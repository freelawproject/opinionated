The BIA\u2019s order affirmed an Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of Singh\u2019s requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture relief. We grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-21\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b416-22\">In support of his applications for relief from removal, Singh testified he is a baptized Sikh from the Punjab who was persecuted for his involvement in the Akali Dal Mann political party. He described his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>political activities and two incidents when he was arrested and tortured by police. He asserts his family\u2019s home was raided and his father was warned that if Singh did not turn himself over to authorities, the police would kill Singh in a \u201cfake encounter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The IJ determined Singh\u2019s \u201ctestimony was for the most part consistent\u201d but nonetheless \u201cimplausible\u201d for several reasons. Our task is to \u201caddress each reason in turn\u201d to determine whether \u201cseparately or in combination\u201d such explanations are \u201cspecific and cogent\u201d and \u201csupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 885 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted). Applying these standards, we conclude the IJ erred by rejecting Singh\u2019s testimony as implausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">First, the IJ questioned why Singh waited until 1998 to become politically involved, \u201cwell after most of the violence in the Punjab had subsided.\u201d Singh explained at length, however, why he waited. He stated he elected to concentrate on his education rather than politics and that after college, he returned home to care for his sick father and to work on the family farm. There was no evidence to the contrary and the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is impermissible \u201cspeculation and conjecture.\u201d <em>Ge v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Second, the IJ opined that Singh\u2019s submission of documents verifying his political activities in India \u201cstrains credulity\u201d because Singh testified his father sent the documents unsolicited. Given the father\u2019s prior involvement (arranging for Singh\u2019s release twice from jail by paying bribes), however, it is not unreasonable that he might again attempt to aid his son by forwarding documents supporting Singh\u2019s claim of political persecution. Moreover, whether Singh requested the documents or his father sent them unsolicited is not directly relevant to Singh\u2019s request for asylum. <em>See Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir.2004) (noting IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding \u201ccannot be peripheral, but rather must go to the heart of petitioner\u2019s claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Third, the IJ noted Singh used falsified documents to leave India and reasoned that \u201c[i]f the alien would commit fraud in order to get to the United States, ... he [would] commit fraud in order to stay here.\u201d We have previously rejected that reasoning as a basis for an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Kaur, </em>379 F.3d at 889 (\u201c[T]he fact that an asylum seeker has lied to immigration officers or used false passports to enter this or another country ... is not a proper basis for finding her not credible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Finally, the IJ cited a report by the United States Government indicating \u201cthere is considerable fraud\u201d by Sikh applicants for asylum and withholding of removal. While an IJ may consider such a report \u201cin evaluating a petitioner\u2019s credibility,\u201d it may not be used \u201cto discredit specific testimony regarding [petitioner\u2019s] individual experiences.\u201d <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 993, 997 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted). Rather, the IJ must make an \u201cindividualized analysis of an applicant\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1069 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">We conclude the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings, individually and collectively, are not specific and cogent or supported by substantial evidence. Rather, they are based on impermissible speculation and conjecture or are not material or relevant to Singh\u2019s claim. <em>See Kaur, </em>379 F.3d at 884. Without these adverse credibility determinations, Singh established that he suffered persecution and is therefore presumptively eligibility for relief. <em>See Singh </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 1164, 1170 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting if petitioner \u201cwas actually subjected to beatings and torture, ... he is presumptively eligible for asylum and an exercise of discretion by the Attorney General\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The IJ also rejected Singh\u2019s claims because there was no corroborating evidence. The IJ reasoned that corroborating evidence is necessary when an applicant \u201ctells a story which although consistent is implausible.\u201d According to the IJ, Singh should have submitted declarations from \u201cindividuals who have direct knowledge of [Singh\u2019s] predicament in India.\u201d We disagree. First, Singh had no notice of the IJ\u2019s demand for corroborating evidence. <em>See Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1091 (9th Cir.2000) (noting petitioner must be given the opportunity at the hearing to explain why corroborating materials are not available). Second, \u201cthe type of corroboration that the IJ thought necessary \u2014 affidavits or letters from friends and neighbors in India \u2014 was inappropriate\u201d because they are \u201calmost never easily available.\u201d <em>Kaur, </em>379 F.3d at 890. Finally, because we reject the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, Singh\u2019s testimony is deemed credible and no corroborating evidence is required. <em>See Shire v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 1288, 1298 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Remand is required. <em>See Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194, 1203-04 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cWhere an appellate court has held that an ... adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence ... the proper procedure is to remand the case to the BIA for further consideration and investigation in light of the ruling that the petitioner is credible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Petition for review GRANTED; REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b416-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
