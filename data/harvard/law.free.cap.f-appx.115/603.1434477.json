In civil actions in which the United States is a party, parties are accorded sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to file a notice of appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Panhorst v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 367, 369-70 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-26\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing Thomas\u2019 motion was entered on March 7, 2003. Thomas filed his notice of appeal in this court on June 2, 2003. In it, Thomas stated that the district court did not send him its order disposing of his motion until May 14, 2003. We liberally construe Thomas\u2019 notice of appeal as a motion <em>to </em>extend the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). We remand this case for the district court to determine whether Thomas has shown excusable neglect or good cause to warrant an extension. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
