We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the denial of asylum, and will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision that Camacho did not establish that the guerrilla\u2019s threats or attempted recruitment of him were on account of an enumerated ground. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150-51 (9th Cir.2000). Additionally, the IJ properly relied upon a State Department Country Report to determine that conditions in Guatemala have changed such that Camacho\u2019s fear of future persecution is not objectively reasonable. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 1000 (9th Cir.2003). Because Camacho failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), Camacho\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, as of the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issue of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
