The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED. The Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-20\">Longbine contends that the district court erred by applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 to determine his offense level and, for the first time on appeal, that the four-level adjustment to his offense level for having material depicting sadistic and masochistic images of adults having sex with children violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and constituted plain error. Longbine concedes that his <em>Blakely </em>contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004)(No. 04-5263), but he raises the issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-27\">Longbine\u2019s receipt of child pornography was sufficient to trigger application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2. <em>United States v. Cana</em>da, 110 F.3d 260, 264 (5th Cir.1997). Longbine\u2019s argument that his guideline adjustment violated <em>Blakely </em>is foreclosed by <em>Pineiro, </em>in which this court held that <em>\u201cBlakely </em>does not extend to the federal Guidelines.\u201d <em>Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d at 465-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-28\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
