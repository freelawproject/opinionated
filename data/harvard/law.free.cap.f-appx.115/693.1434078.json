We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Haikl filed suit against his employer, Philips Semiconductor of America (\u201cPhilips\u201d), alleging discrimination based on his national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.); </em>age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination and Employment Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 <em>et seq.); </em>and that he was subjected to retaliation for reporting the alleged harassment and discrimination. Philips filed a summary judgment motion seeking to dismiss all of Haikl\u2019s claims after he failed to comply with the district court\u2019s order compelling his participation. The district court entered an Order and Advisory explaining the summary judgment procedures, obligation to respond, and granting an extension of time for Haikl to submit his response. On December 30, 2003 after Haikl failed to file a response, the district court dismissed his case with prejudice. Haikl filed a pro se motion for reconsideration, which the district court properly treated as a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. <em>In re Stangel, </em>68 F.3d 857, 859 (5th Cir.1995). The district court denied Haikl\u2019s motion, after again considering the merits of Haikl\u2019s claims, on May 7, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Haikl failed to file his appeal of the district court\u2019s order dismissing his discrimination claims within thirty days. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a). The filing of a Rule 60(b) motion, as Haikl did within 30 days of the district court\u2019s dismissal, does not toll the running of the time for taking an appeal. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 401, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Therefore, Haikl can only appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The district court\u2019s refusal to allow reconsideration of a final judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) will be reversed only if the district court abused its discretion. <em>See Edward H. Bohlin Co., Inc. v. Banning, </em>6 F.3d 350 357 (5th Cir.1993). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Haikl\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment as the record shows Haikl\u2019s continued disregard and failure to comply with the discovery process and court orders that resulted in the dismissal of the case and therefore there is no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
