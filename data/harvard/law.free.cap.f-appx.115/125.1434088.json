We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision, designated by the Board as the final agency determination, and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Kyalla failed to sustain her burden of showing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c\u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812). The evidence does not compel such a result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">In addition, we uphold the denial of Kyalla\u2019s application for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Finally, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Kyalla did not establish it was more likely than not that she would be tortured \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1) (2004). Therefore, she has not established her entitlement to relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">We therefore deny Kyalla\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
