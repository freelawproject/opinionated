To obtain a COA, an applicant must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This requires the applicant to demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Rodriguez-Montes argues that counsel was ineffective at sentencing in failing to seek a two-level \u201csafety-valve\u201d reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The safety-valve provision is an exception to the general rule under the sentencing guidelines that, if the statutory minimum sentence is greater than the maximum guideline range, the statutory minimum sentence must be the guideline sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). The safety valve provides that, for convictions of certain drug offenses, the \u201ccourt shall impose a sentence in accordance with the applicable guidelines without regard to any statutory minimum sentence\u201d if the defendant meets certain requirements. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l)-(5); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>60 F.3d 193, 194-95 (5th Cir.1995). The first of these criteria is not having more than one criminal history point. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The record reflects that RodriguezMontes\u2019s 1990 guilty-plea conviction for theft of property was incorrectly assessed one criminal history point under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e). Rodriguez-Montes did not serve any period of imprisonment, and the sentence was imposed more than 10 years prior to the commencement of the instant offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, comment. (n.3); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). As Rodriguez-Montes had only one criminal history point and apparently otherwise qualified for the safety-valve reduction, Rodriguez has shown that counsel was ineffective for failing to move for such a reduction. Accordingly, Rodriguez-Montes has shown that reasonable jurists would dispute the correctness of the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. We GRANT COA, VACATE the judgment of the district court, and REMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">COA GRANTED; JUDGMENT VACATED AND CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
