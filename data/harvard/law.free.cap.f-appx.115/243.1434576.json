Adams\u2019s complaint alleged that prison officials caused him to miss a filing deadline for a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. The district court took judicial notice that the Supreme Court had considered and denied the petition for writ of certiorari that Adams alleged was untimely due to the defendants\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The district court certified that, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3), Adams\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. In the instant motion, Adams makes no reference to the district court\u2019s certification decision or the reasons for the dismissal. Thus, Adams has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal or that the district court erred in certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Adams\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Adams\u2019s civil rights complaint counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous also counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Adams is WARNED that, if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
