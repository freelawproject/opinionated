The district court dismissed, as frivolous, Ganesan\u2019s claims against Warden Michael Upshaw (Upshaw) and Janie Cockrell (Cockrell) and certain claims against Shirley James (James), after finding that Ganesan had not demonstrated the denial of a constitutional right. The district court also found that Ganesan made misrepresentations calculated to mislead the court and issued an order to show cause why he should not be sanctioned. After Ganesan failed to respond to the show cause order, the district court dismissed the remainder of Ganesaris claims, issued a monetary sanction of $100, and barred Ganesan from making any subsequent filings until the sanction was satisfied or judicial approval was previously obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-18\">On appeal, Ganesan does not provide any legal arguments or authority challenging the district court\u2019s determinations that Ganesan has not demonstrated the denial of a constitutional right as to Upshaw and Cockrell and that sanctions were appropriate because Ganesan made misrepresentations to the court. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Ganesan fails to address the district court\u2019s factual basis for dismissing these claims as frivolous and issuing sanctions, he has abandoned these issues. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The claims Ganesan has not abandoned are his claims that, on April 25, 2002, James was verbally abusive, that, on April 25, 2002, James threatened Ganesan\u2019s physical safety, and that, after April 25, 2002, and in retaliation for a previously filed lawsuit, James denied Ganesan access to the courts. As for Ganesan\u2019s claim of verbal abuse, mere allegations of verbal abuse do not present an actionable \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Bender v. Brumley, </em>1 F.3d 271, 274 n. 4 (5th Cir.1993). As for Ganesan\u2019s claim that James threatened his physical safety, a review of record reveals a lack of facts to support this allegation, and the district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">As for Ganesan\u2019s claim that James retaliated against him and denied him access to the courts by James\u2019 refusal to deliver Ganesan\u2019s mail to him and James\u2019 denial of a protective escort for Ganesan to the mailroom to pick up his mail, Ganesan must show that he has been denied a specific constitutional right. <em>See Tighe v. Wall, </em>100 F.3d 41, 43 (5th Cir.1996). A review of the record reveals that Ganesan refused to pick up his mail from the mail-room. There is no evidence that the mail-room failed to inform Ganesan that he had mail in the mailroom or that the mailroom refused to give Ganesan his mail when he came to the mailroom. Therefore, because Ganesan did not make the necessary showing of a violation of a constitutional right, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing, as frivolous, Ganesan\u2019s claims. <em>See Arnaud v. Odom, </em>870 F.2d 304, 307 (5th Cir.1989) (Mere \u201cconclusory allegations\u201d are not sufficient to establish a \u00a7 1983 claim.).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Ganesan\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s affirmance count as one \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Ganesan is cautioned that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes,\u201d he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">AFFIRMED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b705-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
