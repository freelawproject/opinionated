Burrell, </em>289 F.3d 220 (2d Cir.2002) <em>(\u201cBurrell </em>I\u201d). Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In the summary order accompanying <em>Burrell I, </em>43 Fed. Appx. 403 (2d Cir.2002), this court relied on <em>United States v. Lovell, </em>16 F.3d 494 (2d Cir.1994) to rule that an earlier conviction is \u201cprior\u201d within the meaning of the guidelines, notwithstanding that that conviction may be part of the underlying conduct upon which the current conviction for conspiracy was based. Burrell now contends that the district court erred on remand by not re-considering the issue under <em>United States v. Martino, </em>294 F.3d 346 (2d Cir.2002), which was handed down in the interval. Because Burrell failed to raise this argument before the district court, our standard of review on appeal is for plain error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Crowley, </em>318 F.3d 401, 414-15 (2d Cir.2003). The district court\u2019s decision must then have been a \u201cclear or obvious deviation from current law that affected the outcome\u201d of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Law of the case is \u201ca discretionary doctrine which does not constitute a limitation on the court\u2019s power but merely expresses the general practice of refusing to reopen what has been decided.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>205 F.3d 23, 34 (2d Cir.2000) <em>quoting United States v. Martinez, </em>987 F.2d 920, 923 (2d Cir.1993). We see no need to revisit the question. In any event, regardless of whether they are evaluated under the law in this circuit as stated in <em>Martino </em>or as stated in <em>Lovell, </em>the district court properly included Burrell\u2019s convictions as \u201cprior\u201d in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">Next, Burrell challenges the attribution of approximately 30 kilograms of cocaine base sold by the organization for the purpose of establishing his base offense level. In evaluating relevant conduct for a drug conspiracy, \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts ... of others in furtherance of the conspiracy may be taken into account to determine a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Molina, </em>106 F.3d 1118, 1121 (2d Cir.1997). The district court \u201cmust make two particularized findings.\u201d <em>United States v. Mulder, </em>273 F.3d 91, 118 (2d Cir.2001). These two findings are: (1) \u201cthe scope of the criminal activity agreed upon by the defendant,\u201d <em>United States v. Studley, </em>47 F.3d 569, 574 (2d Cir.1995); and (2) \u201cwhether the activity was foreseeable to the defendant,\u201d <em>id.; see also Mulder, </em>273 F.3d at 118. Here, in order for a different base offense to apply, the court would have had to have found no more than 1.5 kilograms attributable to Burrell. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. 2D1.1. Though the district court did not make the required particularized findings as to the scope of the agreement and the foreseeability of the conduct, \u201cwhen a defendant asserts that he is not responsible for the entire range of misconduct attributable to the conspiracy of which he was a member, the Guidelines place on him the burden of establishing the lack of knowledge and the lack of foresee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ability.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Rios, </em>143 F.3d 662, 677 (2d Cir.1998). Burrell made no such effort. On this record, it is impossible to see how he could have done so to the extent needed to affect his sentence. The district court\u2019s determination of Burrell\u2019s base offense level was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Burrell also argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Specifically, Burrell argues that it was unconstitutional for the district court to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, (1) that he had committed the crime after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense had become final, (2) that he had possessed a firearm during the conspiracy, and (3) that the amount of drugs attributable to him was 30.34 kilograms of crack cocaine. This Court has held, however, that we will not apply <em>Blakely </em>to the Federal Guidelines unless and until the Supreme Court rules that we must. <em>See United States v. Mincey, </em>380 F.3d 102 (2d Cir.2004). We therefore reject Burrell\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claims at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">The mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 11, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004), and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 12, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004). Should any party believe there is a need for the district court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court will not reconsider those portions of its opinion [or order] that address the defendant\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until fourteen days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
