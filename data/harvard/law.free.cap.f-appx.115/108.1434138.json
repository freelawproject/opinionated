Kahn, <em>Judge) </em>dismissing Gilmore\u2019s claims against all defendantsappellees. On appeal, Gilmore argues that (1) various defendants-appellees unconstitutionally deprived him of a liberty interest afforded by the New York parole statute; (2) application of a parole statute enacted subsequent to his conviction violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution; (3) various defendants-appellees deprived him of his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by failing to provide parole officials with a mental health report; (4) the district court improperly dismissed his retaliation claim against defendant-appellee Sikora without permitting Gilmore to amend his complaint and conduct further discovery; and (5) the district court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>improperly dismissed his claims against nine of the defendants-appellees for failure to serve process, without first giving adequate notice to Gilmore. Familiarity with the facts and proceedings below is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">As we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s decision, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
