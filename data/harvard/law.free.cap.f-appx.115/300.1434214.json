By moving for IFP, Mathews is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted because the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Mathews\u2019s IFP \u201cmotion must be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-19\">Mathews has briefed the merits of his civil rights claims only. Although this court liberally construes <em>pro se </em>briefs, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), the court requires arguments to be briefed in order to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Mathews does not provide any analysis of the reasons for the district court\u2019s certification decision, he has abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-20\">Mathews has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issues. Mathews\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-21\">The dismissal of this appeal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Mathews that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-22\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
