For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Because we write only for the parties, it is not necessary to recite the facts or procedural history of this case except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">NE first contends that the district court erred in not requiring plaintiff to offer expert testimony as to both the scope of NE\u2019s alleged duty to properly instruct truck drivers and the relevant standard of care in the highway construction and trucking industry. NE rests its argument in large part upon <em>Young v. Pennsylvania Dept. of Trans., </em>560 Pa. 373, 744 A.2d 1276 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">The issue in <em>Young </em>was \u201cwhether expert testimony is necessary to ascertain if warning signs should be placed three miles away from a construction site on an interstate highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1277. The case involved a car accident in which plaintiffs husband was killed when he struck a median while attempting to avoid stopped traffic. <em>Id. </em>There, plaintiff contended that PENNDOT was negligent for failing to properly place advance warning signs, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1279. In doing so, the court first reviewed the standards for expert testimony under Pennsylvania law stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-15\">Expert testimony is often employed to help jurors understand issues and evidence which is outside of the average juror\u2019s normal realm of experience. We have stated that, \u201c[t]he employment of testimony of an expert rises from necessity, a necessity born of the fact that the subject matter of the inquiry is one involving special skill and training beyond the ken of the ordinary layman.\u201d <em>Reardon v. Meehan, </em>424 Pa. 460, 227 A.2d 667, 670 (1967). Conversely, \u201c[I]f all the primary facts can be accurately described to a jury and if the jury is as capable of comprehending and understanding such facts and drawing correct conclusions from them as are witnesses possessed of special training, experience or observation, then there is no need for the testimony of an expert.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 1278. The court stated that \u201clay witnesses are [not] able to impart sufficient knowledge to jurors regarding the many variables which are required to establish the existence of a legal duty to place signs over three miles away from a construction zone.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">However, <em>Young </em>provides little support for NE\u2019s position here. In <em>Young, </em>the lay witnesses who were not competent to testify about the Commonwealth\u2019s legal duty were the other drivers in the traffic jam. Here, the evidence included testimony from experienced truck drivers, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>struction site managers and other professionals in the construction field. The jury [was as] ... capable of comprehending and understanding [that testimony] and drawing correct conclusions from [it].... [Thus,] there [was] no need for the testimony of an expert.\u201d NE was, after all, hiring independent truckers to haul material away from its construction site to be \u201cdumped\u201d elsewhere. Jurors could certainly understand the need for the truckers to know where they were going and how to get there without relying on an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">NE next argues that the traffic pattern in the construction zone was not confusing and that it did not cause Sunder-land to stop in a live lane. In asserting this claim, NE merely reargues the evidence that was before the jury. In fact, at oral argument, NE\u2019s counsel asked us to find that, \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d the roadway was clean and clear enough to avoid any confusion. However, at trial, both sides presented evidence regarding the traffic pattern at the construction site. Based on our review of the record we believe there was sufficient evidence to establish that roadway confusion was negligently created by NE, and that it was a contributing factor in the accident. Thus, having found sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict on these grounds, we cannot rule as a matter of law that NE was entitled to a verdict in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">NE also asks us to find that the district court erred in admitting a Gannett Fleming, Inc. (\u201cGFI\u201d) memo, which potentially supported plaintiffs theory that, on the night of the accident, NE should have restricted the eastbound lane of the turnpike to one lane. Specifically, the GFI memo stated that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission \u201cdirected that the single lane pattern be extended <em>full length </em>through the approaches of Bridge B-445.\u201d (emphasis in original). NE contends that, because the GFI memo lacked a proper foundation, the district court erred in admitting the memo as a business record. NE argues that the critical statement in the memo was inadmissible because it was offered to establish the truth of the Commission\u2019s alleged requirement extending the lane closure. NE also contends that \u201cthe business record exception does not embrace statements contained within a business record that were made by one who is <em>not </em>a part of the business if the embraced statements are offered for their truth.\u201d <em>United States v. Vigneau, </em>187 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.1999) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Although we agree that the disputed statement in the memo was improperly admitted, we conclude that the error was harmless because other evidence negated the impact of this memo. That testimony included evidence that, following GFI\u2019s submission of the memo to NE, and prior to finalizing the plans for the construction site, GFI met with the Commission and \u201c[a]greement was reached that the lane would be closed only when NE simultaneously conducted bridge and pavement repair work ... [and] when simultaneous work was not ongoing, the lane should remain open.\u201d The subsequent agreement negated the memo\u2019s critical statement. The jury also heard evidence that the \u201capproaches\u201d mentioned in the memo \u201cwould be those approaches that lead up to the bridge.\u201d The accident happened about 700 feet beyond the bridge. Therefore, the disputed statement in the memo did not even pertain to the accident area.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">NE next contends that it should be \u201creleased ... from liability\u201d because Sunder-land\u2019s \u201cunforeseeable,\u201d \u201chighly extraordinary\u201d and \u201cabnormal\u201d conduct in stopping his truck in a live lane of traffic, along with the speed at which Ravotti was traveling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>prior to the accident, \u201cwere the only substantial factors causing the accident.\u201d However, NE\u2019s argument is against the weight of Pennsylvania authority. <em>See Powell v. Drumheller, </em>539 Pa. 484, 493, 653 A.2d 619, 623 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The plaintiff in <em>Powell, </em>alleged that \u201cthe accident [in which her husband was killed] was caused by two concurring causes: (1) the negligent driving of [co-defendant] under the influence of alcohol and (2) the negligent design and maintenance of the Commonwealth highway which prevented Mr. Powell from taking action to avoid the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 653 A.2d 619. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had to decide \u201cwhether the criminally negligent conduct of [a] co-defendant ... in driving under the influence of alcohol is a superceding cause relieving PENNDOT of liability for negligently designing a Commonwealth highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 653 A.2d 619. The court concluded that was a jury question and would not \u201cas a matter of law [conclude] that [co-defendant\u2019s] conviction for driving under the influence was a superceding cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 653 A.2d 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Similarly, the parties here presented various theories of causation and, as in <em>Powell, </em>the district court correctly allowed the jury to assess fault and to decide if the behavior of Sunderland or Ravotti was sufficiently \u201cextraordinary to constitute a superseding cause.\u201d We cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that the jury\u2019s determination was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">NE next maintains that the district court abused its discretion in allowing testimony regarding Exhibit 73. Exhibit 73 is a document created by NE\u2019s risk manager, William Carr, during his investigation of the accident. It contains a specific notation by Carr of an employee\u2019s comment that the speed limit at the time of the accident was 55 mph. While questioning Carr on rebuttal about his purpose in preparing Exhibit 73, plaintiff asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">All of these people that you spoke with to get this information in order to discharge your duties as a risk manager, as well as your contractual obligations that you say that you owed to the insurance company, you spoke to [NE] employees, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">SuppApp. At 955. Additionally, in earlier testimony, plaintiff had cross-examined defense expert Walter Kilareski, and asked him if he had been given Exhibit 73 during or after preparation of his expert report. Kilareski responded that he had not seen the report before. In his report, Kilareski concluded that the speed limit was 40 mph. According to NE, Exhibit 73 was irrelevant, its introduction prejudiced NE because plaintiff used it to elicit information about insurance, and plaintiff improperly used it to portray NE as an evildoer that withheld important documents from its expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">We disagree with each of these contentions. First, as plaintiff points out, Exhibit 73 was relevant because NE and Sunderland \u201cdefended this case by claiming that Ravotti was guilty of contributory negligence for, <em>inter alia, </em>driving in excess of an alleged 40 mph speed limit at the accident scene ... [and] Ravotti attempted to meet Defendants\u2019 arguments concerning Ravotti\u2019s speed by showing that, for various reasons, one could have easily been confused as to the speed.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 20-1. Second, the introduction of Exhibit 73 was consistent with Fed.R.Evid. 411, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Although plaintiff did not offer Exhibit 78 specifically to show \u201cproof of agency, ownership, or control or bias or prejudice of a witness,\u201d under <em>Posttape Assoc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>537 F.2d 751, 758 (3d Cir.1976), so long as \u201cthe evidence is offered for other relevant purposes [i.e. other than the inference that a party acted negligently], it may be admitted.\u201d Exhibit 73 was relevant to the issue of the speed limit and the passing reference to \u201cthe insurance company\u201d did nothing more than explain why the witness was asking NE\u2019s employees questions about the accident. The questioning also served the permissible purpose of challenging the accuracy of Kilareski\u2019s expert report.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Finally, NE argues that the district court abused its discretion in instructing the jury regarding 67 Pa.Code \u00a7 601.6 [prohibiting non-emergency stops in specific sections of Turnpike] and 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3362 [posting of speed limits]. However, even if we assume that the court\u2019s instruction was erroneous, we would nevertheless view the error as harmless. There was sufficient evidence at trial, unrelated to these traffic laws, to allow the jury to assess the parties\u2019 conflicting positions concerning the speed limit and to support the jury\u2019s apportionment of fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
