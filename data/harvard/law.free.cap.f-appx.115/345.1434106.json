We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-21\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Sargsyan failed to carry her burden of demonstrating either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on her Pentecostal religion or imputed political opinion. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003). The incidents Sargsyan described, although credible, did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Sargsyan failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-22\">Because Sargsyan failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960-61 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-23\">Sargsyan is also not entitled <em>to </em>CAT relief because she did not demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if returned to Armenia. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>See Malhi v.
