He argues that his criminal defense attorney conspired with the trial judge to deprive him of his right to appeal his escape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-27\">Switzer\u2019s appeal from the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition is currently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>pending before this court. He was granted a certificate of appealability on the issue whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failing to file a direct appeal. <em>See Switzer v. Mississippi, </em>No. 04-60104 (5th Cir. July 1, 2004) (unpublished). Given that Switzer\u2019s civil claims imply the invalidity of his escape conviction and, further, that he has not shown his conviction to have been reversed or otherwise declared invalid, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on the alternative basis that Switzer\u2019s claims are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 283 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Bickford v. Int\u2019l Speedway Corp., </em>654 F.2d 1028, 1031 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Switzer that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger or serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b785-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
