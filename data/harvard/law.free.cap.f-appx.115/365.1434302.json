Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 808, 811 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1064-65 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld if \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an alien seeks to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination, \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. at 817; <em>see also Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">While credibility determinations are judged by the same deferential substantial evidence standard, <em>see Kebede, </em>366 F.3d at 810-11; <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Cordon-Garcia, </em>204 F.3d at 990; <em>de Leon-Barrios v.

By pointing to a discrepancy that went to the heart of Hakhverdian\u2019s claims, the Immigration Judge provided a specific, cogent reason that was supported by substantial evidence of and had a legitimate nexus to the determination that Hakhverdian was not credible. <em>See Gui, </em>280 F.3d at 1225; <em>de Leon-Barrios, </em>116 F.3d at 393-94. A reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to find the contrary or to conclude that she had suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution, as required to sustain her asylum or withholding claims. <em>See Fisher, </em>79 F.3d at 961-62; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>Prasad v.

Hakhverdian attempts now to raise a claim pursuant to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, G.A. Res. 39/46, U.N.

This court does not have jurisdiction to consider this claim because Hakhverdian did not raise this issue before the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Rojas-Garcia v.
