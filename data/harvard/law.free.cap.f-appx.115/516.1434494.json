NBC, </em>35 F.3d 45 (2d Cir.1994); 2d Cir. R. 0.14(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Plaintiff-Appellant G. Alexander Boxill (\u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals from the judgment by the District Court (David G. Trager, Judge) dated September 20, 2001 that granted Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Appellant\u2019s Title VII and Rehabilitation Act claims. Appellant has raised only his Title VII claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">For the reasons stated by the District Court, Appellant\u2019s Title VII claim was properly time-barred and did not fall within the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d exception. Under Title VII, each discrete act of discrimination \u201cconstitutes a separate actionable \u2018unlawful employment practice,\u2019 \u201d and a plaintiff \u201ccan only file a charge to cover discrete acts that \u2018occurred\u2019 within the appropriate time period.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>586 U.S. 101, 114, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002); <em>accord Patterson v. County of Oneida, </em>375 F.3d 206, 220 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201c[Title VII] \u2018precludes recovery for discrete acts of discrimination or retaliation that occur outside the statutory time period,\u2019 even if other acts of discrimination occurred within the statutory time period.\u201d) <em>(quoting Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>536 U.S. at 105, 122 S.Ct. 2061). Under the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine, however, \u201c \u2018if a plaintiff has experienced a continuous practice and policy of discrimination, ... the commencement of the statute of limitations period may be delayed until the last discriminatory act in furtherance of it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington v. County of Rockland, </em>373 F.3d 310, 317-18 (2d Cir.2004) <em>(quoting Fitzgerald v. Henderson, </em>251 F.3d 345, 359 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted)); <em>see also Elmenayer v. ABF Freight Sys., </em>318 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.2003). In this case, Appellant presents evidence of specific events but provides no evidence of an underlying discriminatory policy or program by Defendants-Appellees. <em>See Lambert v. Genesee Hosp., </em>10 F.3d 46, 53 (2d Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1052, 114 S.Ct. 1612, 128 L.Ed.2d 339 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">To the extent that Appellant\u2019s March 9, 1995 resignation, within 300 days of his October 24, 1995 EEOC filing, might be viewed as a timely discrete claim of discrimination, the possibility need not long detain us, because in any event, we also agree with the District Court\u2019s alternative determination that Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>See Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>239 F.3d 456, 467 (2d Cir.2001) (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s arguments and consider them to be with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>out merit. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
