Koontz argues that under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court should have assigned the burden of proof regarding a reduction for acceptance of responsibility to the Government, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). He thus contends that the district court erred in not giving him an additional one-level decrease in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) for acceptance of responsibility. He argues that this court should reverse his sentences and remand his case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">Koontz does not specifically argue that the district court erred in finding that he was not eligible for the additional one-level decrease to his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). Rather, his entire argument relates to who bears the burden of proof for a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) in the wake of <em>Blakely. </em>Koontz\u2019s reliance on <em>Blakely </em>is misplaced because this court held in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Accordingly, Koontz\u2019s argument has no merit and his sentence is AFFIRMED. Koontz\u2019s motion to substitute counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b789-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
