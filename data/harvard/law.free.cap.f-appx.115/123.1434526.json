The record reveals, however, that the immigration judge denied asylum relief on the grounds that (1) Mussotte failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his application within one year of the date of his arrival in the United States, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000), and (2) Mussotte failed to allege any \u201cchanged\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances that would excuse his late filing, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) (2000). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (holding that section 1158(a)(3) precludes court from reviewing immigration judge\u2019s finding that a petition for asylum is barred because untimely) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Mussotte\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Mussotte\u2019s asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of his request for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that Mussotte has failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Finally, Mussotte contends that the Board\u2019s decision to adopt and affirm the immigration judge\u2019s decision violated his right to due process of law. Mussotte, however, fails to establish either that he was prejudiced by the Board\u2019s decision to adopt the reasoning of the immigration judge, <em>see Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 324-25 (holding that to prevail on a procedural due process claim, an alien must \u201cshow that better procedures are likely to have made a difference in the outcome of his hearing\u201d), or that the Board\u2019s summary affirmance was constitutionally deficient, <em>see Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 282-83 (4th Cir.2004) (finding that Board\u2019s affirmance without opinion satisfies due process where immigration judge\u2019s opinion may be meaningfully reviewed). We therefore find that he is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Accordingly, we deny Mussotte\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\"> Mussotte\u2019s brief merely asserts, without supporting argument, that the immigration judge erred in denying him protection under the Convention Against Torture. He has therefore waived appellate review of this claim. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
