Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>SF-1221-01-0529-W-2 (MSPB Sept. 5, 2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-19\">Lopez claims that on May 16, 1986, the agency fired her one week before the expiration of her term as an archaeologist in retaliation for several letters she had written regarding the construction of the new Bureau of Land Management building in Needles, California. The board held that it lacked jurisdiction over this claim because the retaliatory action was taken before the effective date of the Whistleblower Protection Act (\u201cWPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8) (2000). In response, Lopez contends that she was unaware that she had been terminated given that her appointment was slated to expire on May 23, 1986. She maintains that between 1986 and the time discovery was conducted in this case she believed her employment had simply expired. As a result, she argues that her allegation of retaliatory termination was not \u201cpending\u201d before the effective date of the WPA, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.191(b)(2), but rather that her claim came into existence after the effective date of the WPA (i.e., when she learned that she had been terminated).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-20\">Our case law holds that a challenged personnel action must have been taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>subsequent to the effective date of the WPA in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the board. <em>Bosley v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>162 F.3d 665, 667 (Fed.Cir.1998) (\u201cThe WPA, however, applies only to acts of reprisal that occurred after the statute became effective on July 9, 1989.\u201d); <em>Knollenberg v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>953 F.2d 623, 625 (Fed.Cir.1992) (holding that an individual right of action under the WPA is \u201cavailable only when the subject personnel action was taken subsequent to the effective date of the [WPA]\u201d). In <em>Eidmann v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>we held that there was jurisdiction pursuant to the WPA because the agency had not filed its complaint and given notice of that action to the employee until after July 9, 1989. 976 F.2d 1400, 1404 (Fed.Cir.1992). Here, while Lopez might not have fully understood the nature of the agency action, there is no question that it took place prior to the enactment of the WPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">With respect to Lopez\u2019s allegations that the agency did not rehire her in 1997 and 1999 on account of her protected disclosures, the board held that the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have made the same personnel decisions irrespective of Lopez\u2019s disclosures. This factual finding is supported by substantial evidence and, therefore, we affirm it as well. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703 (2000).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-15\">. This decision became final when the full board denied Lopez\u2019s petition for review. <em>Lopez v.
