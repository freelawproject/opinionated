The district court sentenced him to 60 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">For the first time on appeal, Ramirez argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because they do not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As Ramirez concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Ramirez also argues for the first time on appeal that if <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is overruled, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537,159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), renders unconstitutional the district court\u2019s calculation of his sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines based on facts relating to his prior convictions that were neither found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted by him. Ramirez concedes that in addition to the obstacle posed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>his argument regarding the effect of <em>Blakely </em>is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), in which this court held that <em>Blakely </em>does not extend to the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
