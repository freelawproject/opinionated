The district court\u2019s March 2004 summary judgment and April 2004 order denying reconsideration concluded the district court proceedings on this matter, which had commenced in August 2001 when Johnson filed suit in district court against his former employer, Defendant-Appellee Fred\u2019s Stores of Tennessee, Inc. (\u201cFred\u2019s\u201d). In that suit Johnson claimed that he had suffered adverse employment actions, i.e., disparate compensation, termination of employment, and denial of constitutional due process, all alleged to have resulted from his employer\u2019s racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We have carefully reviewed the extensive record on appeal, including the district court\u2019s dispositive rulings and judgments, as well as the appellate briefs of the parties. As a result, we are satisfied that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing Johnson\u2019s action with prejudice and its order denying rehearing are correct, largely for the reasons given by the court in its Memorandum Ruling of March 14, 2004 and its Order of April 22, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Even accepting, as did the district court and Fred\u2019s, that Johnson made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in Fred\u2019s termination of his employment, Johnson\u2019s extensive filings and the summary judgment evidence that he submitted both before and after the district court denied Fred\u2019s original motion for summary judgment, viewed in the light most favorable to Johnson, fails to demonstrate that Fred\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for firing Johnson are pretext. As this is painstakingly set forth and fully analyzed in the district court\u2019s Memorandum Ruling, we need not rehash it in detail. It suffices that Johnson\u2019s subjective beliefs and unsupported conclusional assertions fail to satisfy his burden of demonstrating pretext or even establishing the existence of a genuine dispute of material facts regarding pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">As for Johnson\u2019s claim that he was paid substantially less than similarly situated white store managers, we conclude that he failed even to make a prima facie case of actionably disparate compensation, whether race based or objectively analyzed. The undisputed summary judgment evidence establishes no significant disparity between Johnson\u2019s compensation and that of white managers situated essentially identically to him; and Johnson has again failed to demonstrate the existence of any genuine disputes of material fact regarding this claim. On the contrary, his evidence demonstrates that Fred\u2019s takes into account numerous factors when determining compensation for managers of differently located and differently situated stores, and that greater compensation paid to other managers \u2014 both black and white \u2014 is legitimately explained by Fred\u2019s on a non-racial basis, free of any probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>evidence of racial discrimination or animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Finally, Johnson\u2019s effort to advance a constitutional claim of a due process violation under \u00a7 1983 widely misses the mark. An employee in the private sector cannot make out a due process violation against an employer in the private sector in the absence of evidence that the employer\u2019s acts are somehow attributable to government. Johnson has not \u2014 because he cannot \u2014 present any evidence of nexus between the aets of his former employer and any governmental unit or agency \u2014 federal, state, or local.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In conclusion, we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing Johnson\u2019s action with prejudice for essentially the same reasons set forth in that court\u2019s Memorandum Ruling, and we affirm its order denying Johnson\u2019s motion for reconsideration, also for the reasons set forth in its Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">AFFIRMED.'</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
