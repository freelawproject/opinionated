First, she claims that the indictment is multiplicitous in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Multiplicity arises where the same crime is charged in separate counts. <em>United States v. Ansaldi </em>372 F.3d 118, 124 (2d Cir.2004). Danson argues that giving a false statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and committing perjury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 are not separate offenses. She asserts that, as a result, the indictment was multiplicitous because it charged her under both statutes for each false statement. Danson forfeited this claim, however, by not raising it in the district court. Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 12(b)(3), (e); <em>see also Aparicio v. Artuz, </em>269 F.3d 78, 96 (2d Cir.2001). Danson\u2019s argument that her reference to the Double Jeopardy Clause during trial preserves all arguments under that clause on appeal is without merit. To avoid forfeiture of a claim, an appellant must raise that claim, not merely the constitutional clause under which it arises, in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Although Danson forfeited the multiplicity claim by not raising it below, this Court may, at its discretion, review the claim for plain error. Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 52(b); <em>see also Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997); <em>United States v. Gore, </em>154 F.3d 34, 41 (2d Cir.1998). The Supreme Court has made clear that the circuit courts should only exercise such discretion if an error \u201c \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 466-67 (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (alteration in original)). The district court sentenced Danson to time already served in INS detention on each of the four false statements and four perjury charges, to run concurrently. Because erroneous multiplicity, if any, in the indictment did not affect Danson\u2019s term of imprisonment, any error did not seriously affect the fairness of the proceedings below. We therefore do not exercise our discretion to review the forfeited claim. <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 466-67. Danson\u2019s first argument on appeal is therefore unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Second, Danson asserts that her criminal trial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because it exposed her to deportation after the Government had failed to exclude her through immigration proceedings. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) provides for the deportation of \u201c[a]ny alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, ... sought to procure or has procured ... admission into the United States.\u201d Danson\u2019s conviction in this case therefore provides a basis for her exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Danson\u2019s claim that her conviction violates the Double Jeopardy Clause raises a question of law and is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Leyland, </em>277 F.3d 628, 631 (2d Cir.2002). The Double Jeopardy Clause guards against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense. <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 98-99, 118 S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997); <em>SEC v. Palmisano, </em>135 F.3d 860, 864 (2d Cir.1998). Whether a sanction is a criminal punishment is a question of statutory interpretation. <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 99; <em>Palmisano, </em>135 F.3d at 864. It is settled law that deportation is a civil proceeding and is not considered a criminal punishment, regardless of its harsh consequences. <em>See Oliver v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, INS, </em>517 F.2d 426, 428 (2d Cir.1975). Danson\u2019s second double jeopardy claim therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The Court heard oral argument in this case on the morning of October 18, 2004. Apparently, later that same day, Danson\u2019s counsel submitted a motion to stay oral argument and appeal based on the claimed discovery of new evidence alleged to show Danson\u2019s innocence. Any motion based on new evidence regarding Danson\u2019s possible innocence cannot be made to this Court in the first instance. The motion to stay is therefore not properly submitted to this Court and does not affect our review of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
