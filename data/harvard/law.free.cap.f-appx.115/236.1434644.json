He was sentenced to 30 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Lopez contends that the district court erred by characterizing his state felony conviction for possession of marijuana as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. This issue, however, is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 700-06 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Lopez also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) are unconstitutional. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Lopez concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Lopez further argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), should be applied to sentences determined under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. As Lopez concedes, this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-73 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), but he raises it to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
