He first argues that his sentence is invalid pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), this court held that <em>\u201cBlakely </em>does not extend to the federal Guidelines.\u201d Washington acknowledges that his instant argument is foreclosed by <em>Pineiro </em>but urges that we reconsider <em>Pineiro\u2019s </em>holding. A panel of this court cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). Washington\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>argument does not warrant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-26\">Washington also contends that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Because Washington has not shown that the coconspirator testimony produced at trial was incredible as a matter of law, his challenges on grounds of credibility and lack of corroboration fad. <em>See United States v. Gadison, </em>8 F.3d 186, 190 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Greenwood, </em>974 F.2d 1449, 1457 (5th Cir.1992). Moreover, examination of the record shows that a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-27\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
