We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>De Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004). We review purely legal questions de novo. <em>Id. </em>We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Bonilla\u2019s motion to reopen because his application for derivative TPS based on his wife\u2019s TPS is collateral to his removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The BIA is correct in holding that jurisdiction over Bonilla\u2019s derivative TPS registration rests with the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d). Bonilla can appeal the agency\u2019s error in miscategorizing his application and finding him ineligible for direct TPS relief when in fact he had applied for derivative TPS. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 244.10(c) <em>&amp; </em>(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Bonilla\u2019s stay of removal will remain in effect until his TPS appeal is adjudicated. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(a)(l)(A) (providing that the government shall not remove an alien who establishes prima facie eligibility for TPS pending final determination on the TPS application); <em>see also Yao v. INS, </em>2 F.3d 317, 318-19 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that alien\u2019s pending application for legalization of immigration status as a Special Agricultural Worker did not preclude initiation of deportation proceedings or entry of deportation order, but did prohibit execution of the deportation order until final determination on the application).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b399-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
