INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we dismiss Meng\u2019s petition with respect to his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Meng\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, and we will uphold the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Bellout v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 975, 977-79 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">We deny Meng\u2019s petition for review with respect to his claims for withholding of removal and relief under CAT because Meng did not present sufficient evidence to compel a finding that it is more likely than not that he will be subject to persecution or tortured if he returned to China. <em>See Abebe v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 755, 760 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part AND DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
