Hernandez-Gonzalez argues for the first time on appeal that the viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is in doubt given the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He also argues that if <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>were overruled and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), were held to apply to the federal Sentencing Guidelines, Hernandez-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence could not be enhanced by his prior convictions unless those convictions were found beyond a reasonable doubt or Hernandez-Gonzalez admitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-24\">As Hernadez-Gonzalez concedes, <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>see also United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). As Hernandez-Gonzalez also concedes, his <em>Blakely </em>argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
