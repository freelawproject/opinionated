We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Because the BIA summarily affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s decision pursuant to its streamlining regulations, we review the immigration judge\u2019s decision as the final agency decision. <em>Abebe v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 755, 758 (9th Cir.2004). We deny Singh\u2019s petition because the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-22\">An applicant\u2019s submission of false documents going to the heart of his asylum application provides grounds for an adverse credibility finding. <em>See, e.g., Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 955 (9th Cir.1999) (noting that \u201cthe presentation of a fraudulent document in an asylum adjudication for purpose of establishing the elements of an asylum claim\u201d is a proper basis for an adverse credibility finding). In this ease, the immigration judge found that Singh submitted two false affidavits and a fraudulently obtained letter. Accordingly, the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir.2004) (upholding immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>finding because \u201cthere was support for the IJ\u2019s conclusion that several documents may have been fraudulent\u201d where the \u201cgenuineness of these documents [went] to the heart of [petitioner\u2019s] claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">THE PETITION IS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b407-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
