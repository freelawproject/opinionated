Because the transitional rules apply, see <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The evidence that Iqbal offered with his motion to reopen was not specific to his asylum claim, and thus, could not overcome the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) adverse credibility determination. Therefore, Iqbal did not establish a prima facie case of eligibility for relief, and his motion to reopen was properly denied. <em>See Caruncho v. INS, </em>68 F.3d 356, 360-61 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">To the extent Iqbal challenges the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of his asylum application, or the BIA\u2019s denial of his first motion to reopen, those decisions are not before us in this petition for review. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that the Court reviews solely the motion to reopen and not the underlying deportation order on a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen,).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b411-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
