Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12940. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the county on Demus\u2019 Title VII claim. Even assuming Demus established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, <em>see Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.1998), she has not shown that the county\u2019s articulated nondiseriminatory reasons for its adverse employment actions were pretextual. To survive a motion for summary judgment, Demus had to rebut the county\u2019s proffered justifications with either direct or indirect evidence of pretext. <em>See Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, </em>349 F.3d 634, 641-42 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amending Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, </em>307 F.3d 884 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The county\u2019s explanation for its demotion and disciplinary action, validated by the civil service commission\u2019s finding that Demus was incompetent in examining two foster children, counters the presumption of discrimination. <em>Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>26 F.3d 885, 892 (9th Cir.1994). Further, the county has offered a legitimate reason \u2014 reorganization of its adoptions program \u2014 for Demus\u2019 transfer to another unit. Demus has failed to counter the county\u2019s asserted justifications with evidence of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Demus\u2019 \u00a7 1981 claim, because her employment is governed by statute, rather than contract. <em>Miller v. State of California, </em>18 Cal.3d 808, 813, 135 Cal.Rptr. 386, 557 P.2d 970 (Cal.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Demus leave to amend the scheduling order, because she failed to demonstrate good cause. <em>Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 604, 608 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">Finally, Demus\u2019 FEHA claim also cannot survive summary judgment, because she has failed to rebut the county\u2019s nondiscriminatory reasons for its adverse employment actions against her. <em>Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 317, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (Cal.2000) (applying federal framework to state discrimination claim on summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
