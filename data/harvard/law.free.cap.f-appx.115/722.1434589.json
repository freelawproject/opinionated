He contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He argues that he may not be convicted and sentenced under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) because the indictment did not allege that he was deported after a qualifying felony or aggravated felony and that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), dictates that his sentence violates his Sixth Amendment rights. As Espinoza-Cortez concedes, these arguments are foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
