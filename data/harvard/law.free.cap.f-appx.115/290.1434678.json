Davis, Texas state prisoner # 582332, is appealing the magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. Davis argues that the magistrate judge erred in determining that his allegations did not reflect that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference to his safety in making his housing assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-20\">Davis has not addressed the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that Davis failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit or the dismissal of his complaint on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-21\">An appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument on the issues that are raised so that this court may know what action of the district court is being complained of. <em>Al-Ra\u2018id v. Ingle, </em>69 F.3d 28, 31 (5th Cir.1995). Because Davis has briefed no argument with respect to the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that he failed to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit, he has waived any such argument. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). This court need not address the magistrate judge\u2019s alternative basis for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-22\">Davis\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, thus, is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal of the present case and this court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal count as two strikes against Davis for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see, e.g., Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Davis is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
