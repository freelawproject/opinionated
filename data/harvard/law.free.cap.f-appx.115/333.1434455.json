We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition for writ of habeas corpus as untimely, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Beasley contends that a lack of legal materials relating to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) in the law library at the Pleasant Valley State Prison was a state-created impediment to his timely filing of a federal habeas petition. Alternatively, he contends that this lack of legal materials entitles him to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Both claims fail, however, because Beasley established no causal connection between any lack of AEDPA library materials and his failure to timely file a federal habeas petition. <em>See Spitsyn v. Moore, </em>345 F.3d 796, 799 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that equitable tolling is not available unless the petitioner shows that extraordinary circumstances actually caused his untimeliness); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) (stating that the 1-year period of limitation runs from date on which the state-created impediment is removed, \u201cif the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
