Ann.Code, art. 49B, \u00a7 42 (2003). Because the district court erroneously denied as \u201cmoot\u201d Medley\u2019s motion for an extension of the discovery period and otherwise failed to address his motion for discovery in opposition to summary judgment, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">As part of the discovery process, Medley sought certain records of similarly situated Fedex employees, and Fedex objected. Fedex also declined to turn over the documents at a deposition conducted on March 25, 2003. On March 26, 2003, the final day of the discovery period, Medley filed a motion to further extend the discovery period to facilitate the filing of a motion to compel discovery. On April 24, 2003, Fedex filed a motion for summary judgment. On May 15, 2003, with the summary judgment motion still pending, the district court entered a \u201cpaperless order\u201d denying Medley\u2019s motion for additional discovery as \u201cmoot.\u201d Medley then responded to the summary judgment motion and again moved for additional discovery under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(f). On July 15, 2003, the district court filed a memorandum opinion and order awarding summary judgment to Fedex, implicitly denying Medley\u2019s motion under Rule 56(f), and dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">Medley\u2019s motion for extended discovery was not moot at the time it was denied by the district court. Moreover, the district court did not address Medley\u2019s motion under Rule 56(f) in its opinion and order dismissing Medley\u2019s complaint. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court, and we remand for the court to consider Medley\u2019s motion for an extension of discovery and Rule 56(f) motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
