Hargett, </em>341 F.3d 1207, 1215 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>540 U.S. 1091, 124 S.Ct. 960, 157 L.Ed.2d 797 (2003). In these appeals, Petitioner challenges two orders related to that decision. The first is the district court\u2019s order, issued in response to our remand, directing Petitioner\u2019s release or retrial. The second is the district court\u2019s order denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to \u201cexpedite his release\u201d \u2014 a motion that Petitioner filed after we remanded the case to the district court but before the district court ordered Petitioner\u2019s release or retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Before addressing the issues in this appeal, we must clarify the relevant procedural history of this case since the time of our 2003 judgment, for that history plays a key role in our analysis. Eight events are particularly important:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">1. On August 29, 2003, we issued our judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">2. On October 6, 2003, Petitioner filed a motion to expedite his release with the district court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">3. On October 10, 2003, the district court received a certified copy of our August 29 judgment and a copy of our opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">4. On December 10, 2003, in response to our remand, the district court issued an order stating that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s habeas corpus petition is granted, unless the state court retries him within 120 days of this order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\">5. Also on December 10, 2003, the district court overruled Petitioner\u2019s motion to expedite his release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-12\">6. On December 18, 2003, Petitioner gave notice of his intent to appeal the district court\u2019s order granting his habeas petition unless the state court were to retry him within 120 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-13\">7. On or around December 18, 2003, Petitioner gave notice of his intent to appeal the district court\u2019s order overruling his motion to expedite his release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-14\">8. From March 29, 2004 through April 1, 2004, Petitioner was re-tried and re-convicted in Oklahoma state court. According to Petitioner, he was re-sentenced on April 19, 2004.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-15\">On appeal, Petitioner, appearing <em>pro se </em>and <em>informa pauperis,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-16\">1. The delay between our August 29 judgment and the district court\u2019s December 10 order directing Petitioner\u2019s retrial was improper and prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-17\">2. The State of Oklahoma should not have been given 120 days in which to attempt to effect a retrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-18\">3. The 120-day period should have begun on the date of our judgment, rather than on the date of the district court\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-19\">4. He should have been released from custody pending the State of Oklahoma\u2019s decision whether or not to retry him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-20\">5. The retrial violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and the Oklahoma constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-21\">6. The State of Oklahoma failed to retry him within 120 days, since Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>tioner was not re-sentenced until nine days after that period had expired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\">7. For a host of reasons, the proceedings during and surrounding his retrial in Oklahoma state court were constitutionally flawed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In its December 10 orders, the district court did not address whether Petitioner should be granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Consequently, we treat this appeal as though the district court denied Petitioner a COA. To obtain a COA, Petitioner must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). This is accomplished by establishing that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). For the following reasons, Petitioner has failed to make such a showing, and we therefore DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Our analysis of Petitioner\u2019s first claim\u2014 that the delay between our August 29 judgment and the district court\u2019s December 10 order directing Petitioner\u2019s trial was improper and prejudicial \u2014 proceeds in two phases. The first phase focuses on the transmittal of our judgment to the district court; the second, on the district court\u2019s actions after receiving our judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">To the extent that any delay in the district court\u2019s order may have been caused by a delay in transmitting our judgment to the district court, we note that we have acknowledged that delay in the processing or resolution of an appeal may rise to the level of a due process violation. <em>Harris v. Champion, </em>15 F.3d 1538, 1558 (10th Cir.1994) (addressing delays largely attributed to the state public defender\u2019s office). However, the degree of delay in the case at bar \u2014 slightly more than one month, from August 29 until approximately October 10 \u2014 is not on par with those delays that we have found to be constitutionally suspect. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1560 (establishing that \u201ca two-year delay in finally adjudicating a direct criminal appeal ordinarily will give rise to a presumption of inordinate delay\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">To the extent that any delay in the date of the district court\u2019s order may have been caused by the district court itself, we note that delays comparable to and far longer than the approximately two months<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at issue in this case have been deemed acceptable by the Supreme Court and other circuit courts. <em>See, e.g., Garrison v. Hudson, </em>468 U.S. 1301, 1302, 104 S.Ct. 3496, 82 L.Ed.2d 804 (1984) (\u201c[A] 6-week delay of the scheduled retrial would not impose an unreasonable delay on respondent who has remained in confinement under a life sentence\u201d for approximately seven years.); <em>Knox v. Johnson, </em>224 F.3d 470, 475 (5th Cir.2000) (upholding, without directly addressing, a ten- to eleven-month delay at the district court level in a case analogous to the one at bar). We do not go so far as to embrace explicitly the Fifth Circuit\u2019s tolerance for a ten- to eleven-month delay between the date of an appellate judgment and the date of a district court order on remand, but merely hold that the delay in this case was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">With respect to Petitioner\u2019s second claim, it is clear that the district court did not err in granting the State of Oklahoma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>120 days to effect a retrial. Allowing 120 days for a retrial is a common practice. <em>See, e.g., Holloway v. Horn, </em>355 F.3d 707, 730 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 410, 160 L.Ed.2d 352 (2004); <em>Soffar v. Dretke, </em>368 F.3d 441, 480 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Foster v. Lockhart, </em>9 F.3d 722, 727 (8th Cir.1993). Thus, it is clear that the district court\u2019s decision to set such a period does not arise to the level of a \u201cdenial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">With respect to Petitioner\u2019s third claim, there is no reason that the 120-day period should have begun with the issuing of our judgment. Our judgment did not set a 120-day limit, but allowed the district court to determine a reasonable time limit for the State of Oklahoma to retry Petitioner, if the state were to choose to do so. Wansing, 341 F.3d at 1215. The district court order did not explicitly set our judgment as the beginning point for the measurement of the 120-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Petitioner\u2019s fourth claim \u2014 that he should have been released pending the State of Oklahoma\u2019s decision whether or not to retry him \u2014 is utterly without merit. \u201cFederal courts are authorized, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, to dispose of habeas corpus matters \u2018as law and justice require.\u2019 In construing \u00a7 2243 and its predecessors, [the Supreme Court] has repeatedly stated that federal courts may delay the release of a successful habeas petitioner in order to provide the State an opportunity to correct the constitutional violation found by the court.\u201d <em>Hilton v. Braunskill, </em>481 U.S. 770, 775, 107 S.Ct. 2113, 95 L.Ed.2d 724 (1987)</p>\n<p id=\"An\">Petitioner\u2019s fifth and sixth claims are not properly before us.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner appeals, inter alia, from the district court\u2019s December 10 order stating that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s habeas corpus petition is granted, unless the state court retries him within 120 days of this order.\u201d To the extent that Petitioner\u2019s retrial may have raised double jeopardy concerns, those concerns are not implicated by the December 10 order, which merely gave the State of Oklahoma the option of retrying Petitioner if it chose to do so. Jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn, <em>Crist v. Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 29, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978), so double jeopardy concerns are not implicated as a result of the district court\u2019s order merely giving the State of Oklahoma the <em>option </em>of empaneling and swearing a jury. To the extent that Petitioner\u2019s retrial may have raised double jeopardy concerns under the Constitution, or analogous concerns under the constitution or laws of the state of Oklahoma, Petitioner must raise those concerns by first exhausting his state court remedies, then filing a new \u00a7 2254 petition. To the extent that Petitioner\u2019s retrial may have taken place more than 120 days after the district court\u2019s December 10 order, Petitioner should first raise those concerns with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">Like his fifth and sixth claims, Petitioner\u2019s seventh claim also is not properly before us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That claim relates to events that occurred after Petitioner raised this appeal. Therefore, Petitioner must first exhaust his state remedies, then file a new \u00a7 2254 petition, in order to raise this claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Thus, we DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-10\">. Based on our review of Defendant\u2019s financial declarations, we grant his motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\">. This delay lasted from approximately October 10, 2003 until December 10, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\">. Thus, while we deny Petitioner\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss his appeal with respect to these claims, we do so without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\">. Therefore, as we did with Petitioner's fifth and sixth claims, while we deny Petitioner's request for a COA and dismiss his appeal with respect to this claim, we do so without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b65-15\">. For the same reasons, we also DENY Petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>which we treat as a motion to vacate his state court conviction after retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
