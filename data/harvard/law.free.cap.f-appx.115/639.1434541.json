In the agreement, the Government reserved the sole discretion to decide whether to file a motion for a substantial assistance departure. Following his direct appeal, Freeman filed a motion to enforce his plea agreement, seeking an order requiring the Government to file a Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) motion to reduce his sentence based on his cooperation. The district court denied the motion, and Freeman timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-26\">\u201c[A] claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Nor would additional but generalized allegations of improper motive.\u201d Wade <em>v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). A defendant must make a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d of improper motive to warrant an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis court has followed the Supreme Court\u2019s lead and strictly interpreted the <em>Wade </em>exceptions, holding that the decision not to make a downward departure motion is properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>within the government\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Butler, </em>272 F.3d 683, 686 (4th Cir.2001). Thus, unless the Government\u2019s refusal to file a motion is based on an unconstitutional motive such as race or religious animus, or is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental end, district courts are without authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s discretionary decision not to file a substantial assistance motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Thus, Freeman\u2019s assertions that he provided substantial assistance do not entitle him to any relief. Further, his claim that the Government breached the plea agreement by declining to investigate Freeman\u2019s information is belied by the plea agreement. The plea agreement gave sole discretion to the Government to determine whether to file a motion for departure and did not require any specific investigation on the Government\u2019s part. Finally, Freeman does not even allege that the Government\u2019s failure to so move was based on an unconstitutional motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court and deny Freeman\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
