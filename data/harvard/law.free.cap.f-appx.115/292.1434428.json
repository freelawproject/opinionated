The district court determined that Vasquez had failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit and that his complaint failed to overcome the defendants\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity and failed to specify personal involvement by each defendant. The court dismissed the action with prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-21\">In his appellate brief, Vasquez argues the merits of his deliberate-indifference claim. He does not address any of the district court\u2019s conclusions that he had not exhausted administrative remedies, overcome the defendants\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity, or specified personal involvement by each defendant. Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Vasquez has failed to contest the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his complaint, he has waived appellate review of these issues. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Vasquez\u2019s appeal therefore lacks arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Vasquez is warned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Vasquez that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
