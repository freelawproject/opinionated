Vidal-Morales appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider sentence for lack of jurisdiction. He also contends that his motion to reconsider was filed within the time for requesting an extension of time to appeal based on excusable neglect and that this court should remand this case to the district court for a determination of excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-24\">Vidal-Morales\u2019 motion sought reconsideration of the district court\u2019s sentence, and contrary to Vidal-Morales\u2019 contention, his motion does not evince an intent to appeal. Vidal-Morales\u2019 request for a remand for a determination of excusable neglect is DENIED. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Page v. DeLaune, </em>837 F.2d 233, 237 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-25\">Because Vidal-Morales\u2019 motion for reconsideration was filed more than ten days after the entry of the district court\u2019s judgment, the district court was without jurisdiction to address it. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>670 F.2d 46, 48-49 (5th Cir.1982). Likewise, the motion for reconsideration was not authorized under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35, and the district court did not err in denying Vidal-Morales\u2019 motion to reconsider sentence for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-26\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying Vidal-Morales\u2019 motion to reconsider sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b748-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
