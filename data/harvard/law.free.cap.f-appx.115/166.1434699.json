The orders are not appeal-able unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>see Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368-69, 374 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Miles has not made the requisite showing. We therefore deny Miles\u2019s motions for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-22\">Additionally, we construe Miles\u2019s notices of appeal and informal briefs on appeal as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>applications to file a second or successive habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2254 petition, a prisoner must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) (2000). Miles\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline to authorize Miles to file a successive \u00a7 2254 petition. We deny Miles\u2019s motions for judicial notice, for summary judgment, for appointment of counsel, to take judicial notice and amend, for an evidentiary hearing, for the court to take independent action under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), for judgment, to review the record, for discovery, for production of documents, for sanctions under Fed. R.Civ.P. 11, and all other pending motions. We deny Miles\u2019s motion for oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
