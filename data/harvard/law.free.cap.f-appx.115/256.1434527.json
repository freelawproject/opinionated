Gutierrez-Suarez argues, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are elements of the offense, not sentence enhancements, making those provisions unconstitutional. He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and by prior Fifth Circuit precedent, <em>United States v. Barrera-Saucedo, </em>385 F.3d 533, 537 (5th Cir.2004). He raises the argument for possible review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Gutierrez-Suarez also argues that after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his sentence could not be enhanced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines on the basis of the fact of his prior conviction unless that fact was found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by him. He concedes that this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), forecloses this issue, and he raises it solely to preserve the issue for further review. This court has held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
