Covucci appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of his former employer, Service Merchandise Company, Inc. The primary issue on appeal is whether the termination of Covucci\u2019s employment constituted unlawful handicap discrimination under Ohio law. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Covucci incurred a work-related injury to his back on February 20, 1994 while moving a stack of plastic patio chairs. Following his injury, he provided his supervisor with a series of \u201cExcuse from Work\u201d forms signed by his doctor. In June of 1994, Covucci sought permission to return to work in a light-duty capacity, but Service Merchandise refused to allow him to do so until a physician authorized his return. The last Excuse from Work form that Covucci presented to Service Merchandise excused him from work through October 4, 1994. This form was followed by a letter from his doctor, stating that \u201c[o]ur physicians will NOT authorize your being out of work beyond 10/30/94.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Covucci remained on leave through January of 1995, even though he did not provide Service Merchandise with any further Excuse from Work forms. On January 30, 1995, a Service Merchandise Human Resources manager sent Covucci a letter, via certified mail, requesting medical documentation of his continued injury. The letter explained that Covucci\u2019s employment would be terminated if he did not provide this documentation. Covucci claims that he never received the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">On February 28, 1995, Service Merchandise terminated Covucci\u2019s employment. The stated reason for his termination was that the company\u2019s leave-of-absence policy permits, at most, a one-year separation from work. Covucci then filed suit in state court, claiming that his termination violated Ohio\u2019s Handicap Discrimination Statute, Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 4112.02(A). He also contended that his termination violated the public policy embodied in Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 4123.90, which prohibits retaliation against employees who file workers\u2019 compensation claims. Service Merchandise removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship. After the completion of discovery, Service Merchandise moved for summary judgment. The district court granted Service Merchandise\u2019s motion. Covucci now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">A. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Therma-Scan, Inc. v. Thermoscan, Inc., </em>295 F.3d 623, 629 (6th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.CivF. 56(c). In considering a motion for summary judgment, the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The central issue is \u201cwhether the evidence presents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">B. Covucei\u2019s claim of handicap discrimination under Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 4112.02(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In order to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination under Ohio law, a plaintiff must prove that (1) he is handicapped, (2) an adverse employment action was taken by his employer, and (3) even though handicapped, he can safely and substantially perform the essential functions of the job in question. <em>Hood v. Diamond Prods., Inc., </em>74 Ohio St.3d 298, 658 N.E.2d 738, 741 (1996). Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to set forth a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. <em>Id. </em>The burden then shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the employer\u2019s stated reason was a pretext designed to mask impermissible discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Service Merchandise argues that Covucci failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination because he was unable to show that he was handicapped. The district court agreed with this argument in granting summary judgment for Service Merchandise. There is no need for us to analyze the elements of Covucei\u2019s prima facie case, however, in order to resolve this lawsuit. Instead, we will proceed to the second and third parts of the burden-shifting analysis because, even if we were to assume that Covucci had made out a prima facie case, he failed to show that Service Merchandise\u2019s stated nondiscriminatory reason for his termination was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">As its nondiscriminatory reason for discharging Covucci, Service Merchandise asserts that Covucci violated the company\u2019s Leaves of Absence Policy. The policy provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">The employment of an associate will be terminated if the associate fails to return to work from a leave of absence in a timely manner or chooses not to return to work from a medical leave upon release of the attending physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-10\">The maximum length of a leave of absence for an associate\u2019s own illness or injury or military duty will be one year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-11\">&gt;;&lt; ^ &gt;\u00a1\u00ed sjc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-12\">An associate who fails to return to work on the scheduled return to work date and/or who, needing an extension to the leave, has not received an approved extension from management may be terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">Covucci was not in compliance with the policy when he faded to return to work upon release by his treating physician in October of 1994. He also failed to provide Service Merchandise with any Excuse from Work forms between November of 1994 and February of 1995. Moreover, even if he had submitted the requisite paperwork, Service Merchandise was entitled to terminate Covucci because his leave of absence exceeded the one-year maximum stated in the policy. (Covucci\u2019s leave began on February 25, 1994; he was terminated on February 28,1995.)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">Finally, Covucci failed to demonstrate that Service Merchandise\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reason for terminating him was pretextual. The leave-of-absence policy does not distinguish between handicapped and nonhandicapped individuals. Instead, it imposes a uniform approach in that it provides for the termination of any employee who does not return to work at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the end of an authorized leave period or whose absence due to illness, injury, or military service exceeds one year. Nor has Covucci presented any evidence that Service Merchandise applied its policy unfairly or inconsistently. Because Covucci has failed to raise any genuine issue of material fact as to the legitimacy of Service\u2019s Merchandise\u2019s reason for terminating him, he cannot succeed in his statutory discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">C. Covucci\u2019s public-policy claims</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Covucci also contends that Service Merchandise terminated him in violation of Ohio public policy, as expressed in Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 4112 (relating to handicap discrimination claims) and \u00a7 4123.90 (relating to workers\u2019 compensation claims). The elements of the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of Ohio public policy are that: (1) a clear public policy exists in a statute, regulation, or common law, (2) discharging employees under circumstances like those involved in the present case would jeopardize the policy, (3) the discharge at issue was motivated by conduct related to the policy, and (4) there was no overriding business justification for the discharge. <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc., </em>78 Ohio St.3d 134, 677 N.E.2d 308, 321 (1997) In limited situations, an employee may bring a claim of tortious violation of public policy regardless of whether a statutory remedy exists. <em>Cf. Ferraro v. B.F. Goodrich Co., </em>149 Ohio App.3d 301, 777 N.E.2d 282 (2002) (permitting a suit for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy based on age discrimination despite the fact that a separate statutory remedy exists for age discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">As to Covucci\u2019s public-policy claim based on \u00a7 4112, the statute itself is evidence of a clear public policy against disability discrimination. But, as noted above, Covucci failed to establish that his discharge was motivated by unlawful discrimination based on an alleged handicap. His public-policy claim therefore lacks merit. <em>See Cochran v. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc., </em>138 Ohio App.3d 888, 742 N.E.2d 734, 740 (2000) (holding that an employee who failed to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination could not sustain a claim of wrongful discharge based on public policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Similarly, Covucci\u2019s public-policy claim based on \u00a7 4123.90 is without merit. Section 4123.90 prohibits employers from taking retaliatory action against employees who file workers\u2019 compensation claims. But Covucci has not offered any evidence that Service Merchandise rejected or delayed his workers\u2019 compensation claim or that the company took any other retaliatory action in response to the filing of his claim. In fact, Covucci remained employed by Service Merchandise for nearly a year after his claim was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Covucci\u2019s common law claim is also barred because he did not comply with the procedural mandates of \u00a7 4123.90. <em>Cf. Kulch, </em>677 N.E.2d at 322-23 (holding that a plaintiff who had not strictly complied with the requirement of Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 4113.52, the whistleblowing statute, could not pursue a public-policy common law claim based on the same statute). Section 4123.90 provides that any action instituted by an employee to redress a violation \u201cshall be forever barred unless filed within one hundred eighty days immediately following the [adverse action], and no action may be instituted or maintained unless the employer has received written notice of a claimed violation ... within ninety days immediately following the [adverse action].\u201d \u00a7 4123.90. Covucci failed to comply with either of the time deadlines. He cannot, therefore, secure the protections embodied in the statute by asserting a common law claim as a means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>of bypassing the statutory requirements. <em>Cf. Kulch, </em>677 N.E.2d at 322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
