We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility determination, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-20\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because petitioner\u2019s testimony regarding the sterilization of his wife and his reason for fleeing China contained implausibilities going to the heart of his asylum claim, including with regard to why he waited six years after the sterilization to leave China. <em>See id. </em>at 1043. Because petitioner failed to .show that he was eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-21\">In addition, substantial evidence also supports the denial of relief under CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b440-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
