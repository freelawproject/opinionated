INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-24\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, to review the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Praditya\u2019s remaining claims. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s findings that Praditya failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution if returned to Indonesia, as required to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See Al-Harbi v. INS, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001). In addition, Praditya is not entitled to CAT relief because he failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b376-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
