He argues that 1) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object at trial to testimony regarding his criminal history, 2) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object at trial to the admissibility of a tape recording and to a witness\u2019s trial testimony regarding the contents of that tape recording, and 3) the cumulative effect of his trial counsel\u2019s errors deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-23\">\u201cWe have undertaken to resolve claims of inadequate representation on direct appeal only in rare cases where the record allowed us to evaluate fairly the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>United States v.
