To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. See <em>de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">We are without jurisdiction to review Singh\u2019s arguments related to the BIA\u2019s final removal order entered on December 13, 2002 because Singh did not file a timely petition for review of that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b); <em>Stone v.
