Lopez pled guilty without the benefit of a plea agreement reserving his right to appeal the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress. The district court\u2019s on-the-record statement at the sentencing hearing, informing Lopez that he had the right to appeal, is ambiguous regarding whether Lopez could appeal the ruling on his suppression motion or only his sentence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(j)(l)(B). However, that statement was made long after defendant entered his unconditional guilty plea, and Lopez \u201cpoints to no evidence in the record that [his] plea was involuntary at the time that [he] entered it.\u201d <em>United States v. Floyd, </em>108 F.3d 202, 204 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-25\">The appellant\u2019s unconditional guilty plea deprives this court of jurisdiction to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>his appeal. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b449-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
