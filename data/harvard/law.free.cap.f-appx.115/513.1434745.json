We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural history and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">All of Tsabbar\u2019s current claims against the Co-op defendants were previously raised or could have been raised by Tsabbar in state court. Those claims are thus barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine: \u201cinferior federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction \u2018over cases that effectively seek review of judgments of state courts and that federal review, if any, can occur only by way of a certiorari petition to the Supreme Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phifer v. City of New York, </em>289 F.3d 49, 55 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., </em>95 F.3d 195, 197 (2d Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Tsabbar\u2019s claims against the New York State Defendants, challenging the conduct of New York State judges, are barred by either the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution or the doctrine of judicial immunity, or both. <em>See Davis v. New York, </em>316 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir.2002); <em>Tucker v. Outwater, </em>118 F.3d 930, 932-33 (2d Cir.1997). To the extent Tsabbar\u2019s claims against the New York State defendants seek a reversal of prior decisions of the New York State courts, those claims are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
