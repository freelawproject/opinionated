It is assumed that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The court has jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court denial of habeas relief. <em>Bobb v. Senkowski, </em>196 F.3d 350, 352 (2d Cir.1999). The underlying state court decision is reviewed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1) [AEDPA], under which habeas relief is appropriate only if the state court\u2019s determination was either \u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201can unreasonable application of\u2019 \u201cclearly established\u201d Supreme Court precedent. <em>Id. </em>When a state court expressly engages in harmless error review, we assess whether the state court unreasonably applied the standard in <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), requiring that error be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Gutierrez v. McGinnis, </em>389 F.3d 300 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Here, the state court expressly ruled that, even if Portee\u2019s rights were violated, any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We need not decide whether Portee\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause were violated because in any event, for substantially the reasons the reasons stated by the district court, the determination by the state court that any such violation was harmless was not unreasonable. <em>See Fuller v. Gorczyk, </em>273 F.3d 212, 220 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED and the petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
