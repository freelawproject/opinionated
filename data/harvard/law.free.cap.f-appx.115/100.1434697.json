We assume the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural context, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Velazquez claims that drug quantity should have been found by the jury. However, none of the statutes underlying Velazquez\u2019s conviction make any mention of a particular quantity of drugs; and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), instructs only that drug quantity is an element of the offense (and thus must be presented to the jury) where \u201cthe quantity results in a punishment above the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 660 n. 3 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(in banc). </em>Here, Velazquez was sentenced below \u00a7 841(b)(l)(C)\u2019s 240-month maximum. Therefore, the jury was not required to make the drug quantity finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>No. 04-104, 2004 WL 2331491, and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>No. 04-105, 2004 WL 2331491 (argued October 4, 2004). Should any party believe there is a need for the district court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court will not reconsider those portions of its order that address the defendant\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until fourteen days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
