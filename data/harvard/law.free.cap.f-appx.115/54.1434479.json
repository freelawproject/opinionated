Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Robert L. Jackson\u2019s appeal of the decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, <em>Jackson v. Principi, </em>18 Vet.App. 463 (Vet.App.2003), for lack of jurisdiction. Jackson opposes. The Secretary replies. Jackson submits a surreply, which the court treats as a motion for leave to file a surreply.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Jackson appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims from a February 29, 2000 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals that determined there was no clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in (1) a 1966 regional office (RO) decision that granted his service connection claim for psychiatric disability, assigning a 10 percent disability rating, but did not consider service connection for varicose veins; (2) a June 1987 RO decision that did not increase his psychiatric disability rating above 30 percent; and (3) a March 1994 RO decision that found CUE in a 1993 RO decision. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims only considered allegations of CUE in the 1966 RO decision because Jackson\u2019s brief and response contained \u201cno discernable argument with respect to the Board\u2019s determinations that the 1987 and 1994 RO decisions were not the products of CUE[J\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">On appeal from the Board\u2019s decision, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims considered the following claims asserted by Jackson: (1) The April 1966 RO decision contained CUE because pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1137 and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.131 his psychiatric disability should have been rated at 50 percent; (2) the April 1966 RO decision did not award service connection for varicose veins and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \u201cused altered service records for more than 30 years to deprive [him of] compensation[;]\u201d (3) the RO failed to adjudicate a 1978 claim for a rating based on total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU); and (4) the VA committed grave procedural error and breached its duty to assist.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-16\">With regard to the issues raised, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-17\">As an initial matter, to the extent that the appellant is arguing that VA committed grave procedural error that renders the prior RO decisions non-final, the Court notes that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has eliminated grave procedural error as a means to vitiate the finality of a prior decision. See <em>Cook v. Principi, </em>318 F.3d 1334, 1341 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc) (holding that grave procedural error cannot render decision of VA non-final). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Thus, the Court will not further address those arguments. In addition, to the extent that the appellant contends that VA breached its duty to assist, the Court notes that VA\u2019s failure to fulfill its duty to assist does not rise to the level of CUE. <em>See Cook, </em>318 F.3d at 1344-47.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">Turning to the appellant\u2019s arguments regarding CUE in the 1966 RO decision, the Court notes that his argument regarding \u00a7 4.131 appears unavailing because he has not pointed to any evidence extant at the time of the 1966 RO decision that demonstrates that his \u201cmental disorder ha[d its] onset as an incident of battle or enemy action, or following bombing, shipwreck, imprisonment, exhaustion, or prolonged operational fatigue.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.131 (1965).... Although it is unclear for what proposition the appellant cites to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1137 ..., the Court notes that the statute would have no bearing on the issue of a rating in excess of 10% for his service-connected mental disorder. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1137 (extending wartime service presumptions of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1111, 1112, and 1113 to post-1946 peacetime service).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims rejected Jackson\u2019s argument that the April 1966 RO decision committed CUE in failing to award him service connection for varicose veins because, among other things, \u201cthere is no evidence of record that the appellant filed a claim for service connection for bilateral varicose veins at any time prior to the 1966 RO decision.\u201d Finally, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims determined that \u201cbecause appellant did not raise his arguments regarding a pending unadjudicated claim for a rating of TDIU before the Board ... and because the issue of CUE in the 1978 RO decision has not been the subject of a [Board] decision, those arguments are not properly before the Court.\u201d Citing <em>Andre v. Principi, </em>301 F.3d 1354, 1361-62 (Fed.Cir.2002). The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed the Board\u2019s decision of no CUE. Jackson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). This court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Jackson\u2019s appeal does not satisfy any of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. In his response, Jackson raises numerous issues that were not raised before the Board or the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and these issues do not relate to the CUE decision on appeal challenging the April 1966 RO decision. In his informal brief, Jackson makes vague allegations of constitutional issues, including that he \u201cdid not receive equity under Article III\u201d of the Constitution. As we explained in <em>Helfer v. West, </em>174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed.Cir.1999), \u201c[t]he characterization of [a] question as constitutional in nature does not confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise lack.\u201d Additionally, Jackson appears to raise issues, arguably constitutional in nature, that were not \u201cpresented and necessary\u201d to the decision on appeal. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). Jackson further states that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims misinterpreted 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1137 and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.131. However, the record shows that the decision simply applied these provisions to the facts and found that they did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims factual determinations pertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>to the sufficiency of Jackson\u2019s CUE claim or application of the law of CUE to the facts are not within our jurisdiction. In these circumstances, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Jackson\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b89-13\"> The motion is granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
