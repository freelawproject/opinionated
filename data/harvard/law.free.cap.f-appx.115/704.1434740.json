Banks\u2019s claim that he was served food loaf for seven days does not implicate a liberty interest; he has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal or that the district court erred in certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Banks\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Banks\u2019s complaint count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Banks previously earned a strike in another civil rights action. <em>See Banks v. Cain, </em>No. 03-310-D-M1 (M.D.La. Aug. 12, 2003); <em>Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387-88. Because Banks has accumulated three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he is BARRED from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
