Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>No. CH-0752-02-0670-I-1, 2004 WL 485478 (M.S.P.B. Apr.30, 2003). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">On May 1, 2002, at approximately 8:25 a.m., Maddox was informed that he was to participate in a random drug test that morning. In response, Maddox told his supervisor (Gary Thomas) that he had \u201ca doctor\u2019s appointment\u201d and that he \u201chad to go.\u201d His supervisor replied that he was unaware of any request for leave and told Maddox that he would arrange for Maddox\u2019s immediate testing. Thomas then told Maddox that he was going to make sure the testers were ready. When Thomas returned, approximately two minutes later,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Maddox was no longer at his work station, and Thomas did not see Maddox\u2019s car in the company parking lot. Maddox returned later that morning and, at some point later in the day, submitted a leave slip for the time he was gone. This leave request, however, was not approved, because Maddox had not followed agency leave procedures and did not have a valid excuse for this departure from procedure. Also that day, Maddox requested leave from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. \u2014 this time following proper agency procedure. However, at 1:20 p.m., when Thomas went in search of Maddox, Thomas could not find him. Accordingly, the two time periods that Maddox was deemed AWOL are from 8:30 to 11:00 a.m. and 1:20 to 1:30 p.m. on May 1, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">Following an exhaustive discussion of the factual background of this case and the testimony before him, the AJ found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">the circumstances surrounding the appellant\u2019s sudden departure from the agency\u2019s facility on May 1, 2002, after receiving notice that he would be randomly drug tested, without obtaining specific leave approval from [his supervisor], and without an otherwise legitimate reason to leave the facility, establish, by preponderant evidence, that the appellant intentionally failed and refused to submit to the random drug test in violation of agency standards of conduct and discipline, and the conditions of his employment of which he was on ample personal notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 33. The AJ also found that the agency\u2019s AWOL charges were supported and sustained by a preponderance of the evidence. The AJ\u2019s decision became final when the full Board denied Maddox\u2019s petition for review. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">We must affirm a Board decision unless it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). We will not overturn a decision of the Board \u201cif it is supported by \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brewer v. United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>Postal Serv., </em>227 Ct.Cl. 276, 647 F.2d 1093, 1096 (Ct.Cl.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">On appeal, Maddox simply takes issue with the Board\u2019s findings of fact,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> without offering any explanation as to why the AJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. The AJ\u2019s conclusions are fully supported by the evidence which is discussed in detail in his forty page opinion. The AJ made determinations concerning the credibility of agency witnesses and Maddox\u2019s lack of credibility. It is well settled that judging the credibility of witnesses is the responsibility of the trier of fact and is virtually unreviewable. <em>Hambsch v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed.Cir.1986). Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-9\">. Maddox claimed that it had to have been at least ten minutes before Thomas returned due to a phone conversation Maddox recalled having; however, the Administrative Judge (\"AJ\") did not believe this testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-14\">. Maddox does not challenge the \"efficiency of the service\u201d and \"penalty\u201d prongs of the AJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
