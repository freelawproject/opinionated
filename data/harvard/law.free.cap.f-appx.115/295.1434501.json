Wilson\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s decision that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 201 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-22\">Wilson argues that the district court erred in dismissing as frivolous his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against Kenneth Nash, Wilson\u2019s former defense attorney, and a staff attorney for the State Counsel of Offenders. A public defender is not a state actor for purposes of \u00a7 1983 liability \u201cwhen performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). Moreover, Wilson\u2019s claim is barred because he is seeking to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional sentence that has not been reversed on appeal or in a postconviction proceeding. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-23\">Wilson has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Wilson\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Wilson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Wilson\u2019s civil rights complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous also counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Wilson is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
