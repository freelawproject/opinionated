Under the New Jersey Constitution, such an election is required if there is a \u201cvacancy\u201d in office. There is no vacancy here because the Governor has not yet resigned and because he continues to serve and occupy the office. Absent a vacancy, no special election is mandated. We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-17\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b574-18\">James McGreevey was elected as Governor of the State of New Jersey on November 6, 2001, and was sworn in January 15, 2002. He was elected to a four-year term which expires January 17, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-19\">At an August 12, 2004 press conference, McGreevey publicly announced his intention to resign before the completion of his term. Citing \u201can adult consensual affair with another man\u201d which he believed would render the office \u201cvulnerable to rumors, false allegations, and threats of disclosure,\u201d McGreevey declared \u201cthe right course of action is to resign.\u201d For the ostensible purpose of facilitating \u201ca responsible transition,\u201d McGreevey stated that the effective date of his resignation \u201cwill be November 15, 2004.\u201d McGreevey continues to discharge the powers and functions of the New Jersey governorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-20\">The Governor\u2019s stated intention to resign \u201ceffective\u201d November 15, 2004 is significant. Had McGreevey \u201cvacated\u201d his office prior to September 3, 2004, the New Jersey Constitution would require that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>successor be elected on November 2, 2004. On the other hand, if the office is \u201cvacated\u201d after September 3, 2004, the President of the New Jersey Senate would serve as acting governor until the next elected governor takes office in January 2006. The current President of the New Jersey Senate is Richard Codey, who, like McGreevey, is a member of the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Plaintiffs Bruce Afran and Carl Mayer, purporting to represent a class of all registered New Jersey voters, brought this action in federal court on August 16, 2004, seeking a declaration that Governor McGreevey \u201cvacated\u201d his office under the New Jersey Constitution; that this \u201cvacancy\u201d requires election of a new governor on November 2, 2004, to serve the remainder of the term; and that McGreevey\u2019s continued occupation of the Governor\u2019s office infringes plaintiffs\u2019 First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The District Court for the District of New Jersey denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 and dismissed their \u00a7 1983 action for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because this case involves only questions of law, our review is plenary. <em>Pollice v. Nat\u2019l Tax Funding, L.P., </em>225 F.3d 379, 388-89 (3d Cir.2000). We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">II. Federal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 over the District Court\u2019s final order denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for declaratory judgment and dismissing the case. The District Court properly exercised its federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">Federal jurisdiction is proper where plaintiffs assert a non-frivolous federal claim. <em>Martin v. United Way of Erie County, </em>829 F.2d 445, 447 (3d Cir.1987) (citing <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946)). Only where the claim upon which federal jurisdiction hinges is \u201cinsubstantial on [its] face\u201d is dismissal for want of jurisdiction required. <em>Kulick v. Pocono Downs Racing Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>816 F.2d 895, 898-99 (3d Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 542 n. 10, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974)). Moreover, dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is only appropriate where \u201cthe right claimed is \u2018so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 899 (quoting <em>Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, </em>414 U.S. 661, 666, 94 S.Ct. 772, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">In this case, plaintiffs claim they were deprived of their constitutionally protected right to vote. Although we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under \u00a7 1983, this does not deprive a federal court of jurisdiction. <em>See Kulick, </em>816 F.2d at 898; <em>Martin, </em>829 F.2d at 447.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>tiffs allege deprivation of a fundamental right protected by the Constitution, <em>see Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 554, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964), federal jurisdiction is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">III. Abstention and Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Defendants urged the District Court to abstain from asserting federal jurisdiction in light of the allegedly unsettled status of New Jersey law, a position plaintiffs \u2014 after opposing it in the District Court \u2014 now advance in the alternative to this court. <em>See R.R. Comm\u2019n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). The District Court declined to abstain. Although we rely upon different reasoning, we agree that abstention is inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The <em>Pullman </em>doctrine authorizes federal court abstention when a constitutional challenge is intertwined with an ambiguous issue of state law and a likelihood exists, therefore, that clarification of the state law issue will substantially affect the constitutional inquiry. <em>Id. </em>In order to abstain under <em>Pullman, </em>there must be three \u201cspecial circumstances:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">(1) Uncertain issues of state law underlying the federal constitutional claims brought in federal court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">(2) State law issues amenable to a state court interpretation that would obviate the need for, or substantially narrow, the scope of the adjudication of the constitutional claims;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">(3) A federal court\u2019s erroneous construction of state law would be disruptive of important state policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-11\"><em>Chez Sez III Corp. v. Township of Union, </em>945 F.2d 628, 631 (3d Cir.1991) (citing <em>D\u2019Iorio v. County of Del., </em>592 F.2d 681, 686 (3d Cir.1978)) <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 907, 112 S.Ct. 1265, 117 L.Ed.2d 493 (1992). If the court finds these three circumstances, \u201cit must then make a discretionary determination as to whether abstention is in fact appropriate under the circumstances of the particular case, based on the weight of these criteria and other relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">Abstention under <em>Pullman </em>therefore is discretionary and is generally exercised sparingly. <em>City of Houston v. Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 467, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987) (citing <em>Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 813, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976)); <em>see also Baggett v. Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 375, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964) (\u201cThe abstention doctrine is not an automatic rule applied whenever a federal court is faced with a doubtful issue of state law; it rather involves a discretionary exercise of a court\u2019s equity powers.\u201d); <em>Planned Parenthood of Cent. N.J. v. Farmer, </em>220 F.3d 127, 149 (3d Cir.2000) <em>(\u201cPullman </em>abstention should be rarely invoked\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">Moreover, ambiguity in state law will not, standing alone, require abstention. As the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-14\"><em>[Pullman </em>abstention] contemplates that deference to state court adjudication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>only be made where the issue of state law is uncertain. If the state statute in question, although never interpreted by a state tribunal, is not fairly subject to an interpretation which will render unnecessary or substantially modify the federal constitutional question, it is the duty of the federal court to exercise its properly invoked jurisdiction. Thus, \u201crecognition of the role of state courts as the final expositors of state law implies no disregard for the primacy of the federal judiciary in deciding questions of federal law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><em>Harman v. Forssenius, </em>380 U.S. 528, 535, 85 S.Ct. 1177, 14 L.Ed.2d 50 (1965) (quoting <em>England v. La. State Bd. Med. Exam\u2019rs, </em>375 U.S. 411, 415-16, 84 S.Ct. 461, 11 L.Ed.2d 440 (1964)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Principles of comity and federalism counsel for a state constitutional interpretation by state courts. But the state law which controls our decision is not uncertain. Furthermore, the discretionary analysis in this case must be informed by considerations of timing, as well as the policy disfavoring forum-shopping. Were we to abstain, a final judicial determination would be substantially delayed. In a time-sensitive environment such as that presented by a rapidly approaching election, prejudice to both parties would inevitably result from such delay. <em>See Farmer, </em>220 F.3d at 151 (noting that delay is a relevant factor in considering whether to abstain).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Moreover, citing an \u201cimmense conflict of interest\u201d in an adjudication by the New Jersey courts, plaintiffs elected to bring suit in federal court. But having obtained an adverse ruling on the merits, plaintiffs now \u2014 in a reversal of position \u2014 argue to this court that the New Jersey state courts are better suited to resolving this dispute. We disagree and hold that <em>Pullman </em>abstention is inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Plaintiffs contend in the alternative that we should certify to the New Jersey Supreme Court the question whether Governor McGreevey\u2019s action effects a vacancy under the New Jersey Constitution. Under New Jersey Court Rule 2:12A, the New Jersey Supreme Court may answer such a question if \u201cthere is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or statute in this State.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>R.2:12A (Gann 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The use of certification \u201crests in the sound discretion of the federal courts.\u201d <em>Lehman Bros. v. Schein, </em>416 U.S. 386, 391, 94 S.Ct. 1741, 40 L.Ed.2d 215 (1974) (Rehnquist, J., concurring). Moreover, this court \u201cmay not properly ask a state court if it would care in effect to rewrite a statute,\u201d or a constitutional provision. <em>Fanner, </em>220 F.3d at 152 n. 12 (quoting <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. at 471, 107 S.Ct. 2502). Relying upon the same considerations which inform our decision not to abstain\u2014 timing, feasibility, public policy, and plaintiffs\u2019 choice of forum \u2014 we decline to employ certification in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">IV. The Constitutional Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Plaintiffs allege they have been deprived of their right to vote under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The District Court dismissed this claim under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">To state a claim for violation of \u00a7 1983, plaintiffs must allege that defendants, while acting under color of state law, deprived them of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 535, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981) <em>overruled on other grounds, Daniel v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>see also Gruenke v. Seip, </em>225 F.3d 290, 298 (3d Cir.2000). This court\u2019s initial inquiry, therefore, is whether plaintiffs have \u201calleged the deprivation of a right that either federal law or the Constitution protects.\u201d <em>Gruenke, </em>225 F.3d at 298 (citing <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 144 n. 3, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The Constitution protects the right of qualified citizens to vote in both national and local elections. <em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 554, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964) (\u201cIt has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified voters have a constitutionally protected right to vote, and to have their votes counted.\u201d) (citing <em>Ex parte Yarbrough, </em>110 U.S. 651, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274 (1884) and <em>United States v. Mosley, </em>238 U.S. 383, 35 S.Ct. 904, 59 L.Ed. 1355 (1915)); <em>see also Yick Wo v. Hopkins, </em>118 U.S. 356, 370, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886) (noting that voting is a \u201cfundamental political right\u201d). Despite constitutional protection of the franchise, however, not every imperfection in state and local elections rises to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>Duncan v. Poythress, </em>657 F.2d 691, 699 (5th Cir.1981); <em>see also Forenza v. Rodgers, </em>268 N.J.Super. 482, 633 A.2d 1057, 1059 (Law Div.1992) (finding the proposition that \u201cnot every violation of state election law constitutes a denial of constitutionally guaranteed rights\u201d to be \u201cwell established\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">But there are exceptions to the general rule that federal courts do not superintend the administration of local electoral contests. Where a discrete group of voters suffers a denial of equal protection, for example, their constitutional rights are violated. <em>See Reynolds, </em>377 U.S. at 559-61, 84 S.Ct. 1362. Of relevance to this case, a claim under \u00a7 1983 will also lie where state or local election infractions work a denial of substantive due process rights in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Bonas v. Town of N. Smithfield, </em>265 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir.2001) (\u201c[I]n those few cases in which organic failures in a state or local election process threaten to work patent and fundamental unfairness, a colorable claim lies for a violation of substantive due process\u201d), <em>Duncan, </em>657 F.2d at 700 (holding that \u201cthe due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits action by state officials which seriously undermine the fundamental fairness of the electoral process\u201d); <em>Griffin v. Burns, </em>570 F.2d 1065, 1077 (1st Cir.1978) (\u201cIf the election process itself reaches the point of patent and fundamental unfairness, a violation of the due process clause may be indicated and relief under \u00a7 1983 therefore in order.\u201d); <em>see also Marks v. Stinson, </em>19 F.3d 873, 889 (3d Cir.1994) (enjoining winning state senate candidate from exercising official authority where absentee ballots were obtained and cast illegally).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">We find instructive the decision of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <em>Bonas v. Town of North Smithfield, </em>265 F.3d 69 (1st Cir.2001). In <em>Bonas, </em>four registered voters in the town of North Smithfield sought to compel an election in November 2001 for the North Smithfield town council and school committee. Because a referendum to transition the town from an odd-year election cycle to an even-year cycle had been adopted in 1998, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>regularly scheduled elections had been held in 1999, the town decided not to hold a municipal election in 2001. Invoking \u00a7 1983, plaintiffs \u2014 who desired to exercise their right to vote for town council and school committee in 2001 \u2014 filed suit in federal district court claiming denial of their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The court recognized the limited reach of federal jurisdiction over claims arising from state or local election disputes but held that where the election process is patently and fundamentally unfair, substantive due process violations can occur. <em>Id. </em>at 74. \u201c[Tjotal and complete disenfranchisement of the electorate as a whole,\u201d held the <em>Bonas </em>court, is one such instance of patent and fundamental unfairness giving rise to a constitutional claim. <em>Id. </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">To determine whether such disenfranchisement had in fact occurred, the court turned to state law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">Do state and local rules mandate an election in North Smithfield for the offices of town council and school committee in the fall of 2001? Assuming that such an election is required ... the Town\u2019s refusal to hold it would work a total and complete disenfranchisement of the electorate, and therefore would constitute a violation of due process (in addition to being a violation of state law).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\"><em>Id.; see also Taxpayers United for Assessment Cuts v. Austin, </em>994 F.2d 291, 295-96 (6th Cir.1993) (same). We employ a similar analytic framework. Assuming New Jersey law requires an election in this case, refusal to hold it would rise to the level of a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The determinative inquiry, therefore, is whether New Jersey law requires an election under these circumstances. As we discuss, we answer that question in the negative. Therefore, there is no violation of plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process rights, and they have failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">V. New Jersey Law</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">As a threshold matter, the parties vigorously dispute the method of interpretation to be employed in this case. Defendants urge this court to rely upon the plain meaning of the New Jersey Constitution, while plaintiffs suggest an expansive interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">Plaintiffs rely heavily upon a \u201cliberal\u201d rule of construction they attribute to the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>New Jersey Democratic Party, Inc. v. Samson, </em>175 N.J. 178, 814 A.2d 1028 (2002). In <em>Samson, </em>Senator Robert Torricelli withdrew his candidacy for United States Senator approximately five weeks before the November 2002 general election. The New Jersey Democratic Party requested Torricelli\u2019s name be taken off the ballot and replaced with the name of a new candidate. The applicable New Jersey statute set forth the procedures for replacement only when the vacancy on the ballot occurred \u201cnot later than the 51st day before the general election.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. 19:13-20. Regarding vacancies arising within fifty days of the election, however, the <em>Samson </em>court found the statute silent regarding replacement. Reasoning that reconfiguration of the ballots was logistically feasible, and emphasizing its belief that the applicable statute did not specifically preclude such a remedy, the New Jersey Supreme Court permitted plaintiffs to insert a new candidate on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">Significantly, the <em>Samson </em>court construed a New Jersey statute, rather than a New Jersey constitutional provision. We decline to apply the \u201cliberal\u201d interpretation urged by plaintiffs to the state Constitution where there is no indication that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>New Jersey Supreme Court would itself espouse such an approach. Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that the New Jersey Supreme Court has never expressly endorsed a \u201cliberal\u201d approach to interpretation of the state Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Of even greater significance, the New Jersey Constitution \u2014 in Article V, section 1, paragraphs 6 through 9 \u2014 addresses each scenario generated by a gubernatorial vacancy and provides means for filling it. Where the language of a constitutional provision is clear, the words must be given their plain meaning. <em>Cambria v. Soaries, </em>169 N.J. 1, 776 A.2d 754, 758 (2001) (quoting <em>State v. Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts, Inc., </em>160 N.J. 505, 734 A.2d 1160 (1999)). We are mindful of New Jersey\u2019s policy preference in favor of empowering voters, but we believe the language of the Constitution incorporates this principle within its text. Because the Constitution anticipates and provides for succession and election procedures following a vacancy in the office of the Governor, our textual analysis is already infused by New Jersey\u2019s preference for electing officials. Our analysis must begin with the text itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The New Jersey Constitution identifies several ways in which a gubernatorial \u201cvacancy\u201d may arise, among them resignation. N.J. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 1,11116-8. Plaintiffs argue that by virtue of Governor McGreevey\u2019s August 12th announcement, there is a vacancy in the office of Governor. Because we find this announcement alone does not constitute a resignation, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The New Jersey Constitution establishes a comprehensive framework by which unexpected transfers of power in the office of the Governor will take place. When a governor resigns, a vacancy arises and the Constitution provides for a provisional fulfillment of the governor\u2019s duties by the President of the Senate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">In the event of a vacancy in the office of Governor resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a Governor in office, or the death of a Governor-elect, or from any other cause, the functions, powers, duties and emoluments of the office shall devolve upon the President of the Senate, for the time being, and in the event of his death, resignation or removal, then upon the Speaker of the General Assembly....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">N.J. Const. Art. Y, \u00a7 1, H 6 (\u201cParagraph 6\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">In addition to providing for the immediate assumption of power by the Senate President, the Constitution also provides that a vacancy in the office of the Governor will \u2014 in some circumstances \u2014 trigger a special gubernatorial election:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-15\">In the event of a vacancy in the office of Governor, a Governor shall be elected to fill the unexpired term at the general election next succeeding the vacancy, unless the vacancy shall occur within sixty days immediately preceding a general election, in which case he shall be elected at the second succeeding general election; but no election to fill an unexpired term shall be held in any year in which a Governor is to be elected for a full term. A Governor elected for an unexpired term shall assume his office immediately upon his election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">N.J. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 1, H 9 (\u201cParagraph 9\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-17\">Reading these two provisions together, it is apparent that the New Jersey Constitution contemplates the resignation of the governor and subsequent transfer of pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>er as a three-step process: first, the creation of a vacancy by the governor\u2019s resignation; second, the assumption of the powers and duties of the Governor\u2019s office by the Senate President; and third, an election to determine the next governor. The timing of the first step \u2014 that is, when the Governor\u2019s office becomes vacant \u2014 determines both the date of the next gubernatorial election<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the duration of the Senate President\u2019s term as acting governor. Unsurprisingly, it is this date of \u201cvacancy\u201d which lies at the center of the current dispute. The parties offer competing views.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">According to plaintiffs, a vacancy arose in the office of Governor on August 12, 2004, because McGreevey\u2019s public announcement constituted an effective resignation. Because this announcement came more than sixty days before the next general election, they argue Paragraph 9 requires that an election to fill the remainder of McGreevey\u2019s term be held on November 2, 2004, or \u2014 as they stated at oral argument \u2014 on a judicially-determined date in the future. Defendants, conversely, contend that no vacancy exists because no resignation has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We agree with defendants on this point. Under the New Jersey Constitution, a vacaney will arise upon resignation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Governor McGreevey has not resigned, there is no vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">On August 12, 2004, Governor McGreevey made a declaration that he would resign from office and that such resignation \u201cwill be effective\u201d November 15, 2004. Under New Jersey law, he has not taken the steps necessary to translate this announcement into an official act.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">Chapter 14 of New Jersey Code Title 52 sets forth \u201c[mjethods of resigning from office\u201d for both elected and appointed officers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">Whenever a state officer holding an office under the appointment of the joint meeting of the legislature shall be desirous of resigning, he shall present such resignation in writing under his hand, during the sitting of the legislature addressed to the joint meeting. <em>All other state officers </em>desirous of resigning shall send their resignations, in writing, to the governor. All such resignations shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state. <em>No resignation made in any other way or pretended to be made, shall be valid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">N.J. Stat. Ann. 52:14-10 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">The text of section 14-10 requires that a governor file a written resignation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the Secretary of State to effectuate his resignation. After specifying the resignation procedures to be followed by \u201ca state officer holding an office under the appointment of the joint meeting of the legislature,\u201d the statute uses all-inclusive language requiring that \u201c[a]ll other state officers\u201d file written resignations with the office of the Secretary of State. N.J. Stat. Ann. 52:14-10.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even though the requirement that resignations first be sent \u201cto the governor\u201d may be redundant when it is the governor resigning, this does not defeat application of section 14-10 to gubernatorial resignations. The governor falls within the catch-all category of \u201call other state officers\u201d and his resignation must, therefore, comply with the terms of the statute. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cNo resignation made in any other way or pretended to be made, shall be valid.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The submission of a written letter of resignation to the Secretary of State by a departing governor, in accordance with section 14-10, is an established practice in New Jersey. Each of the four New Jersey governors to have resigned in the last 106 years have submitted a written resignation to the Secretary of State. In 1898, Governor John W. Griggs submitted a written letter of resignation to Secretary of State George Wurts. In 1918, Governor Woodrow Wilson submitted a hand-written resignation to the Secretary of State so that he could assume the presidency of the United States. In 1919, Governor Edge submitted a written letter of resignation to Secretary of State Thomas Martin. More recently, in 2001 Governor Christine Todd Whitman tendered a written resignation to Secretary of State DeForest Soaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Plaintiffs urge that McGreevey\u2019s public announcement is more \u201cfinal\u201d than would be a letter to the Secretary of State under section 14-10. They posit that \u201c[e]ven if [McGreevey] theoretically retains the power to stay on and change his decision ... the reality is that he is not changing his mind and he is going.\u201d The legal reality, however, is something different. Under New Jersey law, a resignation is not valid unless it is in writing and filed in the office of the Secretary of State. \u201cNo resignation made in any other way or pretended to be made, shall be valid.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. 52:14-10. Plaintiffs have cited no statutory provision to the contrary, relying instead on the argument that McGreevey\u2019s public announcement is \u201cfunctionally far more definitive and final than would be a letter of resignation quietly and privately delivered to a government official.\u201d But the New Jersey legislature has set forth what constitutes a \u201cdefinitive and final\u201d resignation. McGreevey\u2019s announcement has not satisfied these statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">By requiring a written filing with the Secretary of State \u2014 a clear and concrete manifestation of resignation \u2014 the legislature has assured clarity in the resignation process. Because Governor McGreevey has not yet officially resigned from the office of the Governor, there is no vacancy under the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">In sum, we hold that there is no vacancy in the office of New Jersey Governor because James McGreevey, the current governor, has not officially resigned from office. Because it is the existence of a vacancy which triggers Paragraph 9\u2019s election procedures, no special election is called for by New Jersey law. Absent a state law requirement that such an election be held, plaintiffs have failed to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>a claim under \u00a7 1983 for violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights to substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">For the reasons stated, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">. <em>Afran v.

Once the plaintiff has met this threshold pleading requirement, however, the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint is a question on the merits, as is the legal question whether the facts alleged establish a violation.

Second, where a vacancy occurs between 61 and 364 days before a general election, a new governor will be elected at that next general election to fill the remainder of the resigning governor\u2019s term. For example, were a vacancy to arise in May, an election would be held the following November and the victor would assume the governor\u2019s office until the next regularly scheduled gubernatorial election \u2014 which could be up to three years later. And finally, should a vacancy arise during the year of a regularly scheduled gubernatorial election, a successor would be chosen at that election.
