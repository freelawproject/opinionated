Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Because the Board stated it only affirmed the results of the IJ\u2019s decision, we have no way of knowing on which ground or grounds the Board affirmed, and in turn whether we have jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 02-73538, 2004 WL 2650828, *1 (9th Cir. Nov.22, 2004). Accordingly, we vacate the Board\u2019s decision and remand with instructions to clarify the grounds for its affirmance of the immigration judge\u2019s denial of the application for cancellation of removal. <em>Id. </em>at *14 (9th Cir. Nov. 22, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b404-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
