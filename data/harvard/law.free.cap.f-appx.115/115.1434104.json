We have jurisdiction over this appeal from the District Court\u2019s final order awarding summary judgment to the Commissioner pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The detailed history and facts of the case are presented in the District Court\u2019s opinion, <em>Slovak v. Barnhart, </em>No. 02-1361 (W.D.Pa. filed September 22, 2003), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>will only be summarized here. At issue in this appeal is whether substantial evidence supports the decision that Slovak is not entitled to SSI because she is not so functionally limited as to preclude her performance of unskilled, medium jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Our review of the District Court\u2019s order is plenary, but we may reverse the grant of summary judgment to the Commissioner only if we conclude that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) findings were not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Burns v. Barnhart, </em>312 F.3d 113, 118 (3d Cir.2002). Substantial evidence is that evidence that \u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The disability standard requires evidence of a medically determinable impairment that is so severe as to prevent an individual\u2019s performance of any substantial gainful activity which exists in the national economy. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). Slovak claims that she suffers from thrombophlebitis, vein inflamation in her leg stemming from a 1973 injury, which constitutes a severe impairment and precludes her from working. At the hearing, the ALJ determined that although Slovak\u2019s condition was a severe impairment, it was not a listed impairment as determined by the applicable regulations and, in addition, Slovak retained the capacity to perform medium work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.967(c). This determination was based, <em>inter alia, </em>on the medical opinion of Dr. John Gaydos, a consultative physician whose 2000 examination of Slovak diagnosed her with a history of thrombophlebitis, ulcer disease, and anxiety, but did not find that she was currently functionally limited. The ALJ also considered a letter from Dr. John A. Carter, Slovak\u2019s treating physician, who found Slovak to be permanently disabled, but did not provide any objective medical findings such as lab tests or treatments. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d)(2). The ALJ further found that Slovak\u2019s subjective complaints of pain were not entirely credible and that there were a significant number of jobs in the economy that Slovak could perform. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920. The ALJ\u2019s decision became the Commissioner\u2019s final decision under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Slovak then filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking to overturn the ALJ\u2019s decision. The District Court found that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision and granted summary judgment for the Commissioner. Slovak now argues to this Court that the ALJ\u2019s decision improperly rejected Dr. Carter\u2019s conclusions and that the ALJ\u2019s finding regarding Slovak\u2019s ability to perform jobs was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The decision of the ALJ that Slovak was not entitled to SSI is supported by substantial evidence. In determining that Slovak did not meet a listed impairment and that she could perform medium work, the ALJ properly evaluated the medical evidence, which was both thorough and clear, in accordance with regulations. The decision that Dr. Carter\u2019s conclusions were outweighed by the other record medical evidence is supported by substantial evidence, namely the opinion of Dr. Gaydos, the consultative evaluation of Dr. Ralph E. Landafeld, the residual functional capacity assessment performed by a state agency physician, and the testimony of Slovak.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">In addition, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Slovak\u2019s subjective allegations of pain were not supported by the evidence and not fully credible was based on a reasonable assessment of the evidence, including an evaluation of her medical evaluations and testimony regarding her daily activities. Finally, the ALJ properly applied the applicable guidelines to determine that Slo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>vak could perform a significant number of unskilled, medium jobs in the national economy notwithstanding her medical condition. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920. This determination was supported by the medical evidence, noted above, showing that Slovak had functional capacity as well as Slovak\u2019s own testimony regarding her daily activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Thus, because the decision of the AL J is supported by substantial evidence, the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Commissioner will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
