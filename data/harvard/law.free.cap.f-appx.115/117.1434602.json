On November 11, 1989, he entered the United States without inspection in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) and was subject to removal from the United States. Yupanqui conceded his removability before an Immigration Judge (IJ) but applied for a cancellation of removal in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(b). On December 7, 2001, the IJ denied Yupanqui\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. The IJ held that Yupanqui did not demonstrate that his American citizen daughter would suffer <em>\u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d </em>\u2014 as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(b)(1)(D) \u2014 if he were to be removed from the United States. This decision was affirmed without an opinion (AWO) by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-22\">Yupanqui seeks a petition for review by this court. He raises two issues that he feels were errors committed during the previous proceedings. He argues (1) that the IJ\u2019s decision concerning the lack of a showing of \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d was erroneous, and (2) that his due process rights were violated by the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm without issuing an opinion. Because we lack the jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions made by the IJ and because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>BIA\u2019s AWO does not violate due process, we will deny Yupanqui\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We have recently held in an analogous case that pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), we do not have jurisdiction to hear discretionary decisions made under 8 U-.S.C. \u00a7 1229(b). <em>Mendez-Moranchel v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 176, 178 (3d Cir.2003). We also held that the question of whether an alien can establish \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d under Section 1229(b)(1)(D) is a discretionary question. <em>Id. </em>at 178-79. We stated that, \u201c[t]he determination of whether the alien has established the requisite hardship is a quintessential discretionary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179. This decision was consistent with other circuits that addressed the same question. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we lack jurisdiction to address Yupanqui\u2019s argument that the IJ and BIA wrongly decided that he did not meet the necessary hardship standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">As to the due process argument, after Yupanqui filed his brief in this appeal, we held in <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228 (3d Cir.2003), that \u201cthe BIA could have articulated its reasons for affirming the IJ\u2019s order, but just because it had the power to do so, does not mean the Constitution required it to exercise that power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240. We concluded that a \u201cmeaningful review\u201d is established as long as either the BIA <em>or </em>the IJ \u201cput forth a sufficiently reasoned opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243. The IJ\u2019s opinion here meets that standard. Hence, with <em>Dia </em>as controlling precedent in this circuit, Yupanqui\u2019s due process argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">For the aforementioned reasons, we will deny Yupanqui\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\">. We will not discuss the facts because we write only for the parties and they are familiar with them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
