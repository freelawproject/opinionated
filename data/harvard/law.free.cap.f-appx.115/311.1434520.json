Beahn claimed that she was wrongfully terminated from her position as product manager a little over a month after she reported her pregnant condition to a supervisor and that the company then wrongfully failed to re-hire her in another position. The defendant contended that the plaintiff had not established a prima facie case of discrimination and also introduced evidence to show that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for eliminating Beahn\u2019s position during a major reduction in force and organizational restructure following CompuServe\u2019s purchase by AOL. The company also claimed that its human resources manager had attempted \u2014 unsuccessfully\u2014to place Beahn in another position with CompuServe.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The district court held that Beahn had established a prima facie case but that she had not rebutted the defendant\u2019s non-discriminatory reason for her layoff and the failure to place her in another position. Having had the benefit of oral argument, and having studied the record on appeal and the briefs of the parties, we are not persuaded that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint. Because the reasons why judgment should be entered for the defendant have been fully articulated by the district court, the issuance of a detailed opinion by this court would be duplicative and would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court upon the reasoning set out by that court in its order and opinion entered on September 30, 2002, and its opinion and order entered on October 29, 2003.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
