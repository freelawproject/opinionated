Prieto argues that he is entitled to damages because he was illegally-convicted of sexually molesting two teenaged boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Prieto is challenging the validity of his conviction, and he has not demonstrated that his conviction has been reversed, questioned, or declared invalid. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Prieto\u2019s complaint as frivolous. <em>See Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Prieto\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Prieto is warned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous constitutes a \u201cstrike\u201d and that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous also counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Prieto is cautioned that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b793-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
