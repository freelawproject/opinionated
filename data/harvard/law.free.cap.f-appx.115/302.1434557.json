Spinella v. Savoretti </em>201 F.2d 364, 364 (5th Cir.1953). The district court properly denied Okpoju\u2019s claim regarding his continued detention as premature because, at the time of the district court\u2019s ruling, Okpoju had not yet been in custody longer than the presumptively reasonable six-month post removal order period. <em>See Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-23\">Okpoju\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations and interpretation of the evidence are not of constitutional magnitude so as to warrant habeas relief. <em>See Toscano-Gil v. Trominski, </em>210 F.3d 470, 473-74 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States ex rel. Tisi v. Tod, </em>264 U.S. 131, 134, 44 S.Ct. 260, 68 L.Ed. 590 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-24\">Okpoju\u2019s request that we remand for consideration of his 1-130 application is raised for the first time on appeal and we will not consider it. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-25\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Okpoju\u2019s motion for stay of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>his removal pending the outcome of his appeal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
