Reed alleged in his complaint that he suffered injuries when the defendant backed a van, in which Reed was riding, into a metal pole. The negligent act of an official causing loss or injury will not, standing alone, state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Coon v. Ledbetter, 780 </em>F.2d 1158, 1163 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-24\">Reed contends for the first time on appeal that Officer Moore acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment by denying him medical treatment in order to \u201ckeep the accident from being documented.\u201d Although Reed did contend in the district court that he was denied medical treatment at the Robertson Unit at the time of the accident, as to Officer Moore, he alleged only that Moore told him not to complain if he wanted to reach his destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-25\">Reed\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, 707 </em>F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cik. R. 42.2. We caution Reed that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). If Reed accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b771-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
