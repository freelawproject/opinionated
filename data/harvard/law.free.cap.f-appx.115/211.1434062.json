Montgomery argues that, because the gun was not loaded and evidence of drug dealing or drug-related activities was not present, the district court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>when it increased his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). Inasmuch as Montgomery does not contest that he had a prior felony or that he possessed a firearm in a bag with cocaine, his argument is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1199-2000 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 231 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1081, 124 S.Ct. 942, 157 L.Ed.2d 757 (2003) .</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Montgomery\u2019s argument that the district court committed plain error when it enhanced his sentence based on facts not alleged in the indictment, proven to a jury, or proven beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004)(No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Montgomery\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.,5 the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
