Garcia argues, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number><em>Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are elements of the offense, not sentence enhancements, making those provisions unconstitutional. He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but raises it for possible review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><em>\u201cApprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres.\u201d United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348. We must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it. <em>See Rivera, </em>265 F.3d at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Garcia also argues that if <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applies to the United States Sentencing Guidelines his sentence could not be enhanced based on any prior convictions unless he admitted to them or they were found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b769-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
