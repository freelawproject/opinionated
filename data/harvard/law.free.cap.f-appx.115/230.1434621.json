Garcia argues that the district court clearly erred by failing to award him a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) for having a minor role in the offense. He argues that he was merely a drug courier who was to be paid a small fee for driving a car containing marihuana across the border from Mexico into the United States. He contends that other participants in the offense were more culpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-22\">Garcia admitted to contacting the man who hired him as a courier, as well as to accompanying this man to purchase the vehicle in which the drugs were hidden. Garcia knew that the vehicle contained drugs and that he was to deliver the vehicle to an individual in the United States and was to be paid for his efforts. The district court did not clearly err by denying Garcia an adjustment for playing a minor role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 713 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 137-38 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
