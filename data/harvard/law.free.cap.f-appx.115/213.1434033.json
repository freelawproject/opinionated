He argues that his sentence should be vacated in view of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). As part of his plea agreement, Popoca waived the right to appeal his sentence \u201cexcept ... a sentence imposed above the statutory maximum and an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines not requested by the United States.\u201d At the rearraignment hearing, the district court expressly advised Popoca of the waiver provision, and Popoca stated that he understood and did not express confusion or ask any questions concerning the waiver provision. Therefore, Popoca knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence, and the waiver is valid and enforceable. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). Even if Popoca\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim is not precluded by the waiver provision, the issue is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004)(No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"Apb\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
