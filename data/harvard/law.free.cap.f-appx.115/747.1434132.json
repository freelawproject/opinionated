The district court dismissed the complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Guajardo contends that he was not required to pursue administrative remedies because the Texas grievance system offers no avenue to make a statewide challenge to prison rules. He also argues that the district court should have required the defendants to answer his complaint and that the district court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The exhaustion requirement is mandatory and applies to all inmate suits regardless of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative remedies. <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003). The district court did not err in dismissing Guajardo\u2019s suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The district court was not required to obtain a response from the defendants pri- or to dismissing Guajardo\u2019s complaint. <em>See Wendell v. Asher, </em>162 F.3d 887, 889-90 (5th Cir.1998). Nor was the district court required to conduct an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.1998). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b781-43\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
