Berman, <em>Judge). On </em>appeal Wheeler argues that the district court erred in 1) allowing the government, on cross-examination, to ask him about the purpose of proffer sessions he had with federal prosecutors; <em>2) </em>admitting evidence of various prior \u201cbad acts\u201d allegedly committed by Wheeler; 3) allowing an SEC attorney to testify that \"Wheeler had, during an interview, \u201casserted a privilege\u201d in response to questions about his income; and 4) imposing a sentence that was unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Familiarity with the facts and proceedings below is assumed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We address each of the foregoing points in turn. As to his first argument, \"Wheeler did not object at trial to the government\u2019s questions regarding the purpose of the proffer sessions; we therefore review the admission of those questions for plain error. <em>See United States v. Nucci, </em>364 F.3d 419, 421 (2d Cir.2004). Given the context in which the questions were asked, \"Wheeler\u2019s testimony that he did not intend to plead guilty in meeting with the government, and the substantial evidence of \"Wheeler\u2019s guilt offered at trial, we conclude that if there was error at all, it was not plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Second, we review the district court\u2019s admission of prior \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence over Wheeler\u2019s objection for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. LaFlam, </em>369 F.3d 153, 155 (2d Cir.2004). We find that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence, as the evidence plausibly tended, at the very least, to establish that American Healthcare\u2019s financial statements had not been audited in 1998, that those statements did not accurately reflect the financial condition of the company, and that Wheeler was aware of this fact. Regarding challenged testimony to which Wheeler did not object at trial, we review for plain error, and find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Nor do we do not find reversible error with respect to Wheeler\u2019s third contention, concerning testimony by the SEC attorney. The revelation that Wheeler had \u201casserted a privilege\u201d first came as a measured response to a rather pointed question by Wheeler\u2019s own lawyer. While the government did ask a brief follow-up question on the matter, and while Wheeler did at that point lodge an objection, the witness\u2019s response revealed nothing beyond that which had already emerged from his testimony on cross-examination. In light of all the other evidence offered at trial, moreover, this testimony did not ultimately prejudice Wheeler\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Finally, Wheeler challenges his sentence on the grounds that it is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington. </em>We recently decided, however, that we would adhere to the existing law of the Circuit until the Supreme Court determines that its reasoning in <em>Blakely </em>applies to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Mincey, </em>380 F.3d 102, 106 (2d Cir.2004). Thus, we affirm the sentence imposed on Wheeler by the district court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 664 (2d Cir.2001) (in banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">We have carefully considered Wheeler\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">The mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 11, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>(mem.), and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 12, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004) (mem.). Should any party believe there is a special need for the district court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Athough any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Court will not reconsider those portions of its opinion that address the defendant\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until 14 days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
