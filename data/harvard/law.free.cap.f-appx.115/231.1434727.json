Pettry argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by enhancing his offense level for manufacturing an unregistered firearm on the basis that Pettry manufactured the firearm in connection with another felony offense. Pettry argues that the sentence enhancement is erroneous in light of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.4), because his sentence for manufacturing a firearm is to be served consecutively to his sentence for using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Pettry\u2019s sentence for manufacturing an unregistered firearm was not enhanced based on his use of a firearm, but because he manufactured the device in connection with the felony offense of manufacturing methamphetamine. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s sentencing determination. <em>United States v.
