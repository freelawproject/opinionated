He argues that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel when (1) counsel\u2019s alleged miscalculation of the sentence exposure under the terms of the proposed plea offer led Greer to reject the plea and (2) counsel failed to object to the district court\u2019s omission of the requested jury instruction on eyewitness identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-24\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel generally cannot be addressed on direct appeal unless the claim has been presented to the district court. <em>United States v. Navejar, </em>963 F.2d 732, 735 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see also Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 505, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). We resolve claims of inadequate representation on direct appeal only in \u201crare\u201d cases where the record allows a fair evaluation of the claim\u2019s merits; Greer\u2019s is not such a case. <em>See Navejar, </em>963 F.2d at 735. The record is devoid of the factual development necessary to determine whether but for counsel\u2019s alleged miscalculation of Greer\u2019s sentence exposure, Greer would have accepted the Government\u2019s plea offer and received a lesser sentence and, additionally, the reasons underlying counsel\u2019s alleged omission in failing to object to the jury charge. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). These issues are therefore best raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
