The sentence was increased for Thompson\u2019s felonious possession of crack cocaine in connection with the firearm offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-18\">The record plainly establishes that Thompson agreed with the Government\u2019s \u201cFactual Basis\u201d which stated that the Government \u201cwould prove\u201d possession of both the firearm and the drugs. Further, the PSR contained sufficient indicia of reliability to establish drug possession, and Thompson offered nothing to show that the PSR was \u201cmaterially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ayala, </em>47 F.3d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">Thompson also contends that the increased sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He concedes that this challenge is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464 (5th Cir.2004), and he raises the issue only to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. <em>Blakely </em>would afford Thompson no relief in any event because Thompson admitted the drug possession when he agreed with the factual basis recited in open court. <em>See Blakely, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 124 S.Ct. at 2537 (admission by defendant supports sentence increase).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-24\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
