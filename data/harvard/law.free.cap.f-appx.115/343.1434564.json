We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding and will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-22\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision. Isayan\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his asylum application. The discrepancies relate to the basis of his alleged fear of persecution and go to the heart of his asylum claim. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-23\">By failing to qualify for asylum, Isayan necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 961 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b377-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
