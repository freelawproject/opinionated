He argues that the district court plainly erred by characterizing his state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), when that same offense was punishable only as a misdemeanor under federal law. This issue, however, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>foreclosed by <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691 (5th Cir.1997), and, therefore, Vences has not demonstrated plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Vences concedes that the issue whether the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and he raises it solely to preserve its further review by the Supreme Court. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348. This court must therefore follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Accordingly, Vence\u2019s arguments are foreclosed, and his conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. We REMAND to the district court for correction of the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 36 to reflect that Vences was convicted of a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 for attempted illegal reentry, not illegal reentry, into the United States after deportation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
