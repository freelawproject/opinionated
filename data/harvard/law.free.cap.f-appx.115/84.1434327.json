(\u201cCatalina\u201d) owns Patent No. 4,674,041 (\u201cthe \u2019041 patent\u201d) entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Controlling the Distribution of Coupons.\u201d The Catalina device was intended to oversee the distribution of coupons from electronic terminals at the point of sale. Coolsavings.com, Inc. (\u201cCoolsavings\u201d) runs an Internet web site that uses inputted user demographic information to target coupon offers for various products to potential customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">Catalina sued Coolsavings in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for infringement of claim 1 of the \u2019041 patent. The district court conducted a <em>Markman </em>hearing and construed key claim terms. After the district court\u2019s claim construction order was issued, Catalina conceded that it could not prove infringement given the district court\u2019s claim construction and stipulated to a dismissal of its infringement complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">Catalina now appeals the dismissal, challenging the district court\u2019s claim construction ruling to this court. Because we find no error in the district court\u2019s claim construction, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b119-19\">Claim 1 of the \u2019041 patent recites a coupon-dispensing terminal that comprises, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-20\"><em>activation means </em>for activating [the] terminal for consumer transactions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>display means <em>operatively connected </em>with said activation means for displaying a plurality of coupons available for selection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\"><em>selection means operatively connected </em>with [a] display means provided to permit selection of a desired displayed coupon by the consumer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">print means <em>operatively connected </em>with [the] selection means</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">control means <em>operatively connected </em>with [a] display means ... for controlling [the] display means to prevent the display of coupons having exceeded <em>prescribed coupon limits.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u2019041 patent col. 30, ll. 50-65 (claim terms at issue underlined).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Coolsavings runs an Internet web site that seeks to target product promotions to users of its site by using demographic data provided by the users. Coolsavings.com users access the web site through personal computer terminals. Once users choose the offers that appeal most to them, they are invited to print coupons from their local computer printers.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">In 1999, Catalina brought suit against Coolsavings for infringement of the \u2019041 patent. In 2001, the district court granted summary judgment to Coolsavings, finding noninfringement on the grounds that parts of the preambles to claim 1 and claim 25 were claim limitations. Catalina appealed that judgment to this court, which affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part and remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>Catalina Mktg. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Coolsavings.com, Inc., </em>289 F.3d 801 (Fed.Cir.2002) <em>(\u201cCatalina </em>/\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">In our 2002 opinion, we held that the preamble phrase \u201clocated at predesignated sites such as consumer stores\u201d was not a claim limitation of claim 1 of the \u2019041 patent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id. at 810. Accordingly, we vacated the district court\u2019s noninfringement judgment based on its then erroneous construction of claim 1 and remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 813-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">Following our remand, the district court held another <em>Markman </em>hearing. On remand, Catalina continued to press its claim that Coolsavings infringed claim 1 of the \u2019041 patent. In addition, Catalina also joined Landmark Communications, Inc. and Landmark Ventures VII, Inc. (collectively referred to as \u201cLandmark\u201d) as co-defendants based on a theory of alter ego liability. In its June 25, 2003 claim construction order, the district court determined that another term in the preamble to claim 1 was not a limitation on the claim and also construed the claim terms \u201cactivation means,\u201d \u201cs\u00e9lection means,\u201d \u201coperatively connected,\u201d and \u201cprescribed coupon limits.\u201d <em>Catalina Mktg. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Coolsavings.com, Inc., </em>No. 00 C 2447, slip op. at 7-21 (N.D. Ill. June 25, 2003) (\u201cDistrict Court Opinion\u201d). In addition, on July 2, 2003, the district court granted Landmark\u2019s 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. District Court Opinion at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">After Catalina conceded that it could not prove infringement of claim 1 of the \u2019041 patent based on the district court\u2019s claim construction, the district court accepted the stipulated dismissal of the case agreed to by Catalina, Coolsavings, and Landmark.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">Catalina now appeals. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The district court\u2019s claim construction of \u201cactivation means,\u201d \u201cselection means,\u201d \u201cprescribed coupon limits,\u201d and \u201coperatively connected\u201d are at issue in this case. Also at issue is the district court\u2019s determination that the preamble to claim 1 is not a limitation of claim 1. If the district court\u2019s claim construction is affirmed, then, pursuant to Catalina\u2019s stipulation, Coolsavings cannot be infringing the \u2019041 patent. If Coolsavings does not infringe the \u2019041 patent, then the jurisdictional arguments raised by Catalina in regards to Landmark become moot as Catalina has only alleged a derivative (and not an independent) theory of liability in regards to Landmark.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Claim construction is an issue of law that is reviewed de novo. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Tech, Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1456 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc). Determining whether a preamble constitutes a limitation is a matter of claim construction that is likewise reviewed de novo. <em>See, e.g., Catalina I, </em>289 F.3d at 807-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">A. \u201cActivation means\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The district court construed the term \u201cactivation means for activating such terminal for consumer transactions\u201d as a means-plus-function term under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, 116 and found that the function of the term is \u201cactivating the terminal for consumer transactions.\u201d District Court Opinion at 8. The court then examined the \u2019041 patent specification and identified the corresponding structure to be a magnetic card reader. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">While not disputing the district court\u2019s determination of the limitation\u2019s function, Catalina argues that the corresponding structure for the \u201cactivation means\u201d limitation should be the \u201casynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART)\u201d which sends the interrupt signal which activates the disclosed invention for consumer transactions. <em>See </em>\u2019041 patent col. 7, 11. 42-54. Catalina asserts that the \u2019041 patent identifies an activator that contains three major components \u2014 a \u201ccard reading apparatus,\u201d a \u201cconventional card reader interface,\u201d and the UART. It argues that only the UART should be considered corresponding structure to the \u201cactivation means\u201d term because only the UART sends the interrupt signal that activates its disclosed device.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">We disagree with Catalina and agree with the district court that the corresponding structure to the \u201cactivation means\u201d is a magnetic card reader. The specification contains numerous references to a magnetic card reader in connection with the \u201cactivation means\u201d limitation. <em>See </em>\u2019041 patent col. 5,11. 38-58; col. 7,11. 42-49. It is clear in the specification that what \u201cactivates\u201d the disclosed terminal for consumer transactions is \u201cactivator A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 5, 1. 43. Furthermore, as the specification notes, \u201cActivator A is a conventional magnetic card reading apparatus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 5, 11. 45-46. Finally, neither the specification nor the prosecution history identifies any other structure as the \u201cactivation means\u201d for the terminal disclosed in claim 1 of the \u2019041 patent. It is therefore clear from the specification that the structure corresponding to the \u201cactivation means\u201d is a magnetic card reader.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s construction of the \u201cactivation means\u201d limitation found in claim 1 of the \u2019041 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">B. \u201cSelection means\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">The district court determined that the function of the \u201cselection means operatively connected with said display means provided to permit selection of a desired displayed coupon by the consumer\u201d limitation was \u201cto permit selection of a desired displayed coupon by the consumer.\u201d Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>trict Court Opinion at 13. Relying on the specification and the prosecution history, the court then determined that the corresponding structure to the \u201cselection means\u201d limitation is a touch screen. <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">On appeal, Catalina argues that the district court improperly altered the claim term \u201cto permit selection\u201d to \u201cpermitting the consumer to make a selection\u201d and maintains that this change led the district court to incorrectly identify a touch screen as the \u201cselection means\u201d limitation\u2019s corresponding structure. Catalina urges this court to identify the UART, which sends the interrupt signal to the microprocessor, as the \u201cselection means.\u201d We agree with the district court and find Catalina\u2019s argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The claim limitation itself states that the \u201cselection means\u201d is intended \u201cto permit selection of a desired displayed coupon <em>by the consumer. </em>\u201d \u2019041 patent col. 30,11. 55-57 (emphasis added). Therefore, contrary to Catalina\u2019s assertion, the district court did not \u201calter\u201d anything in its claim construction. Furthermore, as was the case for \u201cactivation means,\u201d the corresponding structure for the \u201cselection means\u201d limitation is the entire structure that permits selection of a coupon \u2014 and not the minute substructure that enables the last step involved with selection of a coupon.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Moreover, the only structure that corresponds to the selection means in the specification is a touch screen. As the specification itself states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\"><em>Coupons are displayed for customer selection at each dispensing terminal on a video menu via a cathode ray tube and touch screen combination </em>in a fashion which enhances customer acceptance by reducing the time necessary to select and obtain coupons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u2019041 patent col. 2, 11. 8-12 (emphasis added). The preferred embodiment likewise identifies a touch screen in discussing the means by which customers can select the coupons that interest them. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">Customer interface display I includes a conventional cathode ray tube 28 for displaying the video menu of coupons available for selection as well as other video graphics, such as advertisements, in response to signals received from microcomputer 22. <em>Overlaying cathode ray tube 28 is a transparent, touch sensitive screen SO which includes an array of touch activated switches arranged in a regular array to overlay particular coupons displayed on cathode ray tube 28. </em>In the preferred embodiment, a screen having an array of thirty-two (32) switches such as the Model Number TK120S manufactured by Interaction Systems, Inc. is used. Other commonly available and suitable touch sensitive screens may also be employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">\u2019041 patent col. 5, 11. 8-21 (emphasis added). No structure other than a \u201ctouch screen\u201d or \u201ctouch sensitive screen\u201d is identified as a selection means in the specification. And no other structure allows for the \u201cselection\u201d of coupons.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s claim construction of the \u201cselection means\u201d limitation is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">C. \u201cPrescribed coupon limits\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">The district court construed \u201cprescribed coupon limits\u201d as being \u201cpredetermined limits on the number of coupons collectively and per store.\u201d District Court Opinion at 20. On appeal, Catalina argues that the district court\u2019s construction is too limiting. Instead, it argues that \u201cprescribed coupon limits\u201d should have been construed as the \u201cdesignated maximum quantity or number\u201d of coupons. Catalina\u2019s argument, however, is refuted by the prosecution history of the \u2019041 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>During the course of prosecuting the \u2019041 patent, the named inventors amended the term \u201cprescribed coupon criteria\u201d in their original patent application to \u201cprescribed coupon limits.\u201d Going further, they stated that, according to the specification, the term \u201cprescribed coupon criteria\u201d was \u201cexemplified by the per store limits, the per day limits and the per customer limits as indicated.\u201d District Court Opinion at 20. In explaining their amendment to claim 1, they stated that, \u201cClaim 1 has been amended and the phrase \u2018prescribed coupon criteria\u2019 has been replaced by \u2018prescribed coupon limits\u2019 which may more effectively communicate the same idea.\u201d Id What the inventors represented to the patent examiner at the time of prosecution Catalina cannot now retract.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s construction of \u201cprescribed coupon limits\u201d is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">D. \u201cOperatively connected\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The district court construed the claim term \u201coperatively connected\u201d to mean \u201cjoined or linked together to produce the designed effect.\u201d District Court Opinion at 20. The court also held that the \u201coperatively connected\u201d limitation, when read in light of the \u2019041 patent specification, should be construed to mean \u201cjoined or linked together to produce the designed effect <em>within the terminal.\u201d Id </em>at 21 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Catalina challenges this construction, arguing that the district court improperly imported \u201cwithin the terminal\u201d into the \u201coperatively connected\u201d limitation. Catalina argues that the plain and ordinary meaning of the \u201coperatively connected\u201d limitation is not restricted to operative connections only within the coupon-dispensing terminal. We are not persuaded by Catalina\u2019s argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">The language of claim 1 itself describes \u201c[a] syste[m] ... wherein <em>each terminal comprises\u201d </em>the device recited by the claim 1 limitations. \u2019041 patent col. 30, 11. 46-49 (emphasis added). It is within those limitations that the \u201coperatively connected\u201d term is used. Furthermore, the patent specification itself often refers to the disclosed invention as a \u201cstand alone coupon dispensing terminal.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>\u2019041 patent col. 2,11. 5-7. Clearly, the language of the claims and the intrinsic evidence supports the district court\u2019s construction of the \u201coperatively connected\u201d term in claim 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s construction of \u201coperatively connected\u201d is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">E. Preamble to claim 1</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">The district court held that certain preamble language in claim 1 is not a limitation of claim 1. District Court Opinion at 7. Specifically, it found the preamble language \u201c[a] syste[m] for controlling the selection and dispensing of product coupons at a plurality of remote terminals\u201d to be unnecessary to the understanding of the terms or limitations in the body of claim 1. <em>Id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">Catalina challenges the district court\u2019s ruling on this issue, arguing that the preamble phrase is a limitation because it is crucial to understanding what it is the \u2019041 patent inventors invented. Specifically, Catalina urges that the preamble be construed as a limitation requiring \u201ccontrolling the selection and dispensing of product coupons at a plurality of remote terminals.\u201d Furthermore, it asks this court to find the corresponding structure to be a host central processing unit, a modem, and a plurality of remote terminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">A claim\u2019s preamble can be considered a claim limitation when it is \u201cnecessary to give life, meaning and vitality\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>claim. <em>Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>182 F.3d 1298, 1305 (Fed.Cir.1999). On the other hand, if the preamble \u201coffers no distinct definition of any of the claimed invention\u2019s limitations, but rather merely states ... the purpose or intended use of the invention,\u201d then the preamble cannot be read as a limitation on a claim. <em>Id. </em>As we stated in our previous decision in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">[A] preamble limits the invention if it recites essential structure or steps, or if it is necessary to give life, meaning, and vitality to the claim. Conversely, a preamble is not limiting where a patentee defines a structurally complete invention in the claim body and uses the preamble only to state a purpose or intended use for the invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><em>Catalina I, </em>289 F.3d at 808 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Reading the preamble to claim 1, it is clear it is intended to summarize the invention and its purpose and not to give any information that is indispensable to understanding the invention recited by claim 1. Specifically, the preamble does not offer any details, structure or description that would aid one of skill in the art in understanding what is being covered by the limitations of claim 1. Therefore, we find that the preamble language in claim 1 of the \u2019041 patent is not a limitation of claim 1. Consequently, the district court\u2019s determination that the claim 1 preamble phrase \u201cA syste[m] for controlling the selection and dispensing of product coupons at a plurality of remote terminals\u201d is not a limitation on claim 1 is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">F. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">In its stipulation to a dismissal before the district court, Catalina itself conceded that if the district court\u2019s claim construction were upheld, Coolsavings\u2019 accused device could not be infringing the \u2019041 patent. Since Landmark\u2019s liability is only derivative of the liability of Coolsavings, Landmark cannot now be liable to Catalina for infringement of the \u2019041 patent under any theory of liability advanced by Catalina. Therefore, Catalina\u2019s jurisdictional arguments regarding Landmark are moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">For the aforementioned reasons, the district court\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-10\">. We also noted, however, that since that term was used in both the preamble and the body of claim 25, it was a limitation on claim 25. <em>Id. </em>at 811.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-10\">. In addition, we deny Landmark\u2019s Rule 38 motion for the imposition of sanctions against Catalina.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
