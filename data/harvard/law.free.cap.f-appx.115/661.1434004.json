Trujillo argued that 1996 deportation proceedings against him were constitutionally deficient and thus \u201cto use the results of my deportation hearing in this present case to prove [the illegal-reentry] element of [\u00a7 ] 1326 violates my right to due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-26\">Concluding that Trujillo\u2019s petition amounted to a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his illegal-reentry conviction and that Trujillo had filed a prior \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the conviction, the district court dismissed the petition as an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its determinations on issues of law de novo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Whereas 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provides the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal conviction and sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 ordinarily is used to challenge the manner in which a sentence is being executed. <em>Id.; Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900-01 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cA petition filed under \u00a7 2241 which attacks errors that occurred at trial or sentencing is properly construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Trujillo argues that he is entitled to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because the only relief he seeks is judicial review of the 1996 deportations proceedings. A petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 for a writ of habeas corpus is a proper avenue for challenging the legality of an order of deportation. <em>See Bravo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 590 (5th Cir.2003). However, Trujillo cites no authority for his novel assertion that a petitioner may challenge the legality of a deportation order by reentering the country without authorization and, upon being convicted for illegal reentry, filing a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging the prior deportation proceedings. Moreover, Trujillo clearly challenged the illegal-reentry conviction in his petition. Trujillo never responded to the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, nor did he otherwise challenge the Government\u2019s characterization of his petition. The district court did not err by dismissing the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition as an unauthorized \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Trujillo\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b695-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
