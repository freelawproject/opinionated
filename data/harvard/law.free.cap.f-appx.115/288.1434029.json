Guardado argues that the district court erred by finding that his California felony convictions for possession of cocaine and possession of a controlled substance were aggravated felonies for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), because his offenses were punishable only as misdemeanors under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Guardado\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 694 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, Guardado\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
