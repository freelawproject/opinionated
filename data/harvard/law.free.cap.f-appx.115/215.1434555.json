He contends that these defendants should be held hable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 because they conspired with Officer Baldwin to violate his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">A private party may be held hable under \u00a7 1983 if he or she is a willful participant in a joint activity with the state or its agents. <em>Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1343 (5th Cir.1994). Because Banks has failed to point to any evidence of record that would undermine the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that the private party defendants were not willful participants in a joint activity with Officer Baldwin, he has failed to show error. <em>See id.; Canal Barge Co., Inc. v. Torco Oil Co., </em>220 F.3d 370, 375 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Banks contends that he has been denied \u201cprocedural due process of the law and equal immunities of the law.\u201d However, Banks fails to specify what acts or omissions of the district court or magistrate judge violated his constitutional rights. He has therefore failed to brief the issue adequately. <em>See Al-Ra'id v. Ingle, </em>69 F.3d 28, 31 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Banks takes issue with the magistrate judge\u2019s grant of qualified immunity to Officer Baldwin. He also contends that the magistrate judge erred in denying his motion for a default judgment against William Bryant.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">An appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument with his \u201ccontentions and reasons for them with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Fed. RApp. P. 28(a)(9); <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). General arguments giving only broad standards of review and not citing to specific errors are insufficient to preserve issues for appeal. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Banks fails to identify any factual or legal error in the magistrate judge\u2019s grant of qualified immunity to Officer Baldwin, or in the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a default judgment as to Bryant, he has failed to brief these issues for appeal adequately. <em>See </em>Rule 28(a)(9); <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Athough this court applies less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel and liberally construes briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants, <em>pro se </em>parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the requirements of Rule 28. <em>See Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Ml outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
