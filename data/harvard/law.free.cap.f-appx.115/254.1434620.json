The district court sentenced Trejo to thirty-five months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-22\">Trejo asserts that the district court plainly erred by characterizing his state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). Trejo\u2019s argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-23\">Trejo contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) are unconstitutional. He asserts that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Trejo acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. As Trejo concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263); <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, 33</em>1 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
