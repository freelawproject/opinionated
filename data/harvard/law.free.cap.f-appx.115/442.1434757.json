Jones, requests that this court review a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) denying his petition for review. <em>Jones v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>Docket No. AT844E030516-I-1 (June 25, 2004) <em>(\u201cJones II\u201d). </em>Because the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">In its initial decision, the Board denied Mr. Jones\u2019s request for disability annuity benefits under the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cFERS\u201d). The Board\u2019s administrative judge denied the petitioner FERS benefits because the record in this case establishes that the petitioner only worked as an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs for three and one half months. <em>Jones v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>Docket No. AT844E030516I-1, slip op. at 1 (June 2, 2003) <em>{\u201cJones </em>I\u201d). Under the FERS statute, an employee must have completed at least 18 months of service in order to qualify for disability retirement benefits. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8451(a)(1)(A) (2004). Because the petitioner could not establish that he had served at least 18 months in the Department of Veterans Affairs, his appeal from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s denial of disability benefits was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Jones I, </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-19\">The full Board denied the petitioner\u2019s petition for review of the administrative judge\u2019s initial decision because no new evidence that had been previously unavailable was presented to the Board. <em>Jones II, </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-20\">We can only set aside a Board decision if it is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-21\">1. arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-22\">2. obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-23\">3. unsupported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIJ\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-24\">In his petition to this court, Mir. Jones does not allege that the Board\u2019s decision is covered by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(e)(l)-(2). To 'the extent that he argues that the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, we disagree. The evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the record clearly establishes that Mr. Jones began his employment at the Department of Veterans Affairs on November 22, 1987 and resigned on March 9, 1988. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s decision is affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
