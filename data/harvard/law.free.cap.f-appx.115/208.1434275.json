The district court denied Edwards\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-23\">Individuals have a federal right to challenge their extradition by writ of habeas corpus in the courts of the asylum state prior to being extradited. <em>Crumley v. Snead, </em>620 F.2d 481, 483 (5th Cir.1980). The scope of such a habeas challenge is narrow. <em>Id. </em>Once the Governor of Texas granted extradition, the district court could decide only whether the extradition documents are in order, whether Edwards had been charged with a crime in California, and whether Edwards was the person named in the request for extradition. <em>See Michigan v. Doran, </em>439 U.S. 282, 289-90, 99 S.Ct. 530, 58 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Edwards has not shown that the district court erred in any of these determinations. All of Edwards\u2019s other claims are beyond the scope of the district court\u2019s review. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Edwards\u2019s motion to expedite is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Edwards asserts that the final judgment lists the wrong party as the respondent. The error is clerical and did not affect the substance of the court\u2019s denial of Edwards\u2019s habeas application. The matter is REMANDED to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the caption on the final judgment issued March 26, 2004. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a); Fed.R.CivP. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED; REMANDED FOR CORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERROR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
