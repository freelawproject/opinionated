HEL-TON was sentenced to 168 months in prison based on the district court\u2019s factual finding that he was responsible for at least 500 grams, but less than 1.5 kilograms of methamphetamine. Helton argues that the district court clearly erred in relying on the unsworn statements given by his coconspirators to law enforcement officers regarding the amount of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">A sentencing court may consider \u201cinformation [having] sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). This language \u201crequire[s] that the facts used by the district court for sentencing purposes be reasonably reliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>1 F.3d 341, 344 (5th Cir.1993). \u201cSworn testimony given by a government agent at a sentencing hearing generally bears sufficient indicia of reliability to be considered by the trial judge during sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>12 F.3d 1350, 1372 (5th Cir.1994). The district court is not barred from considering the agent\u2019s testimony despite the fact that an agent\u2019s testimony was based on information obtained from the defendant\u2019s coconspirators. <em>Thomas, </em>12 F.3d at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">In this case, former DEA Special Agent Blair testified that he received specific information from specific coconspirators regarding specific numbers of methamphetamine \u201ccooks,\u201d in which specific amounts of the drug were manufactured. Blair testified that the information coming from Helton\u2019s coconspirators was consistent in both the scope of Helton\u2019s activity and in the description of the manufacture of methamphetamine. Other than to make a general attack on the reliability of unsworn statements from coconspirators, Helton has not shown that the evidence relied on by the district court was not reasonably reliable. <em>See Rogers, </em>1 F.3d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-16\">Helton argues that his sentence is illegal, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because the quantity of drugs used to determine his sentence was not deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>mined by a jury or included in his plea. This issue is foreclosed by the court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 14, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Helton\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b722-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
