On April 26, 2001, Long entered a guilty plea to simple assault in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 113(a)(5), 1152, and was sentenced to a two-year term of probation. A petition for revocation of his probation was filed in November 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-21\">For the first time, after the filing of the revocation petition, Long argued the government lacked the authority to prosecute him under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152 because he is an Indian. Long\u2019s guilty plea waived his jurisdictional challenge. The alleged jurisdictional defect was not clear from the face of the information at the time that Long pled guilty. <em>United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 575-76, 109 S.Ct. 757, 765-66, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989); <em>United States v.
