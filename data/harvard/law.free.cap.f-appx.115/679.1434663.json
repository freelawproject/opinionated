Dimas argues that because he filed a motion for an extension of time to file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition before the expiration of the limitations period, the instant petition is timely. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>He further avers that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period because the magistrate judge, in denying the motion for extension of time as unnecessary, stated that he had until March 6, 2003, to file a timely 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. He argues that he was misled into believing that he had until that date to file his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The one-year limitations period of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) may be subject to equitable tolling \u201cin rare and exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Davis v. Johnson, </em>158 F.3d 806, 811 (5th Cir.1998). It \u201capplies principally where the plaintiff is actively misled by the defendant about the cause of action or is prevented in some extraordinary way from asserting his rights.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A district court\u2019s refusal to invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Molo v. Johnson, </em>207 F.3d 773, 775 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The record shows that on April 15, 2002, and before the expiration of the limitations period, Dimas filed his motion for extension of time to file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. The motion was not ruled on until July 1, 2002, after the expiration of limitations period. The magistrate judge, in denying the motion as unnecessary, stated that Dimas had until March 6, 2003, to file a timely habeas petition. Dimas\u2019s current petition was filed before that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We conclude that Dimas has shown rare and exceptional circumstances warranting the tolling of the limitations period and that reasonable jurists would conclude that the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was incorrect. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>211 F.3d 927, 929 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Accordingly, a COA is hereby GRANTED. The district court\u2019s judgment denying Dimas\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred is hereby VACATED, and this case is REMANDED to the district court for consideration of the constitutional claims set forth in Dimas\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">GRANT COA; VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b713-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
