At the time he pleaded guilty, Disiere was serving a five-year state sentence for his 1999 conviction for burglary of a habitation. Additionally, a 30-month federal sentence was pending against Disiere for his conviction in 2000 for making threats against the President of the United States. Disiere appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 claim that he should have been transferred to federal custody to serve his federal sentence upon completion of serving his first state sentence for burglary of a habitation. Because Disiere is challenging only the denial of relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, he is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability (COA). Therefore, his motion for a COA is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Disiere has remained in state custody and is serving his second state sentence even though it was imposed after his federal sentence was imposed. Disiere argues that his federal sentence should not have been postponed and, citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a), that the district court relied on outdated law in dismissing his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Disiere\u2019s contentions are without merit. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a); <em>Free v. Miles, </em>333 F.3d 550, 552 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Causey v. Civiletti, </em>621 F.2d 691, 694 (5th Cir.1980). Therefore, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
