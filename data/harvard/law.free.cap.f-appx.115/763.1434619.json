Section 1140 states that \u201c[n]o person may use, in connection with any item constituting an advertisement, solicitation, circular, book, pamphlet, or other communication ... [prohibited words] in a manner which such person knows or should know would convey, or in a manner which reasonably could be interpreted or construed as conveying, the false impression that such item is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the Social Security Administration....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320b-10(a). In an initial review, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found both that NFRP knew or should have known the mailers could create a false impression as to their origin, and that a reasonable person could have been similarly misled by the solicitations; in particular, the mailers included numerous mentions of \u201cSSA\u201d, \u201cSocial Security\u201d, and \u201cSSI\u201d, and displayed images, such as the Capitol building, typically associated with governmental bodies. The DAB affirmed this ruling, finding that there were not sufficient countervailing features of the mailers to override its otherwise misleading nature and rejecting challenges to the ALJ\u2019s legal test.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-22\">In this appeal, NFRP renews its argument that the ALJ\u2019s legal conclusions were not justified under the statute. For the cogent reasons given by the DAB, we reject NFRP\u2019s contention. By faffing to point to any feature of the mailers that undermines the DAB\u2019s factual conclusions, NFRP implicitly concedes that part of the DAB\u2019s order. Finally, we reject NFRP\u2019s argument that section 1140 is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. <em>See J &amp; B Entm\u2019t, Inc. v. City of Jackson, Miss., </em>152 F.3d 362, 367 n. 6 (5th Cir.1998) (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number><em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-09, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972)). Consequently, the DAB\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b797-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
