James subsequently amended her complaint several times, eventually non-suiting her claim against Allen, adding plaintiff Terri Lary, and adding the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) as a defendant. James and Lary (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) also sought certification of two classes under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). After conducting a hearing on Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class certifications in October 1999, the district court entered an order certifying two classes under Rule 23(b)(2), one of which was based on due process claims and the other on racial discrimination grounds. The City appealed the district court\u2019s certification determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">A panel of this Court modified the number of claims for which the Plaintiffs could potentially recover under the due process class and concluded that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing to seek the relief requested for the race discrimination class. <em>James v. City of Dallas, </em>254 F.3d 551, 573 (5th Cir.2001) <em>{\u201cJames I\u201d). </em>The court in <em>James I </em>determined that the due process class could seek potentially available injunctive relief on seven of their original twelve requests: \u201c(1) cancel the debt assessed for demolition costs and associated fees/interest and file notice in the public deed records that the debt was can-celled, (2) file a release of the lien in the public deed records, (3) ensure that title is clear on the property, (4) ensure that all City records concerning the property show the debt cancelled, (5) refrain from taking any steps to enforce the lien or collect the debt, (6) refrain from foreclosures based on demolition liens, and (7) refrain from retaliatory action such as refusing to issue building permits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-19\">On remand, the district court bifurcated the due process class issues for a bench trial (over the City\u2019s objection), leaving the claims seeking individual money damages for a jury trial. The district court tried the due process claims without a jury on December 9, 2002. In August 2003, the district court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law, ordering a permanent injunction against the City on the due process claims. <em>James v. City of Dallas, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>No. 3:98-CV-436-R, 2003 WL 22342799 (N.D.Tex. Aug.28, 2003) (\u201c/ames <em>II\u201d). </em>The City timely filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Having carefully reviewed the entire record of this case, and having fully considered the parties\u2019 respective briefing and arguments, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. We therefore AFFIRM the final judgment of the district court essentially for the reasons stated in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
