By moving for IFP, Akomolafe is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that an appeal from the dismissal of his civil rights complaint was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). In his IFP motion, Akomolafe argues that Cornell Corrections Corporation is liable for the alleged violations against him. His argument lacks merit because Akomolafe may not bring a Bivens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claim against Cornell Corrections Corporation. <em>See Correctional Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 63, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-24\">Akomolafe has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal or that the district court erred in certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the instant motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Akomolafe that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-25\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
