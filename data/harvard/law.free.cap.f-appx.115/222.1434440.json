Smith first argues that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment. Measured against the benchmark of <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980), Smith\u2019s 180-month sentence is not grossly disproportionate and thus does not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>121 F.3d 928, 943-44 (5th Cir.1997). Smith\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Smith also contends that he was entitled to application of the \u201clesser harm\u201d policy. We understand this to be an argument that Smith was entitled to a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.11. Because the record does not indicate that the district court erroneously believed that it lacked the authority to downwardly depart under this guideline, we lack jurisdiction to consider this argument. <em>See United States v. Landerman, </em>167 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Smith\u2019s appeal of this issue is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
