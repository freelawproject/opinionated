We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural context, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Torres\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, <em>see First Eagle SoGen Funds, Inc. v. Bank for Int\u2019l Settlements, 252 </em>F.3d 604, 607 (2d Cir.2001), and the denial of his recusal motion, <em>see Rosen v. Sugarman, </em>357 F.2d 794, 796 (2d Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Torres a preliminary injunction; it properly held that Torres failed to show that he would \u201cbe irreparably harmed in the absence of an injunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>See Forest City Daly Hous., Inc. v. North Hempstead, </em>175 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">For the reasons set forth above, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED IN PART, and the remainder of the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
