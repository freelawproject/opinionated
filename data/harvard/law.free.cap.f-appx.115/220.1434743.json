Perez argues that the district court erred by finding that she was an organizer or leader of the criminal activity and applying a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). For the first time on appeal, Perez asserts that the application of the four-level enhancement was unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-22\">The district court\u2019s application of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 adjustment is a factual matter that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Dadi, </em>235 F.3d 945, 951 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as the finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 432 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The undisputed evidence showed that Perez recruited co-defendant Carlos Linan-Salinas; exercised control over his actions; and maintained a log of the names, destinations, and fees to be paid by the illegal aliens. Given these facts and \u201cthe extreme deference of the \u2018clear error\u2019 standard,\u201d the district court\u2019s application of the four-level enhancement for Perez being an organizer or leader of the criminal activity was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Lowder, </em>148 F.3d 548, 554 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-23\">As Perez concedes, her <em>Blakely </em>argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
