We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>see Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-24\">In his complaint, Portillo alleged that his attorney, a public defender, failed to investigate and present the defense that his codefendant shot the victim. He sought declaratory relief setting aside his conviction, and he also sought damages. Citing <em>Smith v. City of Hemet, </em>356 F.3d 1138 (9th Cir.) (holding that conviction for resisting arrest barred excessive force claim), <em>reh\u2019g en banc granted, </em>371 F.3d 1045 (9th Cir.2004), he contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claims for damages as barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See Heck </em>at 486-87 (holding that claim for damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 unless conviction has been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>versed, expunged, declared invalid, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus). This contention lacks merit because Portillo\u2019s ineffective assistance claim attacks the validity of his conviction. <em>See Ramirez v. Galaza, </em>334 F.3d 850, 856 (9th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2388, 158 L.Ed.2d 963 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b391-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
