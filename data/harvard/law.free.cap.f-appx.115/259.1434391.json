He was sentenced to 110 months of imprisonment, four years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-25\">Robinson argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>including, pursuant to the relevant conduct provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2), an additional 15.4 grams of cocaine base in the calculation of his base offense level because the finding of the additional drug amount was made by the district court and was not made by a jury or admitted by Robinson. He contends that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the use of the court\u2019s finding of the additional drug amount in the determination of his sentence violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. As Robinson acknowledges, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
