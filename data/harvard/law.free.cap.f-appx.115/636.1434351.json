In several of the actions, plaintiffs also sued individual store managers who carried out their stores\u2019 orders and removed plaintiffs\u2019 barbecue products from store shelves. Each of the complaints purported to allege a violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cSCUTPA\u201d), S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-5-10 <em>et seq., </em>based on the contention that the defendants\u2019 discontinuation of carrying plaintiffs\u2019 products was an unfair trade practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaints alleged that in July 2000, when the Confederate battle flag was lowered from the top of the South Carolina cap\u00edtol building, Bessinger began flying the Confederate battle flag at his restaurants. Within a month, an article appeared in <em>The State </em>newspaper that was extremely critical of Bessinger for flying the flag and for distributing religious literature at Bessinger\u2019s restaurants that the newspaper alleged to be controversial in nature. Following <em>The State </em>newspaper article, a series of news media stories appeared both in print and on radio and television \u201cconcerning [the media\u2019s] perception of Plaintiff Bessinger\u2019s political and religious views with special emphasis on the Confederate Battle Flag controversy.\u201d Following this publicity, defendants removed plaintiffs\u2019 products from store shelves and discontinued selling their products. As the complaints alleged, \u201c[t]he sole reason that Plaintiffs\u2019 products were removed by the Defendants in this case was because of Plaintiffs individual political and religious views as expressed by him and publicized in the media.\u201d The plaintiffs claim that the defendants\u2019 retaliation against plaintiffs for their exercise of free speech was an unfair trade practice that violated SCUTPA. The plaintiffs demanded in the aggregate $45 million in compensatory damages, as well as treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>In the five actions against Food Lion, Inc., Winn-Dixie, Inc., Sam\u2019s Club, Inc., Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and Harris Teeter, Inc., respectively, the defendants removed the cases to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction conferred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 and filed motions to dismiss the complaints under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). In the Food Lion, Winn-Dixie, and Harris Teeter cases, the plaintiffs in turn moved to remand the cases to state court because the store managers, who were also named defendants, were South Carolina citizens, thus destroying diversity of citizenship, the essential condition for diversity jurisdiction. The district court denied the motions to remand and granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Applying the \u201cfraudulent joinder doctrine,\u201d <em>see Mayes v. Rapoport, </em>198 F.3d 457, 461 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Marshall v. Manville Sales Corp., </em>6 F.3d 229, 232-33 (4th Cir.1993), the district court disregarded the citizenship of the store managers because there was no possibility that the plaintiffs would be able to establish that the managers were liable under SCUTPA. The court observed that the managers \u201cdid not commit, participate in, direct or authorize the <em>corporate decision </em>to discontinue the plaintiffs\u2019 products.\u201d With the managers\u2019 citizenship disregarded, the court concluded that it had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 and accordingly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">On the question of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints stated a claim under SCUTPA upon which relief could be granted, the district court concluded (1) that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the defendants discontinued selling plaintiffs\u2019 products in retaliation against plaintiffs\u2019 speech did not allege an \u201cunfair act,\u201d as required by SCUTPA, and (2) that the defendants\u2019 alleged retaliation did not adversely affect members of the public, also as required by SCUTPA. The district court reasoned that while the plaintiffs retained the right to speak out as they had done, the defendants retained the right to exercise their freedom not to sell plaintiffs\u2019 products. In addition, the court concluded that the exercise of these rights by the respective parties did not adversely affect the public but rather benefited it. As the court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">the vendor is free to express his views; the store is free not to do business with the vendor based on those views; and the customer is free not to patronize the store because it no longer sells the vendor\u2019s product. Such free market interaction benefits rather than harms the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Accordingly, the district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants in each of the five actions on November 24, 2003. From these judgments, the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">We have carefully reviewed the record and considered the arguments of the parties\u2019 counsel in their briefs and oral arguments, and at bottom, we agree with the district court. Accordingly, for the reasons given by the district court in its opinion filed in each of the five actions, <em>see Bessinger et al. v. Food Lion, LLC et al., </em>No. 03-CV-2828 (D.S.C. Nov. 20, 2003); <em>Bessinger et al. v. Winn Dixie, Inc. et al., </em>No. 03-CV-2874 (D.S.C. Nov. 20, 2003); <em>Bessinger et al. v. Sam\u2019s Club, Inc. et al, </em>No. 03-CV-2807 (D.S.C. Nov. 20, 2003); <em>Bessinger et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. et al, </em>No. 03-CV-2810 (D.S.C. Nov. 20, 2003); and <em>Bessinger et al. v. Harris Teeter, Inc. et al, </em>No. 03-CV-3153 (D.S.C. Nov. 20, 2003), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
