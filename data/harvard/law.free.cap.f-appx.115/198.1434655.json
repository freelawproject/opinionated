For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Diane S. Roy (\u201cRoy\u201d), a black female, sued the USDA, alleging racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Roy worked at the USDA as an Accounting Technician in the National Finance Center. Roy applied for one of five vacant paralegal positions within the USDA. Applicants were instructed to file a package consisting of an application, their most recent performance appraisal, a college transcript <em>or </em>a paralegal certificate, proof of eligibility, and a supplemental statement discussing the applicant\u2019s knowledge, skills, and abilities. Soon after submitting her application, Roy received a hand-delivered notice that she would not be considered for any of the vacant positions because her application was deficient. She was not permitted to amend her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Other application packages were reviewed and rated by a promotions panel, which used a five-criterion evaluation system. The system resulted in two rosters, \u201cBest Qualified\u201d and \u201cNon-Competitive Eligibles,\u201d which were then submitted to two selection officials in alphabetical order and minus the scoring and ratings. The two selection officials then interviewed in identical manner the candidates who made the \u201cBest Qualified\u201d roster, excepting one candidate who withdrew. Thereafter, each official individually selected five persons from the roster. They then convened to compare their choices. Both officials chose the same five candidates, hired those persons, and, as required by law, contemporaneously filed justifications for the selection of each candidate. All of the five selectees were women: one Black, one Native American, and three Caucasians. After the hiring decisions were posted, Roy filed a Freedom of Information Act request for copies of the hired persons applications. After reviewing these documents, Roy filed suit. The USDA responded with a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted in its favor. Roy appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as that court. <em>Norman v. Apache Corp., </em>19 F.3d 1017, 1021 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">Pursuant to the burden-shifting framework operative in Title VII disparate treatment cases, if Roy demonstrates a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the USDA to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for its employment decision. If the defendant meets this burden, Roy must demonstrate that the USDA\u2019s articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L.Ed.2d 668(1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>The prima facie burden is extremely low, and Roy had no problem meeting it here. As a black woman she qualifies as a member of a protected class; she applied for a paralegal position and was qualified for the job; she did not get the job; and non-protected persons with similar qualifications were hired for the position she sought. <em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824 (setting forth the four requirements of prima facie case). The USDA also meets its burden \u2014 one of production, not persuasion \u2014 to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision: that the qualifications of the five persons hired were superior to Roy\u2019s qualifications,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including those of the two minorities hired to the exclusion of Roy. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2106, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (stating that \u201c[tjhis burden is one of production, not persuasion; it \u2018can involve no credibility assessment\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 509, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2748, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).) The USDA supported this articulation with production of summary judgment evidence, including affidavits from the selecting officials regarding hiring procedures and criteria as discussed above, more than sufficiently rebutting the presumption established by Roy\u2019s prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Fatally, Roy fails to establish pretext. As discussed above, the selection officials filed statements, as legally required, affirmatively explaining the employment decision as to each hired applicant and detailing each individual\u2019s relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities, including written communications. The officials were only required to justify their reasons for declining Roy the position during the EEOC administrative investigation. At that time, the officials maintained that Roy\u2019s application was rejected because it was poorly written and contained numerous grammatical and spelling errors. As evidence of pretext, Roy maintains that the applications of the five hired persons were as poorly written as her own, submits an unsigned document from a school teacher in support thereof, and maintains that she is better qualified than the persons hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">First, because an unsigned affidavit is not competent summary evidence pursuant to Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court will not consider it for purposes of de novo review. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>Duplantis v. Shell Offshore, Inc., </em>948 F.2d 187, 192 (5th Cir.1991). Assuming technical competency, arguendo, the document, which asserts that the applications of the five persons hired also contained grammatical and spelling errors, is insufficient to establish pretext because its substance does not adequately dispute the more than competent summary judgment declarations of the selection officials, which aver that the degree and extent of grammatical and spelling errors contained in Roy\u2019s application was unacceptable under the relevant application requirements and hiring procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Additionally, Roy\u2019s argument that she was \u201cclearly better qualified\u201d than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>hired persons also fails.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a Title VII plaintiff, Roy may survive summary judgment by demonstrating that she was \u201cclearly better qualified\u201d than the persons hired. <em>Celestine v. Petroleos de Venezuella SA </em>266 F.3d 343, 356-57 (5th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). However, unlike Roy\u2019s prima facie burden, the \u201cclearly better qualified\u201d standard is extremely high \u2014 evidence of the plaintiffs qualifications must be \u201cof such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question\u201d \u2014 and Roy does not satisfy it. <em>Celestine, </em>266 F.3d at 357. Contrary to Roy\u2019s contentions, the fact that she has a paralegal certificate does not make her \u201cclearly better qualified\u201d than the candidate(s) who had no certification because certification was not an exclusive education requirement. Rather, an applicant had to possess a college education <em>or </em>a paralegal certificate. Even if specialized paralegal certification was a requirement, the white hiree with whom Roy takes greatest issue was employed as a paralegal specialist at the time she was hired and had significant relevant prior work experience. The other hirees had similarly extensive legal employment backgrounds. Roy\u2019s certification and one-year trainee experience at a law firm pale in comparison and fail under the \u201cclearly better qualified\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Finally, Roy similarly fails on her \u201cpattern and practice of discrimination\u201d claim as it is inapplicable to her individual claim of racial discrimination. <em>See Celestine, </em>266 F.3d at 355-356 (holding that an individual failure-to-promote race-based claim is properly analyzed under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework at summary judgment stage because \u201cpattern and practice\u201d claims are unavailable outside of a class action).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s summary judgment grant in favor of the USD A.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b233-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-5\">. Roy argues that the district court erred in identifying the USDA\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason as the superior qualifications of the five hired persons, instead of the reason that the selection officials offered during an EEOC administrative investigation\u2014 that Roy\u2019s application was poorly prepared and contained numerous grammatical and spelling errors. Roy\u2019s distinction is without a difference. The USDA's reason \u2014 superior qualifications of the five hired persons \u2014 necessarily encompasses the application review procedures wherein hiring personnel found Roy\u2019s application deficient for, among other reasons, poor preparation as reflected in the high number of grammatical and spelling errors. The USDA's position has been consistent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">. Although Roy tries to back away from this argument now, contending that the district court incorrectly applied the \u201cclearly better qualified\u201d standard when it should have simply addressed whether she demonstrated pretext, Roy raised both standards below and, thus, the district court properly addressed both standards below. Therefore, we address those same standards here, and Roy loses on both counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
