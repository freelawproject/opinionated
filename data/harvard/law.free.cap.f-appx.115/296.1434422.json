Higgins argues that Troy Bennett, Jr., Clerk of Court for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, deprived him of his constitutional right of access to the federal courts by failing to notify him in a timely manner that the state court had dismissed his state habeas application, thereby delaying the filing of his federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-21\">Higgins has not established that he was unable to proceed in a court case or that his federal habeas petition has been dismissed or is likely to be dismissed as untimely because of the clerk of court\u2019s allegedly late notice. Higgins thus has not established prejudice or an actual injury from the clerk\u2019s alleged failure to give timely notice and therefore has not established that he has standing to bring his claim or that his right of access to the courts has been violated. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 349-51, 116 S.Ct. 2174,135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-22\">Consequently, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Higgins\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED. Higgins\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal is DENIED. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The district court\u2019s dismissal of Higgins\u2019s lawsuit constitutes one strike for purposes of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) bar. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Higgins that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
