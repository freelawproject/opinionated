Because Jasmin\u2019s claims are dependent upon Gill\u2019s claims, only Gill\u2019s claims require consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Gill contends that the BIA erred by finding that she did not establish her eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA and CAT. Gill\u2019s application for asylum was denied as untimely. Because Gill has failed to address the timeliness of her asylum application in her instant petition, that issue is waived. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s determination that Gill\u2019s testimony alleging past persecution and fear of future persecution was not credible. As Gill has failed to show anything in the record compelling this court to overturn the BIA\u2019s credibility determination, that credibility determination cannot be overturned. <em>See Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002). Gill has therefore failed to show that the BIA\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Moreover, even if Gill\u2019s testimony was deemed to be credible, the record does not compel a finding that she met her burden to warrant withholding of removal under the INA or the CAT. <em>See Bah v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b793-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
