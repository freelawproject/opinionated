Plaintiff argues that he has a right to bring suit under \u00a7 1983, based on violations of his federal housing rights established under the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437a. Plaintiff asserts that he can bring suit regardless of the existence of state administrative remedies, relying upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wright v. City of Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, </em>479 U.S. 418, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>427-29, 107 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987). Construing plaintiffs complaint as favorably, as possible, we will assume this to be what he alleged there, and agree that such a suit could state a claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Our Court has held that claims for monetary damages under \u00a7 1983 are not barred by the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine, <em>Rivers v. McLeod, </em>252 F.3d 99, 101-02 (2d Cir.2001), though otherwise identical claims for injunctive or declaratory relief brought in the same complaint are barred. <em>Kirschner v. Klemons, </em>225 F.3d 227, 238 (2d Cir.2000). At this time we lack an adequate record to determine precisely what issues were litigated in the multiple state proceedings. For this reason, and to allow the District Court to analyze plaintiffs statutory claim, we affirm the dismissal under <em>Younger </em>to the extent that plaintiff seeks injunctive or declaratory relief and remand to the District Court for consideration of whether <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>preclusion, or any other doctrine bars plaintiffs remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">We hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court in part and VACATE the judgment in part and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this ruling. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
