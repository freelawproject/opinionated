We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. </em>Summary judgment was properly granted only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, no genuine dispute of material fact exists to be resolved by trial. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). This Court may affirm on any basis for which the record is sufficient to permit conclusions of law, including grounds not relied on by the District Court. <em>See, e.g., EEOC v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., </em>321 F.3d 69, 73-74 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">The district court granted defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion on the ground that Colon failed to allege sufficient facts in dispute material to whether he suffered hardship \u201catypical and significant ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\u201d which would infringe a liberty interest under <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), and entitle him to procedural due process. In light of this Court\u2019s precedents, <em>see, e.g., Palmer v. Richards, </em>364 F.3d 60 (2d Cir.2004), it was erroneous to grant summary judgment to defendants on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">Defendants have not waived their statute of limitations defense by failing to raise it in their motion under Rules 12(c) and 56. Statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that is preserved by assertion in a party\u2019s first responsive pleading. <em>See Kulzer v. Pittsburgh-Corning Corp., </em>942 F.2d 122, 125 (2d Cir.1991) (holding \u201cbare assertion\u201d of statute of limitations in answer preserved it to be raised again mid-trial, despite failure to raise it in pretrial dispositive motions); <em>see also Nicholas v. Miller, </em>189 F.3d 191, 195 (2d Cir.1999) (holding assertion of qualified immunity in answer, not asserted in successful summary judgment motion, preserved it to be raised as ground for affirmance on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Colon argues that his solitary confinement during most of the statutory period and the malfunction of his facility\u2019s photocopier for thirty days towards the end of the statutory period entitle him to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. While this Court has never held solitary confinement alone sufficient to entitle a prisoner to equitable tolling, prison conditions that <em>prevent </em>a prisoner from timely filing may require equitable tolling. <em>See Hizbullahankhamon v. Walker, </em>255 F.3d 65, 75 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Colon should therefore be allowed to develop evidence and argument regarding his entitlement to equitable tolling in the district court. For the foregoing reasons, we ORDER that the district court\u2019s order be VACATED and the case REMANDED for a hearing to determine whether Colon filed timely, taking into consideration any toll to which he proves entitlement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
