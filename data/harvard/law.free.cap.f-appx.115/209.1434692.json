Muana has waived the denial of his applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture by failing to argue those issues. <em>Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">This court will uphold the BIA\u2019s factual finding that an alien is not eligible for asylum if the determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires only that the Board\u2019s conclusion be based upon the evidence presented and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As the BIA summarily affirmed without opinion the IJ\u2019s decision, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for judicial review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 831-32 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Muana has failed to make the requisite showing that he is unable or unwilling to return to Burma \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also Jukic v.
