It is assumed that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Hayes argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to bifurcate, a ruling that we review ordinarily for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Belk, </em>346 F.3d 305, 310 (2d Cir.2003). However, a district court \u201cdoes not err when it refuses to bifurcate a defendant\u2019s jury trial to provide for separate consideration of the elements of a felon-in-possession charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310. Hayes urges that his is the \u201cunusual case\u201d contemplated in <em>Belk </em>in which bifurcation could have been appropriate. However, though Second Circuit precedent may \u201cnot go so far as to prohibit a District Court\u2019s bifurcation of the separate elements of a \u00a7 922(g)(1) charge, [it] at least makes it clear that a district court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in refusing to bifurcate the elements of a \u00a7 922(g)(1) charge is not reversible error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Hayes\u2019 next argues that enhancement of his criminal history category was plain error in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Specifically, Hayes argues that the district court erred in i) granting a \u201cvertical\u201d upward departure of four offense levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) based on the judge\u2019s finding that Hayes possessed ammunition in connection with drug trafficking; n) granting a \u201chorizontal\u201d enhancement of two criminal history points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(2) for committing this offense less than two years after release from imprisonment for a prior offense; iii) designating Hayes as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, resulting in a \u201cvertical\u201d upward enhancement of 10 levels. We will not apply <em>Blakely </em>to the Federal Guidelines unless and until the Supreme Court rules that we must. <em>See United States v. Mincey, </em>380 F.3d 102 (2d Cir.2004). We therefore reject Hayes\u2019 <em>Blakely </em>claims at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">The government responds that the enhancements in Hayes\u2019 sentence for criminal history and status as an armed career criminal are based on the fact of his prior convictions and thus authorized under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 229-48, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); however, the enhancements in this case go beyond the mere \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d permitted by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>see also United States v. Santiago, </em>268 F.3d 151, 156 (2d Cir.2001) (holding judge can appropriately find \u201cwho, what, when and where\u201d of a prior conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">Therefore, the mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>No. 04-104, 2004 WL 2331491, and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>No. 04-105, 2004 WL 2331491 (argued October 4, 2004). Should any party believe there is a need for the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court will not reconsider those portions of its order that address the defendant\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until fourteen days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
