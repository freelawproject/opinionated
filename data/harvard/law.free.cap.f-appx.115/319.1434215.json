He seeks a new trial, contending that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should have sua sponte ordered a competency hearing after he tested positive for methamphetamine during trial and that his attorney\u2019s failure to request such a hearing denied him effective assistance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-25\">Swarzentruber was indicted on three counts of distributing methamphetamine, two counts of possessing the drug with an intent to distribute, and one count of possessing a firearm while unlawfully using drugs. On the first day of trial, two witnesses testified they had obtained methamphetamine from Swarzentruber the pri- or week, and one said he had used the drug with Swarzentruber during the past year. Because one of the conditions of Swarzentruber\u2019s pretrial release was not to use illegal substances, he was given a drug test which returned positive for methamphetamine. After the district court observed that Swarzentruber exhibited no outward signs of impairment and confirmed that he was able to communicate effectively with his lawyer, the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Swarzentruber argues that due process requires a hearing whenever sufficient doubt is raised about a defendant\u2019s competency at trial, <em>Griffin v. Lockhart, </em>935 F.2d 926, 929 (8th Cir.1991), and that the district court erred by not holding such a hearing. The factors to be considered in deciding whether a hearing is necessary include evidence of irrational behavior, the defendant\u2019s demeanor at trial, and any pri- or medical opinions concerning the defendant\u2019s competency. <em>Id. </em>at 930. None of these factors raised doubt as to Swarzentruber\u2019s competency at the time of trial, for the record reveals no irrational behavior and the court made findings to the contrary. The use of drugs \u201cdoes not per se render a defendant incompetent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>542 F.2d 50, 51 (8th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 837, 97 S.Ct. 105, 50 L.Ed.2d 103 (1976). Swarzentruber has not shown that the court erred by not holding a competency hearing or that his due process rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Swarzentruber also argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to request a competency hearing denied him effective assistance. This claim is premature on direct appeal. <em>See United </em>States <em>v. Jackson, </em>41 F.3d 1231, 1234 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-19\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
