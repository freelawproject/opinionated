Sellmon seeks to appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his habeas petition challenging the United States Parole Commission\u2019s determination in his case. The district court dismissed Sellmon\u2019s complaint in an order entered on May 10, 2004. Sellmon\u2019s notice of appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>is dated August 2, 2004.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Although Sellmon\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely, it was submitted within the thirty day window for seeking an extension of time authorized by Rule 4(a)(5) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Further, Sellmon\u2019s notice of appeal appears to expressly seek an extension of time to file a notice of appeal and to attempt to explain why such extension would be warranted. We therefore construe Sellmon\u2019s notice of appeal as a motion for extension of time under Rule 4(a)(5). <em>See Washington v. Bumgarner, </em>882 F.2d 899, 901 (4th Cir.1989) (litigant\u2019s pleading must make a request for an extension of time and explain why it would be warranted in order to qualify as a Rule 4(a)(5) motion); <em>Myers v. Stephenson, </em>781 F.2d 1036, 1038-39 (4th Cir.1986). Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for the limited determination of whether Sellmon has shown excusable neglect or good cause to warrant an extension of time for filing a notice of appeal. The record, as supplemented, then will be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b215-5\"> Because Sellmon was in prison, we construe the date he executed his notice of appeal as the earliest date on which it can be considered filed. <em>See Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988); Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
