The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights, interfered with the automobile towing businesses\u2019 relations, defamed Barr, and otherwise injured her when the police officers conducted an investigation into the legitimacy of Barr\u2019s businesses, initiated legal process against them, and conducted a search of them on February 2, 1999. The search was conducted pursuant to several search warrants signed by a circuit judge on January 28,1999. The police officers contended that they had reason to believe that Barr and her businesses were abusing their duties when hired by the Prince George\u2019s County \u201cTow Coordination Unit\u201d to pick up automobiles on behalf of Prince George\u2019s County. They contended that Barr and her businesses were fraudulently transferring such vehicles to herself or her entities, contrary to any authorization give by Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">In her complaint, Barr alleged in nine counts a wide array of claims for violations of civil rights committed under color of state law, violations of the Maryland Constitution, malicious prosecution, violations of the Local Government Tort Claims Act, abuse of process, tortious interference with business relationships, defamation, and injurious falsehood. On the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, the district court granted the motions with respect to various counts, by order dated July 19, 2002. With respect to the remaining counts, the district court granted summary judgment by an oral opinion given on December 19, 2003, and a written order entered on December 22, 2003. From final judgment in favor of the defendants, the plaintiffs filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-15\">While this appeal was pending, we granted the motion of counsel for the plaintiffs to withdraw from this case and directed the plaintiffs \u201cto notify the Court in writing of the name and address of counsel representing them in this appeal on or before September 17, 2004.\u201d We admonished plaintiffs that if they failed to obtain new counsel, \u201cthe case [would] proceed pro se as to appellant Barr ... [and] be dismissed as to the corporations, ... since a corporation cannot proceed pro se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>on appeal.\u201d The appellants failed to provide this court notice of new counsel, and no counsel has entered an appearance on behalf of them. Accordingly, as to the appellant corporations, we dismiss their appeal. <em>See </em>Fourth Circuit Local Rule 46.</p>\n<p id=\"ALpG\">As to the appellant Barr, we have reviewed her submissions and the record, and for the reasons given by the district court in dismissing some of the counts, <em>see Barr v. Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, et al, </em>Civil Action AW-02-346 (D.Md. July 19, 2002), and the reasons given by the district court in granting summary judgment for the remaining counts, <em>see Barr v. Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, et al., </em>Civil Action JFM-02-346 (D. Md. Dec. 19 and 22, 2003), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
