The district court granted a certificate of appealability. On appeal, Gibson argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to object to his offense level adjustment under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) (1998) (adjustment based on the number of firearms involved in the offense). Specifically, Gibson asserts that, because he was permitted under North Carolina law to possess firearms in his home, <em>see </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 14-415.1(a) (Supp.1998), the firearms recovered from his home could not be used to calculate the number of firearms involved in his offense. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.9) (\u201cFor purposes of calculating the number of firearms under subsection (b)(1), count only those firearms that were ... unlawfully possessed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">However, we find that any objection by counsel would have been futile. Federal law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) (2000), does prevent federal prosecution for a felon in possession of a firearm when a state has restored a person\u2019s civil rights on the predicate felony. But when, as here, a state restricts a felon from possessing firearms in certain situations (e.g., outside of his home or business), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) prohibits him from possessing any guns <em>at all, </em>even those permitted under state law. <em>See Caron v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 308, 315-17, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998). Thus, Gibson has failed to make a prima facie showing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We deny Gibson\u2019s motions for summary judgment and to appoint counsel. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
