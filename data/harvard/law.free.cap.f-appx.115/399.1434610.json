Because the transitional rules apply, <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review the BIA\u2019s decision for substantial evidence and must uphold it unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 937 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Mr. Ali\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent, inconsistent with his application, and contained implausibilities. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003). Because some of the factual discrepancies went to the heart of the asylum claim, substantial evidence supports the denial of asylum. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). It follows that the petitioners did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), petitioners\u2019 voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b434-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
