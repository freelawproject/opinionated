The court lacks jurisdiction to deny the executrix her statutory right of renouncement of the compensation provided in the will and to receive commissions provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">\u201cII. The court erred in rejecting the consent and agreement by the parties of the renouncement of the compensation provided in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">\u201cIII. Abuse of discretion and the court\u2019s ruling is against the manifest weight of the evidence and contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">The facts that are relevant to this appeal are not in dispute. The record indicates that on April 21, 1994, decedent Verneita Scheid died testate. Her will provided that appellant, as her executor, \u201cshall be allowed and shall receive no compensation for her services and expenses.\u201d On July 6, 1994, appellant filed in the trial court a \u201crenouncement of executrix fee as provided in the will\u201d and claimed that \u201cby reason hereof the compensation shall be as allowed by law.\u201d At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>a hearing held on the matter on September 13, 1994, appellant argued that she should be allowed to renounce her \u201cfee\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2113.36 and take a commission on the amount of the estate pursuant to R.C. 2113.35. In a judgment entry filed on October 4,1994, the court found that the motion was not well taken and that it was not in the best interest of the estate and the heirs for the court to approve the renouncement. The trial court also found that the proposed renouncement was not provided for by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Appellant argues in her assignments of error that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to deny the renouncement, that the trial court erred in rejecting the consent of the other heirs to her renouncement, and that the court erred in denying her renouncement. Upon thorough consideration of the record of proceedings in the trial court, this court finds that R.C. 2113.36 does not provide for \u201crenouncement\u201d of a nonexistent fee in order to receive a commission from the estate and that the trial court did not err as a matter of law in denying appellant\u2019s request to \u201crenounce\u201d something that did not exist. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first, second and third assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On consideration whereof, this court finds that substantial justice was done the party complaining and the judgment of the Huron County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, is affirmed. Costs assessed to . appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b381-8\">Abood, P.J., Glasser and Melvin L. Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b381-9\">Melvin L. Resnick, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AQb\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">I would only add that when the executor accepted the appointment she was aware of the terms of the will. Having accepted the appointment, she is estopped from claiming any commissions provided for under the statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
