Nugent, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">This is an appeal of Brian Lesser, Shahpor Mobasseri and Fatemeh Khodabandlou (\u201cappellants\u201d) from a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas dismissing their appeal, pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506, from an order of the Cleveland Board of Zoning Appeals (\u201cBZA\u201d) denying appellants\u2019 request for a change of use and/or variance for their property located at 727 East 185th Street, Cleveland, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">On November 28, 1990, appellants submitted an application for plan examination and building permit to the Department of Community Development, Division of Building and Housing of the City of Cleveland. Appellants\u2019 application sought a change of use for property owned by Lesser and rented to Mobasseri and Khodabandlou. Appellants sought to continue using the property, located in a general retail business district, as an auto repair shop. In the application, appellants \u201crequest[ed] to continue using [the building] for the sale of automobile parts and accessories; and the installation of said parts and accessories, as well as the repair of automobiles, including but not limited to tune-ups, brakes, exhaust systems, shock absorbers, and tires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>On November 30, 1990, a commissioner for the city of Cleveland (the \u201ccity\u201d) notified appellants that use of the property was in nonconformance with the zoning code. In his notice of nonconformance, the commissioner explained that an auto repair shop is not permitted in a general retail business district.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Appellants appealed the notice of nonconformance to the BZA. In their application to appeal to the BZA, appellants maintained that they were appealing \u201cfor a permit to erect, alter, convert, maintain and/or use permises [sic] * * * as an auto repair garage.\u201d At the hearing before the BZA, appellants and their attorney were sworn in. Michael Gaeta, the city\u2019s zoning engineer, represented that the property in question consists of a fifty-by-one-hundred-foot corner lot at East 185th Street and Mohawk Avenue. It is located in a general retail business district and is occupied by a two-story masonry store and suites building. The building has five service bay doors facing the side of Mohawk Avenue, and the upstairs portion is vacant. Gaeta further represented that the tenants have been operating an auto repair- shop for two years and \u201ctheir operation is mechanical repairs, stated tuneups, brakes, lubes, et cetera.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The permit history of the property was discussed by Anthony Costanza, secretary of the BZA. Costanza represented that prior to 1962, the property in question was operated as a hardware store. In 1962, a building permit was issued by the city to the Lesser &amp; Lesser Firestone Company, which operated a retail tire store, to utilize the rear of the building as a garage for installation of tires sold by the store. Pursuant to the permit, the city allowed the Lessers to install five overhead garage doors in the rear of the building and to convert that portion of the building into a garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Subsequently, on April 29, 1983, a change of use permit was issued to convert the tire store into a store for the sale and installation of automotive security systems. Again, pursuant to the permit issued by the city, the Lessers were permitted to convert the Firestone Tire Store into Chapman Automotive Security System, a retail store for the sale and installation of automotive security systems. The garage of the building was permitted to be used for installation of said automotive security systems in the same way that the garage was previously used for the installation of tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Costanza further testified that both the Firestone Tire Store and the Chapman Automotive Security System store were permitted uses in a general retail business district.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Appellants\u2019 attorney then gave an opening statement to the BZA while under oath. Appellants\u2019 counsel represented that in 1962, Lesser &amp; Lesser Firestone moved into the building and, after having obtained all necessary city permits, spent substantial sums to make the property suitable for a retail tire store with attendant installation services. The Lessers improved the property by construct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ing a service garage. They installed five new service bays, five new overhead service doors and five curb cuts on Mohawk Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In 1983, the property was converted into an automotive security systems sales and installation store. Again, all necessary permits were issued by the city approving the use of the premises. Subsequently, in 1988, Lesser rented the premises to Mobasseri for use as a \u201cgeneral service station type automobile repair business.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel then gave a brief description of the neighborhood. Across the street from the property is a Medic Drug Store, two bars are located nearby and, down the road, in the same general retail business district, is Rink\u2019s Auto Repair shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Appellants\u2019 counsel continued by noting that one of appellants\u2019 neighbors in the general retail business district, Rink\u2019s Auto Repair, was, at one time, a full-service gas station which subsequently removed its gas pumps and has legally continued to do' business as an auto repair shop. Apparently, Rink\u2019s Auto Repair has been cited by the budding department for doing \u201cincidental transmission work\u201d and \u201con one or two occasions some heavy engine work.\u201d Nonetheless, Rink\u2019s Auto Repair\u2019s basic operation is \u201cbrakes, tuneups and the type of automobile repair work that is permitted in service stations, which is a permitted use in the District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Appellants\u2019 counsel further stated that appellants \u201cwant to continue to operate just as our neighbor has. We wan1&gt;\u2014we are operating, basically, a repair, restorage garage which is a permitted use.\u201d However, counsel acknowledged that \u201con occasion, * * * [appellants] may have done one or two transmissions, and [they] may have done, in the past, one or two motor jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Councilman Michael Polensek testified next. Councilman Polensek has received several complaints that the property in question was not being maintained. He stated that he drove past the building and observed two large broken signs on the building, oil and grease stains on the sidewalk bordering Mohawk Avenue, and broken bottles and glass on the property. Councilman Polensek further represented that he had no problems with the operation of a repair garage at the property; rather, his concern was with the way the property was being maintained. Mr. Spendel, an owner of nearby residential property, also spoke of the complaints his tenants were registering concerning the lack of maintenance at the property in question. Spendel complained of grease and oil spilling on the sidewalks, used parts cluttering up the property, loud noises, and cars being parked on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Appellants\u2019 counsel then reiterated to the BZA that they believed the auto repair business in question has \u201cprior nonconforming use rights and, if not, then appellants were requesting a variance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Next, although the Chairman of the BZA announced that he would not allow the tenant or owner to give testimony, Lesser was given the opportunity to speak under oath. Lesser stated that his father started the business in 1942 before the instant building was constructed. The building was bought from the owners of a \u201cReal Hardware\u201d store, and the Lessers made \u201ctremendous improvements\u201d to the building. Lesser stated that all along the city has issued all necessary building and use permits and gave them permission to construct the building and the attached garage. The Lessers eventually leased the store to Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company in 1978, which obtained a use permit allowing it to operate a store for the repair of automobiles and the installation of shock absorbers, brakes, mufflers and tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Lesser acknowledged that the current tenants did not \u201chave the best housekeeping habits\u201d and did not maintain the property as well as he would like. He maintained that the beer bottles were the result of too many bars in the neighborhood and the broken windows the result of not enough police in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Based on the foregoing, the BZA sustained the decision of its commissioner and refused appellants\u2019 appeal. In its resolution denying appellants\u2019 appeal, the BZA made the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u201c1. The evidence establishes that the property has been located in a General Retail District since 1929; that prior to 1962 the building was being used as a hardware store, a permitted use in the district; that in 1962 a permit was issued to make alterations and an addition to a \u2018retail outlet\u2019; that in fact the building was converted to tire sales and installation and auto repair, a nonpermissible use in a General Retail District.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\u201c2. No exceptional local condition exists in this vicinity to justify the Board in making the exception requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u201c3. Granting the appeal would be detrimental to the general welfare of the neighbors and to the value of their properties and would be contrary to the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">\u201c4. In being refused this appeal the owner will not suffer an unreasonable hardship since he is not denied any use of property not also denied other owners in that district similarly situated * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Appellants appealed the decision to the trial court pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506. Appellants presented two arguments before the trial court. First, appellants maintained that they demonstrated their entitlement to a variance to conduct their auto repair business at the subject property. Second, appellants argued that their auto repair business is a permitted use in a general retail business district and that the building department should have issued appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>an occupancy and/or change of use permit. Following briefing and submission of the administrative record, the trial court affirmed the decision of the BZA, and this appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Appellants raise the following assignment of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u201cTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE CLEVELAND BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Appellants argue that the trial court erred in affirming the decision of the BZA, which denied their request for a use variance. Alternatively, appellants argue that the trial court erred in affirming the decision of the BZA to deny them an occupancy and/or change of use permit to operate the auto repair business.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">In an administrative appeal, pursuant to R.C. 2506.04, a court of common pleas, after reviewing the entire record, must affirm the decision of the administrative agency if it is supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence. <em>Dudukovich v. Lorain Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 202, 207, 12 O.O.3d 198, 201-202, 389 N.E.2d 1113, 1116-1117; <em>Families Against Reily/Morgan Sites v. Butler Cty.

If a preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence does not exist to support the administrative agency\u2019s decision, the common pleas court may reverse, vacate, modify or remand. <em>Dudukovich, supra; Families Against Sites, supra. </em>Thus, to a limited extent, a substitution of judgment by the common pleas court is permissible. <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 67, 407 N.E.2d 1265, 1267-1268. Pursuant to R.C. 2506.04, a judgment of the court of common pleas may be appealed to an appellate court on questions of law. Our inquiry is limited to a determination of whether we can say, as a matter of law, that there did exist a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to support the findings of the trial court. <em>Dudukovich, supra, </em>58 Ohio St.2d at 208, 12 O.O.3d at 202, 389 N.E.2d at 1117. Stated alternatively, in reviewing the court of common pleas judgment, the court of appeals, limited to a review of that judgment only on questions of law, can reverse if that judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>Id.; In re Annexation of Riveredge Twp., supra, </em>46 Ohio App.3d at 36, 545 N.E.2d at 1295-1296; <em>Sposit v.

An automobile repair business is permitted in semi-industrial districts. See Cleveland Codified Ordinances 345.03(C)(2).

Mgt., Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 238, 6 OBR 307, 452 N.E.2d 1287, the Ohio Supreme Court interpreted the above ordinance and held:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">\u201cIt is necessary that the board of zoning appeals read, and apply, each subsection of Ordinance Section 329.03 <em>in pari materia. </em>Accordingly, in order for the board to grant a specific variance, subsections 329.03(b)(1), (2) and (3) require that each applicant prove that the zoning classification presents an unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty to the intended use of the property; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>that refusal of the variance will deprive the owner of substantial property rights; and that the granting of the variance would not be contrary to the intent of the zoning code. Here, we hold that the appellees have not sustained the burden of proving that they were entitled to the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 6 OBR at 310-311, 452 N.E.2d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">As noted above, it is the applicants\u2019 burden to present evidence that they are entitled to a variance from strict application of the zoning code. In consideration of the above requirements, the BZA made four essential factual findings in support of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The BZA first found that a \u201cnonpermissible use\u201d in the form of a tire sales and installation and auto repair business has occupied the premises since 1962. We believe this finding is against the preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence in the record. The record demonstrates that in 1962, the property was used by the Lesser &amp; Lesser Firestone Company as a retail tire store while the back of the building was used for installation of said tires. Additionally, the Lessers had obtained all necessary city building and use permits and had spent considerable sums to upgrade the building and install five service bays and five overhead garage doors. Indeed, the BZA\u2019s secretary, Costanza, testified that the Firestone dealership, being a retail outlet for the sale of tires and attendant installation services, was a permissible use. Subsequently, in 1983, the tire store was sold and the property used as a store for the sale and installation of auto security systems. Again, all necessary city permits were issued, and Costanza testified that this was a permissible use.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Under Cleveland\u2019s Zoning Code, Section 343.11(b)(2)(E) broadly permits \u201cthe sale of other goods or merchandise\u201d in a general retail business district. In addition, Section 343.11(b)(2)(Q) provides for \u201cany accessory use customarily incident to a use authorized by this section * * *.\u201d The retail sales of tires and/or automotive security systems and the attendant installation services are clearly permitted and accessory uses in general retail business districts in the city of Cleveland. The historical use of the premises since 1962 and the fact that the city itself issued permits allowing for such uses underscores appellants\u2019 argument that such prior uses are permitted. Thus, the BZA\u2019s finding that the present property was being subjected to an illegal use for thirty years is not supported by the record and is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The BZA\u2019s second finding states that \u201cno exceptional local condition exists in this vicinity to justify the Board in making the exception requested.\u201d Appellants surmise that this is probably the BZA\u2019s attempt to make a finding on whether a \u201cpractical difficulty or unnecessary hardship inheres .in and is peculiar to the premises * * * not generally shared by other land or buildings in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>district.\u201d Cleveland Codified Ordinances 329.03(b)(1). We are inclined to agree and note that the BZA\u2019s fourth finding also addresses this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In any event, appellants argue that the unique structure of the building, which includes the garage area, prevents the building from being used for other permissible uses. Moreover, the historical use of the premises, and the city\u2019s acquiescence in such use from 1962 to 1988 as a retail business for the sale of tires and/or automotive security systems underscores appellants\u2019 position that the building cannot be used for purposes other than those attendant to the automotive industry. However, the fact that the premises were used in connection with the automotive industry does not equate with practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship where there is no evidence that the building cannot be used consistently with its prior uses. There was no evidence presented that the building could not continue being used for the retail sale of automotive accessories, such as the sale and installation of tires and/or automotive security systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">For the same reason, it is not clear that appellants are likely to suffer practical difficulty and/or an unnecessary hardship by not being granted the variance to conduct an automobile repair shop as that term is defined in Cleveland Codified Ordinances 325.30. As mentioned, this is consistent with the conclusion in the BZA\u2019s fourth finding which, in effect, states that appellants will not suffer an unreasonable hardship since they are not being denied use of property not also being denied other owners similarly situated. The evidence discloses that appellants can use the property for retail sale of items related to the automobile industry. The record reflects that since 1962 the building has permissibly been used for the retail sale of automotive accessories and attendant automotive services. In short, while the structure of the building is uniquely suited for the automotive services industry, there is nothing in the record which suggests that the building cannot be used consistently with its limited prior uses, as opposed to the expanded use of permitting the general repair of any kind of automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Appellants\u2019 additional argument that if the property cannot be used as an automobile repair shop, the property will have to be boarded up is also unpersuasive. Appellants pleaded before the BZA that it is nearly impossible to lease the building for something other than automobile services due to the unique structure of the building and due to the heavy population of bars which contribute to the deterioration of the property (and the neighborhood) and discourage other forms of retail or business establishments from entering the neighborhood. Again, however, appellants offer no evidence as to why the property cannot be leased for other types of automotive sales businesses, with attendant installation services, as had been done in the past. This court is mindful that it is appellants\u2019 responsibility to produce evidence of practical difficulty and undue hardship. <em>Consol. Mgt., Inc., supra, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 242, 6 OBR at 310-311, 452 N.E.2d at 1291; <em>Susman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>v. Cleveland Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(May 12, 1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 53771, unreported, at 2, 1988 WL 47462.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Additionally, the record fails to disclose that appellants would be deprived of a substantial property right granted others similarly situated within the district. The evidence demonstrates that Rink\u2019s Auto Repair, a former service station which removed its gas pumps and no longer sells gasoline, is permitted to conduct minor car repairs and provide other automotive services, in the same general retail business district. In fact, Rink\u2019s Auto repair is a neighbor, and competitor, of appellants\u2019 business. However, Rink\u2019s Auto Repair operates as a service station, although it no longer engages in the retail sale of gasoline, which is a permitted use within a general retail business district. Moreover, Rink\u2019s Auto Repair is limited to conducting minor automobile repair services as are permitted at service stations. See <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Finally, appellants argue that the BZA\u2019s third finding is not supported by the record. The BZA\u2019s third finding states, in effect, that granting the appeal would be detrimental to the general welfare of the neighbors and to the value of their properties and contrary to the purpose and intent of the zoning code. It is undisputed that appellants did not maintain the property, as there was evidence of grease stains on the sidewalk and broken glass and bottles on the property. Mr. Spendel registered complaints over the grease and oil stains on the sidewalk, used parts cluttering up the property, loud noises, and cars being parked on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Appellants argue that Councilman Polensek\u2019s testimony supports their contention that the purpose and intent of the zoning code would be served by granting the variance. They point out that Councilman Polensek did not oppose the type of business being run from the premises but that he opposed only the way in which the business was being run. Appellants add that various other types of automotive service businesses, such as service stations (Cleveland Codified Ordinances 343[b][2][I][5]), service garages (343.11[b][2][I][l]), and public garages (343.11[b][4]) are permitted in general retail business districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">It is not contested that a service station may engage in light automotive repairs. However, it is also important to note that automotive repairs at an automobile repair shop (as opposed to minor automotive repairs at a service station) may involve heavier work, which contributes to the greater incidence of loud noises, the potential for heavier spills of gas and oil, and the greater likelihood of spare and used parts cluttering up the premises. As gleaned from the record, these potential hazards were apparently being realized from the way in which appellants ran their automotive repair shop and certainly may cause the BZA to conclude that granting a variance to allow appellants to operate an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>automotive repair shop where any type of automobile repair work could be done would be contrary to the purpose and intent of the zoning code.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Thus, from the record, we conclude the trial court did not err in affirming the BZA\u2019s decision denying appellants\u2019 request for a variance. As a matter of law, the preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence supports the BZA\u2019s decision to deny appellants a variance to conduct automobile repair work as permitted in a repair garage as that term is defined in Cleveland Codified Ordinances 325.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In the alternative, appellants argue that the trial court erred in affirming the BZA\u2019s denial of an occupancy permit. Appellants contend that their automotive repair shop falls within the definition of \u201cservice station,\u201d which is a permissible use in a general retail business district. Cleveland Codified Ordinances 343.11(b)(2)(I)(5). As previously stated, Section 325.60 defines \u201cservice station\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u201c \u2018Service station\u2019 means a use of premises primarily for the retail sale of gasoline or other motor vehicle fuels and oil for delivery into automotive vehicles, and may include the retail sale of lubricants, tires, batteries and automotive accessories; the rendering of services and the making of adjustments and replacements to motor vehicles; the washing, waxing and polishing of motor vehicles as incidental to other services rendered; the washing of motor vehicles with self-service coin operated equipment without an independent structure therefor; and the making of repairs to motor vehicles except repairs of a major type which are defined to be spray painting, body, fender, clutch, transmission, differential, axle, spring and frame repairs, major overhauling of engines requiring the removal of engine cylinder head or crankcase pan, repairs to radiators requiring the removal thereof or complete recapping or retreading of tires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Appellants contend that pursuant to the above ordinance, the following five types of business fall within the scope of the term \u201cservice station\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">1. Retail sale of gasoline, and the incidental sale of other automotive supplies;</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">2. Services to motor vehicles, including \u201cadjustments and replacements\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">3. Washing, waxing and polishing of motor vehicles, as \u201cincidental\u201d to other services rendered;</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">4. Washing of motor vehicles, with self-service coin operated equipment without an independent structure therefor; and</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">5. Making repairs to motor vehicles, which are not repairs of a \u201cmajor type\u201d as that term is defined in Section 325.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The city, on the other hand, argues that \u201cservice station\u201d contemplates use of the premises primarily for the retail sale of gasoline or other motor vehicle fuels and oil for delivery into automotive vehicles. Going further, the city contends that other incidental services, such as the making of minor repairs to motor vehicles, are permitted so long as the service station engages primarily in the retail sale of gasoline or other motor vehicle fuels.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">While we find merit to the city\u2019s interpretation of Cleveland Codified Ordinances 325.60 and conclude appellants\u2019 auto repair shop does not fall within the definition of a service station, we believe this courts decision in <em>Std. Oil Co. v. Cleveland </em>(Mar. 19, 1981), Cuyahoga App. No. 42537, unreported, is controlling. In <em>Std. Oil, </em>plaintiff appealed the decision of the common pleas court, which reversed the BZA\u2019s decision granting it a permit to operate a service station. Plaintiff had operated a service station since 1958 but removed its gas pumps and, in 1979, sought an operating permit to allow it to operate as a \u201cminor repair\u201d garage. As in the present case, the plaintiff in <em>Standard Oil </em>had legally operated a business in conformance with the zoning code but discounted its main use, <em>i.e., </em>the sale of gasoline, and attempted to continue to operate by performing a use which had been previously permitted only as an ancillary service, <em>ie., </em>performing minor repair work on automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In interpreting Cleveland Codified Ordinances 325.60, this court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u201cEvidence presented to the Board, unrebutted by the City, discloses that Stewart proposes to provide the kinds of minor repair services permitted to be part of the general operation of a service station, but simply will not be selling gasoline to his customers. In other words, what was an ancillary service of Sohio would become the sole service of Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u201cThe City, on the other hand, cites other ordinance provisions to support its argument that by discontinuing gasoline sales and performing <em>only </em>automobile repairs, albeit minor, Stewart will create a semi-industrial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u201cOrdinance Section 345.03(C)(2) includes as an \u2018additional commercial and semi-industrial use\u2019 a \u2018repair garage for repair or painting of automobiles.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">\u201cOrdinance Section 325.60 defines a \u2018repair garage\u2019 as any \u2018building or part thereof in which a general <em>repair of any kind </em>is performed on motor vehicles.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">\u201cIn effect, the City concludes that by no longer pumping gas, while continuing the previously allowed minor repair services, Stewart will <em>ipso facto </em>be broadening the uses of the property, converting what was formerly a local retail use to a semi-industrial use, and thereby creating a \u2018greater nonconformity\u2019 in use which would be \u2018more objectionable.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201cWe disagree. In reviewing the evidence presented in the hearing before the Board, and the language expressly incorporated by the Board in issuing the permit, we find that the appellant would be performing the same limited repair work that Sohio was authorized to do. Unrebutted testimony indicates that Stewart would actually be continuing the prior use of repair and not expanding it as the City has argued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">As in <em>Std. Oil, </em>a review of the record reveals that appellants\u2019 premises has been historically operated in conformance with the zoning code, but now appellants no longer seek to engage in the retail sale of tires and/or automotive security systems. Instead, appellants seek to use the premises for the sale of automobile parts and accessories as well as the repair of automobiles. Moreover, the type of work sought to be done at appellants\u2019 automobile repair business would be the type of limited repair work permitted to be done at a \u201cservice station\u201d and would be the type of ancillary services previously performed at the premises in question as part of the business of providing for the retail sale of tires and/or automobile security systems. In other words, what was an ancillary service of the Lesser <em>&amp; </em>Lesser Firestone tire store or the Chapman Automotive Security System store, <em>ie., </em>the attendant services of installing the merchandise provided at the store, would become the sole service of Mobasseri and Khodabandlou, <em>ie., </em>minor repair work and servicing of automobiles. The present case is, therefore, indistinguishable from <em>Std. Oil, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">First, Mr. Gaeta stated that appellants\u2019 operation is \u201cmechanical repairs, tuneups, brakes, lubes, et cetera.\u201d Appellants\u2019 application for an occupancy permit states further that the business involves the \u201crepair of automobiles, including but not limited to tune-ups, brakes, exhaust systems, shock absorbers, and tires.\u201d Finally, appellants\u2019 counsel represented that appellants operated \u201ca repair, restorage garage.\u201d Thus, the evidence before the BZA demonstrates that the minor automobile repair work to be performed at appellants\u2019 business falls within the realm of minor repair work permitted as an ancillary service at a service station. Moreover, it is difficult for this court to imagine how a service station which engages in the additional service of retail sale of gasoline and other fuels, in addition to the minor repair work permitted at a service station, is less objectionable than a business as' the one proposed by appellants, which does not engage in the retail sale of gasoline and other fuels but does engage in the minor repair work otherwise permitted at a service station.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">However, the BZA could have been concerned when appellants\u2019 counsel acknowledged that appellants \u201cmay have done one or two transmissions, and [they] may have done, in the past, one to two motor jobs.\u201d As previously stated, a service station is prohibited from conducting \u201cmajor type\u201d repairs, which include \u201ctransmission * * * repairs, [and] major overhauling of engines.\u201d Nonetheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>counsel\u2019s forthright acknowledgement of what had happened in the past with respect to appellants\u2019 operation of their business should not impact upon appellants\u2019 rights to an occupancy permit when they seek to use the premises, in a lawful fashion, as a place where minor repair work is performed. We emphasize that any occupancy permit issued to appellants should be limited to the performance of minor automobile repairs as such are permitted at a service station as defined in Cleveland Codified Ordinances 325.60. Moreover, this opinion should not be read to prohibit lawful city authorities from exercising their rights to prevent any unauthorized uses attendant to the issuance of an occupancy permit. See Cleveland City Ordinances 327.02 (enforcement; permits and certificates); 327.03 (legal action by Director of Law); and 327.99 (penalties).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Therefore, we conclude that the trial court erred in affirming the BZA\u2019s decision denying appellants\u2019 request for an occupancy permit. As a matter of law, this court finds that the BZA\u2019s decision denying appellants\u2019 application for an occupancy permit in order to operate as an auto repair shop where minor automobile repairs are performed is against the manifest weight of the evidence. The record before this court indicates that appellants\u2019 proposed use of the premises, <em>ie., </em>as an automobile repair shop where the type of minor repairs permitted at a service station are to be performed, is permitted as an ancillary use at a service station and/or as incidental services at a retail store for the sale of automobile accessories. In either case, such is permitted in a general retail business district. The BZA should have, therefore, granted appellants an occupancy permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">In sum, this court concludes that the trial court did not err in affirming the BZA\u2019s decision to deny appellants\u2019 application for a zoning variance. However, we also conclude that the trial court erred in affirming the BZA\u2019s decision to deny appellants an occupancy permit in order to conduct limited, minor repair services which are permitted to be conducted at service stations as that term is defined in Cleveland Codified Ordinances 325.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error is sustained in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The judgment of the common pleas court is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-10\">Spellacy, P.J., and Nahra, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
