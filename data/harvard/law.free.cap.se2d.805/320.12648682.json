Introduction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   The North Carolina Supreme Court described the State's constitutional obligation to provide each student a \"sound basic education\" in\n   <em>\n    Leandro v. State\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , which was filed in 1997; the Halifax County Board of Education was one of several plaintiffs in that case. In\n   <em>\n    Leandro I\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court declared that the State bears the constitutional obligation to provide a \"sound basic education\" to each student; the Court then explained in later\n   <em>\n    Leandro\n   </em>\n   litigation that \"by the State we mean the legislative and executive branches[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislative branch is the North Carolina General Assembly; the executive branch includes the Governor, State Board of Education, and Department of Public Instruction. The Supreme Court also explained that our state courts are not well-equipped to solve the problems in North Carolina's public schools. The Court approved of the trial court's approach, which deferred to \"the expertise of the executive and legislative branches of government in matters concerning the mechanics of the public education process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court then assigned a superior court judge to oversee the efforts to improve public education in several counties, including Halifax County, and the court oversight started by\n   <em>\n    Leandro\n   </em>\n   still continues today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In this case, plaintiffs are students in the Halifax County Public Schools and organizations interested in promoting public education. They claim that despite years of\n   <em>\n    Leandro\n   </em>\n   court oversight, including countless hearings and orders by the trial court and two extensive opinions from the North Carolina Supreme Court, many of the educational deficiencies described in\n   <em>\n    Leandro I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   still exist in Halifax County. But in this case, plaintiffs claim that the Halifax County\n   <em>\n    Board of Commissioners\n   </em>\n   -alone-bears the constitutional obligation for providing all children in the county with a sound basic education. This claim is not supported by our Supreme Court's holdings in\n   <em>\n    Leandro I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   . And the courts are still ill-equipped to solve the problems of North Carolina's\n   public schools today, while the State-\"the legislative and executive branches\"-still has the constitutional duty to provide a sound basic education for every child in North Carolina. The defendant Halifax County Board of Commissioners was created by the State, and the State has legal power to control it. Plaintiffs' complaint describes serious problems in the schools in Halifax County, but because this defendant-the Halifax County Board of Commissioners-does not bear the constitutional duty to provide a sound basic education, we affirm the trial court's order dismissing this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   II. Plaintiffs' claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Procedural background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case presents a question of first impression in our Court: whether North Carolina schoolchildren may assert a violation of their right to a sound basic public education, guaranteed by the North Carolina Constitution, against a local board of county commissioners for their alleged failure to adequately fund aspects of public schools. This case has come before this Court at an early stage of the proceedings, as the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). At this early stage, this Court must take the factual allegations from plaintiffs' complaint, and treat them as true to determine the legal question of whether the trial court properly dismissed this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridges v. Parrish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353660\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/366/539/#p541\">\n    366 N.C. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=742%20S.E.2d%20794\">\n    742 S.E.2d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 796 (2013) (noting that in an appeal from a trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \"[w]e consider\n   whether the allegations of the complaint, if treated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under some legal theory.\" (citation and quotation marks omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Brianna Silver, Larry Silver III, Dominick Silver, Alicia Jones, and Jamier Scott (\"the students\") are five students in school systems within the geographic boundaries of Halifax County, North Carolina. Latonya Silver, Brenda Sledge, and Felicia Scott are the students' respective parents or legal guardians. The students and their parents and legal guardians, as well as with two interested organizations-the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Coalition for Education and Economic Security (collectively, \"plaintiffs\")-filed a complaint against the Halifax County Board of Commissioners (\"defendant\" or \"the Board\") asserting that the Board's ineffective and inefficient allocation of financial resources resulted in a failure to provide a \"sound basic education\" to all school children within Halifax County, and that such failure violated the students' rights under Article I, Section 15 and Article IX, Section 2 of the North Carolina Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in Halifax County Superior Court on 24 August 2015. In their complaint, plaintiffs asserted that, due to the \"educational deficiencies\" in the three Halifax County school districts, \"merely adding resources to the defective three-district system cannot remedy its constitutional deficiencies.\" Plaintiffs also claim that the Board's \"decision to maintain three racially identifiable school districts prevents students from the opportunity to receive a sound basic education.\" Plaintiffs asserted two claims for relief, both based on Article I, Section 15 and Article IX, Section 2 of the North Carolina Constitution, and requested in part: (1) \"[t]hat the Court find and conclude that Defendant's maintenance of three separate school districts obstructs Halifax County's students from securing the opportunity to receive a sound basic education;\" and (2) \"[t]hat the Court exercise its equitable powers and order the Board to develop and implement a plan to remedy the constitutional violations of its present education delivery mechanism and to ensure that every student in Halifax County is provided the opportunity to receive a sound basic education[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts, this case was designated as exceptional by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, and a special superior court judge was designated to hear the case. Defendant moved to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) on 2 November 2015, asserting that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. After a hearing, the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), reasoning it is not \"the constitutional responsibility of [the Board] to implement and maintain a public education system for Halifax County.\" Plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Facts as alleged by plaintiffs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We recite these factual allegations from plaintiffs' complaint and treat them as true for the purposes of our decision.\n   <em>\n    Bridges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353660\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/366/539/#p541\">\n    366 N.C. at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=742%20S.E.2d%20794\">\n    742 S.E.2d at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Three separate school districts exist wholly within the geographical boundaries of Halifax County: Halifax County Public Schools (\"Halifax County Schools\"), Weldon City Schools (\"Weldon City Schools\"), and Roanoke Rapids Graded School District (\"Roanoke Rapids Schools\"). This tripartite school system was created in the 1960s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As of 2015, the student population of Halifax County Schools was 85% African-American and 4% Caucasian; the student population of Weldon City Schools was 94% African-American and 4% Caucasian; and the student population of Roanoke Rapids Schools was 26% African-American and 65% Caucasian. According to plaintiffs' complaint, the three school\n   districts receive an unequal amount of funding, with Roanoke Rapids Schools-the only school district with a majority of Caucasian students-receiving the most financial support. Plaintiffs allege this funding disparity flows directly from the choices made by the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege the Board has financial responsibility for public education in Halifax County, and has the authority to use\n   local revenues to maintain or supplement public school programs. Various North Carolina General Statutes assign to local governments the responsibility to pay for certain school-related expenditures for the school districts within its borders; the complaint alleges that the Board is responsible for providing furniture and apparatus needs; library, science, and classroom equipment; instructional supplies and books; and water supply and sanitary facilities. To fund these financial responsibilities, North Carolina law allows local governments, if they choose, to collect a one-cent sales and use tax.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20105-463\">\n    N.C.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 105-472\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)-(2) (2015). For counties that choose the Per Capita Method, the \"net proceeds of the [sales and use] tax collected in a taxing county\" is distributed \"to that county and to the municipalities in the county on a per capita basis according to the total population of the taxing county, plus the total population of the municipalities in the county.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20105-472\">\n     N.C.

For counties using the Ad Valorem Method, the \"net proceeds of the [sales and use] tax collected in a taxing county\" is distributed \"to that county and the municipalities in the county in proportion to the total amount of ad valorem taxes levied by each on property having a tax situs in the taxing county during the fiscal year next preceding the distribution.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20105-472\">\n     N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-472\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2). According to the complaint, both Roanoke Rapids Schools and Weldon City Schools levy ad valorem \"supplemental property taxes,\" while Halifax County Schools do not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The Board distributes local sales and use tax revenue under the Ad Valorem Method. Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that because the Board chooses the Ad Valorem Method, a funding disparity exists among the three school districts. Between 2006 and 2014, it is alleged that Roanoke Rapids Schools received approximately $4.5 million in local sales and use\n    tax revenue, Weldon City Schools received approximately $2.5 million in local sales and use tax revenue, and Halifax County Schools received no local sales and use tax revenue, because it does not collect ad valorem taxes and was therefore not entitled to a share of the local sales and use taxes distributed under the Ad Valorem Method. Plaintiffs allege the Board has \"repeatedly refused to adopt\" the Per Capita Method, \"preferring to maintain a public education system that denies additional funding\" to Halifax County Schools.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The Board's choice not to adopt the Per Capita Method \"exacerbates funding disparities already in place,\" according to plaintiffs, by the fact that Roanoke Rapids Schools and Weldon City Schools collect ad valorem supplemental property tax revenue, while Halifax County Schools does not. Roanoke Rapids Schools has \"authority to levy its own taxes,\" and plaintiffs allege it set a supplemental property tax rate at $0.21 per $100.00 of taxable property value within the school district, which resulted in Roanoke Rapids Schools receiving approximately $15 million in additional revenue through supplemental property taxes between 2006 and 2014. Plaintiffs allege Weldon City Schools \"relies on the Board to set its supplemental property tax rate,\" and the Board set the rate at $0.17 per $100.00 of taxable property value, resulting in Weldon City Schools receiving approximately $11 million in additional revenue through supplemental property taxes during the same time period. In contrast, Halifax County Schools do \"not have a supplemental property tax and thus receive[ ] no additional revenue,\" according to plaintiffs' complaint. Plaintiffs allege these funding disparities have had an appreciable effect on each of the school districts' facilities, quality of teachers, and learning materials, briefly summarized below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    The complaint alleges that many of Halifax County Schools' buildings are in subpar condition,\n    resulting in: toilets flooding hallways, forcing students to walk through sewage to travel between their lockers and classes; a ceiling occasionally crumbling and falling onto students' desks mid-lesson; heating and air conditioning systems regularly failing; and school buses breaking down, affecting class schedules and school attendance. The complaint further alleges that Weldon City Schools are not much better off. The high school in the Weldon City School system has a mold infestation, crumbling ceilings, an invasive pest problem, and rodents. An elementary school in the Weldon City Schools system has bathrooms with no bathroom stall doors and routinely has no soap in the soap dispensers. Plaintiffs allege, in stark contrast, that Roanoke Rapids Schools have been renovated regularly; feature computer labs,\n    art rooms, music rooms, and physical education spaces; and have \"pristine athletic field[s].\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Plaintiffs also allege that disparities extend to the quality of the faculty in the three school districts. They allege Halifax County Schools and Weldon City Schools (together, the \"majority-minority districts\") are \"unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of experienced, highly effective, or qualified teachers.\" The complaint alleges 40 percent and 50 percent of the school districts' teachers, respectively, reported that they have insufficient access to appropriate instructional materials, while only five percent of Roanoke Rapids Schools teachers reported the same problems. Plaintiffs allege the majority-minority districts must resort to teachers provided through Teach For America (\"TFA\"), while Roanoke Rapids Schools have no TFA teachers placed in its schools.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Plaintiffs further allege differences between the three school districts' learning materials, curricular offerings, and extracurricular activities, with students in the majority-minority districts being \"frequently forced to share old and worn down textbooks, workbooks, and other classroom materials[,]\" and students are not permitted to take those materials home, making it difficult to complete homework assignments. Students in the majority-minority districts have minimal access to advanced academic courses. In contrast, students in Roanoke Rapids Schools have access to an \"Outreach Academy\" program designed to decrease the dropout rate, have wide access to advanced academic placement, and can participate in \"educational inputs like extracurricular and athletic offerings[.]\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    In addition, plaintiffs allege that the school funding choices made by the Board have also had a negative impact on student test scores in the three districts. Since 2008, Halifax County Schools and Weldon City Schools have had no more than 31.7% and 47.7%, respectively, of their students score at or above grade level on statewide standardized tests. They allege students in these two school districts have consistently scored significantly lower on the SAT college entrance exams than their peers at Roanoke Rapids Schools. While students at Roanoke Rapids Schools have fared better, all three districts have higher dropout rates than the state average, with half of the dropouts in Roanoke Rapids Schools being African-American, despite that group constituting less than 25 percent of the total student population.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    III.

Although we have concluded that the North Carolina Constitution requires that access to a sound basic education be provided equally in every school district, we are convinced that the equal opportunities clause of Article IX, Section 2(1)\n    <em>\n     does not require substantially equal funding or educational advantages in all school districts\n    </em>\n    ....

Because the North\n    Carolina Constitution expressly states that units of local governments with financial responsibility for public education may provide additional funding to supplement the educational programs provided by the state,\n    <em>\n     there can be nothing unconstitutional about their doing so or in any inequality of opportunity occurring as a result\n    </em>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"139626\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/346/336/\">\n     346 N.C. at 349-50\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=488%20S.E.2d%20249\">\n     488 S.E.2d at 256\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

Then, after concluding that the State's overall funding and resource provisions scheme was adequate on a statewide basis, the trial court determined that the evidence showed that the State's method of funding and providing for individual school districts such as Hoke County was such that it did not comply with\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     's\n    </em>\n    mandate of ensuring that all children of the state be provided with the opportunity for a sound basic education.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 637,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%20365\">\n     599 S.E.2d at 390\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Accordingly, our Supreme Court affirmed \"those portions of the trial court's order that conclude[d] that there [had] been a clear showing of a denial of the established right of Hoke County students to gain their opportunity for a sound basic education\" and also affirmed the portions of the order which required \"the State to\n    assess its education-related allocations to the county's schools so as to correct any deficiencies that ... prevent[ed] the county from offering its students the opportunity to obtain a\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    -conforming education.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 638,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%20365\">\n     599 S.E.2d at 391\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    With these principles in mind, we consider plaintiffs' complaint. In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that Halifax County Schools and Weldon City Schools lack the necessary resources to provide fundamental educational opportunities to the children in their school districts. Plaintiffs further complain of inadequate school facilities, crumbling ceilings, leaking pipes, sewage in the hallways, and a lack of adequate instructional materials in the majority-minority districts. These deficiencies result from defendant's funding choices and have led to poor test scores and the inability to retain qualified teachers. Plaintiffs requested, in their complaint, that the Court \"exercise its equitable powers and order the Board to develop and implement a plan to remedy the constitutional violations of its present education delivery mechanism and to ensure that every student in Halifax County is provided the opportunity to receive a sound basic education.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The educational deficiencies as described in the plaintiffs' complaint, which we accept as true for the motion to dismiss, are serious and intolerable. But rather than filing this separate lawsuit, the correct avenue for addressing\n    plaintiffs' concerns in the present case would appear to be through the ongoing litigation in\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    The\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    cases defined not only the essential requirements for a \"sound basic education\" under the North Carolina constitution, but also the entities with the constitutional responsibility to provide that education. In addition, these cases answer the essential question in this case of whether a local board of county commissioners has the constitutional obligation for providing a sound basic public education for the students in its county. The Halifax County schools are addressed in many orders in the ongoing court supervision in the\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    cases.

This Court, however, fails to see any such cause and effect. By holding the State accountable for the failings of local school boards, the trial court did not limit either: (1) the State's authority to create and empower local school boards through legislative or administrative enactments, or (2) the extent of any powers granted to such local\n    school boards by the State. Thus, the power of the State to create local agencies to administer educational functions is unaffected by the trial court's ruling, and any powers bestowed on such agencies are similarly unaffected. In short, the trial court's ruling simply placed responsibility for the school board's actions on the entity-the State-that created the school board and that authorized the school board to act on the State's behalf. In our view, such a conclusion bears no effect whatsoever on the local school board's ability to continue in administering those functions it currently oversees or to be given broader and/or more independent authority. As a consequence, we hold that the State's argument concerning a diminished role for local school boards as a result of the trial court's ruling is without merit.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 635-36,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%20365\">\n     599 S.E.2d at 388-89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The plaintiffs' complaint here seeks to invoke the constitutional rights established by\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    , but then asks the trial court to assign that constitutional responsibility to the defendant county commissioners alone-despite the Supreme Court's very specific rulings on the allocation of the constitutional duties from\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    in\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2987054\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/358/605/#p635\">\n     358 N.C. at 617\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%20365\">\n     599 S.E.2d at 378\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"While it is true that the school boards are not among those endowed with [the constitutional right to a sound basic education] ..., the school boards were properly maintained as parties because the ultimate decision of the trial court was likely to: (1) be based, in significant part, on their role as education providers; and (2) have an effect on that role in the wake of the proceedings.\").

If a board of education believes the funds appropriated by a county to be inadequate, the remedy is in N.C. Gen.

But regardless of the taxing authority of the county, the\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    cases have answered the question of who bears the constitutional responsibility and have addressed issues of school funding at great length.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Plaintiffs also stress the existence of three school districts within Halifax County: Halifax County Schools, Weldon City Schools, and Roanoke Rapids Schools. Plaintiffs allege that \"Defendant's continued maintenance of three inadequately and inefficiently resourced and racially identifiable school districts prevents students in Halifax County from obtaining the opportunity to receive a sound basic education.\" In the Request for Relief, plaintiffs ask:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n    1. That the Court find and conclude that Defendant's maintenance of three separate school districts obstructs Halifax County's students from securing the opportunity to receive a sound basic education;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n    2.

That the Court exercise its equitable powers and order the Board to develop and implement a plan to remedy the constitutional violations of its present education delivery mechanism and to ensure that every student in Halifax County is provided the opportunity to receive a sound basic education.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    As a practical matter, plaintiffs are asking this Court to require that the three school systems be merged, and we must take as true plaintiffs' allegations that having a single school district in Halifax County would allow a more equitable allocation of tax revenues and a better school administration. But the relief requested in Request 3 as quoted above is essentially what the court is already doing in the ongoing\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    litigation. Beyond that, even if merger of the local administration units in Halifax County would ameliorate the problems noted by plaintiffs, this defendant does not, on its own, have the authority to provide that relief. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115C-67 (2015):\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n    City school administrative units may be consolidated and merged with contiguous city school administrative units and with county school administrative units upon approval by the State Board of Education of a plan for consolidation and merger submitted by the boards of education involved and bearing the approval of the board of county commissioners.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n    County and city boards of education desiring to consolidate and merge their school administrative units may do so by entering into a written plan which shall set forth the conditions of merger....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n    The plan referred to above shall be mutually agreed upon by the city and county boards of education involved and shall be accompanied by a certification that the plan was approved by the board of education on a given day and that the action has been duly recorded in the minutes of said board, together with a certification to the effect that the public hearing required above was announced and held. The plan, together with the required certifications, shall then be submitted to the board of county commissioners for its concurrence and approval. After such approval has been received, the plan shall be submitted to the State Board of Education for the approval of said State Board and the plan shall not become effective until such approval is granted. Upon approval by the State Board of Education, the plan of consolidation and merger shall become final and shall be deemed to have been made by authority of law and shall not be changed or amended except by an act of the General Assembly. The written plan of agreement shall be placed in the custody of the board of education operating and administering the public schools in the merged unit and a copy filed with the Secretary of State.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Boards of Education can be merged in other ways. For example, a \"city board of education\" may dissolve itself:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n    If a city board of education notifies the State Board of Education that it is dissolving itself, the State Board of Education shall adopt a plan of consolidation and merger of that city school administrative unit with the county school administrative unit in the county in which the city unit is located; provided, however, if a city school administrative unit located in more than one county notifies the State Board of Education that it is dissolving itself, the State Board shall adopt a plan that divides the city unit along the county line and consolidates and merges the part of the city unit in each county with the county unit in that county and the plans shall take effect on the same day. The plans shall be prepared and approved in\n    accordance with G.S. 115C-67 as provided by general law, and G.S. 115C-68 as provided by general law, as applicable, except that the county and city boards of education and the boards of commissioners shall not participate\n    by preparing, entering into, submitting, or agreeing to a plan, and the plan shall not be contingent upon approval by the voters.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 115C-68.2 (2015).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    In other words, the General Assembly has adopted a comprehensive set of statutes addressing the organization and merger of school districts, and the State retains the power to control the school districts and counties. Plaintiffs argue that only the county commissioners can\n    <em>\n     initiate\n    </em>\n    a merger plan for the school districts, but they acknowledge in their reply brief that such a plan must still be approved by the State and cannot be accomplished by the county commissioners alone. Plaintiffs here ask this Court to overlook the complex statutory framework governing educational administration and finance and to take on the role of the legislature in correcting the deficiencies in Halifax County by ordering the consolidation of the three school districts. In addition, plaintiffs ask the Court to order defendants to make this merger happen\n    <em>\n     without\n    </em>\n    the participation as parties of all three Boards of Education in Halifax County and the entities comprising \"the State\" vested with the constitutional and statutory responsibilities to provide education. Under\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     II\n    </em>\n    , this Court does not have that authority, and this defendant-the Halifax County Board of Commissioners-does not have that constitutional duty described in\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    or even the ability\n    <em>\n     on its own\n    </em>\n    to do what the plaintiffs ask. Although the Board of Commissioners surely has statutory duties related to education, still the State and all of the school boards within Halifax County would be necessary parties to any lawsuit seeking consolidation of the school boards.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    e.\n    <em>\n     Counties are creatures of the State.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    <em>\n     \"[C]ounties are merely instrumentalities and agencies of the State government.\"\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Martin Cnty. v.

The number of counties excluded or included is not necessarily determinative, and a statute may be general even if it includes only one county. For the purposes of legislating, the General Assembly may and does classify conditions, persons, places and things, and classification does not render a statute \"local\" if the classification is reasonable and based on rational difference of situation or condition.

When the General Assembly assigns to boards of county commissioners the financial responsibility for aspects of public education, such as adequate facilities, equipment, water supplies, and learning materials, North Carolina schoolchildren must be able to pursue a declaratory action against those boards to assert that it has failed to adequately fund the aspects of public schooling assigned to it, and that such a failure has resulted in the lack of \"an opportunity to receive a sound basic education in our public schools.\"\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"139626\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/346/336/\">\n     346 N.C. at 347\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=488%20S.E.2d%20249\">\n     488 S.E.2d at 255\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    With these principles in mind, I consider plaintiffs' complaint in the present case. In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that Halifax County Schools and Weldon City Schools lack the necessary resources to provide fundamental educational opportunities to the children in their school districts. Plaintiffs further complain of inadequate school facilities, crumbling ceilings, leaking pipes, sewage in the hallways, and a lack of adequate instructional materials in the majority-minority districts. These deficiencies, plaintiffs allege, are a direct result of defendant's funding choices, and have led to poor test scores by the schoolchildren and the inability to retain qualified teachers. Plaintiffs requested, in their complaint, that the court \"exercise its equitable powers and order the Board to develop and implement a plan to remedy the constitutional violations of its present education delivery mechanism and to ensure that every student in Halifax County is provided the opportunity to receive a sound basic education.\" I would hold that, to the extent plaintiffs' complaint asserts that the children's inability to receive a sound basic public education is a result of the Board's inadequate funding of buildings, supplies, and other resources, responsibility for which was assigned to it by the General Assembly pursuant to Article IX, Section 2(2) of the North Carolina Constitution, plaintiffs have stated a claim upon which relief may be granted to assert their constitutional rights to a sound basic public education.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    II.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    The majority makes a variety of thoughtful arguments as to why plaintiffs' claims are foreclosed by our Supreme Court's holdings in\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    . I disagree, and briefly address those arguments. The majority opinion first asserts that the\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    cases \"began as a declaratory judgment action with the express purpose of determining the extent of the state constitutional right to a sound basic education\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    the entities responsible for providing that education,\" and that \"\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    determined the correct parties and the entities legally responsible for providing a sound basic education under the\n    North Carolina Constitution.\" (emphasis in original) (citing\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2987054\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/358/605/#p635\">\n     358 N.C. at 611\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%20365\">\n     599 S.E.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    374 ). However, the Court in\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    did not decide such a sweeping question; as explained by the Court, the\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    cases were\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n    initiated as a declaratory judgment action ... [, and] commenced in 1994 when select students from Cumberland, Halifax, Hoke, Robeson, and Vance Counties, their respective guardians ad litem, and the corresponding local boards of education, denominated as plaintiffs, sought declaratory and other relief for alleged violations of the educational provisions of the North Carolina Constitution and the North Carolina General Statutes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2987054\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/358/605/#p635\">\n     358 N.C. at 611\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%20365\">\n     599 S.E.2d at 374\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Our Supreme Court never stated that it was determining the entire or exclusive group of entities responsible for providing a sound basic education. Rather, the Court determined the discrete legal question presented to it: whether the plaintiffs in that case \"[had] a right to adequate educational opportunities which [was] being denied them by defendants[, the State of North Carolina and the State Board of Education,] under the current school funding system.\"\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"139626\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/346/336/\">\n     346 N.C. at 341\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=488%20S.E.2d%20249\">\n     488 S.E.2d at 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    do not address whether other entities may be responsible under our Constitution for a sound basic public education.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    It is not surprising that the\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    Courts did not address whether boards of county commissioners had any responsibility for a sound basic education under our Constitution, nor is it surprising that those Courts did not hold that a board of county commissioners may be held responsible if a student's inability to obtain a sound basic education is due to the board's funding decisions. No board of county commissioners was a party to that litigation, and the Court was not asked to determine whether a board of county commissioners had that responsibility. That question remains unanswered by our Courts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    The majority opinion holds that all of the deficiencies alleged in plaintiffs' complaint, including poor educational performance, inadequate\n    buildings, and lack of school supplies at the three school systems located within Halifax County, have already been addressed within the context of\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    , and that \"if the 2009 consent order\" that was entered by the superior court on remand from our Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    \"has been violated, the court which entered that order should address the violation.\" However, as the majority opinion notes, the Board was not a party to the\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    litigation. Therefore, the 2009 consent order-along with all of the ongoing supervision in that case-does not, and cannot, bind the Board or force it to act. While the Halifax County Board of Education was a party to the\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    litigation, it was a plaintiff, not a defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    The majority suggests a path forward for plaintiffs, writing that \"rather than filing this separate lawsuit, the correct avenue for addressing plaintiffs' concerns in the present case\n    <em>\n     would appear to be\n    </em>\n    through the ongoing litigation in\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Leandro II\n    </em>\n    .\" (emphasis added).\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    But the\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    cases' sole focus was on the funding provided by the State,\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    the local revenues collected and disbursed by boards of county commissioners, including the Board in the present case. It is\n    <em>\n     these\n    </em>\n    revenues that plaintiffs allege the Board is failing to disburse to the three school systems in Halifax County consistent with the constitutional right to a public education in the schools in this State. I do not see how plaintiffs, who were not parties in\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    , could assert a claim in the ongoing\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    litigation against defendant, also not a party in\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    , seeking a larger portion of local revenues, which were not at issue in\n    <em>\n     Leandro\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    The plain language of Article IX, Section 2(2) clearly recognizes \"local responsibility\" in public education, and provides that if the General Assembly assigns to \"units of local government such responsibility for the financial support of the free public schools,\" those units of local government may use \"local revenues to add to or supplement any public school[.]\" N.C. CONST. ART. IX \u00a7 2 (2). The drafters of the Constitution contemplated that local revenues, which do not originate from the State, could be used to fund aspects of public education. As explained above, at this early stage in the proceedings plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the local boards of county commissioners must disburse these local revenues in a way that does not violate the constitutional right to a sound basic education established by our Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    , and must be able to be held accountable for their failure to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    III.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    The majority opinion states that, \"[a]s a practical matter, plaintiffs are asking this Court to require that the three school systems [in Halifax County] be merged, and notes that defendant \"does not, on\n    its own, have the authority to provide that relief.\"\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Section III(d),\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . I concur in that assessment, as I too, believe that plaintiffs have requested something-the merging of the three school systems geographically located in Halifax County-that defendant and this Court have no authority to provide. However, plaintiffs also requested that the court \"exercise its equitable powers and order the Board to develop and implement a plan to remedy the constitutional violations ... to ensure that every student in Halifax County is provided the opportunity to receive a sound basic public education,\" and have also requested \"such other and further relief as the [c]ourt may deem just and proper.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    This prayer for relief is broad and if, on remand, the trial court were to make findings and conclusions from competent evidence that the Board had violated a student's right to a sound basic education, the trial court would be able, as our Supreme Court held in\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    after declaring a right to a sound basic education, to \"enter[ ] a judgment granting declaratory relief and such other relief as needed to correct\" the constitutional violation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    <em>\n     Leandro I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"139626\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/346/336/\">\n     346 N.C. at 357\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=488%20S.E.2d%20249\">\n     488 S.E.2d at 261\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted).\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    The trial court would be entrusted with the duty to fashion an appropriate remedy which \"minimiz[ed] the encroachment upon the other branches of government,\" including the Board and the General Assembly.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=488%20S.E.2d%20249\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citation omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    IV.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion's conclusion that the Board is not constitutionally responsible for public education, not even for those aspects of public education the General Assembly has seen fit to statutorily assign financial responsibility for, consistent with Article IX, Section 2(2) of the North Carolina Constitution. I would hold that plaintiffs have stated a claim upon which relief may be granted, to the extent that their complaint alleges that the schoolchildren are unable to receive a sound basic public education, and that inability is a result of the Board's inadequate funding of buildings, supplies, and other resources, responsibility for which was assigned to the Board by the General Assembly consistent with Article IX, Section 2(2) of the North Carolina Constitution. I would therefore reverse the trial court's order granting defendant's motion to dismiss pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6), and remand for further proceedings. I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-219\">\n     Some of the statutes listed above dictate that the financial responsibilities are to be shared between the \"local boards of education\" and the \"tax-levying authorities.\"\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     , N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115C-522(c) ; N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115C-524(b).
