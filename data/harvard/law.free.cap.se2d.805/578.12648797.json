We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case is one of many lawsuits stemming from a child sexual abuse scandal involving a summer camp at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina (The Citadel), and Louis \"Skip\" ReVille. On April 23, 2007, the father of a former\n   camper at The Citadel's youth summer camp notified Mark Brandenburg, The Citadel's general counsel, that one of the camp's counselors had engaged in sexual misconduct at the camp with his son five years earlier. The former camper's father told Brandenburg a counselor named Skip invited his son into his dorm room, where the two watched pornography together and masturbated. Brandenburg subsequently spoke by telephone with the former\n   camper, then nineteen years old, who confirmed that Skip had invited him into his room, showed him pornography, and convinced him to masturbate. After reviewing camp records, Brandenburg was able to identify the counselor as ReVille, who worked at the camp for three summers from 2001 to 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 24, 2007, Brandenburg-along with Colonel Joseph Trez, an executive assistant to John Rosa, The Citadel's president-met with ReVille, a Citadel graduate who had also worked with college students as a part-time, temporary tutor at The Citadel's writing center from August 2006 to April 2007. During the meeting, ReVille emphatically denied the former camper's allegations. Brandenburg continued to investigate the allegations from April through July 2007, and by May 2007, had informed President Rosa of the allegations. On July 1, 2007, Brandenburg traveled to Texas to meet with the former camper and his parents. At some point during that summer, however, Brandenburg fell out of touch with the former camper. Brandenburg then contacted potential witnesses who may have been present during the commission of ReVille's alleged misconduct, but he failed to find one that could corroborate the former camper's accusations. The Citadel ended its investigation without reporting the complaint to law enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2011, ReVille was arrested after confessing to abusing numerous boys while employed in various educational and athletic positions in the Charleston area over the span of nearly a decade. On June 13, 2012, ReVille pleaded guilty to numerous charges involving the abuse of twenty-three boys in Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester counties and was sentenced to fifty years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ReVille met Doe-a young male about to enter the seventh grade-and his family in the summer of 2005, through ReVille's involvement with AAU basketball at Pinewood Preparatory School (Pinewood Prep) in Summerville, South Carolina. That summer, ReVille began \"grooming\" Doe and later abused Doe at ReVille's residence, and he continued to abuse Doe throughout the 2005-2006 school year. At the time, ReVille was a teacher at Pinewood Prep. Doe, however, neither attended Pinewood Prep nor any summer camps or educational programs at The Citadel. In the spring of 2006, ReVille was terminated from his teaching position at Pinewood Prep and accepted Doe's parents' offer to move into the mother-in-law suite connected to their house. While living there from May 2006 to June 2007, and for a short period after moving out, ReVille continuously abused Doe. ReVille's sexual abuse of Doe ended when Doe and his family moved to Georgia in the summer of 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Doe filed the instant action against The Citadel on March 19, 2012, alleging claims of negligence/gross negligence and outrage. In his complaint, Doe claimed actions taken by The Citadel created a risk that ReVille would be placed in positions to enable him to victimize young boys, and subsequently, its failure to prevent this risk allowed ReVille to sexually abuse him. Doe asserted The Citadel was in a unique position to warn or prevent ReVille from sexually abusing young victims like Doe because The Citadel knew of the reported sexual abuse and it had a special relationship with ReVille. The Citadel filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on April 24, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After conducting a hearing, the circuit court granted The Citadel's motion on July 6, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its order, the circuit court dismissed Doe's negligence claims because it found The Citadel did not owe Doe a duty of care to prevent ReVille from sexually abusing Doe. Specifically, the court noted the majority of the abuse of Doe occurred before the April 2007 allegations by the former camper. Moreover, the circuit court found it was \"impossible to differentiate the injury that [Doe] suffered after The Citadel arguably\n   should have stopped ReVille from abusing him from the unquestionably devastating injury that\n   [Doe] suffered from his longstanding, ongoing abuse by ReVille.\" Accordingly, the court concluded Doe's injuries arose before, and were not proximately caused by, any breach of duty by The Citadel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court also dismissed the outrage claim as a matter of law because it was barred by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (TCA) and alternatively found no evidence suggested The Citadel directed any conduct toward Doe.

Under section 323 of the Restatement of Torts, however, this undertaking cannot create a duty unless (1) Brandenburg's failure to exercise reasonable care actually\n   <em>\n    increased\n   </em>\n   the risk of harm to Doe or (2) Doe suffered harm because he relied upon Brandenburg's undertaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884895\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/401/500/#p504\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884895\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/401/500/#p504\">\n    at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884895\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/401/500/#p504\">\n    737 S.E.2d at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Upon our review of the record, we find no evidence supports a showing that Brandenburg's actions increased the risk of harm to Doe. In fact, the record demonstrates that ReVille was already abusing Doe-for nearly two years-when the April 23, 2007 allegations were made. Thus, any failure of The Citadel to exercise due care in its investigation regarding a former camper could not have reasonably increased the risk of harm to Doe when the harm was already occurring. Moreover, the record indicates Brandenburg conducted his investigation as the college's general counsel to \"find out what happened\" and determine possible avenues for settlement for the protection of The Citadel. It was not conducted as part of a criminal investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goode v.

App. 1997) (finding an owner of an apartment complex did not undertake a duty to protect a social guest from a criminal assault occurring at the complex when providing security to the complex was taken for the protection of the tenants and not the general public). Last, because Doe had no prior relationship with The Citadel and no evidence indicates Doe relied on Brandenburg's investigation to prevent further harm, The Citadel did not create a duty when it investigated the April 23, 2007 allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nevertheless, Doe claims the evidence presented at summary judgment\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   established The Citadel violated its own policies\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   from 1998 to 2005 by not investigating ReVille for sexual abuse of children. Additionally, Doe argues The Citadel's policies required action following the April 2007 allegations and its failure to adhere to the policies demonstrated a lack of due care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We disagree with Doe's contention that The Citadel's deviations from its own policies and procedures, both prior to and following the April 23, 2007 allegations, demonstrate a lack of due care and create a triable issue as to whether The Citadel voluntarily assumed a duty to investigate and arrest ReVille for\n   sexual abuse of children. Indeed, we find the internal policies created by The Citadel do not establish a voluntary undertaking of a duty; rather, they can only serve as evidence of the standard of care if the duty was established by law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe ex rel.

However, we again find any purported violation of the policy does not amount to the existence of a duty, but rather, focuses more on the standards of due care establishing the extent and nature of the duty, which would help a fact-finder determine whether a duty was breached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Madison ex rel.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   , Doe does not present any evidence indicating The Citadel actively created a situation that increased the risk of harm to Doe-such as placing ReVille and Doe in the same room, encouraging the two to meet, or placing Doe in ReVille's custody. In fact, no evidence suggests The Citadel was even aware of Doe's very existence before the commencement of this lawsuit because Doe had no\n   affiliation with The Citadel's programs or camps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Furthermore, the evidence does not demonstrate The Citadel was aware of ReVille's pedophilia prior to the April 2007 allegations, despite Doe's claims to the contrary. The record does not support Doe's assertions that The Citadel knew of ReVille's sexual misconduct while he was a counselor at the camp. In particular, Doe asserts The Citadel should have investigated and arrested ReVille when Garrott found ReVille alone in his room with a camper in 2002, and again in 2003 when she discovered him in his room rubbing \"Icy Hot\" on a junior counselor's leg following a run. However, the record does not indicate that any improper behavior was occurring at\n   the time when Garrott \"caught\" ReVille to warrant termination or an investigation. Garrott stated, at the time, she did not think either incident amounted to a violation of the camp policies. Instead, she viewed the incidents as \"lapse[s] in judgment.\" Doe's arguments again \"confuse the existence of a duty with standards of care establishing the extent and nature of the duty in a particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Madison ex rel.
