Mangal was convicted of criminal sexual conduct with a minor, lewd act upon a child, and incest. After his convictions were affirmed, Mangal filed this action for post-conviction relief (PCR). He argues trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to improper bolstering testimony. The PCR court refused to rule on the improper bolstering issue because the court found Mangal did not raise it in his PCR application or at the PCR hearing. The court of appeals reversed, finding the improper bolstering issue was raised to the PCR court. The court of appeals then proceeded to grant PCR on the merits of the issue before it was considered by the PCR court. We reverse the court of appeals and reinstate the PCR court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

App. 2015). Focusing on those facts relevant to the specific issues in this appeal, the victim-Mangal's nineteen-\n   year-old daughter-testified Mangal had been sexually assaulting her since she was ten years old. She described where, when, and how it happened. On cross-examination, trial counsel questioned the victim about inconsistencies in her testimony and suggested she had a motive to lie\n   about the sexual abuse-to gain freedom from Mangal's strict parenting. Mangal testified in his defense and claimed the victim and her mother fabricated the allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mangal's improper bolstering claim is based on the testimony of the State's witness Nancy Henderson, M.D., a pediatrician the trial court qualified as an expert \"in the examination, diagnosis, and treatment of child sex abuse.\" Dr. Henderson testified she conducted a physical examination of the victim and discovered her \"hymen tissue looked very, very normal\" except for a \"marked narrowing\" at one spot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Henderson concluded this was \"a sign of some type of penetration.\" She then testified the victim had been \"sexually abused,\" and that her opinion was \"based on the history [the victim] shared with me and based on my examination.\" Trial counsel cross-examined Dr. Henderson in part by emphasizing her reliance on the victim's history-as opposed to the physical examination-in forming her opinion that the hymen injury resulted from sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury convicted Mangal of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree, criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree (two counts), lewd act upon a child,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and incest. The trial court sentenced Mangal to thirty years in prison, and the court of appeals affirmed his convictions.\n   <em>\n    State v. Mangal\n   </em>\n   , Op.

App. filed March 4, 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mangal filed his PCR application without the assistance of counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As required by\n   section 17-27-50 of the South Carolina Code (2014) and Rule 71.1(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, he made the application on the form prescribed by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Form 5, SCRCP Appendix of Forms. In the blank requiring the applicant to \"State concisely the grounds on which you base your allegation that you are being held in custody unlawfully,\" Mangal handwrote, (a) \"ineffective assistance of counsel trial,\" (b) \"prejudiceness,\" (c) \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\" In the blank requiring the applicant to \"State concisely and in the same order the facts which support each of the grounds set out [above],\" Mangal handwrote (a) \"failure to preserve direct appeal issue,\" (b) \"failed to investigate documentary evidence and witnesses,\" and (c) \"fail to make an additional object [ion] to the sufficiency of the curative charge or moved for a mistrial.\" He also wrote \"will amend pursuant to SCRCP, Rule 71.1\" to include \"new grounds upon appt. of PCR counsel,\" in apparent recognition that Rule 71.1(d) requires, \"Counsel shall insure that all available grounds for relief are included in the application and shall amend the application if necessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mangal was subsequently appointed counsel, and later retained a different attorney who represented him at the PCR trial, but no written amendment to Mangal's original application was filed. Mangal's counsel began the PCR hearing by calling witnesses, giving no indication to the PCR court he intended to raise any issues not set forth in the original application. During his presentation of evidence, PCR counsel asked trial counsel why he did not object to \"improper bolstering\" testimony given by Dr. Henderson, and the\n   State briefly cross-examined him on the same subject. However, PCR counsel did not mention any intent to make an ineffective assistance claim based on a failure to object to improper bolstering testimony until the end of the hearing. At that point, he argued trial counsel was ineffective in several respects not mentioned in the original application, including for not objecting to the alleged improper bolstering testimony of Dr. Henderson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The PCR court denied relief in a written order without addressing the improper bolstering issue. Mangal made a\n   motion under Rule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure to alter or amend the judgment, arguing the PCR court should have addressed the improper bolstering issue. The PCR court denied the motion and held the improper bolstering issue was \"not presented to the court in the application or in an amendment, and no testimonial evidence from the applicant was presented in support of these allegations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mangal filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of the denial of PCR, which we transferred to the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 243(l) of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules. Mangal argued trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to Dr. Henderson's testimony and the PCR court erred by not ruling on the issue. The court of appeals agreed the PCR court erred in not ruling on the improper bolstering issue.\n   <em>\n    Mangal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186604\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/415/310/\">\n    415 S.C. at 317-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186604\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/415/310/\">\n    781 S.E.2d at 735-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Presentation of the Improper Bolstering Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We first address the court of appeals' ruling that the improper bolstering issue was presented to the PCR court, and thus the PCR court erred in not ruling on it. We find the PCR court acted within its discretion in refusing to address the issue. First, the written application makes no mention of a claim based on improper bolstering, and no amendment to the written application was ever made. Second, PCR counsel began the hearing without mentioning there would be any additional claims for ineffective counsel beyond those listed in the original application. Third, even when PCR counsel questioned trial counsel on why he did not object to Dr. Henderson's testimony, he did not inform the PCR court he would make a claim for ineffectiveness based on the failure to make an objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Fourth, when PCR counsel did finally mention an ineffectiveness claim based on the testimony of Dr. Henderson, he did not make the claim with specificity. In what was essentially a closing argument, PCR counsel argued for relief on several unrelated grounds, and then stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   We also brought up the issue of Dr. Henderson. I believe in this case we have no case law specifically on allowing an expert to say in her opinion abuse occurred. She wasn't asked that question. She gave that answer. It did not receive an objection which we believe it should have. It was improper vouching.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There was no further discussion of any claim for ineffectiveness based on trial counsel not objecting to Dr. Henderson's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To the extent PCR counsel's brief statement constitutes a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, we find a PCR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   judge would have difficulty recognizing it. The entire evidentiary presentation at the PCR hearing regarding trial counsel's decision not to object to Dr. Henderson's testimony consisted of three points. First, the PCR court was informed that the State asked Dr. Henderson, \"Do you have an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty based on your education, training, and experience, and based on your findings on examination of the victim, whether those findings are consistent with a penetrating injury?\" Second, PCR counsel immediately commented, \"Which was an appropriate question under our law, I would think.\" Third, the PCR court was informed Dr. Henderson stated she \"believed [the victim] had been abused.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the only evidentiary basis PCR counsel presented to support the premise that Dr. Henderson's testimony was improper bolstering was the fact Dr. Henderson gave her opinion-based in part on physical findings from an objective medical examination-that the victim suffered a penetrating injury resulting from sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In its opinion concluding Dr. Henderson's testimony was improper bolstering, the court of appeals relied on several additional portions of Dr. Henderson's testimony that were not revealed to the PCR court at any point during the PCR hearing. First, the court of appeals relied on the fact Dr. Henderson testified she considered \"the history that [Victim] gave [her]\" in reaching her opinion the victim had been abused.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186604\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/415/310/\">\n    415 S.C. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186604\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/415/310/\">\n    781 S.E.2d at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the PCR hearing transcript contains no mention of this testimony. Second, most of the testimony the court of appeals relied on to support its conclusion Dr. Henderson's testimony was improper bolstering was actually elicited by trial counsel on cross-examination. There was no reference to any of that testimony during the PCR hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally with regard to the PCR court's exercise of discretion in refusing to address the improper bolstering issue, Mangal filed a Rule 59(e) motion asking the PCR court to consider the\n   claim. The PCR court denied the motion, finding \"no testimonial evidence ... was presented in support of these allegations.\" We agree with the PCR court. The most generous interpretation of the improper bolstering claim-as counsel described it to the PCR court in closing argument and in the Rule 59(e) motion\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   -limits the claim to the failure to object to Dr. Henderson's direct examination opinion testimony. That testimony provides no support for the claim other than Dr. Henderson considered the victim's history-in addition to her objective findings-in reaching her opinion that the penetrating injury resulted from sexual abuse. Notably, however, Dr. Henderson did not repeat to the jury the victim's history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   From a procedural standpoint, the court of appeals relied on\n   <em>\n    Simpson v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609181\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/587/\">\n    367 S.C. 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609181\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/587/\">\n    627 S.E.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), which it found \"similar\" to this case, to support its conclusion the PCR court erred by not ruling on the improper bolstering issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Mangal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186604\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/415/310/\">\n    415 S.C. at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186604\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/415/310/\">\n    781 S.E.2d at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   is similar to this case in that the PCR court refused to rule on a PCR claim \"because Simpson did not specifically raise it in his PCR application.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609181\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/587/\">\n    367 S.C. at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609181\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/587/\">\n    627 S.E.2d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First,\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   was an appeal from a three and one-half day PCR hearing, and PCR counsel's intention to pursue the disputed issue was made clear\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   the PCR hearing. The issue concerned an alleged\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   violation involving a bag of money, which trial counsel testified he learned of \"two hours before testifying\" at the PCR trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the State knew about it in time to present a witness \"whom the State called for the specific purpose of addressing the ... issue.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609181\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/587/\">\n    367 S.C. at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609181\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/587/\">\n    627 S.E.2d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The PCR court also left the record open in\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   for the State to submit additional evidence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609181\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/587/\">\n    367 S.C. at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609181\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/587/\">\n    627 S.E.2d at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, on the other hand, the State had no notice Mangal intended to pursue the claim until the end of the hearing, after all the evidence had been presented. Though the State did conduct a brief cross-examination of trial counsel on his decision not to object to Dr. Henderson's testimony, the State had little reason to suspect her testimony would form part of the basis of a PCR claim yet to be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, the PCR court in\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   made a specific finding as to the merits of the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, stating \"the contents of the bag could have been exculpatory,\" and \"this evidence should have been preserved and, thus, been subject to discovery.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609181\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/587/\">\n    367 S.C. at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609181\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/587/\">\n    627 S.E.2d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As we explained, the PCR court acted within its discretion to refuse to address any claim based on Dr. Henderson's direct examination testimony.

And she'll testify the same way in every trial.\" The State argues trial counsel, knowing Dr. Henderson would give an opinion the victim had been sexually abused, attempted to undermine her opinion by demonstrating to the jury that Dr. Henderson's opinion was not based on the objective results of her physical examination, but rather on the victim's fabricated\n   statements. The State argues trial counsel then intentionally invited Dr. Henderson to admit she based her opinion on the truth of what the victim told her. According to the State, this allowed trial counsel to impeach Dr. Henderson's opinion with the weaknesses he had previously shown in the victim's credibility. Otherwise, the State argues, trial counsel was left with an expert opinion based only on objective physical findings-a far more difficult opinion to impeach. We need not decide whether this was a valid trial strategy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We simply find this evidence does not support the extraordinary action of excusing Mangal's procedural default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
