ARTHUR KELSEY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Richard S. Levick and Deborah MacDougall married in 2002. During a divorce proceeding 10 years later, Levick asserted-for the first time-that their marriage was void ab initio. On this ground, Levick claimed that he could repudiate a marital agreement requiring him to pay spousal support and to distribute the marital assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The circuit court agreed in full with Levick's reasoning. The Court of Appeals agreed only in part, holding that the marriage was merely voidable, not void ab initio. We disagree entirely with Levick's reasoning and hold that the marriage was not voidable or void ab initio. The circuit court, therefore, had authority to distribute the marital assets consistent with the marital agreement and to\n   continue its adjudication of the divorce proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 21, 2002, Levick and MacDougall participated in a wedding ceremony in their home in the presence of friends and family. Before the ceremony, the officiating rabbi discovered that the parties had not yet obtained a marriage license. The rabbi suggested that Levick and MacDougall participate in the ceremony that day as long as they obtained a marriage license and submitted the marriage certificate to the rabbi as soon as possible. On January 6, 2003, MacDougall went to the courthouse with Levick to obtain the license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 J.A. at 673, 679, 802.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Levick told MacDougall that he would mail the marriage register out right away to the rabbi,\n   and she agreed and kissed him goodbye.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 683, 803. After the rabbi received the marriage register, which included the license and certificate, he executed the marriage certificate and verified that the parties were married on the date of execution, not the prior date of the ceremony in their home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As the rabbi explained in his testimony, he was \"completing\" the solemnization that began with the ceremony. 3\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 979. His receipt of the marriage register in the mail from Levick and MacDougall demonstrated the couple's \"intention ... to complete the ceremony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 983. Levick conceded in the proceedings below that \"[their] intention was to be\n   <em>\n    legally\n   </em>\n   married,\"\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   he and MacDougall followed the rabbi's instructions, obtained the license, and mailed the marriage register to the rabbi.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 773-76 (emphasis added). Levick understood that they \"needed a license and it had to be signed by the rabbi\" and that \"it was\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to do [so] in order to be\n   <em>\n    lawfully\n   </em>\n   married.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 776 (emphases added). In response to a question asked by Levick's counsel about whether she thought that she was married on December 21, 2002, MacDougall responded that she \"didn't think that it was over\" on December 21 because the rabbi \"had told [them] what [they] had to do,\" and if she \"thought it was all finished, then [she] wouldn't have gone to the Courthouse\" thereafter to obtain the marriage license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 825-26. Under their agreement, the ultimate expression of their solemn intent to marry was their act of forwarding the marriage register to the rabbi for the sole purpose of him acknowledging that intent by executing the marriage certificate. The rabbi identified the date of the marriage as the date that he received the marriage register and executed the marriage certificate.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   at 2 &amp; note 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2009, the marriage began to deteriorate. Levick and MacDougall entered into a marital agreement to \"form the foundation of a divorce or separation agreement, should either come to pass.\" 1 J.A. at 3. If either did occur, Levick agreed to pay MacDougall $150,000 in spousal support annually and pay for her health\n   insurance premiums for the remainder of her lifetime. Levick also agreed to divide equally the proceeds from the sale of the marital home, and, in the event that he sold his company, MacDougall would receive 35% of the proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties filed for divorce in 2011. Nearly two years into the divorce litigation, Levick filed a motion arguing for the first time that the marriage was void ab initio-that is, a \"complete nullity\" under the law,\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647115\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/795/705/#p53\">\n    293 Va. 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647115\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/795/705/#p53\">\n    795 S.E.2d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719 (2017) (citation omitted)-because they had obtained the marriage license 16 days after the marriage ceremony in their\n   home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This time lapse, he contended, violated Code \u00a7 20-13 and rendered the marriage void ab initio, thus placing him outside the equitable powers of the divorce court and allowing him to repudiate his marital agreement. The circuit court agreed and rejected MacDougall's arguments in support of enforcing the marital agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the Court of Appeals agreed that the ceremony-before-license sequence violated an implied term in Code \u00a7 20-13 but rejected the circuit court's conclusion that the violation rendered the marriage void ab initio.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MacDougall v.

Treating the marriage as merely voidable, the Court of Appeals nonetheless affirmed the circuit court's decision to hold the marital agreement ineffectual and rejected MacDougall's assertion that, under equitable principles, the agreement should be enforced even if the marriage was voidable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 81-84,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173031\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/66/50/#p69\">\n    782 S.E.2d at 197-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On further appeal to this Court, MacDougall argues that Code \u00a7 20-13 does not mandate a precise sequence for performing the marriage ceremony and obtaining the marriage license. To be sure, she points out, the statute does not mention a marriage \"ceremony\" at all. Instead, the statute addresses only the broader concept of solemnization. She adds that, even if this Court were to infer a particular sequence for the license and solemnization requirements,\n   a violation of that judicially implied requirement would not render her marriage to Levick either void ab initio or voidable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin our analysis where it will eventually end-with the first premise of Virginia law governing marriages: \"The public policy of Virginia ... has been to uphold the validity of the marriage status as for the best interest of society,\"\n   <em>\n    Needam v. Needam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1971147\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/183/681/#p686\">\n    183 Va. 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 686,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20S.E.2d%20288\">\n    33 S.E.2d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290 (1945), and thus, the presumption of the validity of a marriage ranks as \"one of the strongest presumptions known to the law,\"\n   <em>\n    Eldred v. Eldred\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2013076\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/97/606/#p625\">\n    97 Va. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20S.E.%20477\">\n    34 S.E. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484 (1899). This presumption is not unique to our Commonwealth. \"[I]t will be readily conceded that English and American tribunals tend, in construing the marriage acts, to uphold every marriage, if possible, notwithstanding a non-compliance with the literal forms.\" 2 James Schouler &amp; Arthur W. Blakemore, A Treatise on the Law of Marriage, Divorce, Separation and Domestic Relations \u00a7 1191, at 1446 (6th ed. 1921). In our opinion, this robust presumption withstands all of Levick's arguments against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Levick's main argument is quite simple: A marriage license must\n   <em>\n    precede\n   </em>\n   the marriage ceremony, and the marriage is void ab initio if this sequence is not followed. While we admire the brevity of Levick's reasoning, it illustrates well the trenchant aphorism, often attributed to Albert Einstein, that \"[e]verything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Levick's argument evades a set of conceptually complex yet necessary legal questions: What are the essential attributes of solemnization? Does solemnization necessarily end at the last moment of the marriage ceremony? Are \"solemnization\" and \"ceremony\" exact synonyms, or is the latter simply evidence of the former? Can the officiant and the celebrants agree to extend solemnization for a brief period of time after the ceremony ends and, during that period, obtain the marriage license and execute the marriage certificate?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To answer these questions, we start with the text of Code \u00a7 20-13 : \"Every marriage in this Commonwealth shall be under a license and solemnized in the manner herein provided.\" That is a rather slow start, however, because there is no specific \"manner herein provided\" anywhere in the Code of Virginia. As Levick concedes, nothing in Code \u00a7 20-13 expressly indicates that the license and solemnization requirements must be performed in any particular order for the marriage to be valid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Br. at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does any provision of the Code limit solemnization only to a ceremony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this case, the celebrants and the officiant agreed upon the manner in which they intended to solemnize the marriage. Based on that understanding, Levick and MacDougall obtained the license together and mutually agreed that Levick would mail the marriage register to the rabbi right away. By doing so, they reasserted their mutual intent to marry. On the date that the rabbi executed the marriage certificate, not the date of the earlier ceremony, the marriage began because solemnization was complete pursuant to their agreement. As the rabbi explained, he was \"completing\" their solemnization agreement that began with the ceremony and ended when he received the marriage register and executed the marriage certificate. 3 J.A. at 979.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We know of no statute or opinion of this Court forbidding the celebrants and the officiant from agreeing to this particular manner of solemnization. While it may be unconventional, it should not be judicially deemed unlawful (much less void ab initio) unless the General Assembly has expressly declared it to be so. The legislature, however, has chosen not to micromanage the details of solemnization. Nor have we.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under our precedent, \"no particular form of marriage ceremony is required,\"\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Kuykendall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2158633\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/192/8/#p11\">\n    192 Va. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20S.E.2d%20746\">\n    63 S.E.2d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 748 (1951), because Virginia \"has no official interest\" in the details of \"the ceremony or ritual which surrounds the act,\"\n   <em>\n    Cramer v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2120129\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/214/561/#p565\">\n    214 Va. 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=202%20S.E.2d%20911\">\n    202 S.E.2d 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 914 (1974). What matters is the solemnity of the celebrants' representations to the officiant of their sincere intent to marry.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"The interest of the state is not only in marriage as an institution, but in\n   the contract between the parties who marry, and in the proper memorializing of the entry into, and execution of, such a contract.\"). For the purposes of solemnization, a ceremony merely serves to authenticate the parties' intent to marry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Levick contends that no precedent expressly authorizes the unconventional solemnization that he, his wife, and the rabbi agreed to complete in advance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Br. at 18-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at 787. True enough. But that contention inverts the burden of proof. As the party challenging the validity of his marriage, Levick bears the burden of proving that it violates Virginia law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker v. American Lumber Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2154785\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/190/181/#p185\">\n    190 Va. 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20S.E.2d%20214\">\n    56 S.E.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216 (1949). He attempts to shoulder that burden by asserting that Code \u00a7 20-13 requires every marriage in Virginia to be licensed and solemnized. Again, this statement is true. But, as the marriage certificate attests, the couple was married on January 21, 2003-15 days\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he and MacDougall reaffirmed their mutual intent to marry by forwarding their marriage license to the rabbi pursuant to their earlier agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For over half of a century, Attorneys General of Virginia have been of the opinion that \"Virginia law does not require that the parties to a marriage be in the presence of each other, or in the presence of the person officiating at the ceremony, for the marriage to be valid.\" 1987-1988 Op. Atty. Gen. 316, 317-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1959-1960 Op. Atty. Gen. 219, 220-21 (stating that \"[t]he Virginia statute does not provide that both the parties must be in the presence of the officiating minister when the marriage is solemnized,\" and thus, \"[i]n the absence of a statutory requirement that the parties be in the presence of each other when entering into [a\n   marriage], it would seem that the agreement may be completed at long distance\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It is unnecessary in this case to determine what qualifications or limiting principles apply to the opinions of the Attorneys General. For the present, it is enough to simply observe that if the views of the Attorneys General are even half-right, the solemnization agreement in this case (a ceremony followed shortly thereafter by the issuance of a marriage license, the joint presentation of the marriage register to the officiant, and the officiant's execution of the marriage certificate) did not violate any existing Virginia statute or case law. The \"principal objects\" of statutes similar to Code \u00a7 20-13, which require a license and solemnization for a valid marriage, \"are to insure publicity and preserve evidence of marriages.\" Joseph R. Long, A Treatise on the Law of Domestic Relations \u00a7 60, at 99 (2d ed. 1913).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The solemnization in this case satisfied both of those objects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Levick's contrary view-that \"ceremony\" and \"solemnization\" should be treated as exact synonyms-fails to take into account that the Code of Virginia uses the two words for different purposes in different contexts.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Code \u00a7 32.1-267(C) (requiring a \"person who officiates at a marriage ceremony\" to file\n   the marriage certificate \"within five days after the ceremony\"),\n   <em>\n    with, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Code \u00a7 20-13 (stating that \"[e]very marriage in this Commonwealth shall be under a license and solemnized in the manner herein provided\"). Although the rabbi may have violated Code \u00a7 32.1-267(C) by not filing the marriage certificate within five days of the marriage ceremony that he officiated, neither that statute nor any other statute mandates that the\n   <em>\n    officiant's\n   </em>\n   violation voids the\n   <em>\n    celebrants'\n   </em>\n   marriage. They have no control of whether he files the certificate five, six, or sixty days later. The legal validity of their marriage cannot be so easily extinguished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Levick disagrees, arguing that the General Assembly intended for the marriage to be judicially declared void if the issuance of the license does not precede the \"solemnization ceremony.\" Appellee's Br. at 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 57. However, the term \"solemnization\" does not appear in\n   Code \u00a7 32.1-267(C), and the term \"ceremony\" does not appear in Code \u00a7 20-13. The dissimilar use of these terms implies that the General Assembly has declined to adopt a specific definition for solemnization, leaving the details to the discretion of the officiant and the celebrants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   If we were to transpose \"ceremony\" for \"solemniz[ation]\" in Code \u00a7 20-13, we would effectively amend the statute in a manner inconsistent with our traditional role as mere expositors and not makers of the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Levick also makes much of the fact that the rabbi violated Code \u00a7 20-28, which prohibits an officiant from \"perform[ing] the ceremony of marriage without lawful license.\" Perhaps the rabbi did violate the statute. But his violation of Code \u00a7 20-28 does not affect the only two requirements to create a valid marriage under Code \u00a7 20-13 -a license and solemnization. \"[L]egislation commanding formalities, even punishing those who celebrate\n   marriage contrary to its provisions, or punishing the parties themselves, will not render a marriage had in disregard of it void, unless the statute expressly or by necessary implication declares this consequence.\" 1 Joel Prentiss Bishop, New Commentaries on Marriage, Divorce, and Separation \u00a7 449, at 192 (1891);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2 James Kent, Commentaries on American Law 86-92 (1827) (noting that violations of various statutory regulations of marriage, while they may impose penalties on the officiant, do not ultimately affect the validity of the marriage).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, Levick turns to Code \u00a7 20-14.1, which states in part that a marriage license constitutes \"authority for a period of only sixty days from the date of issuance for the solemnization of a marriage of the licensees.\" The marriage license issued to Levick and MacDougall, however, was obtained 15 days prior to the culmination of their solemnization agreement-the day on which the rabbi received the marriage register and executed the marriage certificate as promised. Code \u00a7 20-14.1 does not address, much less prohibit, the unique sequence agreed to by Levick, MacDougall, and the rabbi. Levick's reliance on Code \u00a7 20-14.1 thus rests on the unproven assumption that the last moment of their ceremony ended solemnization as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In short, Levick has not rebutted the strong presumption favoring the validity of his marriage. Given the absence of any statute or controlling precedent requiring that his marriage be declared void, we have no authority to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On several points, we must regrettably part company with our dissenting colleagues. As noted earlier, Code \u00a7 20-13 does not say anything about the required manner and sequencing of solemnization. Nor do any other statutes require that a marriage in violation of the dissent's view of solemnization be judicially declared void ab initio-a remedy the General Assembly usually makes quite clear when it intends the courts to award it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Code \u00a7 20-43 (declaring bigamous marriages \"absolutely void\"). Because our duty \"is not to make law, but to construe it,\"\n   <em>\n    Saville v.

Levick and MacDougall believed that they were legally married from 2003 to 2013, the period of time before Levick first came up with his argument to challenge the validity of the marriage during the midst of divorce litigation.

A legal transaction deemed void ab initio can be challenged by any person, in virtually any proceeding, for any reason precisely because the transaction, in the eyes of the law, does not exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singh v.

Creditors of one spouse could seek to strip a couple of the protection of a tenancy by the entirety through a challenge to the validity of the marriage, even when the couple is happily married and wants to remain so.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Every legal benefit afforded to lawfully married couples-such as joint-filing status for federal and state income tax filings; rights under wills, trusts, and other estate-planning instruments; beneficiary status in retirement and insurance policies; and a variety of similar benefits that presuppose the existence of a lawful marriage-could be retroactively challenged and expose both parties to the\n   allegedly invalid marriage to a host of unforeseeable financial consequences.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   1 Homer H. Clark, Jr., The Law of Domestic Relations in the United States \u00a7 3.6, at 246-56 (2d ed. 1987) (discussing the \"bewildering variety of situations\" arising from the potential retroactive effects of void marriages on certain rights and obligations that turn upon the existence of a valid marriage).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The dissent's void-ab-initio theory would be particularly harsh to MacDougall. After the parties married, she left a successful career to become an uncompensated chief operating officer for Levick's business and, during the course of her marriage, made $380,000 in personal loans to the business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   These purely financial circumstances served as the principal reasons for the monetary and property-distribution provisions in the marital agreement. The dissent's view, however, would treat her multi-year investment over the course of her marriage as irrelevant. She could not enforce the marital agreement, in which Levick agreed to pay her $150,000 in spousal support annually, pay for her health insurance premiums, divide equally the proceeds from the sale of the marital home, and, in the event that Levick sold his company, provide her with 35% of the proceeds. Nor would she, for that matter, have any other right to seek spousal support or to request a fair apportionment of marital property because, under the dissent's view, she never was Levick's spouse and never had any marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, we disagree with the dissent's conclusion that the subtle complexities of this case boil down to the failure of the rabbi to follow up with the celebrants after receiving the marriage register in the mail. The dissent contends the rabbi should have \"verified the parties' mutual present consent to be married at a time when they had a marriage license.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 792. The dissent acknowledges that, if the rabbi had \"take[n] such action\" to confirm that \"the parties still mutually and presently consented to be married,\" then the dissent \"would agree there\n   had been a solemnization of the\n   marriage after the license had been issued,\"\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at 792, and thus, the marriage would be perfectly legal. The dissent does not identify the specific type of \"action\" that would satisfy this required verification by the rabbi,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at 792, but the dissent concedes later in the opinion that \"contact with them via telephone\" would be sufficient \"to verify the celebrants' mutual present consent to be married,\" which was \"not the case here,\"\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at 793 (citing 1987-1988 Op. Atty. Gen. 316; 1959-1960 Op. Atty. Gen. 219).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This concession serves as an appropriate coda to our analysis. By forwarding the marriage register to the rabbi as they previously agreed to do, both Levick and MacDougall were by that act alone reasserting that \"the parties still mutually and presently consented to be married.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 792. The rabbi executed the marriage certificate in reliance on this intent. Neither Levick, MacDougall, nor the rabbi have ever suggested that the parties had a contrary intent. The dissent characterizes the rabbi's verification of the parties' intent as a mere \"assumption\" that this Court can and should judicially disregard.\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 792-93. We fail to see why we should do so. The rabbi made an assumption, to be sure. But it was the very assumption that the celebrants agreed with the rabbi at the ceremony that he should make and, indeed, asked him to make. Neither Levick nor MacDougall have ever argued that the rabbi should not have made such an assumption. We know of no authority requiring us to declare this marriage void simply because the rabbi failed to make a follow-up call or to take some other action to verify the parties' mutual intent to marry and instead relied upon the parties' agreed-upon manner of verification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Having stated what we do decide, we must clarify what we do not decide.

We thus do not address dissimilar situations such as, for example, those in which the officiant and celebrants make no such solemnization agreement during a wedding ceremony, situations where either celebrant fails to join unequivocally in the agreed-upon reaffirmation of their solemn and mutual intent to marry, or, for that matter, situations where either celebrant outright disputes that he or she ever made such an agreement or reaffirmation.

The Court of Appeals was correct in reversing the circuit court's holding that the marriage was void ab initio but was incorrect in concluding that the marriage was voidable upon the challenge of either party. We thus reverse and remand the case to the Court of Appeals with\n   instructions to remand the case to circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   JUSTICE POWELL, with whom JUSTICE GOODWYN and JUSTICE MIMS join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Prior to today, the requirements for a valid marriage in the Commonwealth of Virginia were clear and straightforward. The General Assembly requires that a marriage be conducted under a license and solemnized. Code \u00a7 20-13. Solemnization must occur after a marriage license is obtained for the marriage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Code \u00a7 20-14.1. According to the majority, however, the strong presumption in favor of marriage allows celebrants to disregard these statutory requirements. As such, celebrants lacking a marriage license may\n   now enter into a \"solemnization agreement\" that delays the effect of their nuptials until they acquire the legally-required license, at which point the execution of the marriage certificate, without more, produces a valid marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I acknowledge the strong presumption in favor of marriage and respect the majority's attempt to honor that judicially-created presumption. However, first and foremost, we must uphold the statutes passed by the General Assembly. A desire to uphold a \"robust presumption\" cannot overcome our obligation to adhere to the clear language of marriage statutes passed by our legislature. As we have long recognized,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   the duty of this court is not to make law, but to construe it; not to wrest its letter from its plain meaning in order to conform to what is conceived to be its spirit, in order to subserve and promote some principle of justice and equality which it is claimed the letter of the law has violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Saville v.

Indeed, there\n   is no precedent for sanctioning a solemnization agreement that requires a marriage be held in limbo until it is validated by the acquisition of a marriage license at some undetermined point in the future. Such an approach appears to be directly at odds with the leading authority on the subject of marriage, which this Court has turned to on numerous occasions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The rule is, that, as marriage cannot be in abeyance, if the thing stipulated for is meant by the parties to delay the nuptials, however briefly, there is no marriage.\" 1 Joel Prentiss Bishop, New Commentaries on Marriage, Divorce, and Separation \u00a7 347, at 144 (1891).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In determining whether the marriage in the present case was solemnized, the majority focuses on the parties' subjective intent, as evidenced by the parties' alleged \"solemnization agreement.\" Our marital statutes are not concerned with the subjective agreements individuals make in an attempt to solemnize a marriage; our marital statutes are objective in nature, looking to whether there was, in fact, an act of solemnization that occurred after a license was obtained, as required by statute. Here, there was no such objective act of solemnization. It is undisputed that the religious ceremony certified in the marriage certificate to have taken place on January 21, 2003 did not occur on that date. Indeed, the majority cannot point to any evidence that demonstrates that the parties' marriage was solemnized by an officiant after the marriage license was obtained on January 6, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The majority is generous in referring to the parties' actions as a \"solemnization agreement.\" In reality, the parties merely decided to go forth with a wedding without the license required under Virginia law because the officiant agreed to sign the license whenever the parties got around to mailing one to him. Thus, what the majority calls a \"solemnization agreement\" was essentially a decision by the parties to circumvent the clear requirements of our marital statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Moreover, rather than harmonizing the relevant marriage statutes, the majority's theory discordantly approves a privately designed solemnization agreement that admittedly violated numerous marriage statutes and resulted in the filing of a marriage\n   certificate which contains demonstrably incorrect information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As no judicially-created theory can validate a marriage that does not satisfy the requirements mandated by the General Assembly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The majority's decision is premised upon the strong presumption of marriage based on\n   matrimonial cohabitation.\n   <em>\n    Eldred v.

However, given the mandatory nature of our marital statutes, any determination as to the existence of a valid marriage begins and ends, not with a presumption, but with an analysis of whether the plain language of our marital statutes has been followed.

Thus, while a marriage ceremony is probably the most common manner in which a marriage is solemnized, it is not the only manner of doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The import of the solemnization requirement is not in\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   it is accomplished; it is in\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   it accomplishes. The most important aspect of the solemnization requirement is its underlying purpose: to ensure that both celebrants presently consent to be married. A proper solemnization requires that the celebrants represent to the officiant their mutual, sincere present consent to be married. \"No form of solemnizing words being necessary, it is sufficient for the proper person, as a minister or justice of the peace, to be present, and take cognizance of the mutual engagement of the parties to assume the marital relation.\" 1 Bishop,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 439, at 189.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   My disagreement with the majority stems from the fact that the majority's solemnization agreement theory undermines the entire purpose of the solemnization requirement because it does not require verification of the\n   celebrants'\n   <em>\n    present\n   </em>\n   consent to be married. Indeed, the receipt of a marriage register in the mail, without more, tells an officiant nothing about celebrants' present state of mind. The majority's theory would allow a marriage to be solemnized based solely on the fact that the celebrants had previously consented to be married.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clearly this is incorrect.\n   \"As, in the nature of the marriage status, it cannot be in abeyance, the consent must be to\n   <em>\n    present\n   </em>\n   marriage, not depending on a future condition, or to be for an instant postponed.\" 1 Bishop,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 238, at 103 (emphasis added). Indeed,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   The entire doctrine relating to this subject is, that, to render competent parties husband and wife, they must ... mutually agree\n   <em>\n    in the present tense to be such\n   </em>\n   ,-no time being contemplated to elapse before the assumption of the status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 299, at 124 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   To be clear, it is not my position that every wedding ceremony that precedes the acquisition of a license results in a void marriage. Far from it. My understanding of the law is that a solemnization occurs when the celebrants presently demonstrate to an officiant their mutual consent to be married. As long as this consent to be married is presently expressed to and, at the same time, received by the officiant when the celebrants possess a marriage license, a valid marriage is created.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stated another way, there must be a nexus where the celebrants possess the marriage license (i.e., the license requirement) and the officiant is able to verify their mutual\n   <em>\n    present\n   </em>\n   consent to be married (i.e., the solemnization requirement). This, in my opinion, is what Code \u00a7 20-13 requires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   No such nexus existed in this case. The record demonstrates that the rabbi had no contact with the parties between December 21, 2002, when he conducted the wedding ceremony and January 21, 2003, when he executed the wedding certificate. Therefore, it cannot be said that he knew whether the parties mutually and\n   presently consented to be married at any point after they obtained the marriage license, including on the date that he executed the marriage certificate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   It is telling that, according to the majority, the solemnization is complete and the marriage legally began on the date of the execution of the marriage certificate.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 779. However, the execution of the marriage certificate is not part of the solemnization; rather, the execution of the marriage certificate is the means through which an officiant certifies that the marriage has been solemnized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 32.1-267(C) (requiring that the officiant \"certify to the facts of the marriage\" and file the record with the officer who issued\n   the marriage license);\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   , at *1-2, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 313, at *4-5 (holding that the execution of the marriage certificate \"presupposes a 'marriage ceremony' solemnizing the union\"). Indeed, Code \u00a7 32.1-267(C) clearly establishes that the execution of the marriage certificate does not mark the beginning of the marriage, as the marriage certificate may be executed up to five days\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the ceremony solemnizing the marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In relying on the perfunctory act of executing the certificate as part of the solemnization of the marriage, the majority's logic seems to be circular: the solemnization of the marriage allows the certificate to be executed while, at the same time, the execution of the certificate solemnizes the marriage.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 783.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In its attempt to rebut my observation that its logic is circular, the majority succeeds in further muddying the waters. The majority responds by stating that \"[s]olemnization by the\n   <em>\n    celebrants\n   </em>\n   permits the execution of the marriage certificate by the officiant\" and the rabbi's \"execution of the marriage certificate is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the celebrants' act of solemnization.\"\n   <em>\n    An\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    te\n   </em>\n   at 783 n.16 (emphasis added). While both of these statements are accurate standing alone, they present an incomplete picture of what is necessary for a solemnization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Indeed, these statements could be read to convey the idea that, by obtaining a marriage license and forwarding it to the rabbi, the parties \"self-solemnized\" their marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   A marriage, however, cannot be self-solemnized. A self-solemnization necessarily occurs in the absence of an officiant. Obviously an officiant who was absent from the solemnization could not witness the celebrants'\n   <em>\n    present\n   </em>\n   , mutual consent to be married. At best, the officiant could only learn of the celebrants' expression of consent at some later time, i.e., their past consent to be married. Our marital statutes require that an officiant take cognizance of the celebrants' present mutual consent to be married. Accordingly, a self-solemnization is insufficient to solemnize a marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Along these same lines, I find it dispositive that, when asked whether the parties had, after December 21, 2002, \"exchanged vows of marriage or otherwise solemnized [their] marriage in [his] presence,\" the rabbi responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   No. We didn't repeat any part of the ceremony. So we did the ceremony just on December 21st and I filled out the paperwork as soon as I received it on January 21st. There is no repetition of ceremony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   He further explained that, when he received the wedding certificate in the mail, he executed it because he \"\n   <em>\n    assumed\n   </em>\n   they hadn't changed their minds.\" (Emphasis added.) In other words, the rabbi admitted that he did not solemnize the marriage after December 21, 2003; he just signed the \"paperwork\" based on an assumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Had the rabbi confirmed on January 21, 2003 that the parties still mutually and presently consented to be married, then I would agree there had been a solemnization of the marriage after the license had been issued. The required nexus would exist as the rabbi would have verified the parties' mutual present consent to be married at a time when they had a marriage license. However, the rabbi failed to take such action. As a result, we are left with a marriage that was not solemnized by an officiant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   This assumption demonstrates another flaw in the majority opinion, one that it never directly addresses: there is no evidence that the rabbi knew that the parties mutually and presently consented to be married on the day he signed the marriage\n   certificate. Rather than address this flaw, the majority appears to take the position that the rabbi's failure to verify the parties' mutual present consent can be simply overlooked by equating past consent with present consent. For example, the majority takes the position that, by obtaining the marriage register and sending it to the rabbi, the parties \"repeated and reaffirmed to the [rabbi] their joint, unqualified intent to marry.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 782. Assuming this is true, then, at best, this merely indicates\n   that, on January 6, 2003, the parties repeated and reaffirmed their intent to be married\n   <em>\n    outside of the presence of the rabbi\n   </em>\n   . It is undisputed that the rabbi did not receive the marriage register until 15 days later. Thus, on January 21, 2003, when the rabbi received the marriage register, he had evidence of the parties'\n   <em>\n    past\n   </em>\n   intent and mutual consent to be married, not their\n   <em>\n    present\n   </em>\n   intent and mutual consent to be married. By any interpretation, a 15-day lapse renders the January 6, 2003 expression of the parties' intent a past expression of intent. It is certainly not a \"contemporaneous expression\" as the majority asserts.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 783 n.16. Thus, it cannot be said that the marriage was solemnized by the rabbi after the license was obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The import of the requirement that an officiant be able to verify that the celebrants possess a mutual present consent to be married is at the very heart of the two Attorney General opinions upon which the majority relies. Notably, the facts underlying each Attorney General opinion demonstrate that, although one or both celebrants were not physically present with the officiant at the time of solemnization, the officiant was in contact with them via telephone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1987-1988 Op. Atty. Gen. 316; 1959-1960 Op. Atty. Gen. 219. Thus, in both scenarios discussed in these opinions, the officiant was able to solemnize the marriage because the officiant was able to verify the celebrants' mutual present consent to be married. Such was not the case here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   I do not dispute that the celebrants and the officiant had an agreement to go forward with the marriage ceremony without a license and that the officiant agreed to sign a marriage license if it\n   was obtained and mailed to him. However, it is inescapable that execution of such a \"solemnization agreement\" could not be accomplished without violating numerous marital statutes and filing a marriage certificate that contained demonstrably false information. The fact that the private \"solemnization agreement\" could not be effectuated without violating statutes indicates that such an approach was neither contemplated nor approved by the General Assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Additionally, I cannot overlook the fact that, under the majority's solemnization agreement theory, it is unclear when, exactly, solemnization occurs. Is it December 21, 2002, the day the solemnization agreement was purportedly entered into? Is it January 6, 2003, the day the parties acquired the license and mailed it to the rabbi? Or is it January 21, 2003, the day the solemnization agreement was purportedly concluded? The necessary implication created by the majority's theory is that solemnization is a process. This indicates to me that, under the majority's solemnization agreement theory, there is no specific date of solemnization, as the \"solemnization\" encompasses the entire time from when the solemnization agreement is entered through its conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This Court has repeatedly admonished that similar statutes \"should be so construed as to harmonize the general tenor or purport of the system and make the scheme consistent in all its parts and uniform in its operation.\"\n   <em>\n    Prillaman v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2055770\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/199/401/#p405\">\n    199 Va. 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20S.E.2d%204\">\n    100 S.E.2d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (1957). With regard to marriage, a number of statutes indicate that the General Assembly clearly contemplated that the solemnization of a marriage would occur at a specific point in time. Notably, several of our marital statutes specifically reference the time or date of solemnization. For example, Code \u00a7 20-45.1(B) provides that marriages are voidable if either of the parties \"lacked capacity to consent to the marriage\n   <em>\n    at the time the marriage was solemnized\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Code \u00a7 20-45.1(C) similarly renders a marriage voidable if both of the parties are not either over the age of 18 or emancipated \"at the time of the solemnization.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 20-90(B) (permitting \"the party who was under the age of 18\n   <em>\n    at the time of the solemnization\n   </em>\n   \" to petition to have the marriage affirmed) (emphasis added). The most problematic statute, in my opinion, is Code \u00a7 20-89.1(B), which allows for the annulment of a marriage \"where the husband,\n   without knowledge of the wife, had fathered a child born to a woman other than the wife within 10 months\n   <em>\n    after the date of the solemnization of the marriage\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) It is thus unclear how, or if, these statutes could function under the majority's nebulous solemnization agreement theory, as there is no specific date of solemnization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Moreover, as the majority notes, the \" 'principal objects' of statutes similar to Code \u00a7 20-13, which require a license and solemnization for a valid marriage, 'are to insure publicity and preserve evidence of marriages.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 780 (quoting Joseph R. Long, A Treatise on the Law of Domestic Relations \u00a7 60, at 99 (2d ed. 1913)). However, these \"principal objects\" of Code \u00a7 20-13 are clearly frustrated by the solemnization agreement theory adopted by the majority. In fact, the majority's theory does just the opposite of insuring publicity and preserving evidence of marriage, because the solemnization agreement approved by the majority allows an indefinite secret period during which an apparent marriage is in legal limbo, known only to the celebrants and the officiant. Furthermore, under a private solemnization agreement, a marriage will only come into being when and if the officiant receives the marriage register and signs the marriage certificate. Thus, the majority's theory transforms the legislature's statutory marriage scheme, which is meant to insure publicity of when the marriage took place, into a scheme in which the actual date of marriage is determined by the efficiency of the postal service and the diligence of the officiant and ultimately results in the marriage being solemnized outside the presence of the celebrants, at some indeterminate point in time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Indeed, in the present case, the parties had no idea when they were actually married because they were not required to be present at the time the marriage was solemnized. Clearly, there is the\n   definite possibility that other celebrants will similarly end up believing they were married on one date, when in fact, their official wedding date is entirely different. As the present case demonstrates, the lack of transparency created by the majority's theory can and will create innumerable problems in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The legislature's intent to prevent such a situation is evidenced by Code \u00a7 32.1-267(C), which requires a marriage officiant to file a marriage certificate within 5 days of the solemnization ceremony he officiated. Unfortunately, Code \u00a7 32.1-267(C) is yet another example of a marriage statute violated by the solemnization agreement theory approved by the majority, as such an approach precludes the need for a solemnization ceremony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Along these same lines, the majority's theory also has the significant potential for abuse. For example, two young lovers, who only met the day before, express their everlasting love for each other to an officiant and express their desire to be married. The officiant informs them that they need only acquire a marriage license, send it to him, and then they will be married. The next day, after acquiring the marriage license, the couple has their first (and only) fight. They break up and vow to never speak to each other again. Fifteen days later, for whatever reason, one of the former lovers mails the marriage license to the officiant. Upon receiving the marriage license the officiant assumes that nothing in the relationship has changed, as it has been less than a month since the\n   young lovers were before him professing their undying love for each other and their desire to marry. The officiant executes the marriage certificate and sends it back to the court clerk. According to the majority, the former lovers are now married. The majority's criteria have all been met: the former lovers had expressed their intent to marry to the officiant, they followed the officiant's \"instructions\" regarding the manner in which the wedding would be solemnized by acquiring a marriage license, and the officiant executed that license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the lack of any authority supporting the concept of a solemnization agreement as a substitute for the solemnization of a marriage at a specific point in time should be sufficient grounds to affirm the decision of the lower courts on this matter, I feel it is also important to point out that the facts of the present case do not support the majority's characterization that the parties intentionally entered into such an agreement. According to the rabbi, upon the discovery that the parties did not have a marriage license, he briefly met with the parties and \"probably said something to the effect of ... whenever you go get [a marriage license] and get it to me, I will sign it.\" Levick testified that the rabbi nonchalantly said: \"Let's just carry on with the ceremony, and get it to me later and I'll sign it.\" Based on his conversation with the rabbi, Levick thought that he and MacDougall were married at the completion of the ceremony and the marriage license was \"just paperwork\" or \"bureaucratic activity.\" MacDougall similarly indicated that the rabbi was rather nonchalant about the lack of a license. She testified that, although the rabbi initially told her to \"[g]et the license to me just as soon as you can,\" he subsequently clarified his statement, telling her that \"[i]t's not a code blue or whatever. Don't worry about it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Taken as a whole, the testimony establishes that the parties and the rabbi had a brief discussion about the lack of a marriage license and the process of rectifying that mistake. The parties simply agreed that they needed to get a marriage license and the rabbi needed to sign it at some point in the future, but there was no rush. There is no indication that either the rabbi or the parties had any idea they were still solemnizing the marriage. Indeed, there was absolutely no discussion of solemnization at all. Thus, the record, at best, demonstrates that the parties and the rabbi thought the marriage was complete aside from the ministerial task of acquiring and completing the license. It was, by their own testimony, \"just paperwork\" and nothing to worry about. Therefore, even applying the majority's flawed solemnization agreement theory to the present case, the decision of the Court of Appeals can be affirmed on the additional ground that there is sufficient evidence to support a factual finding that no solemnization agreement was actually entered into by the parties in this instance. Accordingly, I would\n   affirm the Court of Appeals' determination that the parties' marriage was not solemnized under a license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Having determined that the parties have failed to meet the statutory requirements, I will briefly address the remaining arguments raised by MacDougall with regard to the nature of the parties' marriage. Turning first to MacDougall's argument that the defects in the parties' marriage may be cured by Code \u00a7 20-31, I agree with the Court of Appeals' holding on this matter. Notably, the lack of solemnization after the marriage license was acquired is not a mere procedural defect that may be cured by Code \u00a7 20-31.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   By its plain\n   language Code \u00a7 20-31 only validates marriages \"solemnized under a license.\" As I do not believe a solemnization occurred under license in the present case, the statute has no application here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Even assuming the prerequisites for the application of the statute were met, none of the defects that can be cured by Code \u00a7 20-31 are present in this case. The record indicates that the rabbi was properly qualified as an officiant in Virginia. Therefore, he did not lack authority to perform weddings in Virginia. Similarly, the statute allows for the correction of defects in the marriage license. However, the defect that exists in the present case is not in the marriage license, it is in the marriage certificate. Specifically, the rabbi's certification of a solemnization that never occurred. Code \u00a7 20-31 cannot operate to cure the improper certification of a marriage that never occurred because it only cures defects in the marriage license, not the marriage certificate. Thus, as the Court of Appeals adroitly stated, \"[t]he medicine in Code \u00a7 20-31's cabinet is not formulated so as to spring to life a marriage that, in the eyes of Virginia law, never was.\"\n   <em>\n    MacDougall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173031\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/66/50/#p69\">\n    66 Va.

Notably, such an equitable estoppel argument raises a number of significant public policy questions. Where, as here, the parties have admittedly failed to meet the requirements of Code \u00a7 20-13, the application of equitable defenses would effectively render those same requirements meaningless. Such a radical departure from established law is a matter for the legislature, not the judiciary. As the Court of Appeals explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   [t]he legislature is the rightful branch of government to set Virginia's public policy with regard to an institution so foundational, and of such paramount importance to society, as marriage.

It is factually incontestable that their act of doing so was both a present, unqualified expression of their intent to marry as well as a joint request for the rabbi, upon his receipt of the register, to execute the marriage certificate verifying their continuing, unqualified intent to marry.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    The dissent states that the rabbi \"admitted that he did not solemnize the marriage\" after the initial wedding ceremony.\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    at 792. This is an overstatement. The only admission by the rabbi was in response to a compound question from Levick's counsel asking whether the parties, since December 21, 2002, had ever \"exchanged vows of marriage or otherwise solemnized [their] marriage in your presence.\" 3 J.A. at 1040.

We see these two events differently. Solemnization by the celebrants permits the execution of the marriage certificate by the officiant. The officiant's execution of the marriage certificate is not the celebrants' act of solemnization. It is instead, under the unique facts of this case, the officiant's acknowledgement and verification of the celebrants' contemporaneous expression of their mutual intent to marry in order to complete solemnization. The dissent interprets our reasoning to \"convey the idea that ... the parties 'self-solemnized' their marriage\" because the solemnization was done in the \"absence of an officiant.\"\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    at 792.

In other words, on January 21, 2003, the rabbi could only verify and authenticate their\n    <em>\n     past\n    </em>\n    intent to be married, not their\n    <em>\n     present\n    </em>\n    intent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The majority claims that \"[t]his is what happened in this case,\" yet the evidence unequivocally demonstrates that this is most certainly not what happened in this case.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 782. Here, the rabbi did not receive the parties' present expression of intent\n    <em>\n     at the same time\n    </em>\n    that the parties expressed it; he received it 15 days later.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    Such an approach is not novel. The Court of Appeals has recognized this concept since at least 2009, when it held that \"whatever formalities the [solemnization] requires, at the very least it requires the attendance of both the prospective bride and groom.\"\n    <em>\n     Davidson v.

Again, this amounts to evidence of the parties' past consent to be married; it cannot, under any definition of the term, be considered evidence of the parties' present consent to be married.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    The fact that Code \u00a7 32.1-267(C) provides for the incapacitation or death of the officiant after the solemnization is complete but before the marriage certificate is executed similarly establishes that the execution of the marriage certificate is ministerial and not, as the majority insists, the final step in the solemnization.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    Both of these Attorney General opinions are premised on the fact that, although both celebrants were not in the same physical location as the officiant or each other, they had acquired a marriage license and the officiant was in direct contact with both celebrants when they expressed their present mutual consent to marry. It is this nexus that allows for the creation of a valid marriage. The majority's interpretation of these Attorney General opinions overlooks the fact that the officiant was in direct contact with the celebrants when the marriage was solemnized.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    It is further worth noting other, less obvious collateral effects of the majority's holding.

However, by holding that the mere mailing of a marriage register to an officiant is sufficient to solemnize a marriage, the majority has relegated the role of an officiant from a position of responsibility to a ministerial role. Indeed, what purpose does an officiant serve under the majority's theory, other than to sign paperwork when it is delivered to him or her?\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    While it is true that such a marriage could easily be annulled, that presumes the former lovers being aware of their marital status.

The parties' marriage is not void ab initio because it is \"in violation of [my] view of solemnization;\" it is void ab initio because no solemnization, and therefore no marriage, occurred. For over 100 years, this Court has recognized that a failure to meet the threshold requirements of our marital statutes cannot result in a valid marriage.\n    <em>\n     Offield\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2019242\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/100/250/#p263\">\n     100 Va. at 263\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20S.E.%20910\">\n     40 S.E. at 914\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As the Court made no distinction between the various reasons why an attempted marriage might fail to meet the threshold requirements of our marital statutes, it is only logical that a solemnization without a license and a license without a solemnization lead to the same result: a void ab initio marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Here, it is my position that the parties failed to meet the threshold requirements of Code \u00a7 20-13. Therefore, under\n    <em>\n     Offield\n    </em>\n    , no marriage has occurred; the purported or attempted marriage is a nullity (i.e., void ab initio).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    Moreover, it is unclear why it would be necessary for the General Assembly to declare that the failure to follow Code \u00a7 20-13 results in a void ab initio marriage. Since this Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Offield\n    </em>\n    over 100 years ago, that has been the law of the Commonwealth. Thus, the General Assembly would not need to declare that the failure to meet the threshold requirements of Code \u00a7 20-13 does not result in a marriage. Indeed, the only reason the General Assembly would need to take such action is if it intended to change the law.

Notably, in\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n    , the threshold requirements of Code \u00a7 20-13 were met and, therefore, a marriage was created.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    I recognize that this is a harsh result, but, as we explained in\n    <em>\n     Offield\n    </em>\n    , \" '[h]owever this question is decided, it may result in hardship in some cases, but we think the lesser injury will come from an adherence to the statutory requisites than otherwise.' \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2019242\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/100/250/#p263\">\n     100 Va. at 261\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20S.E.%20910\">\n     40 S.E. at 914\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     In re Estate of McLaughlin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20P.%20651\">\n     30 P. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    658-59 ).
