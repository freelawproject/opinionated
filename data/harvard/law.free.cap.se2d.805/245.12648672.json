McCLANAHAN\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Gregory Edward Leonard II was convicted of driving under the influence (\"DUI\"), third or subsequent offense within a five-year period. The Court of Appeals vacated the sentence for DUI, third offense, and remanded the case to the trial court for sentencing on DUI, second offense. The Court of Appeals ruled that the Commonwealth was collaterally estopped in this case from using a valid DUI conviction as a predicate offense for sentencing enhancement because a general district court, in an unrelated case, previously ruled that the Commonwealth could not use the same DUI conviction as a predicate offense for sentencing enhancement. We conclude the Court of Appeals erred in applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and therefore, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A grand jury indicted Leonard for driving under the influence, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, third or subsequent offense within five years, in connection with an accident that occurred on March 26, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 18.2-270(C)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At a bench trial in the circuit court, the Commonwealth introduced certified copies of DUI conviction orders entered in 2010 and 2012 to establish that Leonard had committed three DUI offenses within a five-year period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2010 conviction\n   order was entered by the General District Court of the City of Virginia Beach and recited that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Leonard was present at trial, was represented by counsel, and pled guilty to the charge of DUI, first offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2012 conviction order was entered by the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach, which heard the matter on appeal from the general district court, and recited that Leonard was present at trial, was represented by counsel, and pled guilty to the charge of DUI, first offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although Leonard did not object to the admission into evidence of the 2012 conviction order, Leonard asserted that the principle of collateral estoppel precluded the Commonwealth from relying upon the 2010 conviction order. Leonard claimed that the General District Court of the City of Virginia Beach, in the 2012 case that was later appealed to the circuit court, ruled that the Commonwealth could not rely upon the 2010 DUI conviction for sentencing enhancement. Leonard introduced a certified copy of the conviction order entered by the general district court in 2012, which noted that Leonard had been charged with DUI, second offense, but found guilty of DUI, first offense. Leonard argued that the general district court ruled in 2012 that the Commonwealth could not introduce the 2010 DUI conviction to establish DUI, second offense, because it found that Leonard had not been advised of his constitutional rights, in violation of\n   <em>\n    Boykin v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771759\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/238/#p242\">\n    395 U.S. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771759\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/238/#p242\">\n    89 S.Ct. 1709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771759\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/238/#p242\">\n    23 L.Ed.2d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969), before pleading guilty to the 2010 offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Leonard maintained that because the issue of whether the Commonwealth could rely upon the 2010 DUI conviction for sentencing enhancement had been previously determined in the 2012 general district court proceeding, the Commonwealth was precluded, under the principle of collateral estoppel, from relitigating this issue. Specifically, Leonard asserted that \"[t]he issue there that was litigated was whether or not the 2010 conviction could be introduced to enhance [the first offense to] a second offense\" and that \"the Commonwealth is trying to relitigate that same issue to try to use the 2010 [conviction] to make this a third offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Commonwealth responded to Leonard's argument by noting that the general district court's order did not provide a basis for the reduction of DUI, second offense, to DUI, first offense, and that in any event, the general district court's judgment was annulled once the matter was appealed to the circuit court. Upon the conclusion of the evidence, however, the Commonwealth stipulated that the basis for the general district court's 2012 ruling was its finding that Leonard was not advised of his constitutional rights before pleading guilty in 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court overruled Leonard's objection to the admission of the 2010 DUI conviction order and found Leonard guilty of DUI, third or subsequent offense, but permitted the parties to brief the issue of collateral estoppel prior to sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the sentencing hearing, the trial court ruled that collateral\n   estoppel did not apply to preclude the Commonwealth's reliance on the 2010 DUI conviction as a predicate offense for sentencing enhancement. The trial court stated that Leonard \"failed to prove two of the elements, litigation of the issue and final judgment on the merits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Leonard appealed to the Court of Appeals, which vacated the trial court's judgment and held that the Commonwealth was barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from using the 2010 DUI conviction as a predicate offense under the enhanced penalty provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-270(C)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Leonard v.

That fact has no bearing on the issues in this case and is not a question the Commonwealth is seeking to litigate.

According to Leonard, the general district court's 2012 finding that he had not been advised of his constitutional rights before pleading guilty in 2010 was based on the general district court's failure in 2010 to note on the warrant that the plea was \"voluntarily and intelligently entered after the defendant was apprised of his right against compulsory self-incrimination and his right to confront the witnesses against him.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The Commonwealth stated as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    I'll stipulate.

As to the latter ruling, the Court of Appeals stated that \"[n]othing in Code \u00a7 18.2-270(B) or anywhere else in Code \u00a7 18.2-270 suggests that the prior imposition of punishment under Code \u00a7 18.2-270(B) is required before a defendant can be punished under Code \u00a7 18.2-270(C)(1). Although that may be the 'normal' progression of events, Code \u00a7 18.2-270(C)(1) only requires that there have been two previous convictions for DUI in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\"\n    <em>\n     Leonard v.
