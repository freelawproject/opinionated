In April of 2008, University Ventures received a building permit and began construction on the land of a 115-room Hampton Inn and Suites, with the construction cost estimated at $7,952,998. The hotel was completed, and a certificate of occupancy was issued on April 22, 2009. The Assessor issued a 2010 tax assessment for the property with a value of $8,180,000, which University Ventures did not challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Assessor conducted a reassessment with a uniform date of value of December 31, 2008. On May 21, 2009, Charleston County Council adopted an ordinance\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   providing for the postponement of the implementation of the 2010 revised values resulting from the next county-wide equalization program until 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Assessor sent a notice of reassessment dated June 30, 2011, to University Ventures,\n   stating the property's fair market value for the 2011 Reassessment was $9,630,000 based on a date of value of December 31, 2008, but was limited by the 15% cap on increases in value at $9,407,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In September 2011, University Ventures objected to the valuation for the property. The Assessor reviewed the valuation and made no adjustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   University Ventures applied for review by the Charleston County Board of Assessment Appeals (the Board). Following a conference, the Board determined because the hotel was incomplete at the end of 2008, the property should be assessed as vacant land and valued it at $628,439.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Assessor filed a request for a contested case hearing with the ALC. At the hearing, Walter L. Ziegler, Sr., who was employed by and performed appraisals for the Assessor's Office, testified the property was valued at $404,000 for both the 2008 and 2009 tax bills. He provided that once the hotel\n   was finished in 2009, the Assessor sent University Ventures an assessment dated May 14, 2010, valuing the property at $8,180,000. He testified the tax bill was for hotel, land, and improvements, which were valued at $8,180,000. He further testified that for the county-wide reassessment issued in 2011, the Assessor valued the property at $9,630,000 but the increase was limited to $9,407,000 because of the 15% cap. On cross-examination, Ziegler indicated the last general five-year reassessment done for the county was based on values as of December 31, 2003. He stated he was unsure in what year that reassessment was supposed to have taken place but he knew it was delayed one year. He also noted that assessment was actually implemented in 2005. He further explained reassessment was to be performed every five years according to state statute. However, he testified the next reassessment was supposed to be completed in 2010. He provided it was supposed to be implemented in 2010 and it was delayed until 2011. He recapped that implementation for the reassessments was delayed for 2004 until 2005 and for 2010 until 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both sides presented real estate appraisal experts who testified as to the value of the property. The Assessor's expert provided a value of the property on December 31, 2008, based on the hypothetical assumption the hotel was complete at that time. He valued it at $8,861,350 for tax assessment purposes. He believed the hotel was 65% to 70% complete on December 31, 2008, but he did not examine the property until 2014. He testified the value of the land alone on December 31, 2008, was $990,000. Alternatively, University Ventures' expert testified the value of the land alone on December 31, 2008, was $734,000. He indicated the hotel was 65% complete on December 31, 2008. He placed the hypothetical value of the hotel on December 31, 2008, if it had been complete, at $8,450,000. He testified the actual value of the hotel on that date was $3,959,400. He provided he had never heard of a building being taxed on its value as a partially complete building; he believed property could only be taxed on the value of the land until the building was completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the hearing, the ALC determined the Assessor had misapplied section 12-43-217 of the South Carolina Code and because the improvements-the hotel-were not completed at the time of the valuation date, the property was appropriately\n   valued as vacant land. The ALC found the preponderance of the evidence supported University Ventures' position the reassessment cycle at issue was comprised of the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The ALC determined the Assessor implemented the reassessment using the wrong years-2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. The ALC calculated the value for the land value to be $860,537 by averaging the experts' values of the unimproved land.

Therefore, in this case, because the reassessment was to be implemented in 2010 (implementation postponed to 2011), the fifth year of the cycle was 2010, and the new cycle would encompass 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. University Ventures maintains the five-year cycle actually ended in 2009 based on looking back at previous cycles and counting forward, making the cycle at issue in this case 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The only evidence in the record about when the five-year cycle began was provided by Ziegler. He testified the previous cycle ended in 2004. This end date is supported by agreement of the Assessor in this court's opinion for\n   <em>\n    LMP Properties\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LMP Props., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 403 S.C. at 197, 743 S.E.2d at 89 (providing that at a contested case hearing before the ALC at which the Assessor sought review of the Board's decision, \"the parties[, including the Assessor,] agreed that the date for valuing the properties was December 31, 2003, because 2004 was the year of the countywide reassessment\"). Additionally, although not binding on us, the ALC has recognized in several cases in which the Assessor was a party that 1999 was a reassessment year, although the Assessor ultimately delayed the implementation by two years to 2001.\n   <em>\n    See Northbridge Assocs., LLC v. Charleston Cty. Assessor\n   </em>\n   , 03-ALJ-17-0148-CC (filed Mar. 30, 2004);\n   <em>\n    Charleston Cty. Assessor v.

The fact that 1999 was a reassessment year supports\n   Ziegler's testimony that 2004 was the end of the subsequent reassessment cycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Assessor's repeated pattern of delaying the implementation year for reassessment has resulted in confusion and inconsistency because it has created a six-year cycle. However, the statute is clear the delay only applies to the implementation; any delay should have no impact on the five-year reassessment cycle. The confusion over which value to use for the hotel seems to have arisen in part from the Assessor delaying the 1999 reassessment to 2001, instead of 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Assessor caused the problem by confusing\n   <em>\n    the permissible one-year delay in implementation\n   </em>\n   with an impermissible delay in starting\n   <em>\n    the clock running\n   </em>\n   on the five-year cycle. The only evidence in the record supports the ALC's determination the Assessor incorrectly calculated the five-year reassessment period and the relevant period actually ended in 2009. The evidence further supports the ALC's finding the Assessor's reasoning for its actions unconvincing. Therefore, we affirm these findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Whether it is complete and fit for use is demonstrated \"by the issuance of the certificate of\n   occupancy,\" which did not occur until 2009.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2012-37-670\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 12-37-670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B). A hypothetical value of what the hotel would have been worth on December 31, 2008, if it was completed is not the proper value to use for the 2011 Reassessment. It would produce an absurd result for the property to be valued as if a finished hotel were on it when that was not the case. It also would be absurd for the property to be assessed as a completed hotel one year, revert to vacant land for the reassessment year, and then return to the value at which it was originally assessed for the following year's assessment, as the ALC determined should happen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The value of the completed hotel was calculated at a date after the date of valuation for reassessment. Because its valuation had already been updated and was the most current, it did not need to be reassessed. If reassessed values had gone into effect the year before they did, the value of the completed hotel would have been what was assessed and not changed the following years. The purpose of reassessment is for property values to be up to date but also all evaluated at the same time. However, the statute specifically provides that if a property has improvements or additions, which by definition includes new construction, those improvements are eligible to be assessed once completed. Because the hotel was completed after valuation was finished for other properties in Charleston County, the initial finished value is the correct value to use. Therefore, the ALC erred in valuing the property as vacant land for the 2011 reassessment. Accordingly, that determination is reversed and instead the property should be valued at $8.18 million as it was when it was first completed and assessed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The ALC correctly determined Charleston had delayed its reassessment by more than the one year allowed by the\n   Legislature.
