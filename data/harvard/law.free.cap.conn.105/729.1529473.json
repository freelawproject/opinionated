In the night of November 19th, 1924, damage was done to the house and contents by smoke and soot caused by a defect in or by defective action of the furnace and oil-heating device. The house and contents were insured in a total sum of $13,000 under the standard form of fire insurance policies, \u201cagainst all direct loss or damage by fire\u201d occasioned to the house and its contents. When the fire was discovered by the plaintiff he at once turned off the switch and thus shut off the oil supply of the heater, and by this means put out the fire. The trial court has expressly found that the fire which caused this damage was all the time inside and never outside the oil-heating furnace. By motion to correct the finding, the plaintiff seeks to establish that the fire had escaped from the furnace and had ignited a board on the ceiling of the cellar above the furnace; that this board was aflame when he discovered the difficulty, and that he extinguished this flame by using the fire extinguisher. This was the substance of his own testimony at the trial as certified to this court. On the other hand, evidence given by two insurance adjusters who made an examination of the premises, is also certified, and they say there was no charring or other evidence of the presence of any flame outside the furnace itself. This of course tended directly to contradict the testimony of the plaintiff upon this point. There was introduced, however, a piece of circumstantial evidence\u2014the board which the plaintiff claimed was aflame when he entered the cellar. The plaintiff claimed that the condition of this board showed the direct action of flame, while the witnesses for the defense insisted that it did not, but that its condition was the result of smoke and soot only. It is clear that the question whether there was or was not fire outside the furnace was a disputed one, Upon the whole evidence the trial court reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the conclusion that this claim of the plaintiff was not established. Were all the evidence before us, a correction of this finding could be made by this court, but this board, which may well have had an important bearing upon the conclusion of the trial court, is not before us. We therefore cannot decide that the conclusion was an unreasonable one under the circumstances. The trial court also refused to find some subordinate facts as testified to by the plaintiff, to the effect that the \u201coil burner and furnace were a mass of flames when the fire was discovered,\u201d and'that \u201cthe fire extinguisher was played on a board nailed to the ceiling.\u201d It was the province of the trial court to determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was correct or was mistaken or untrue. The finding that there was no fire outside the furnace, however, is necessarily against the plaintiff\u2019s evidence in these particulars. For reasons already stated, we cannot say that the -conclusion is an unreasonable one upon all the evidence, and paragraph four of the finding of the trial court must therefore stand, save that we strike out the words \u201cand also used a fire extinguisher,\u201d and change the word \u201cagencies\u201d to \u201cagency.\u201d In this situation, therefore, the only remaining question is whether, upon the facts disclosed by the findings, the fire was one for the results of which the defendants are liable under the terms of their policy, or, in other words, whether the plaintiff\u2019s damage, caused by the smoke and soot from a fire which was confined to the furnace, was a \u201cdirect loss or damage by fire\u201d within the proper meaning of that term as used in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">It is not entirely clear whether the plaintiff claims that this fire\u2014even though it did not escape from the furnace\u2014was a \u201chostile fire.\u201d Two contentions only are made in the brief; that the finding by correction should show the fire <em>did </em>escape and that so <em>escaping </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>it created liability as a hostile fire even though it did not in fact burn any property but did damage by soot and smoke only.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Since the finding must stand, it conclusively appears that the flame did not escape from the furnace and the damage which was caused was the result of the defective operation of the fire in the interior of the furnace. The reasons of appeal may, however, be construed as somewhat broader than the brief, and the arguments of counsel also assumed a wider range, and since it is also a question of considerable public interest and importance, we shall consider whether a fire thus confined to the furnace can be said to be a \u201chostile fire\" and within the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The term \u201cdirect loss or damage by fire,\" contained in the policy, raises two questions\u2014what is a \u201cfire\" as the term is thus used, and what is a \u201cdirect loss or damage\u201d as there meant?</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The word \u201cfire,\" in insurance, does not have the technical meaning which is developed from a scientific analysis of its nature and properties, but more nearly that which conforms to the popular understanding of the word. \u201cIt is rather an effect, than an elementary principle; it is the effect of combustion, and is equivalent to ignition or burning; yet heat is not \u2018fire.\u2019 Timber may be contracted from the heat of the sun, and a loss be thereby sustained, yet it is not a loss by \u2018fire,' \u201d but \u201cthere may be a loss from heat, and \u2018fire,' nevertheless, be the proximate cause of such loss.\u201d 4 Joyce on Insurance, p. 4719. So a loss by the breaking of electrical machinery as the result of the direct operation of fire upon it, has been held to be a loss from \u201cfire,\u201d though nothing was in fact consumed. <em>Lynn Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Meriden Fire Ins. Co., </em>158 Mass. 570, 33 N. E. 690. In Richards on Insurance Law (3d Ed.) at page 284, it is said: \u201cLoss by fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>means the result of the ignition of the property insured or of some substance near it. Thus, the action of fire in charring, scorching, cracking, smoking or heating may be included though no flame be seen.\u201d And citing, in support of the latter Statement, <em>Scripture </em>v. <em>Lowell Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>64 Mass. (10 Cush.) 356, 57 Amer. Dec. 111; <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Phenix Ins. Co., </em>132 N. Y. 298, 30 N. E. 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In a case in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut, it appeared that a steamer was injured by a collision and sank to her promenade deck, but continued to float until a fire broke out which resulted in destroying her buoyancy so that she sank. She was raised and repaired at a cost of $84,000. It was found that if the fire had not broken out the boat would not have sunk but could have been towed to a dock and repaired for $15,000. It was held that the difference between these figures\u2014$69,000\u2014was the loss proximately caused by the fire, though much of it, of course, was not the result of actual burning. <em>Norwich &amp; N. </em>F. <em>Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Western Mass. Ins. Co., </em>34 Conn. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">It was early held that the word \u201cfire\u201d as used in policies of fire insurance meant \u201chostile fire\u201d as distinguished from \u201cfriendly fire.\u201d The leading case is that of <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>4 Campb. 360, 128 English Reprint, 1104. In that case nothing was consumed by fire, but, by improper management of the heating apparatus, heat, smoke and soot were emitted without any escape of the fire from the place where it was designed to be and the loss.by heat, smoke and soot was held not covered by a policy against loss by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In both the <em>Lynn Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>and <em>Norwich &amp; New York Transportation Co. </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>the fire which caused the loss had escaped from the place where it wag intended to be; and go was a \u201c.hostile fire,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>In a case arising in Georgia, a fire was built in a stove on the ground floor of the building, and the stovepipe extended through the ceiling and through the second story of the building. The pipe became disengaged at the ceiling of the second floor. Smoke and soot escaped into the second-story room and damaged goods situated there, but it was not shown that fire occurred outside the stove. The court held that the fire was a \u201cfriendly fire,\u201d and that the damage was not a loss by \u201cfire.\u201d The court said: \u201cIt does not appear . . . that there was any fire in or about the building, except in the stove where it was intended to be built. This fire did not spread from where it was built and intended to remain. It was, therefore, all the time during the alleged injury and damage to the goods, what is termed in the books a 'friendly\u2019 and not a 'hostile\u2019 fire.\u201d The court added: \u201cIt is true that there is sound authority for the proposition that an insured can recover loss occasioned by smoke, soot, etc., thrown out by a fire; but we think in these cases it will be found that such matter causing injury was the product of a hostile fire.\u201d <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Phenix Ins. Co., </em>110 Ga. 563, 567, 35 S. E. 775, 776. We find few and scant criticisms of the rule. One occurs in Wisconsin, where it was argued that <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Drew </em>was not, when properly analyzed, an authority for the distinction. A very exhaustive dissenting opinion in that case, however, maintains the contrary and seems well supported by the leading cases and textbooks. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Queen Ins. Co., </em>140 Wis. 388, 395, 122 N. W. 1038. In that case the majority opinion suggests the test to be, in effect, whether \u201cthe fire was extraordinary and unusual, unsuitable for the purpose intended, and in a measure, uncontrollable . . . inherently dangerous because of unsuitable material used.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>This was clearly based upon the facts of that particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">While the use of the term \u201chostile fire\u201d does suggest, superficially, any fire which by getting beyond control or operating in a manner different from that expected or designed, causes damage, as in the Wisconsin case, yet when fully considered, it'becomes obvious that the wide range of circumstances upon which liability would thus depend would tend to render each case mostly a law unto itself and introduce elements of great uncertainty in determining the rights of the parties. Whether changing instrumentalities of heating and lighting, use of electrical current, etc., may sometime bring about a modification of the rule, we do not need to anticipate. Though the present distinction may seem abritrary, yet it is of long standing, makes for certainty in the ascertainment of rights, and has been acted upon in the writing of so vast a number of insurance contracts throughout this country, that its soundness may not, at this time, be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The rule has had well nigh universal approval in those courts in this country where the question has directly arisen and by text-writers generally. <em>Way </em>v. <em>Abington Mutual Fire Ins.
