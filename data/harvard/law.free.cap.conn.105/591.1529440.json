The plaintiffs filed a general denial. The plea was sustained, judgment was rendered accordingly, in each case, for the defendants, and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The facts material to the issues involved in the plea are stated by the finding as follows: Erma Pallanck was employed by defendant Daniel J. Donovan, through his wife, the other defendant, to do housework and work incidental thereto, in their home in Meriden. For some three years before the date of the accident she was so employed after school hours and sometimes for whole days when school was not in session. Wages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>according to the amount of work done, were paid her regularly each week on Saturday. For two weeks before the accident she had been regularly employed doing household work at wages of $5 per week. Defendant Daniel J. Donovan conducted a meat market in Middletown, regularly employed therein five or more persons, and had not given notice that he would not accept liability under the Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">It is further found that no notice was given by either defendant to either plaintiff, until the filing of the plea, that by reason of the employment of five or more persons, defendant Daniel J. Donovan came within the provisions of the Act, but this is unimportant, as the statute requires no such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Since the finding is that Donovan employed five or more persons in his meat business at Middletown, it is unnecessary to determine whether the plaintiff Erma Pallanck could, if necessary, be counted, with the employees in the meat market, in order to make up the five or more necessary to bring her employer under the Act. We note in passing, however, that the compensation commissioners appear to have uniformly held that all who are employees of a common employer within the definition of the Compensation Act (Chapter 306 of the Public Acts of 1921, \u00a7 11) should be counted for this purpose, including persons employed otherwise than in the employer\u2019s business, provided their employment was not also of a casual nature. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Twiss, </em>1 Conn. Comp. Dec. 420, 425; <em>Coady </em>v. <em>Igo, </em>1 Conn. Comp. Dec. 576, 584; <em>Pilagree </em>v. <em>Jorgensen, </em>2 Conn. Comp. Dec. 289; <em>Rekofskin </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>3 Conn. Comp. Dec. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The only question which is so raised by the appeals as to be available to the appellants is whether the nature of Erma Pallanck\u2019s employment was such as to place her outside the definition of an employee to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>whom the Compensation Act is applicable. Such an employee is defined as \u201cany person who has entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer . . . ; but said term shall not be construed to include . . . (b) one whose employment is of a casual nature, and who is employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employer\u2019s trade or business.\u201d Public Acts of 1921, Chap. 306, \u00a7 11. Since Donovan\u2019s business was that of conducting a meat market, she was, manifestly, employed otherwise than for the purpose of that business, but to bring her within the exception her employment must <em>also </em>have been \u201cof a casual nature.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Twiss, </em>90 Conn. 444, 452, 97 Atl. 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">\u201cCasual\u201d employment as used in our Act has been construed as meaning occasional or incidental employment, which comes without regularity; if the employment be for a definite time, as for a week or a month, it is not casual; so, too, if it is for a part of one\u2019s time at regularly recurring periods. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Twiss, supra, </em>451; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>95 Conn. 160, 165, 111 Atl. 65; Honold, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, p. 203. \u201cOrdinarily . . . where one is employed to do a particular part of a service recurring somewhat regularly with the fair expectation of continuing for a reasonable time,\u201d the employment is not casual. Honold, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, p. 201; <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>James Black Masonry &amp; Contracting Co., </em>192 Mich. 400, 158 N. W. 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In <em>Dewhurst </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>L. R. (1908) 2 K. B. Div. 754, cited in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Twiss, </em>a charwoman who went regularly on certain fixed days to the same employer, but worked on other days for other people, was held to be a periodical and not a casual employee. In <em>Bayon </em>v. <em>Beckley, </em>1 Conn. Comp. Dec. 69, 73 (89 Conn. 154, 93 Atl. 139), the compensation commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>sioner held, in conformity to <em>Dewhurst </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>that the employment of a claimant who worked at housecleaning for the respondent on Thursdays \u201cwas clearly periodic, and possessed the same elements of permanence as are found in the ordinary contract of employment, in that it started at a definite time and was to continue until properly terminated in a legal manner,\u201d and hence was not casual. Analogous rulings have been made in <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Glastonbury, </em>1 Conn. Comp. Dec. 637; <em>Pilagree </em>v. <em>Jorgensen, </em>2 Conn. Comp. Dec. 289; <em>Knapman </em>v. <em>Bruyere, </em>2 Conn. Comp Dec. 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Upon the facts found Erma Pallanck\u2019s employment was not \u201coccasional or incidental\u201d but \u201cstable and regular,\u201d and so not casual in nature within the meaning of our Compensation Act. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Twiss, supra, </em>pages 451, 452. She was therefore an employee, as defined by the Act, and her right to compensation and the forum for prosecution of her claim were exclusively as provided therein. Public Acts of 1921, Chap. 306, \u00a7 1. The pleas in abatement and to the jurisdiction were properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">There is no error in either case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
