Plaintiffs assert that: (1) the \u201cowned property\u201d exclusion in the insurance policy did not relieve Franklin from its duty to defend and indemnify them for cleanup costs associated with both soil and groundwater contamination, and, in any event, the absence of an alienated property exclusion in the policy rendered the \u201cowned property\u201d exclusion ambiguous; and (2) the \u201cbusiness risks\u201d exclusion in the policy did not relieve the insurer of its duty to defend and indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">As to those claims related to the groundwater contamination, we hold that the \u201cowned property\u201d exclusion does not preclude coverage for defense and indemnification related to groundwater contamination. <em>See Morrone v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411, 662 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1995). Regarding the claims related to soil contamination damages, we are constrained by the holding in <em>State, Dep\u2019t of Envt\u2019l Protec. v. Signo Trading Int'l Inc., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>51, 612 A.2d 932 (1992), to conclude that the policy bars coverage for on site soil contamination under the \u201cowned property\u201d exclusion and will not discuss the issue further. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>We reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the absence of an alienated property exclusion causes an invalidation of the \u201cowned property\u201d exclusion when the insured property is transferred. Further, the policy includes an exclusion for \u201clocations not insured\u201d that effectively operates as an alienated property exclusion. The issue of whether the \u201cbusiness risks\u201d exclusion in the policy bars the groundwater damage claims cannot be decided on this record because it is not clear whether the groundwater contamination resulted from plaintiffs\u2019 personal or business activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In July 1992, Anthony D\u2019Altrui and John P.J. Papa, partners, trading as RAAD Associates, a New Jersey partnership (RAAD), filed a complaint in the Law Division <em>(\u201cAltrui </em>suit\u201d) against Elizabethtown Gas Company (Elizabethtown), Frank J. Banisch, III, individually and trading as Banisch Associates (referred to collectively as Banisch) and Eugene and Dixie Kentopp, husband and wife, seeking damages for contamination and remediation of property purchased by RAAD from the Kentopps. Elizabethtown allegedly owned a coal gasification operation \u201ccontiguous to the site [purchased by RAAD] on the same side of Bush Kill Creek and on the opposite side of Bush Kill Creek\u201d that produced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that contaminated the soil on the property purchased by RAAD from the Kentopps. RAAD also asserted that Banisch, a New Jersey licensed planner and potential investor in the development of the site, negligently failed to alert RAAD to \u201cany potential environmental concern at, in, under or adjoining the Site\u201d prior to RAAD\u2019s acquisition of the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">On September 18, 1992, the Kentopps and RAAD executed a stipulation of dismissal and settlement in the action. By letter dated April 6, 1993, Franklin declined to indemnify or defend the Kentopps. RAAD filed an amended complaint on October 14, 1993, adding Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Company (Jersey Central), as a defendant. The complaint alleged that Jersey Central was the successor to companies who had owned and operated the coal gasification operation on the Flemington site now owned by Elizabethtown. Despite the release, the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>complaint asserted a breach of contract claim against the Kentopps, specifying that they breached their agreement with RAAD to indemnify and hold it harmless from all claims and liability arising from contamination of the property sold to RAAD, and that the Kentopps breached their agreement to immediately remediate the property or advance money to RAAD for that purpose. Banisch and Elizabethtown filed answers and cross-claimed against the Kentopps for contribution and indemnification. On June 24, 1994, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment to dismiss the cross-claims for indemnification brought pursuant to the Comparative Negligence Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1 to -5.4, was granted, leaving the cross-claims for common law indemnification and contribution pursuant to the Spill Compensation and Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A, </em>58:10-23.11 to -23.11z.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">On August 11, 1993, the Kentopps filed this action against Franklin seeking a declaration that it must defend and indemnify plaintiffs against all claims asserted by RAAD, Elizabethtown and Banisch in the <em>D\u2019Altrui </em>lawsuit. Franklin filed an answer with a counterclaim for a declaration that it had no duty either to defend or to indemnify plaintiffs. Both parties moved for summary judgment and on January 6, 1995, summary judgment was granted in favor of Franklin declaring that it had no duty to defend or indemnify plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Plaintiffs had owned the site in Flemington from November 3, 1972, until March 12,1991, when they sold it to RAAD. The home the Kentopps resided in and a separate garage were located on the property. They operated a transmission repair shop in a portion of the garage until 1983, and rented the garage to various persons who operated automobile repair businesses on the premises. In October 1990 plaintiffs removed an underground storage tank used for oil heating. The removal had been inspected by a DEP inspector who determined that there was no evidence of environmental contamination from the tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">RAAD demolished the garage and planned on converting the residence to office space. It hired a planning consultant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>inventory potential environmental hazards at the site. The consultant could not determine if hazardous substances were spilled at the site and recommended environmental testing by the DEP. A report dated April 1992 by an engineering concern hired by RAAD to conduct soil samplings at the site indicated that hazardous materials were found in the soil. The report noted that \u201cenvironmentally significant levels of carcinogenic PAH [polyaromatic hydrocarbon] compounds\u201d were found in soil samples collected at the site. It concluded that \u201ca likely source\u201d of the carcinogen PAH was the former coal gasification operations located on adjacent property owned by Elizabethtown. However, the report also suggested that a foundry believed to have been operated on the site of plaintiffs\u2019 property over sixty years ago could be a source of \u201csimilar wastes by virtue of the operation of high temperature metal working.\u201d The report noted that the site was adjacent to the Bushkill Brook and that the brook \u201cdisplayed a bright green algae color indicating a possible biological loading upstream from the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">A third environmental report by another engineering firm hired by RAAD, dated September 9, 1994, reported that manufactured gas plant (MGP) wastes, including PAHs, were located in the property\u2019s soil. According to this report, the MGP wastes were generated through the operation of two former MGP facilities located within 200 feet of the subject property. The on-site levels of these wastes exceeded \u201cNew Jersey non-residential soil cleanup standards for several PAHs and construction debris.\u201d Soil testing found no evidence of gasoline or fuel oil. The report concluded that MGP wastes from the off-site gas manufacturing operations were disposed of on the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">On April 19, 1993, DEP and RAAD executed a \u201cMemorandum of Agreement\u201d that provided for remediation of environmental contaminants at the site. The DEP reported in a letter dated July 7, 1993, that remediation was necessary because the on-site soils exceeded the \u201cDirect Contact Soil Cleanup Criteria.\u201d DEP found that the site contained fill material polluted by contaminants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201ccommonly associated with the auto repair industry.\u201d The letter noted that groundwater quality at the site was not tested, and therefore, DEP reached no conclusion regarding possible groundwater contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Plaintiffs maintained a series of homeowner\u2019s insurance policies for the property issued by Franklin from April 2, 1977, through April 2, 1991. The pertinent coverage, exclusion and definition provisions of the policy in effect from April 2, 1990, through April 2,1991, state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">Section IA Main Liability Coverage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdI\">Coverage E. Personal Liability To Others</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">We will pay for the benefit of insureds, up to our limits of liability, those sums which insureds become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage which occurs during the policy term and is caused by an occurrence covered here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">Section IIB. Supplemental Coverages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">2.

Plaintiffs maintained that they were not seeking first-party coverage on their own property because a third-party, RAAD, now owns the property. Defendant countered that pursuant to exclusions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>policy for \u201cowned property of the insured\u201d and \u201cbusiness activities,\u201d it was not obligated to defend or indemnify plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The trial judge, relying on <em>State v. Signo Trading Int'l supra, </em>interpreted the policy\u2019s \u201cowned property\u201d provision as requiring Franklin to indemnify plaintiffs only for clean-up costs associated with contamination of property owned by third-parties, such as property adjoining the insured property. The judge concluded there was no insurance coverage for the property conveyed to RAAD, as plaintiffs were not entitled to coverage for damage to the insured property when they owned it, and could not gain coverage by virtue of the property\u2019s sale to a third party. In addition, the judge found that plaintiffs were not entitled to a defense or to indemnification because the business risks exclusion did not cover contamination arising from plaintiffs\u2019 business activities at the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The standard of review for determination of a summary judgment motion is whether the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits \u201cshow that ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2. The motion judge must consider whether the available competent evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, is sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Moreover, although the moving papers and pleadings are to be considered in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, the opposing party must nevertheless offer facts which are substantial or material in opposing the motion, in order to defeat the grant of summary judgment. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67, 74, 110 A.2d 24 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">After these motions were decided, our Supreme Court held that environmental response costs and remediation expenses are covered \u201cdamages\u201d within the meaning of a CGL policy. <em>Morton Int\u2019l v. General Acc. Ins. Co. of Am., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>1, 27, 629 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>A.2d 831 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>2764, 129 <em>L.Ed2d </em>878 (1994). Thus, to the extent that the claims against plaintiffs seek damages for costs of DEP-imposed cleanup of the property, as well as for traditional tort-liability money damages, Franklin would be obligated to defend plaintiffs, <em>barring an applicable policy exclusion, </em>as there is no pollution exclusion or specific exclusion for environmental cleanup costs. Exclusionary provisions within insurance contracts are to be strictly interpreted. <em>Last v. West American Ins. Co., </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>456, 460, 354 A.2d 364 (App.Div.1976). We must accord the exclusionary language its plain import and intent. <em>Ibid. </em>CGL policies cover losses or liabilities on account of property damage sustained by parties other than the insured itself, as they are not insurance policies providing an insured first-party coverage for losses sustained to the insured\u2019s property. <em>Broadwell Realty Srvs., Inc. v. Fidelity &amp; Cos. Co. of N.Y., </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516, 528, 528 A.2d 76 (App.Div. 1987) (\u201cobvious purpose [of \u2018owned property\u2019 exclusion] is to exclude from the insurer\u2019s indemnification obligation claims based upon damage or loss to its own property\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds, Morton, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 629 A.2d 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The Law Division judge in the present case observed that where contaminated groundwater has migrated to another\u2019s property, an insured may be entitled to recover costs associated with removing the source of the contamination, but concluded that because no owner of \u201cother property\u201d was seeking damages for contamination of its groundwater, \u201cany claims that plaintiffs have established extensive groundwater contamination on the property conveyed do not change the result until that alleged contamination has moved off the property which is the subject of this litigation.\u201d The judge concluded that there was no evidence of imminent threat to other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In <em>UMC Stamford, Inc. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 647 A.2d 182 (Law Div.1994), the judge found that an owned property exclusion in a CGL policy would not bar coverage for cleanup costs if groundwater was found to be contam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>inated on property owned by the insured and it was established, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the groundwater was likely to migrate and cause off-site damage. 276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 62, 647 A.2d 182. However, in <em>Reliance Ins. Co. v. Armstrong World Indus., </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>148, 625 A.2d 601 (Law Div.1993), <em>reversed, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>365, 678 A.2d 1152 (App.Div.1996), the Law Division judge found that owned property and alienated premises exclusions in a CGL policy barred recovery of groundwater cleanup costs at an insured site although the costs were incurred to prevent actual and threatened harm to third-party property. 265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 153-54, 625 A.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In <em>Morrone v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., supra, 283 N.J.Super. </em>at 419-20, 662 A.2d 562, we considered these conflicting trial court decisions, and noted that each was cogent and well reasoned. We regarded groundwater as generally migratory in nature, thereby defying \u201cthe custody or control of a property owner,\u201d and thus concluded it did not clearly fall within the category of \u201cowned property.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because exclusionary clauses must be narrowly read and ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the insured, <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 176, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992), we held that the insurer was obligated to defend groundwater damage claims, despite the policy\u2019s owned property exclusion. <em>See also, Pittston Co. v. Allianz Ins. Co., </em>905 <em>F.Supp. </em>1279 (D.N.J.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We have heard extensive argument on all aspects of the issue by virtue of our entertaining oral argument on eight cases involving this common issue. After full consideration of all relevant arguments, we see no need to revisit the issue or to rehash the various policy reasons for and against holdings finding coverage. We are satisfied that our holding in <em>Morrone, supra, </em>should not be disturbed. Indeed, in our decision in <em>Reliance, supra, </em>we have held that groundwater contamination is also not excluded by the \u201cuse\u201d and \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d exclusions of CGL policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In the present case, although certain expert reports indicate the presence of groundwater contamination, the reports do not them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>selves assert that the contamination originated with plaintiffs\u2019 property. This, however, does not detract from Franklin\u2019s obligation to defend plaintiffs against the claims asserted by Banisch and Elizabethtown. <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 173, 607 A.2d 1255. As to those allegations of liability related to groundwater contamination, the owned property exclusion would not relieve Franklin of its duty to defend and indemnify plaintiffs under our holding in <em>Morrone, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In <em>State v. Signo Trading Int'l Inc., supra, </em>a bare majority of the Supreme Court, as then constituted, concluded that under the owned-property exclusion, no coverage was provided for \u201cthe costs of clean-up performed by or on behalf of an insured on its own property when those costs are incurred to alleviate damage to the insured\u2019s own property and not to the property of a third party.\u201d 130 <em>N.J. </em>at 63, 612 A.2d 932. It may be that the issue warrants reconsideration in light of the subsequent holding in <em>Morton, supra. </em>The troubling lines to be drawn as to when clean-up is required and the difficulty in apportioning the costs of clean-ups appear to militate against barring recovery for environmental clean-up at the source of the contamination. Considering the interconnection between the soil and the surrounding groundwater, remediation of adjacent soil contamination appears to be required to prevent future damage to groundwater when a past contamination is shown. There would appear to be sound basis for the position that, just as with groundwater, contamination of soil will ultimately end up endangering the health or property of others, and while it is arguable that damage to owned property has occurred, the recovery sought is not for that damage, but to prevent damage to others and their property. <em>See Signo, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 64, 612 A.2d 932 (the Court noted the \u201cnarrow exception\u201d for coverage \u201callowing recovery for the cost of measures intended to prevent imminent or immediate future damage when a present injury had already been demonstrated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">However, notwithstanding that there were no allegations of damage to adjacent properties, plaintiffs maintain that despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>owned property exclusion, Franklin is obligated to defend and indemnify them for the environmental claims arising from soil contamination of their own property. Plaintiffs assert that the absence of an alienated property clause, which would exclude coverage for property damage to the property they previously owned, requires Franklin to defend and indemnify them for the third-party claims brought against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The inclusion within a liability insurance policy of an exclusion for \u201cpremises alienated by the named insured\u201d is designed to extend the \u201cowned property\u201d exclusion to claims by subsequent owners of the property previously owned by the insured. <em>See Wickner v. American Reliance Ins. Co., </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>392, 396-97, 661 A.2d 1256 (1995); <em>Morrone v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 416-17, 662 A.2d 562; <em>Cf. Hatco Corp. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>801 <em>F.Supp. </em>1334, 1359 (D.N.J.1992). The policy included an exclusion for bodily injury or property damage \u201carising out of any premises which is not [an] insured premises here,\u201d and under the heading \u201cNon-Owned Property,\u201d the policy excluded property damage to property \u201cin the care of, occupied or used by, or rented to, any insured.\u201d \u201cInsured premises\u201d is defined in the policy\u2019s glossary as \u201ca one to four family house you own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Once the property was sold, plaintiffs no longer owned it and the property, by definition, could not qualify as \u201cinsured premises.\u201d As simply stated by the motion judge, plaintiffs were not entitled to this coverage when they owned it and they are not entitled to coverage now merely because they have sold it. If plaintiffs\u2019 contention were accepted, they would receive more insurance protection by virtue of having sold their property than they had when they owned it. <em>See Wickner v. American Reliance Ins. Co., supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 396, 661 A.2d 1256. We, therefore, reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that because the underlying lawsuits were brought after they no longer owned the property at issue, the owned property exclusion was not applicable since the insurance policies did not contain alienation clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Lastly, defendant asserts that the business risks exclusion precludes coverage inasmuch as groundwater contamination, if any, arose from plaintiffs\u2019 commercial activities. The record, however, is unclear as to where the contaminants originated or whether they were caused by commercial or non-commercial activities. Whether an insurer has a duty to defend an action against an insured is evaluated by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the language of the policy. <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 173, 607 A.2d 1255. The duty to defend arises if the complaint states a claim that constitutes a risk falling within the purview of the policy language. <em>Ibid.; Danek v. Hammer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 77, 100 A.2d 198 (App.Div.1953), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>573, 105 A.2d 677 (1954). If the allegations of the complaint are ambiguous, doubts regarding coverage are resolved in favor of the insured. <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 173, 607 A.2d 1255; <em>Central Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Utica Nai\u2019l Ins. Group, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 470, 557 A.2d 693 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The cross-claims asserted against plaintiffs by Elizabeth-town and Banisch are claims for contribution and indemnification to the extent that plaintiffs may have caused the contamination alleged. They do not specifically allege that the garage activity on plaintiffs\u2019 property contributed to the contamination at the site. The report issued by the engineering firm hired by RAAD to conduct soil samplings, concluded that MGP wastes found in the soil at the site were \u201cgenerated through the operation of two former MGP facilities located roughly two hundred feet away\u201d owned by Jersey Central and Elizabethtown.
