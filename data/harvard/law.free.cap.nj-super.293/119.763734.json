At that time, Fraser was engaged to be married to Lisa Pinter (now Lisa Fraser), daughter of Irene and Frank Pinter who were killed in an automobile accident in February 1990. Lisa Pinter was named executrix of her parents\u2019 estates. In March 1990 Fraser had a conversation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>with William Voorhees, \u201cthe sole equity partner in the firm and the only partner authorized to commit the firm on the question of a fee,\u201d regarding the representation of the estates in connection with the automobile negligence-wrongful death matter (generally called the \u201cTiso case\u201d because of a consolidated complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Shortly thereafter, with Voorhees\u2019 approval, the firm assumed the representation of the estate of Irene Pinter in the Tiso matter. Fraser was permitted to handle the case with the assistance and supervision of an experienced senior associate, Robert McAndrew.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Andrew Fraser and Lisa Pinter were subsequently married.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Fraser maintained a record of the time spent on the case. He submitted these timesheets along with those on other cases and, pursuant to a billable hour incentive arrangement, received a bonus in 1991 of $1,732.50.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In December 1992, Fraser left Voorhees &amp; Acciavatti and became associated with another firm. On January 13, 1993, a substitution of attorney was filed. The Tiso case was ultimately settled by Fraser\u2019s new firm in February 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">When Fraser decided to leave the firm, a dispute arose between plaintiff and Fraser with regard to attorney\u2019s fees in connection with the case. Fraser and Voorhees disagreed about their understanding of the fee arrangement. On April 13, 1993, a consent order was entered placing $68,996.92 from the proceeds of the settlement in escrow \u201cuntil such time as there is agreement among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the attorneys for plaintiffs Pinter, past and present, on the proper allocation of attorneys\u2019 fees----\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">An evidentiary hearing was held on the question of \u201ccounsel fees.\u201d Fraser testified that during his meeting with Voorhees regarding the firm\u2019s undertaking of the case, Voorhees was agreeable to the representation, but wanted Fraser to work closely with McAndrew, a lawyer with considerable experience in tort litigation. According to Fraser, Voorhees indicated he could handle the case with McAndrew\u2019s supervision \u201con a no fee basis as a professional courtesy.\u201d Voorhees only expected him to \u201ckeep current ... on all of [the] expenses associated with the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Voorhees testified as to a different understanding of the fee agreement. He advised Fraser that the firm would give him a \u201cprofessional courtesy discount as [they] would with any other attorney in the firm on any kind of a legal matter ... which the firm handled on behalf of the close family member.\u201d According to Voorhees,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">I suggested to him that the appropriate way to proceed was to take a look and see what the end result was, take a look and see how much effort the firm had to put into it, and that we would arrive at an appropriate discount of \u2014 for the normal contingent fee. And [Fraser] agreed to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Lisa Fraser and former attorneys at the firm testified on behalf of the estate. They related their understanding that the firm was going to undertake the representation of the estate on a \u201cno-fee\u201d basis as a \u201cprofessional courtesy.\u201d However, they were not privy to the discussion about fees between Voorhees and Fraser. Diane Acciavatti testified on behalf of the firm. She recalled that because Fraser \u201cwas an associate of the firm that we would consider making some reduction in the full contingency fee when the case was concluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Judge Reginald Stanton concluded that where <em>Rule </em>1:21-7 \u201cis not followed, the consequence should be that no fee at all is recoverable,\u201d and because of the firm\u2019s \u201cfailure to have an agreement for a contingent fee in writing ... there [could] be no contingent fee.\u201d He stated that while sometimes \u201cthere should be a fee of some kind allowed \u2014 a quantum meruit fee in the broad sense\u201d despite the absence of a written retainer, that should occur where \u201cservices were nevertheless rendered under circumstances where everybody understood there was to be some payment,\u201d such as in the related litigation which the firm undertook on behalf of the estate. Judge Stanton found, however, that this was not such a case because \u201cthere\u2019s a very fundamental disagreement as to whether there would be any payment at all.\u201d He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0S\">In this case, we have a violation of [\u00f1. 1:21-7]. But, we \u2014 we have the violation of the Rule under circumstances where it is not clear that there was to be compensation. It\u2019s not clear that there was to be [any] compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Judge Stanton found that there had been an honest misunderstanding between Fraser and Voorhees, \u201cthe senior partner in the firm of Voorhees and Acciavatti ... the managing partner and the sole partner with authority to make decisions with respect to fee arrangements between the firm and the clients,\u201d and that \u201cthere [could] be no fee recovered\u201d because \u201cthe absence of a writing should count severely against the party who is responsible under [K. 1:21-7] for making sure that there was a writing; namely, the law firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Stanton, and add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\"><em>R. </em>1:21-7 does not require that all compensation in tort actions must be by contingent fee. <em>See R. </em>1:21-7(b). <em>See also RPC </em>1.5(a)(c). But where, as here, the firm expected its compensation to be \u201ccontingent\u201d upon the recovery, <em>see R. </em>l:21-7(a), the contingent fee agreement must be in writing and in compliance with the <em>Rule. </em>As Voorhees testified that he expected to be compensated on a contingency basis, even though with a \u201cdiscount,\u201d the firm was obliged to comply with the <em>Rule. </em>Fraser, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>inexperienced new associate, was to be supervised in his handling of the matter by an experienced attorney in the firm. Any improper conduct by Fraser cannot excuse the firm\u2019s non-compliance with its responsibility to the client. In any event, the firm is responsible for its conduct, and any action the firm has against Fraser must be pursued in an action against him (and we understand one is pending), not against the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\"><em>R. </em>1:21-7 reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">(a) As used in this rule the term \u201ccontingent fee arrangement\u201d means an agreement for legal services of an attorney or attorneys, including any associated or forwarding counsel, under which compensation, contingent in whole or in part upon the successful accomplishment or disposition of the subject matter of the agreement, is to be in an amount which either is fixed or is to be determined under a formula.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">(b) An attorney shall not enter into a contingent fee arrangement without first having advised the client of the right and afforded the client an opportunity to retain the attorney under an arrangement for compensation on the basis of the reasonable value of the services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">(c) In any matter where a client\u2019s claim for damages is based upon the alleged tortious conduct of another, including products liability claims, and the client is not a subrogee, an attorney shall not contract for, charge, or collect a contingent fee in excess of the following limits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">(1) 33 1/3% on the first $250,000 recovered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">(2) 25% on the next $250,000 recovered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">(3) 20% on the next $500,000 recovered; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-13\">(4) on all amounts recovered in excess of the above by application for reasonable fee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) hereof; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-14\">(5) where the amount recovered is for the benefit of a client who was a minor or incompetent when the contingent fee arrangement was made, the foregoing limits shall apply, except that the fee on any amount recovered by settlement without trial shall not exceed 25%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-15\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-16\">(e) Paragraph (c) of this rule is intended to fix maximum permissible fees and does not preclude an attorney from entering into a contingent fee arrangement providing for, or from charging or collecting a contingent fee below such limits. In all cases contingent fees charged or collected must conform to RPC 1.5(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-17\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-18\">(g) Where the amount of the contingent fee is limited by the provisions of paragraph (c) of this rule, the contingent fee arrangement shall be in writing, signed by both the attorney and the client, and a signed duplicate shall be given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the client. Upon conclusion of the matter resulting in a recovery, the attorney shall prepare and furnish the client with a signed closing statement. Such contingent fee arrangement and closing statement, if any, shall be in the form prescribed by the Administrative Director of the Courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\"><em>RPC </em>1.5(c) also governs contingent fee agreements. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee is prohibited by law or by these rules. A contingent fee agreement shall be in writing and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or percentages that shall accrue to the lawyer in the event of settlement, trial or appeal, litigation and other expenses to be deducted from the recovery, and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent fee is calculated. Upon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">We agree with Judge Stanton that the firm violated <em>R. </em>1:21-7 by entering into a contingent fee agreement without a written retainer signed by the firm and the client. The testimony of Voorhees clearly established that the firm\u2019s representation of Irene Pinter\u2019s estate in the Tiso matter would be pursuant to a reduced contingent fee arrangement. It is true that <em>R. </em>l:21-7(c) sets the maximum limits for a contingent fee and that <em>R. </em>l:21-7(g) requires a written agreement \u201c[w]here the amount of the contingent fee is limited by the provisions of paragraph (c) of [if. 1:21-7].\u201d It is also true that the contingency agreement, as contemplated by Voorhees, was for less than the maximum allowed under <em>R. </em>l:21-7(c). We do not read the Rule to prohibit a contingent fee agreement which sets forth the maximum permissible fee, subject to the limits embodied in <em>R. </em>l:21-7(c) and downward adjustment upon disposition of the case. However, a writing was required because \u201cthe amount of the contingent fee [was] limited by the provisions of paragraph (c).\u201d In any event, <em>RPC </em>1.5(c) requires that any contingent fee \u201cbe in writing and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">While <em>quantum meruit </em>recoveries by law firms have been permitted by our courts, they do not involve circumstances in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>which the Rules have been violated. <em>See Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>584, 587, 461 A.2d 590 (Law Div.) <em>(R. </em>1:21-7 application for excess payment and allocation of fee under written contingent fee agreement), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>188, 469 A.2d 518 (App.Div.1983). <em>See also Cohen v. Radio-Electronics Officers, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 645 A.2d 1248 (App.Div.1994) <em>(quantum meruit </em>recovery permitted where attorney was discharged by client in a matter pursuant to fixed retainer agreement); <em>Dinter v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>521, 651 A.2d 1033 (App.Div.1995) (no recovery by attorney for fees following a successful disposition by another attorney after the representation was terminated by counsel\u2019s refusal to appeal an unsuccessful verdict, although he or she may still be entitled to reimbursement for costs and disbursements advanced on behalf of the client). <em>But see Delle Fare v. Sanitation Equip. Corp., </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>555, 485 A.2d 703 (Law Div.1984) (setting the fee where there was no written agreement, but not exploring the question before us).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In <em>La Mantia v. Durst, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>534, 542-43, 561 A.2d 275 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>181, 570 A.2d 950 (1989), we recognized the significance of the efforts and work of the initial firm which a litigating attorney leaves to join the firm which resolves a tort case. We used a <em>quantum meruit </em>approach to resolve \u201cdisputes between incoming and outgoing attorneys\u201d in such matters. <em>Id. </em>at 536, 561 A.2d 275. But there the firm which initially represented plaintiff prior to disposition had complied with the <em>Rule.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>La Mantia </em>the successor firm had no retainer agreement, and we expressed our \u201cconcern[ ] with the lack of an agreement\u201d between it and plaintiff. But \u201cthe gross fee ha[d] already been adjudicated,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 544, 561 A.2d 275, and the partner in the successor firm had represented plaintiff under the retainer agreement with the first firm. We, therefore, permitted both firms to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u201cIn light of the unique and special relationship between an attorney and a client, ordinary contract principles governing agreements between parties must give way to the higher ethical and professional standards enunciated by our Supreme Court. A contract for legal services is not like other contracts.\u201d <em>Cohen v. Radio-Electronics Officers, supra, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 259, 645 A.2d 1248. Here, the firm\u2019s failure to memorialize its contingent fee arrangement with the estate violates <em>R. </em>1:21-7 and RPC 1.5(c), and we cannot sanction circumvention of the rule by permitting recovery on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis. We do not preclude, however, an application to the trial judge for actual out-of-pocket disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\"> The firm also undertook the representation of Irene Pinter\u2019s estate in connection with a related suit which is not involved in this dispute. Although no written retainer agreement was entered, \"there was a mutual understanding that a fee was to be paid,\u201d and the trial court had to resolve no dispute about that matter. The firm did not bring an action on behalf of the Estate of Frank Pinter because he was the driver of the car in which Irene died, and his estate was made a defendant in her action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\"> Associates received a bonus of $20 for each billable hour above 2,000 hours. An associate also received one-third of any fees collected in any case originated by him or her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-10\"> After judgment was entered, all but $30,000 (plus interest) of the funds held in escrow were distributed to the estate. The motion judge concluded that the retained amount represented a fair recovery of attorney\u2019s fees if we were to uphold a <em>quantum meruit </em>claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> There is a clear indication in the opinion that there was a retainer agreement, 234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 536, 561 A.2d 275, although it is not clear if it tully complied with <em>R. </em>1:21-7. <em>See </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 543-44, 561 A.2d 275.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b156-6\">SHEBELL, P.J.AD.,</author>\n<p id=\"AT\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">I concur in the affirmance only for the reasons expressed from the bench by Judge Stanton. However, I do not agree with the inference raised in the majority opinion that in the absence of a written contingency fee agreement no recovery based upon principles of quantum meruit may be permitted in other circumstances. I would hold that failure to comply with the Contingent Fee Rule, <em>R. </em>1:21-7, merely bars the award of a contingent fee, but not a reasonable fee based on the services actually rendered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
