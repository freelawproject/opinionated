As she loaded groceries into her cai1, an assailant, Philip Reardon, Jr., forced her into the car, covered her nose and mouth with duct tape, and drove away. Mrs. Dalton died of asphyxiation. Reardon was apprehended and later convicted of kidnapping, robbery, theft, and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">Plaintiff sued Foodtown and Reardon. Depositions were taken of Barry Elliott, Manager of Retail Loss Prevention for Twin County Grocers, and Philip J. Scaduto, Director of Loss Prevention for Food Circus Supermarkets.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Elliott testified that his duties primarily focused upon the prevention of illegal activities inside of New Jersey and New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Foodtown stores. He had no recollection of any request to evaluate parking lot security at the Foodtown of Red Bank or the liquor store located on the premises. Elliott admitted, however, that security was hired during a period when construction materials were being stored in the Foodtown of Red Bank lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Scaduto was in charge of security for stores operated by Food Circus Supermarkets. Although he was responsible for parking lot problems, in his experience these consisted of little more than \u201cshopping carts banging, carriages,' basically people looking for money on dents,\u201d and \u201cproper lighting, potholes, things like that.\u201d He did not recall any criminal activity in the parking lot of any store operated by Food Circus prior to the abduction of Mrs. Dalton.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s expert, William A. Torphy, provided a report evaluating security at the Foodtown of Red Bank. Torphy concluded that Foodtown deviated from industry standards of care by failing to provide adequate security, and that this failure caused the death of Mrs. Dalton. He noted the presence of a liquor store on the premises, which attracted persons to drink and \u201chang around.\u201d Torphy also asserted that a Mobil gas station on the edge of the parking lot served as \u201ca gathering place for loiterers\u201d and earned frequent attention from the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The Torphy report observed that the parking lot faced a side of the supermarket that had no windows, making it impossible for employees inside to scan the lot for problems. Foodtown employed no security guards to monitor the parking lot. Torphy opined that the Foodtown was \u201clocated in an area where criminal conduct could reasonably be anticipated.\u201d He concluded that Foodtown\u2019s poor design and lack of security deviated from industry standards and contributed to Mrs. Dalton\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Police reports contained in the record indicate that sixty criminal incidents had been reported in or around the Foodtown store between January 1989 and the date of the Dalton incident, a two and one-half year period. These included thirty shopliftings, twelve thefts, four DWI offenses, four disorderly persons offenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>four assaults, three occasions on which customers misplaced property, one instance of criminal mischief, one charge of trespassing, and one offense of possession of CDS. There were no robberies or attempted robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">None of the assaults bore any resemblance to the attack upon Mrs. Dalton. Two involved store employees who confronted alleged shoplifters or thieves. In a third instance, a man assaulted a police officer who had arrested his wife for disorderly conduct. The remaining assault involved a fight arising out of a car accident in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Foodtown moved for summary judgment. After hearing argument, the judge granted Foodtown\u2019s motion on April 13, 1995, citing plaintiffs failure to allege prior similar incidents necessary to establish foreseeability. The motion judge distinguished plaintiffs case from <em>Butler v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>270, 445 A.2d 1141 (1982), in which seven muggings in the parking lot were deemed to render foreseeable the likelihood of further criminal attacks, thus generating a duty to provide reasonable protective measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Plaintiff moved for reconsideration, but advanced no new arguments or proof. On May 26,1995, the judge denied the motion for reconsideration, again stressing that <em>Butler </em>required prior similar incidents as a prerequisite to imposition of an actionable duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the complaint as to Reardon, rendering final and appealable the summary judgment granted to Foodtown. On appeal, plaintiff argues that the judge erred in granting summary judgment solely because of the absence of prior similar offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">We affirm. The evidence contained in the record before us is legally insufficient to render foreseeable the likelihood of a serious criminal attack occurring in the Foodtown parking lot, and therefore is insufficient to create a duty to provide special security for the Foodtown lot. Accordingly, we conclude that Foodtown owed no duty to plaintiffs decedent to provide security or to post <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>warnings in the parking lot, and that Foodtown is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Unlike the situation in <em>Butler, </em>there were no prior incidents of a nature that would render foreseeable the carjacking, assault, kidnapping and fatal gagging of a patron, or, indeed, any of those offenses. To the extent that a general theory of negligence was asserted, thus including a failure to warn,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we believe that any duty to warn patrons of the possibility of parking lot attacks would have been, at most, coextensive with the existence of a duty to provide security in the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We do not deem the expert report, nor the factual basis upon which it was rendered, sufficient to create a factual issue. \u201c[Ejxpert testimony is useful to fact finders in determining whether a standard of conduct has been violated, but only after a legal duty has been found to exist. The question of whether a duty exists is a matter of law to be decided by the judge alone in the context of the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Burroughs v. City of Atlantic City, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>208, 220-21, 560 A.2d 725 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>647, 569 A.2d 1345 (1989). \u201cThe foreseeability of harm is a significant consideration in the determination of a duty to exercise reasonable care.\u201d <em>Carvalho v. Toll Bros. &amp; Developers, 143 N.J. </em>565, 572, 675 A.2d 209 (1996). \u201c \u2018[I]t is a crucial element in determining whether imposition of a duty on an alleged tortfeasor is appropriate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572-73, 675 A.2d 209 (quoting <em>Carter Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. EMAR Group, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>182, 194, 638 A.2d 1288 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Among the factors properly considered in this case are the broad daylight time of the incident (rendering adequate illumination a non-issue; compare <em>Picco v. Fords Diner, </em>113 <em>N.J.Super. </em>465, 274 A.2d 301 (App.Div.1971)) and the undisputed evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>that there had been no prior criminal attacks against patrons in the Foodtown lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In <em>Butler, supra, </em>the Court recognized, as we do, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">[t]he historical classifications of the degrees of care owing to visitors upon land are undergoing gradual change in the law in favor of a broadening application of a general tort obligation to exercise reasonable care against foreseeable harm to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\"><em>[Butler, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 277, 445 A.2d 1141.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Also recognized was the duty of the proprietor of premises to which the public is invited for business purposes to provide a reasonably safe place to do that which is within the scope of the invitation. <em>Id. </em>at 275, 445 A.2d 1141. Due care under all the circumstances is the proper measuring rod, and the question of foreseeability is that of the existence of an unreasonable risk or likelihood of harm. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 445 A.2d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">In <em>Butler, </em>however, seven muggings had occurred on the Acme premises within one year\u2019s time, muggings of which the victim was unaware. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 445 A.2d 1141. No warnings had been posted to advise patrons of the possibility of attack. <em>Id. </em>at 275, 445 A.2d 1141. One guard attended to store security and to the parking lot. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 445 A.2d 1141. The Court recognized that foreseeability of criminal conduct was \u201capparent\u201d and refused to allocate sole responsibility for security to government with its attendant police power. <em>Id. </em>at 277, 280, 445 A.2d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Neither the Supreme Court nor the Legislature has yet imposed upon all parking lot operators or stores with parking areas an absolute duty to maintain constant police-type protection of those areas. It may be arguable that courts should take notice of an alarming trend in \u201ccarjackings,\u201d an offense largely unknown until recent years. However, such offenses can easily occur in any parking lot, large or small, or indeed on any street or highway. Police protection against such widespread criminal incidents is one of the primary duties for which government exists. The Supreme Court made clear that \u201cwe do not intend an absolute obligation to prevent all crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 445 A.2d 1141. Rather, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>imposed a duty upon Acme to provide adequate security and to warn patrons of the danger, based upon foreseeability generated by the known, repeated history of attacks in its parking lot. <em>Accord Genovay v. Fox, </em>50 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 554-55, 143 A.2d 229 (App.Div.1958), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>436, 149 A.2d 212 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">While we believe that certain showings of fact, for example repeated carjackings or assaults upon persons in the immediate vicinity, or an extraordinary increase of such incidents in the community, <em>see id. </em>at 555, 143 A.2d 229, might well be sufficient to create a duty,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that threshold has not here been crossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We are mindful of the view of our dissenting colleague that \u201c[substantial criminal activity had occurred in and around Food-town\u201d and that, in consequence, the question of Foodtown\u2019s duty to take reasonable security precautions for plaintiff should have been submitted to the jury. Our review of the record satisfies us that the dissent has overstated the nature and extent of the various incidents in and near the market, none of which hinted at an unusual potential for threat to the physical safety of patrons. This was not Dodge City.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Of greater concern is the dissent\u2019s apparent desire to send to a jury almost every case in which an allegation is made that a store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>has failed to provide adequate security protection for its business invitees, free of the judicial hand in measuring foreseeability and in determining existence of a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, we do not interpret <em>Butler </em>to have created an absolute prior similar incidents rule, although the motion judge may have done so. Neither have we created such a rule in this case. We read <em>Butter </em>to have made the existence of prior similar incidents a highly significant,, but not exclusive, factor for the court to consider in making its critical foreseeability/duty determination. In this respect, <em>Butler </em>is consistent with the most recent opinion of the California Supreme Court on this subject, <em>Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Center, </em>6 Cal.4th 666, 25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The dissent relies heavily on the reasoning of that court in an earlier decision, <em>Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital, </em>38 Cal.3d 112, 211 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>356, 695 P.2d 653 (1985), which rejected a strict rule of law limiting a business premises operator\u2019s foreseeability of criminal acts only to cases in which prior similar acts had occurred on the same premises. <em>Isaacs </em>rejected this strict rule in favor of a \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d approach. <em>Id. </em>211 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 361-65, 695 P.2d at 659-61. In <em>Ann M., </em>however, the breadth of the <em>Isaacs </em>opinion was dramatically reconsidered and modified.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While not adopting a strict prior similar incidents rule, the California Supreme Court recognized the difficulty in ascertaining what degree of security is adequate to constitute effective deterrence, and concluded \u201cthat a high degree of foreseeability is required in order to find that the scope of a [shopping center owner\u2019s] duty of care includes the hiring of security guards.\u201d <em>Ann M., supra, </em>25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d at 215. Thus, that court said, \u201cthe requisite degree of foreseeability rarely, if ever, can be proven in the absence of prior similar incidents of violent crime on the ... premises.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Much as we have done, the California court left open the possibility that, even absent prior similar incidents, other circumstances might create the degree of foreseeability sufficient to trigger a duty to provide security guards. Examples given were immediate proximity to a similar business establishment which has experienced violent crime on its premises, or evidence that a particular type of commercial property has become inherently subject to violent crime. <em>Id. </em>25 Cal.Rptr.2d at 145 n. 7, 146 n. 8, 863 P.2d at 215 n. 7, 216 n. 8. Absent legislative action, we believe that the <em>Ann M. </em>analysis is entirely consistent with the business proprietor\u2019s general duty to guard its business invitees against reasonably foreseeable harm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We believe that the dissent has confused the issue of duty analysis, and wrongly seeks to surrender for a jury\u2019s fact-finding the legal determination of foreseeability in the context of determining existence and scope of a duty. <em>See id. 25 Cal.Rptr.2d </em>at 145, 863 P.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">It is ironic that while the dissent has no difficulty in ceding to the jury the court\u2019s traditional role in addressing the policy considerations surrounding imposition of an actionable duty to provide security guards,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> our Supreme Court has struggled might<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ily to uphold legislative enactments that impose similar crime-prevention duties upon landowners. <em>See, e.g., 515 Assocs. v. City of Newark, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>180, 623 A.2d 1366 (1993); <em>Hudson Circle Servicenter v. Town of Kearny, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>289, 359 A.2d 862 (1976). Justice O\u2019Hem\u2019s dissent in <em>515 Assocs. </em>reminds us of the negative consequences of transferring the burden of police protection to private owners, who must then pass the costs on to tenants or customers. <em>See 515 Assocs., supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 200-01, 623 A.2d 1366 (O\u2019Hern, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The approach which we espouse, like that in <em>Ann M., supra, </em>takes account of the special nature of the policy questions here involved. If even legislative enactments of this nature are troublesome, we must not casually experiment with the duty created in <em>Butler </em>or the method of fixing that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In this opinion we change no rule of law, nor do we seek to establish a strict prior similar incidents rule. We believe that the approach adopted by the California Supreme Court in <em>Ann M., supra, </em>is sound and consistent with <em>Butler. </em>As the motion judge found, plaintiffs showing in this case was insufficient to establish an actionable duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\"> <em>See Butler, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 278, 445 A.2d 1141.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> <em>See also Kuzmicz v.

She had been shopping at the Foodtown Supermarket in Red Bank. Her car was parked in the Foodtown parking lot. She was attacked and forced into her car. Her assailant drove away with her. He covered her mouth with duct tape and suffocated her.

A substantial amount of criminal activity had occurred and was occurring at Foodtown. Police reports indicated that some sixty criminal incidents were reported in and around the Foodtown store in the two and one-half years before the attack upon Kathleen Dalton. These included assaults, disorderly persons offenses, thefts, possession of CDS, criminal mischief, and DWI offenses. Moreover, criminal activity at Foodtown itself had been substantially increasing each year. In 1989, only four incidents occurred at Foodtown; in 1990, there were seven; in 1991, there were thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">A security consultant engaged by plaintiff submitted a report on Foodtown\u2019s failure to comply with industry standards for supermarket security. The consultant had participated in the development and design of numerous retail store facilities for K-Mart and Woolworth Department Stores as well as K-Mart food stores throughout the East and in New Jersey. The stores were designed to operate in suburban and urban central business districts. The security consultant\u2019s background included experience in facility design and security and in \u201cmanagement control methods to protect patrons from being exposed to dangerous conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The security consultant\u2019s report contains the following. Food-town is located in a \u201cbusy section of the city between two major streets and at a railroad crossing.\u201d The store \u201cprovided parking for approximately 150 cars located at the side of the market however activity in the area could not be observed from inside the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">A liquor store was adjacent to Foodtown. Defendants admit that \u201c \u2018some guys used to sit around there and drink ... they used to hang around out there.\u2019\u201d Also, there is a Mobil gas station located on the edge of Foodtown\u2019s lot. This area is a \u201cgathering place for loiterers. Police were frequently called to the area to investigate thefts, assaults, trespassing, disorderly persons and other criminal activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>The security consultant states in his report that the parking lot was not visible from the store. Foodtown did not employ any security guards nor did it provide any deterrent to criminal activity taking place in its parking lot. Plaintiff also alleges that Foodtown did not provide parking lot security in any of their Foodtown stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The security consultant further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">Prudent retailers design stores that face the front parking area not only for customer convenience but also to provide a deterrent to crime by increasing the likelihood that criminal activity will be \u2018spotted\u2019 by store management or up-front store personnel and reported. Any side parking defeats this purpose and particularly in this case where the side wall was of solid masonry---- Having the parking area in direct view from the store also is a deterrent to loitering and potential assaults. In its Tips on How to Deter Robbery and Violence covering procedures used by the convenience store sector are found typical instructions used in training store personnel such as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201cObserve if someone appears to be watching or loitering. If so, try to stare down the suspicious person. If he doesn\u2019t leave, call the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The security consultant continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">Industry practice is for such large cooperatives [the defendant] to analyze and if necessary to recommend outside security measures be taken to assure safe parking lots as well, which the cooperative failed to do for this Foodtown even though it was known to be located in an area where criminal conduct could be reasonably anticipated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">The security consultant concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-12\">Where assaults on patrons could reasonably be foreseen due to the absence of any deterrent to crime in an area that was hidden from view, that attracted loiterers and that had a history of criminal activity, customary standards of care in the shopping center industry require proprietors to provide adequate security measures to safeguard patrons such as the use of uniformed guards, to schedule periodic inspection of the parking area by store personnel and to provide means of visibility of the lot from the store through window openings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-13\">Because industry standards of care were not followed or were ignored by Foodtown, ... dangerous conditions that were known or should have been known to the defendants were allowed to exist. As a result of the negligence, carelessness and disregard for the safety of the plaintiff, Kathleen Dalton, she was assaulted and subsequently murdered by an assailant roaming the store\u2019s blind parking area and forcibly entering the plaintiffs car unobserved and undetected by defendants\u2019 store personnel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Whether a defendant owes a legal duty is \u201cgenerally considered\u201d a question of law for the court to decide. <em>Carvalho v.

Foreseeability of harm is a significant consideration in the determination of a duty to exercise reasonable care. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 675 A.2d 209. Thus, courts \u201cconsider initially the factor of foreseeability as the predicate for the duty to exercise reasonable care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 675 A.2d 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Butler v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>270, 445 A.2d 1141 (1982), held that an owner of business premises owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to safeguard its customers from the criminal acts of third parties. The Court further held that it was for the jury to determine whether the business owner had breached that duty of reasonable care. <em>Id. </em>at 280, 445 A.2d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In <em>Butler, </em>a woman had been assaulted in the Acme parking lot in Montclair in November 1977, while she was loading groceries into her car. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 445 A.2d 1141. The parking lot was well lit. <em>Ibid. </em>Seven muggings had occurred within the past year, including five evening attacks during the preceding four month period. <em>Ibid, </em>Acme had hired off-duty police as security guards to combat the problem. <em>Ibid. </em>The only guard on duty at the time of the attack was inside the store and Acme did not have any signs warning patrons of potential danger. <em>Id </em>at 275, 445 A.2d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Acme was granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>Ibid. </em>We reversed and the Supreme Court affirmed our reversal. The Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">The proprietor of premises to which the public is invited for business purposes of the proprietor owes a duty of reasonable care to those who enter the premises upon that invitation to provide a reasonably safe place to do that which is within the scope of the invitation____ The measure of that care has been described as <em>\u2018due care under all the circumstances.\u2019 ... </em>\u2018Negligence is tested by whether the reasonably prudent person at the time and place should recognize and foresee an unreasonable risk or likelihood of harm or danger to others.\u2019 ... <em>If the reasonably prudent person would foresee danger resulting from another\u2019s voluntary criminal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>acts, the fact that another\u2019s actions are beyond defendant\u2019s control does not preclude liability. </em>... <em>Foreseeability of the risk that criminal acts of others would cause harm is the crucial factor.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">The historical classifications of the degrees of care owing to visitors upon land are undergoing gradual change in the law <em>in favor of a broadening application of a general tort obligation to exercise reasonable care against foreseeable harm to others.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">With respect to the allocation of costs issue, in the modem context of merchandising, our placement of these costs is consistent with the principles of the common law. Just as it is deemed fair for the owners and therefore indirectly the tenants of an apartment building, ... or the operators and patrons of a parking lot, ... to bear the costs of avoiding negligence, <em>it is fair that the costs of negligent failure to protect against crime be similarly borne by the operators and indirectly patrons of such shopping facilities.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\"><em>[Ibid, </em>at 275-277, 445 A.2d 1141 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The Court quoted from the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 344 (1965), as to the duty owed by a storeowner to protect its patrons from the acts of third parties. <em>Id. </em>at 280, 445 A.2d 1141. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\"><em>Thus under both Restatement, (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 SU, supra, and the prior decisions of this Court, it was for the jury to determine if Acme exercised reasonable care in the performance of its duty to safeguard its business invitees from the criminal acts of third persons. </em>Here, it was at least reasonable for the jury to determine that absent warnings, hiring one guard who primarily remained inside the store was an insufficient response in light of the known, repeated history of attacks on the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\"><em>[Id, </em>at 280, 445 A.2d 1141 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">As to plaintiff\u2019s lack of expert testimony on the standard of care, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">Obviously, such testimony <em>would be an aid to a jury and its use is encouraged in future cases. </em>But its absence is not fatal.

Under that view, Foodtown would only have a duty to take reasonable precautions to protect its customers from criminal attack if there had been \u201cfor example repeated carjackings or assaults upon persons in the immediate vicinity, or an extraordinary increase of such incidents in the community ...,\u201d or possibly a type of commercial property \u201cinherently\u201d subject to violent crime. <em>Ante </em>at 223-25 &amp; 225, 679 A.2d at 1233-34 &amp; 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">My colleagues also embrace the majority opinion in <em>Ann M. v.

The refinement is that a \u201chigh degree of foreseeability is required in order to find that the scope of a landlord\u2019s duty of care includes the hiring of security guards.\u201d; and that \u201cthe requisite degree of foreseeability <em>rarely, if ever, </em>can be proven in the absence of prior similar incidents of violent crime on the landowner\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Id. 25 Cal.Rptr.2d </em>at 145, 863 P.2d at 215 (emphasis added). The majority in the present case finds that the \u201capproach\u201d in <em>Ann M. </em>is \u201csound and consistent with <em>Butler.\u201d Ante at </em>227, 679 A.2d at 1235.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Butler </em>did not expressly adopt my colleagues\u2019 limitations upon its holding. Nor is there any indication that the Court impliedly adopted such limitations. On the contrary, the broad language in <em>Butler </em>quoted above compels the conclusion that the <em>Butler </em>Court intended no such narrow interpretation of its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Furthermore, subsequent New Jersey cases have not given <em>Butler </em>a restrictive interpretation. <em>See Kuzmicz v.

Thus, the <em>Butler </em>decision affords no support for the restrictive position adopted by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Nor does the weight of modern out of State authorities support the majority decision. Essentially, the majority has adopted the \u201cprior similar incidents\u201d rule with its refinement in <em>Ann M., supra. </em>Under that rule, a business proprietor, has, with only rare exceptions, no duty to take reasonable precautions to protect its patrons from criminal attack in the absence of prior repeated similar criminal incidents. In the past, some courts have espoused that rule. See cases cited in Marjorie A. Caner, Annotation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>Liability of Owner or Operator of Shopping Center, or Business Housed therein, for Injury to Patron on Premises from Criminal Attack by Third Party, </em>31 A.L.R.5th 550 (1995); James L.

First, the rule leads to results which are contrary to public policy. The ride has the effect of discouraging landowners from taking adequate measures to protect premises which they know are dangerous. This result contravenes the policy of preventing future harm. Moreover, under the rule, the first victim always loses, while subsequent victims are permitted recovery. Such a result is not only unfair, but is inimical to the important policy of compensating injured parties. Surely, a landowner should not get one free assault before he can be held liable for criminal acts which occur on his property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">Second, a rule which limits evidence of foreseeability to prior similar criminal acts leads to arbitrary results and distinctions____ Under this rule, there is uncertainty as to how \u201csimilar\u201d the prior incidents must be to satisfy the rule. The rule raises a number of other troubling questions. For example, how close in time do the prior incidents have to be? How near in location must they be? The rule invites different courts to enunciate different standards of foreseeability based on their resolution of these questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">Third, the rule erroneously equates foreseeability of a particular act with previous occurrences of similar acts. This court has already rejected that notion. \u201c \u2018The mere fact that a particular kind of an accident has not happened before does not ... show that such accident is one which might not reasonably have been anticipated.\u2019 ... Thus, the fortuitous absence of prior injury does not justify relieving defendant from responsibility for the foreseeable consequences of its acts.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">Finally, the \u201cprior similar incidents\u201d rule improperly removes too many cases from the jury\u2019s consideration. It is well established that foreseeability is ordinarily a question of fact____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">There is a general reluctance to remove foreseeability questions from the jury____ Foreseeability \u201c \u2018is not to be measured by what is more probable than not, but includes whatever is likely enough in the setting of modem life that a reasonably thoughtful [person] would take account of it in guiding practical conduct.\u2019 ... One may be held accountable for creating even \u2018 \u201cthe risk of a slight possibility of injury if a reasonably prudent [person] would not do so.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-14\">Thus, foreseeability is determined in light of all the circumstances and not by a rigid application of a mechanical \u201cprior similars\u201d rule____ As this court has held, \u201cwhat is required to be foreseeable is the general character of the event or harm ... not its precise nature or manner of occurrence.\u201d ... Prior similar incidents are helpful to determine foreseeability but they are not necessary.

Jones, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>4, 20, 667 A.2d 1043 (1995) (Court looked at \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d to determine whether police acted in an objectively reasonable manner); <em>State v. Smith, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>599, 621, 637 A.2d 158 (1994) (Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>looked at totality of the circumstances to test the legality of a pat-down search); <em>State v. New Jersey Trade Waste Assoc., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>8, 25, 472 A.2d 1050 (1984) (totality of circumstances test will be used in determining whether a course of conduct constitutes a single conspiracy or two or more separate conspiracies).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Applying the totality of circumstances approach and giving plaintiff the benefit of reasonable inferences under summary judgment principles, more than a sufficient showing has been made to permit plaintiff\u2019s case to go forward. To foresee the likelihood of crime is unfortunately not difficult today. The omnipresence of crime is irrefutable. It is an \u201cinescapable fact of modem life. Its presence threatens the suburban enclave as well as the inner city.\u201d <em>Trentacost v. Brussel, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>214, 227, 412 A.2d 436 (1980). Large numbers of people congregate in supermarkets. Parking lots of supermarkets are not \u201clikely to be crime free.\u201d <em>See Seibert, supra, </em>856 P.2d at 1339; <em>see also Business Inviter\u2019s Duty to Protect Invitees from Criminal Acts, supra, </em>134 <em>U.Pa.L.Rev. </em>at 904 (outside parking lots are high risk areas for crime). Predators such as the killer of Kathleen Dalton, go where the prey is.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Owners of supermarkets in 1991 were surely not unaware of these basic facts or of the fact that crime in New Jersey had escalated drastically between 1977, when Helen Butler was attacked, and 1991 when Kathleen Dalton was murdered. In 1977, the total crime index in the State of New Jersey was 373, 450. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>1991, the crime index had risen to 421,863. Violent crime rose even more sharply. In 1977, it was 28,732. By 1991, violent crime had climbed to almost 50,000. <em>See State of New Jersey Uniform Crime Reports </em>(1977 and 1991). The clairvoyance <em>of </em>Cassandra is not needed to foresee an attack in a supermarket parking lot invisible from the store and in a vicinity in which numerous crimes had occurred over the prior two and one-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Furthermore, Kathleen Dalton was a victim of carjacking, a highly publicized criminal phenomena which emerged in the late eighties and early nineties. The legislative history of the federal caijacking statute of 1992 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119) reflects the widespread public knowledge and concern about this crime. One Congressman said \u201c[p]eople are outraged and terrified by the heinous carjacking epidemic currently upon us.\u201d <em>See </em>138 Cong. Rec. H11,819. Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey referred to the \u201cemerging problem of violent carjacking\u201d and noted that it is \u201cespecially prevalent in New Jersey \u2014 \u201d <em>See </em>138 Cong. Rec. S17,961. Another senator referred to carjacking as a national problem which was \u201cbecoming more and more linked to violence\u2014 to severe beatings, and even murder.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In 1993, New Jersey enacted a carjacking statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-2. Carjacking was made a crime of the first degree carrying a sentence of ten to thirty years and a minimum parole ineligibility term of at least five years. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">A supermarket owner in an urban or suburban location can hardly plead ignorance of this rising crescendo of virulent violence. The supermarket here had an adjacent liquor store and a nearby gas station which was a haven for loiterers. Some sixty criminal offenses had occurred in or about its premises in the two and one-half years before Kathleen Dalton\u2019s abduction and murder. Criminal incidents on the supermarket\u2019s premises had sharply increased from 1989 through 1991. Despite these facts, the supermarket provided no security for its customers. If security guards were too costly, the supermarket could have still met \u201ccustomary standards of care in the shopping center industry\u201d by having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201cperiodic inspection of the parking area by store personnel\u201d and by providing \u201cmeans of visibility of the lot from the store through window openings.\u201d (See excerpts from security consultant\u2019s report <em>supra </em>at 230, 679 A.2d at 1237). Instead Foodtown did nothing!</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Moreover, a reasonable inference from the discovery and the security consultant\u2019s report is that the supermarket never made an inquiry as to whether a security problem was present, and, if so, what security measures should be considered. <em>See Romaguera v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., </em>648 So.2d 1000 (La.Ct.App.1994) (in \u201cthe modern urban environment,\u201d a business which provides a parking lot for customers should determine whether security is required and, if so, provide it). <em>See also 515 Assocs. v. City of Newark, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>180, 189, 623 A.2d 1366 (1993) (upheld ordinance requiring owners of apartment houses to provide armed security guards); <em>Hudson Circle Servicenter, Inc. v. Kearny, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>289, 305-311, 359 A.2d 862 (1976) (upheld ordinance requiring parking lot to be supervised by a uniformed guard). In sum, the foreseeability of criminal attack under the facts here should have been determined at trial, not on a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Denying recovery to tort victims by adhering to inflexible and outmoded doctrines runs counter to fundamental principles of tort law. In <em>People Express Airlines, Inc. v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>246, 254-255, 495 A.2d 107 (1985), the Court declined to follow the common law doctrine which barred recovery for economic loss unless the negligent conduct also caused physical harm. The comments of the Court about the purposes and flexibility of tort law are applicable here. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">... The asserted inability to fix chrystalline formulae for recovery on the differing facts of future cases simply does not justify the wholesale rejection of recovery in all cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">The torts process, like the law itself, is a human' institution designed to accomplish certain social objectives. One objective is to ensure that innocent victims have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>avenues of legal redress, absent a contrary, overriding public policy---- This reflects the overarching purpose of tort law; that wronged persons should be compensated for their injuries and that those responsible for the wrong should bear the cost of their tortious conduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">Other policies underlie this fundamental purpose. Imposing liability on defendants for their negligent conduct discourages others from similar tortious behavior, fosters safer products to aid our daily tasks, vindicates reasonable conduct that has regard for the safety of others, and, ultimately, shifts the risk of loss and associated costs of dangerous activities to those who should be and are best able to bear them. Although these policies may be unevenly reflected or imperfectly articulated in any particular case, we strive to ensure that the application of negligence doctrine advances the fundamental purpose of tort law and does not unnecessarily or arbitrarily foreclose redress based on formalisms or technicalisms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at <em>254-255, 495 </em>A.2d 107 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Perhaps the most singular and enduring quality of tort law is its flexibility as it is applied to the myriad patterns of modern day life. Tort law resists the foreclosing of \u201credress\u201d to injured parties based on \u201cformalisms\u201d, \u201ctechnicalisms\u201d and \u201cchrystalline formulae\u201d such as the prior similar criminal incidents rule and its refinement in <em>Ann M. </em>The totality of the circumstances approach best accords with the fundamental purposes of tort law as set forth in <em>Butler </em>and exemplified by the \u201csolid and growing national trend\u201d of authority. <em>Sharp v. W.H. Moore, Inc., supra </em>796 P.2d at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">I would reverse and remand for a trial to determine whether the supermarket violated its duty to take reasonable precautions for the safety of its business invitee, Kathleen Dalton, when, despite a history of increasing and substantial criminal activity, the supermarket provided no security for its patrons in its parking lot and made no inquiry as to whether some form of security was required on the \u201cblind\u201d side of its business premises.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-12\"> The majority cites five cases as \"Some of the cases in accord (with the <em>Ann M. </em>analysis)\u201d. <em>Ante </em>at 226, 679 A.2d at 1235.
