The trial court found that New Jersey had \u201cabsolute jurisdiction over the [parties\u2019] two minor children\u201d; Florida had lost jurisdiction by the terms of the August 28, 1991 order, and a subsequent order retaining jurisdiction was \u201cnull and void as a result of its violation of the constitutional rights of defendant.\u201d Plaintiff also appeals from the court\u2019s award of counsel fees to defendant and to the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>and the reduction of plaintiffs child support arrearages to a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The Florida order modifying the divorce judgment permitted defendant, Mary Ashcraft (formerly Mary Schuyler), to move with the children outside of Florida, denied plaintiffs request for a change of custody, but granted plaintiff liberal visitation. It continued the prior arrangement that plaintiff was to pay $500 support per month through the Central Depository in Dade County, Florida, and ordered plaintiff to pay traveling expenses for visitation. As will be more definitively explained <em>infra, </em>with the Florida court\u2019s consent, defendant moved from Florida to California in 1991, after which she remarried and moved to New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>in early 1993. The children have lived in this State for the past three and a half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Defendant\u2019s New Jersey counsel filed the August 1991 Florida judgment with the Clerk of the Family Part under the provisions of the Uniform Child Custody and Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) and sought its enforcement and later modification in New Jersey. Plaintiff contested the jurisdiction of the New Jersey court on the basis that Florida continued to be the children\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d and the sole state possessing jurisdiction over the custody matter, and he asserted that his repeated attempts to modify the judgment in Florida both prior to and following the New Jersey action deprived New Jersey of jurisdiction. Plaintiff also repeatedly rebuffed the New Jersey court\u2019s attempts to enforce the child support provisions of the order, correctly asserting that it had no jurisdiction to do so, as we will later explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We hold that the Family Part has jurisdiction over the custody issues, but that the questions of support remain subject to the orders of the Florida courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">I. <em>Factual and Procedural Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">We will briefly summarize the facts and procedural history of this case, which are related in more detail in an attached Addendum <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and at the appropriate points in our analysis. The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>were divorced in Florida in 1990 and they have two children born June 29,1986 and March 24, 1989. During the year following the divorce, plaintiff and his family repeatedly used the Florida court system to harass defendant and attempt to force a change of custody, filing and refiling false sexual abuse charges and instituting an extraordinary number of legal proceedings. In August 1991, the Florida court granted defendants emergency petition to leave the state with the children and relocate to California, but permitted plaintiff liberal visitation. The order, quoted at length <em>infra, </em>strongly admonished plaintiff and his family for their behavior and specifically refused plaintiffs request that Florida retain jurisdiction over the matter beyond six months, the period which, under the relevant federal and state statutes, would allow another state to establish custody jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">During the six-month period in which Florida retained jurisdiction, plaintiff applied <em>ex parte </em>before different judges and was granted orders changing the wording of the August 28,1991 order and retaining jurisdiction beyond the six month period. Defendant discovered the existence of these orders months later. There then followed a series of orders purporting to retain jurisdiction and to increase defendant\u2019s share of the child support, all of which were issued without proper notice to defendant. Defendant attempted on June 4, 1992 to bring to the Florida court\u2019s attention plaintiffs behavior in securing these orders, but was told that the court had \u201cno jurisdiction\u201d to hear her application. In the interim, defendant had remarried a member of the Coast Guard and, following her new husband\u2019s transfer, the family moved to New Jersey in January 1993. The last order before the move had issued from Florida on June 2,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">On January 18, 1993, defendant\u2019s New Jersey counsel filed the August 28, 1991 order with the Clerk of the Superior Court of New Jersey. Under the mistaken impression that his filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>conferred plenary jurisdiction upon New Jersey, defendant\u2019s counsel also filed with the Florida court and sent to plaintiff a notice announcing the change of jurisdiction. We note that this was not a motion, nor did it request any relief from the Florida court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">On February 4, 1993, plaintiff filed with the Florida court a \u201cMotion to Enforce Settlement Agreement and/or for Re-Hearing.\u201d Defendant received no notice of this motion and apparently no such settlement agreement existed. Plaintiffs attorney had merely mailed proposed agreements to defendant\u2019s Florida attorney. A hearing was set for March 30,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">On February 16, 1993, plaintiff filed with the New Jersey court a motion to strike defendant\u2019s notice of change of jurisdiction and represented to the New Jersey court that \u201cvarious motions\u201d regarding the parties\u2019 children were \u201ccurrently pending\u201d in Florida. A hearing was set on the matter for March 19, 1993 in New Jersey before the Family Part. Plaintiff then, on an emergent basis, applied for and received a hearing in Florida on March 11, 1993 to determine jurisdiction. The Florida court then issued an order on March 12, 1993 denying defendant\u2019s motion to transfer jurisdiction to New Jersey, although no such motion had ever been made. At the March 19, 1993 hearing in New Jersey, the court denied plaintiffs request to strike the notice of change of jurisdiction, observing that the effect of defendant\u2019s notice was merely to advise Florida of defendant\u2019s new address and where to send the support checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">After obtaining the Florida order denying the \u201cmotion\u201d to transfer jurisdiction, plaintiff informed defendant by letter that he would be picking up the children on April 8, 1993 for visitation in Florida and that she should bring the children to the airport in Philadelphia. Since plaintiff was not entitled to this visitation and, contrary to court order, had not made the arrangements with defendant, defendant feared that the children would not be returned if she allowed them to leave New Jersey. On April 1,1993, the New Jersey court issued an emergent order limiting visitation to within New Jersey. On April 13, 1993, the New Jersey court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>assumed emergency jurisdiction over the children citing their best interests and fear of their disappearance. On April 14, 1993, the Florida court transferred custody to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">On June 4 and June 8,1993, the New Jersey court held hearings on whether the custody and visitation provisions of the August 28, 1991 order should be modified. It was at these hearings that plaintiff\u2019s repeated due process violations became clear to all. Plaintiff\u2019s Florida counsel testified that he had never noticed defendant of the application for the orders he obtained from the Florida court in February 1992 and that he knew she was unrepresented at that time. He was later admonished by the Florida Bar for his conduct in this case. We note that information concerning the substance of this testimony is entirely absent from plaintiff\u2019s brief before this court, in which he relates as \u201cprocedural history\u201d and \u201cfact\u201d the existence and content of the February 1992 orders retaining jurisdiction. Although plaintiff\u2019s Florida attorney specifically testified at this time only with regard to the February 1992 order, as will be explained <em>infra, </em>it is clear from the record that plaintiff\u2019s due process violations were pervasive during this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Throughout 1993 the Florida court issued various orders regarding custody, and the New Jersey court began hearings on defendant\u2019s attempts to enforce the child support provisions of the August 28,1991 order. Plaintiff refused to supply the New Jersey court with the requested financial information. On March 4,1994, after a telephonic conference between the New Jersey and Florida judges, Florida again relinquished jurisdiction over the matter, citing the best interests of the children. On March 7, 1994, however, plaintiff\u2019s Florida attorney sent an <em>ex parte </em>letter to a Florida judge who had issued prior <em>ex parte </em>orders in the matter, but who was no longer sitting in the family court, stating that \u201csomeone\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had contacted the administrative judge, of the Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Division and \u201cmislead\u201d [sic] him into believing jurisdiction did not belong in Florida. That same day the Florida court rescinded its March 4,1994 order that had relinquished jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On April 6, 1994, plaintiff telephoned defendant at her office and, overheard by defendant\u2019s co-worker, threatened to kill her and her counsel and to take the children. Defendant filed a criminal complaint the same day. After hearing testimony, on April 27,1994, the Chancery Division in Cape May County issued a final restraining order under the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act prohibiting plaintiff from contacting defendant or the children, suspending visitation, and ordering plaintiffs weapons seized from his home. Upon leaving the courthouse with the order on April 27, 1994, defendant was assaulted two blocks away by a man who warned her to \u201cdrop the charges.\u201d She immediately reported the incident to the police and applied for emergent relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">At an emergent hearing the next day, defendant testified that she had been followed in New Jersey in the past, and, one day she had returned home and, after seeing someone going over her back fence, she entered her home with a security guard and discovered the word \u201cdead\u201d written in ketchup on her sliding glass door. Defendant also testified that plaintiff had told her that he knew about car bombs, leaving her afraid each time she turned on her car, and he told her he was going to kill her with a gun she had bought him as a gift. Plaintiff was represented at the hearing by his attorney. On the basis of the testimony, the court terminated all plaintiffs contact with defendant and the children, and permitted defendant to change and unlist her telephone number without providing the information to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">On June 30, 1994, the New Jersey court appointed a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the children. Based on interviews with the children and defendant (plaintiff refused to co-operate), the guardian strongly urges in his brief to this court that it is in the best interest of the children that New Jersey maintain jurisdiction over the children\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>On August 11, 1994, the Florida court issued an order staying all matters until resolution of the jurisdictional issue by New Jersey\u2019s Appellate Division or Supreme Court. Nonetheless, a different Florida judge issued an order on August 31,1994 retaining jurisdiction. Various proceedings regarding child support continued in the New Jersey courts through September and October 1994. On November 4,1994, Florida issued two orders of bodily attachment for the children. On November 10, 1994, plaintiff filed a motion directed to the Presiding Judge of the Essex County Family Part requesting recusal of the judge hearing the case and the reinstatement of visitation. The motion, filed by plaintiffs current counsel, asserted that defendant received notice of each Florida proceeding, neglecting to mention the testimony of plaintiffs Florida counsel to the contrary. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">On February 6, 1995, the New Jersey court ordered that it had \u201cabsolute jurisdiction\u201d over the children as a result of the terms of the August 18, 1991 Florida order and the testimony of plaintiffs Florida counsel that he had never properly served defendant with the papers that resulted in the orders issued within the six-month period retaining jurisdiction. The court also issued a bench warrant for plaintiff\u2019s arrest for failing to comply with orders to produce financial records. As noted earlier, plaintiff here appeals from the portion of this order relating to jurisdiction and the fees there awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">On April 28,1995, the New Jersey court found that plaintiff was secreting assets and warned him that it would entertain a motion to transfer sole custody to defendant if he did not pay the fees of the court-ordered psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">There then transpired what can only be characterized as the most bizarre incident in this history. On May 5, 1995, an investigator\u2019s affidavit filed in Florida represented that plaintiff had sole custody of the children and that defendant was unlawfully keeping them out of that state. The affidavit omitted all mention of the New Jersey proceedings and of the August 11,1994 Florida order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>staying the transfer of custody. Plaintiff supplied the court with defendant\u2019s photograph for purposes of identification, and on June 28, 1995, Florida\u2019s Governor signed extradition papers for defendant. Governor Whitman of New Jersey issued a warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest and extradition on July 20, 1995. On July 29, 1995, defendant was placed in handcuffs and arrested in front of her children. She was released on bail and appeared before the New Jersey criminal court at a <em>habeas corpus </em>hearing on July 31, 1995. The Cape May County Prosecutor informed the court that he believed the warrant was based on misinformation. The criminal court judge observed that \u201cthis reads like some of the old Family Court litigation that led to the adoption of the Uniform Child Jurisdiction and Custody Act. Because this kind of thing just really hasn\u2019t happened since the 40\u2019s and the 50\u2019s.\u201d The New Jersey Governor\u2019s Office was expected to withdraw the warrant, but the judge scheduled time for a later hearing if necessary. At a hearing on August 1,1995 before the New Jersey judge who had been handling the civil portion of the case, plaintiffs New Jersey counsel informed the court that he knew plaintiff had been communicating with the Miami District Attorney\u2019s Office, but he believed the matter to be one of attorney-client privilege. The judge stated that, in light of the fraud perpetrated upon the executive branch in New Jersey, the privilege did not apply and he expressed displeasure that counsel had withheld the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On December 13, 1995, the criminal court granted defendant\u2019s writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>based on stipulations agreed to by the New Jersey prosecutor and defendant\u2019s attorney. Plaintiffs attorney was present at the proceedings. The prosecutor had several times invited the State Attorney in Florida to participate in the proceeding, but had received no reply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s attorney also received no reply to his request for supporting documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>On January 5, 1996, while this matter was pending hearing in this court, we remanded the matter to the trial court, in part, to permit additional conversations between the New Jersey and Florida judges. On January 29, 1995, the Florida court ceded jurisdiction to New Jersey once again.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">On February 8, 1996, plaintiff moved in Florida for a rehearing of the January 29,1995 order on the basis that (1) he had not been given an opportunity to be heard; (2) the order was without factual or legal justification and (3) the order was contrary to the provisions of the UCCJA and the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act. Plaintiffs Florida counsel noticed a hearing before the Florida court on the issue for April 1, 1996. Defendant received a bare notice, without ever receiving the memorandum submitted to the Florida court in support of the motion. The Federal Express receipt shows the unsuccessful attempt to serve her just before the hearing, and defendant\u2019s counsel has certified to us and represented in open court before us that neither he nor his client received the moving papers, including the memorandum on which the judge\u2019s order was based, until well after the hearing. As usual, the Florida court was not apprised by plaintiff of these procedural deficiencies. In effect, this was an <em>ex parte </em>application. On April 2,1996, the Florida court rescinded its January 29, 1996 order ceding jurisdiction. The rescinding order incorporated, virtually completely, the factual history contained in plaintiffs memorandum. Nearly three weeks later, defendant\u2019s attorney received plaintiffs complete application for the April 2,1996 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">II. <em>Legal Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The custody and support aspects of this case are governed by different statutes and therefore must be analyzed separately. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>first will examine the New Jersey court\u2019s authority to enforce and modify the custody provisions of the August 28, 1991 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">A. <em>Custody and Visitation Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">It should be noted at the outset that none of the relevant statutes requires that this state meet any jurisdictional prerequisites merely to recognize and enforce a valid out-of-state custody decree. <em>See N.J.SA </em>2A:34-41 (\u201cRecognition of out-of-state custody decrees\u201d), -43(a) (\u201cFiling and enforcement of custody decree of another state\u201d); 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1738A (\u201cFull faith and credit given to child custody determinations,\u201d known as the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA)). The pertinent issue in such situations is whether the foreign decree is valid under the terms of the statutes. <em>Ibid. </em>If so, it is entitled to be enforced in the same manner as a custody decree issued by a New Jersey court. <em>Ibid. </em>If the decree had been validly modified by the issuing court, then the initial decree is invalid to the extent it has been modified, but the decree as modified is entitled to enforcement by this state. <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:34-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Neither party has disputed that the August 28, 1991 order was valid when entered. Plaintiffs counsel agreed at oral argument before us that plaintiffs <em>ex parte </em>attempt in February 1992 to change the wording of the order because of what plaintiffs Florida counsel characterized as \u201ccertain inaccuracies\u201d rendered the ensuing Florida order invalid. The questions before this court are therefore whether plaintiffs later attempts to modify the order resulted in valid enforceable orders, thus invalidating provisions of the August 28, 1991 order, and whether New Jersey gained jurisdiction to modify the August 28, 1991 order. We conclude that the custody provisions of the August 28, 1991 order are entitled to enforcement, as it was not validly modified, and that New Jersey alone has jurisdiction to modify that order insofar as it pertains to custody and visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">In the August 28, 1991 order, Florida retained jurisdiction for only six months. On the day jurisdiction was to expire, the Florida court issued an order retaining jurisdiction after an <em>ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>parte </em>application by the plaintiff. A number of Florida orders issued over the next several years, most, if not all, without proper notice to the defendant, stating by their terms that Florida retained jurisdiction. But, as plaintiffs counsel conceded at oral argument, if the February 28, 1992 order retaining jurisdiction was void, then Florida had ceded jurisdiction by the terms of its August 1991 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">On at least two occasions after defendant\u2019s move to New Jersey, the judges of New Jersey and Florida conferred as required by the UCCJA N.J.S.A 2A:34-34c and Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 61.1314 (West 1985), and attempted to resolve the jurisdiction issue. On each occasion the Florida judge determined that the best interests of the children mandated that Florida cede jurisdiction to New Jersey and so ordered, but thereafter upon <em>ex parte </em>application by plaintiff,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Florida judges rescinded their orders and again asserted jurisdiction. The Florida and New Jersey judges most recently conferred and recognized that, given the convoluted history of this case, the primary determinant of jurisdiction in this case should be the best interests of the children. The Florida judge clearly and unequivocally stated in his order of January 29, 1996 that the best interests of the children required the custody and support issues to be determined in New Jersey. Similarly, the earlier March 4, 1994 Florida order relinquishing jurisdiction acknowledged that the New Jersey court \u201cis in a better position to determine the status of the children due to access to teachers, doctors, neighbors and other persons with more up-to-date knowledge of the children____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The order of April 2, 1996 rescinding the courts\u2019 agreement did not even treat the issue of the children\u2019s best interests. Interestingly, we note that in this order the court adopted the procedural history advanced by plaintiff in the belatedly served memoran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>dum, whole sections of which were expressly disavowed by plaintiffs counsel before us at oral argument as having been in blatant disregard of federal and state statutory requirements and defendant\u2019s due process rights, a recurrent theme throughout this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">There is no question that the originally amended Florida decree of August 28,1991 was the last clearly valid custody order. Under the PKPA, this order, in conjunction with plaintiffs continued residence in Florida, constituted a potential basis for continued jurisdiction in Florida. 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1738A(d). But the existence of this valid Florida order does not carry with it continued Florida jurisdiction over custody matters when such jurisdiction has been expressly relinquished or lost. 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1738A(f)(2); <em>E.E.B. v. D.A, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>595, 611, 446 A.2d 871 (1982) , <em>cert. denied, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>1210, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1203, 75 L.Ed.2d 445 (1983) . Under the UCCJA the best interests of the children now determine which state will govern these proceedings. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A34-31. Having said this, and recognizing the long and bitter history of these parties, we will explain our legal conclusions in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">1. <em>Full Faith and Credit Under the UCCJA and the PKPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Interstate jurisdictional issues regarding child custody are governed by the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1738A (PKPA). The provisions of the PKPA work in tandem with each state\u2019s version of the Uniform Child Custody and Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA). <em>Thompson v. Thompson, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>174, 181, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>513, 517, 98 L.Ed.2d 512, 521 (1988). As a federal statute, the PKPA preempts the UCCJA\u2019s jurisdictional comity provisions at any point where the acts conflict. <em>Matter of Adoption of Child by T.W.C., </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>225, 233, 636 A.2d 1083 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">As indicated by its heading, \u201cFull faith and credit given to child custody determinations,\u201d the PKPA guides this court in determining when it must give full faith and credit to, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>enforce, a particular custody decree of another state.

The August 28, 1991 Florida order states that \u201cJurisdiction is reserved over the parties and the subject matter for six (6) months from the entry of this order.\u201d The court\u2019s strong language during the hearing and in its order indicates its intention to minimize plaintiffs and his family\u2019s ability to use the Florida court to further disrupt the lives of defendant and the children. The Florida docket shows eighty-three entries from the May 1990 date of the divorce until the court granted defendant\u2019s petition to leave the state in August 1991. The Florida judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">The wife has presented as best she can a plan to move to California. Now, unfortunately a most convenient time [sic]. She has no lodging, no money and constant oppression. If the mother wants to try for a better life with the two children, the court gives her its blessings. Slavery was abolished 125 years ago and so was oppression. The mother\u2019s condition following her divorce has been analogous to that of a slave chained to false accusations, constant allegations and hatred. A human being deserves better.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The court\u2019s August 28,1991 order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">FINDINGS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">1.

That the oldest child, [WJ, age 5, was evaluated by Dr. Simon Miranda, a psychologist. [W.] came across as an efficient and friendly child who seemed highly stressed and conflicted, relative to the emotionally charged inter-family issues that have developed around him. It appeared to Dr. Miranda that [W.] feels confused and caught in the middle of a very hostile inter-parental/grandparental struggle, wherein there is open warfare between both the Mother and the Father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>generated by the Father\u2019s family, particularly the paternal-grandmother, against the Mother, which is vindictive, smothering, and oppressive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">3. Based on the two-volume history of this case and upon the evidence before the Court, the Court finds that the paternal grandmother is well versed in psychological and litigious behavior, and that the Mother\u2019s life following her divorce has been filled with false and improper accusations. Such tactics cannot be used to obtain a change of custody to the Father, and cannot be used to defeat a relocation of the Mother to obtain a better life for her children and her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">4. That the Mother is more credible than the husband with respect to the issues before the Court, and that the equities are with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">9. That the Father should be entitled to liberal visitation, including summers and holidays, and have complete access by telephone with his children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Based on the above findings, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">B. There is to be no harassment of the Mother upon leaving Florida. She is to keep the security guard present when the Father has his final good-byes with the children. One false move by either side, including the Father\u2019s family, will be dealt with accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">D. Both parties are to provide each other with current residence addresses and phone numbers, both at work and at home.

All notices required under this Order shall be provided by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall be mailed to the most convenient address for immediate delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">H. The Father shall not take and shall not permit any other person to take either of the children to a psychologist, psychiatrist, or similar service while the children are visiting with him. If, after the initial period of adjustment, he wants the to [sic] pay for the children to go to a psychologist, he may do so in California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">L.

The Mother and children may leave Florida on August 30,1991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">T. Jurisdiction is reserved over the parties and the subject matter for six (6) months from the entry of this order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The transcript of the proceeding shows that, despite plaintiff\u2019s repeated requests, the court specifically refused to retain jurisdiction beyond the six month period. We find that, under these circumstances, the August 28, 1991 Florida order by its terms relinquished jurisdiction after the expiration of the six month period and that it did so in consideration of the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">As noted earlier, the two subsequent orders entered within the six month period and purporting to retain jurisdiction do not meet the requirements of the PKPA and are not entitled to full faith and credit. To be entitled to full faith and credit, a child custody determination <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> must comply with due process as well as jurisdictional requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">Before a child custody determination is made, reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard shall be given to the contestants----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-12\">[28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738A(e)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">The PKPA\u2019s reasonable notice provision is consistent with a similar provision in New Jersey\u2019s UCCJA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">No New Jersey court has fully explored the issue of lack of notice under either the PKPA or the UCCJA. Only one published case has even raised the issue. In <em>D.B. v. R.B., </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>405, 413, 652 A.2d 1254 (App.Div.1995), the plaintiff asserted that a Virginia Court had acted inconsistently with the UCCJA and had not obtained personal jurisdiction over her because she had never been properly served and the summons contained an incorrect address. The court found that she had received actual notice and had appeared throughout the Virginia proceedings fully repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>sented by counsel, thus establishing personal jurisdiction. <em>Ibid; cf. Bednarsh v. Bednarsh, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>482, 491-92, 660 A.2d 575 (Ch.Div.1995) (considering a similar reasonable notice provision in the federal Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>1738B(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The issue of lack of notice has arisen before this court most often in the context of international custody disputes, requiring application of a different and more explicit comity provision in the UCCJA <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-51. <em>See, e.g., Ali v. Ali, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>154, 163-67, 652 A.2d 253 (App.Div.1994); <em>Schmidt v. Schmidt, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 533, 548 A.2d 195 (App.Div.1988); <em>Mc. v.

Carver, supra, </em>and <em>In re Thorensen, </em>46 <em>Wash.App. </em>493, 730 P.2d 1380 (Wash.Ct.App.1987)); <em>accord Snow v. Snow, supra, </em>369 <em>N.</em>W.2d at 583 (South Dakota court no longer had jurisdiction over initial decree because it was not proceeding in accordance with applicable state and federal law when it entered <em>ex parte </em>decree transferring custody). The Washington and Minnesota courts relied on 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>1738A(d) which states that \u201c[t]he jurisdiction of a court of a State which had made a child custody determination consistently with the provisions of this section continues as long as the requirement of subsection (c)(1) continues to be met and such State remains the residence of the child or of any contestant.\u201d <em>State v. Carver, supra, </em>781 P.2d at 1317-1318; <em>In re Thorensen, supra, </em>730 P.2d at 1385; <em>Snow v. Snow, supra, </em>369 N.W.2d at 583. Thus even if the Florida court had not declined to retain jurisdiction beyond the six months set forth in its August 1991 order, Florida\u2019s subsequent reassertions of jurisdiction without proper notice to defendant were ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In the case before this court, the two Florida orders purporting to extend jurisdiction and entered prior to the expiration of the six month retention of jurisdiction were issued without proper notice to defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel has specifically agreed before us that the order signed February 6, 1992 is void. It was issued upon <em>ex parte </em>application by plaintiff\u2019s Florida counsel who later testified before the New Jersey court that he had never even attempted to give notice to defendant or to serve her with a copy of the amended order, and that he knew she was unrepresented at the time. Defendant first discovered the existence of the February 6, 1992 order almost two months after it was signed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>issuance of the order clearly did not comply with the reasonable notice provision of either the PKPA or the UCCJA. Consequently, it is not entitled to the full faith and credit of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Similarly, the order signed on February 28, 1992 is not entitled to full faith and credit because of the lack of proper notice. Plaintiffs Florida counsel testified in New Jersey that the petition forming the basis for this order was not personally served on defendant until March 17, 1992, almost one month after the order was signed. While the PKPA does not define \u201creasonable notice and opportunity to be heard,\u201d both New Jersey\u2019s and Florida\u2019s UCCJA require that notice be given at least 20 days before a hearing. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-33(b); Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 61.1312(2). (New Jersey\u2019s statute has an exception for emergent situations, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34r-34(b); Florida\u2019s does not.) Plaintiff made no attempt prior to the hearing to serve notice upon defendant at her father\u2019s address in California as earlier directed by the Florida court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, according to the certificate of service, he had mailed the notice to a dentist\u2019s office where he believed that defendant worked. Although defendant admits that she, by chance, became aware of the hearing on the day it was held, such notice as defendant received cannot be deemed \u201creasonable\u201d under any interpretation of the statutes. Plaintiff deliberately circumvented the court\u2019s prior order regarding service upon defendant. Defendant had none of plaintiff\u2019s moving papers and no counsel, and thus she had no basis to assess her rights or to assert her position. The resulting February 28, 1992 order purporting to retain jurisdiction did not comply with the notice requirements of the PKPA as it was obtained in violation of defendant\u2019s due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>process rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As such, the order is not entitled to full faith and credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Since neither this order nor the February 4, 1992 order is entitled to our full faith and credit, we conclude that the August 28, 1991 order was the only valid custody order in effect at the expiration of the six-month period. By its terms, that order relinquished jurisdiction as of six months from the date of its entry, and at that point any state which had a basis to assert jurisdiction under the UCCJA and PKPA could have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">After February 28, 1992, the Florida court continued to issue orders \u201cretaining\u201d or \u201cextending\u201d jurisdiction over the matter. The orders, issued outside of the six-month period established by the August 1991 order, asserted no new basis for jurisdiction and, as with the previous orders, were issued without defendant having received reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard. The first of these orders issued on June 2,1992 as a result of a March 30,1992 hearing before a general master and purportedly affected plaintiffs support obligation. On March 26,1992, via regular mail defendant had received a simple notice, with no supporting papers, of a March 30, 1992 hearing regarding a change of custody. The general master denied defendant\u2019s telephone request for an adjournment so she might retain local counsel. Under the threat of losing custody of her children, she therefore participated in the hearing via telephone, unrepresented by an attorney, and again unaware of the content of plaintiffs submission to the court. We cannot view defendant\u2019s forced participation in this proceeding as constituting an appearance conferring jurisdiction anew on Florida. A bare notice, received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>four days before a hearing in another state, along with the court\u2019s denial of an adjournment to retain local counsel cannot in our view meet the PKPA\u2019s or UCCJA\u2019s standards requiring reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard for a person threatened with the loss of her children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, as we noted, the order asserted no new basis of jurisdiction, and, at this point, Florida had no jurisdiction by reason of its cession of jurisdiction in its August 28,1991 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Subsequently, defendant attempted through local counsel to bring to the general master\u2019s attention via an emergency petition for rehearing plaintiff\u2019s actions in obtaining the 1992 orders. This was essentially a challenge to the prior orders, not a new submission of the matter to the Florida court. Although a hearing was held on June 4, 1992, the master refused to consider the merits of defendant\u2019s petition because he said he lacked jurisdiction to do so. No order issued as a result of this hearing. We see no reason to disagree with the Florida court\u2019s conclusion that it had no jurisdiction over the matter merely on the basis of defendant\u2019s petition.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>According to both parties\u2019 Florida attorneys, no further hearings were held in Florida during 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">2. <em>Modification Jurisdiction Under the PKPA and the UC-CJA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">We now reach the question of whether New Jersey gained the right to modify the August 28, 1991 order as it pertains to custody. As we noted earlier, the defendant had remarried in January 1992. Her new husband was a member of the Coast Guard and the family moved with him when he was transferred to New Jersey in January 1993. On January 28, 1993, defendant filed the August 28, 1991 order with the clerk of the Superior Court and the clerk assigned a docket number. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-43. The same day, defendant\u2019s counsel filed with the Florida court a \u201cNotice, Pursuant to UCCJA, For Change of Jurisdiction From Florida to New Jersey.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel was apparently under the mistaken assumption that either this notice or the filing of the judgment in New Jersey conferred absolute jurisdiction on New Jersey under the UCCJA. But, the filing of the judgment in New Jersey, without more, merely permitted this state to enforce the foreign custody order. <em>Compare N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-43 (enforcement of foreign decree) <em>with N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-42 (modification of foreign decree); <em>see </em>Brigitte M. Bodenheimer, <em>Interstate Custody: Initial Jurisdiction and Continuing Jurisdiction under the UCCJA </em>14 <em>Fam. L. Q. </em>203, 220-21 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Under the PKPA\u2019s modification provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">ffi A court of a State may <em>modify </em>a determination <em>of </em>the custody of the same child made by a court of another State, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">(1) it has jurisdiction to make such a child custody determination; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">(2) the court of the other State no longer has jurisdiction, or it has declined to exercise such jurisdiction to modify such determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-12\">[28 <em>US.C.A \u00a7 </em>1738A(f).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Subsection (2) is satisfied in that Florida declined to exercise continuing jurisdiction by the terms of the August 28, 1991 order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Thus, the second requirement for New Jersey\u2019s exercise of modification jurisdiction is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">To determine whether New Jersey has jurisdiction to make a custody order thus satisfying the first requirement, we look to the jurisdictional prerequisites of our own UCCJA. <em>Neger v. Neger, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>15, 31, 459 A.2d 628 (1983). New Jersey clearly has jurisdiction under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-31a(2). <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-31(a)(2) sets out one of four possible, independent bases for jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">a. The Superior Com\u00ed; of the State of New Jersey has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination by initial or modification decree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">(2) It is in the best interest of the child that a court of this State assume jurisdiction because (i) the child and his parents, or the child and at least one contestant, have a significant connection with this State, and (ii) there is available in this State substantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The children have a significant connection with this state. It is the residence of their mother, with whom they have lived for their entire seven and ten-year-old lives. The children themselves have resided here for three and a half years. It is the home of their stepfather who, along with their mother, has provided their financial support during these years that their father has refused to pay child support. This is not a ease where the children were removed from Florida surreptitiously or brought to New Jersey for the purpose of concealment. They left Florida with the blessing of the Florida court and came to reside in New Jersey as a result of their stepfather\u2019s career.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the litigation in this State may have dragged on longer than it should have, the resulting New Jersey orders did not unfairly permit or prolong the children\u2019s residence in this State. There was no reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the trial court or this court to disregard the fact, twice recognized by the Florida court, that all of the evidence concerning the children\u2019s schooling, babysitters, Mends and daily lives for the past several years is located in New Jersey, thus more than meeting the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of the statute. Thus, we conclude that New Jersey has jurisdiction to modify the August 28,1991 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Plaintiff argues, however, that whether or not New Jersey had jurisdiction, it was restricted from exercising that jurisdiction by 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>1738A(g) which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">A court of a State shall not exercise jurisdiction in any proceeding for a custody determination commenced during the pendency of a proceeding in a court of another State where such court of that other State is exercising jurisdiction consistently with the provisions of this section to make a custody determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">We have already determined that Florida no longer had jurisdiction over the matter at the time the parties appeared in New Jersey. Since any proceedings in Florida at that time therefore were necessarily inconsistent with the provisions of the UCCJA, it is unnecessary for us to evaluate whether a particular allegedly pending proceeding involved an exercise of jurisdiction consistent with the terms of the PKPA. We note, however, that each of the particular actions on which plaintiff attempts to rely were conducted without proper notice in disregard of defendant\u2019s statutory due process rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such <em>ex parte </em>proceedings to modify the earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>decree did not constitute pending actions which would have precluded the New Jersey court from exercising its jurisdiction on the custody issues. <em>Snow v. Snow, supra, </em>369 N.W.2d at 583. <em>Cf. Wachter v. Wackter, </em>439 So. 2d 1260, 1263-65 (La.Ct.App.1983) and <em>Elder v. Park, </em>104 <em>N.M. </em>163, 717 P.2d 1132, 1137 (Ct.App.1986) (applying first-in-time rule where initial custody decree was issued without notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Finally, we note plaintiff\u2019s argument that he was entitled to disregard the orders of the New Jersey court because it had no jurisdiction over him personally. There is clear personal jurisdiction over plaintiff by reason of his appearance in New Jersey. <em>R. </em>4:4-6. In any event, personal jurisdiction is not required when a court is exercising jurisdiction solely over custody matters, provided that the party is given reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard. <em>Genoe v. Genoe, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 15, 500 A.2d 3 (App.Div.1985). Plaintiffs jurisdictional arguments as they pertain to the custody issue are therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">B. <em>Child Support Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">We now turn to the child support provisions of the August 28,1991 order. Merely registering the out-of-state order with the Clerk of the Superior court in accordance with the UCCJA does not enable a New Jersey court to enforce or modify the support provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">We will first discuss New Jersey\u2019s ability to modify the support provisions of the August 28, 1991 Florida order. On October 20, 1994, Congress enacted the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (FFCCSOA), Pub.L. No. 103-383, 108 Stat. 4064 (codified as 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1738B). Obviously, the Act\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>guidance was unavailable to the trial court when it was first confronted with this case in 1993. Under the continuing jurisdiction section of the FFCCSOA, the Florida court retained exclusive jurisdiction to modify this support order because plaintiff, as a contestant, remained a resident of that State and no other state gained the authority to modify the order. 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738B(d). Modification authority under the statute is limited to circumstances where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">(1) the court has jurisdiction to make such a child support order; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">(2) (A) the court of the other State no longer has continuing exclusive jurisdiction of the child support order because that State no longer is the child\u2019s State or the residence of any contestant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">(B) each contestant has filed written consent to that court\u2019s making the modification and assuming continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">[28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738B(e).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Since the parties\u2019 apparently have not filed written consent allowing our courts or those of any other state to modify the order and since plaintiff remains a Florida resident, under the FFCCSOA, apparently neither this State nor any other gained authority to modify the support provisions of the August 28, 1991 order. Florida therefore retained continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the support provisions of this order, and New Jersey is without authority to modify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">If defendant wishes to enforce these provisions, she must avail herself of the enforcement methods established by the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement Act, (RURESA), <em>N.J.S.A 2A:4-</em>30.24 to 30.64, which we will explain further. In <em>Kulko v. California Superior Court, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>84, 100-101, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1690, 1701, 56 L.Ed.2d 132, 146 (1978), the Supreme Court held that the mere presence in a state of the support obligee and the children was insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over an obligor who was domiciled in another state. <em>See also Genoe v. Genoe, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 500 A.2d 3 (App.Div.1985) (distinguishing jurisdiction necessary to enforce an out-of-state custody versus support order). The Court found that a proper mechanism for facilitating the collection of child support in such circumstances already existed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the URESA statutes adopted by both parties\u2019 states. <em>Kutko v. California Superior Court, </em>436 <em>U.S </em>at 98-99, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1700-1701, 56 L.Ed.2d at 145-46. These statutes allow an obligeeparent claiming support from an out-of-state parent to file the petition in his or her own state, yet have it adjudicated on the merits in the obligor\u2019s state of residence without either party leaving their own state. <em>Id. </em>at 99, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1700, 56 L.Ed.2d at 145. The Court offered a very clear explanation of how the statutes function:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">Under the [Uniform] Act, an \u201cobligee\u201d may file a petition in a court of his or her State (the \u201cinitiating court\u201d) to* obtain support. If the court \u201cfinds that the [petition] sets forth facts from which it may be determined that the obligor owes a duty of support and that a court of the responding state may obtain jurisdiction of the obligor or his property,\u201d it may send a copy of the petition to the \u201cresponding state.\u201d This has the effect of requesting the responding State \u201cto obtain jurisdiction over the obligor.\u201d If jurisdiction is obtained, then a hearing is set in a court in the responding State at which the obligor may, if he chooses, contest the claim. The claim may be litigated in that court, with deposition testimony submitted through the initiating court by the initiating spouse or other party. If the responding state court finds that the obligor owes a duty of support pursuant to the laws of the State where he or she was present during the time when support was sought, judgment for the petitioner is entered. If the money is collected from the spouse in the responding State, it is then sent to the court in the initiating State for distribution to the initiating party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 99 n. 13, 98 <em>S.Ct </em>at 1700 n. 13, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 146 n. 13. (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">To enforce her claim, defendant therefore must file a complaint under the RURESA provisions set out in <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:4-30.35. The New Jersey court, as the initiating state, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4-30.26c, will then assess the complaint and, if appropriate, certify the complaint and send it to the Florida court, <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:4-30.38. None of defendant\u2019s actions thus far precluded her from following these procedures if she wished to enforce the support provisions of the August 1991 order. Defendant\u2019s attempt to enforce the support order should be treated as an application under RURESA, and should now be so processed. Her complaint, when filed, shall be deemed to date back to her initial application for enforcement of the Florida support order. When the matter is consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ered in Florida, we trust that the circumstances described earlier giving rise to the amended support orders will be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Accordingly, we hold that plaintiff has correctly asserted that New Jersey is without subject matter jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing the child support provisions of the August 1991 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Since we are now the sole state with jurisdiction over custody and visitation issues, the order of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey is affirmed as it affects custody and visitation. The order of the Family Part is reversed and vacated insofar as it asserts jurisdiction over the support provisions of the August 28, 1991 order and to the extent that it provides modification or enforcement relief in the area of support. We remand for processing defendant\u2019s RURESA complaint for support, which should be considered retroactive to her initial application to the Family Part. Finally, in light of our ruling concerning support jurisdiction, we remand for the trial court\u2019s reconsideration of the amount of counsel fees awarded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\"> Given the conclusion of the Florida court in its April 2, 1996 order purporting to retain custody jurisdiction, we have prepared and attached a detailed analysis of the salient events giving rise to each order described by the Florida court. The factual history in that order, however, adopted from plaintiff\u2019s memorandum, incorporated numerous inaccuracies and misrepresentations suggesting the extent to which plaintiff has misled the Florida court. We have not included the Addendum in the published opinion, as it is intended primarily for use by the parties and courts involved in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">We are not, of course, reviewing the Florida order. Such a function belongs to a Florida appellate court. The concurring opinion expands upon this principle and there is no disagreement among the members of this Part concerning the concurrence. We differentiate between an appellate review, which is the right of the Florida courts, and an analysis of the Florida orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>under the PKPA and UCCJA to determine how they might affect New Jersey's right to assert jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\"> The \u201csomeone\u201d was a judge of the New Jersey Superior Court acting as directed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-35d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\"> On December 27, 1995, plaintiff\u2019s current counsel in a letter to the Florida State Attorney, criticized the stipulations and relayed his \u201dastonish[ment]\u2019\u2019 that \u201cthese questions\" were not brought to the attention of the State Attorney or plaintiff\u2019s counsel. However, as the New Jersey prosecutor had advised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>court during the hearing, he had discussed the issues with the Florida State Attorney. Additionally, while plaintiff was technically not a party to the writ which was a criminal proceeding, his attorney had directly observed the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> Notice of the latest application was sent to defendant, but she was given none of the other moving papers until weeks after the order was entered.

Plaintiff\u2019s attorney was copied on the order which stated that \u201call further pleadings shall be served on the Former Wife, MARY PAYNE, now known as MARY ASHCRAFT, and sent to her c/o Richard Payne, [California address and telephone number], until such time as she retains new counsel and an appearance is filed on her behalf.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\"> Furthermore, the order states that the court was advised that the parties had waived their right to object to the hearing officer\u2019s report, which the court adopted the same day it was issued. Although in this analysis we do not purport to review Florida\u2019s compliance with its own laws, it is difficult to understand how the defendant could have waived her right to object to a proceeding in which all parties agree that she did not participate and of which she lacked proper notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\"> Moreover, it is clear that the hearing itself did not afford the kind of full and fair hearing which may have overcome the notice deficiencies. Although defendant had informed the court that she had received only a bare notice of the hearing, with no supporting papers or financial documents from plaintiff and no notice of referral which would have informed her of her obligation to supply certain documents, she was admonished and financially penalized for not providing the documents. Also, it was during this hearing that defendant and the court became aware that plaintiff had had the August 28, 1991 order changed without notifying defendant. The court apparently ignored this information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> We note that the master decided he did have jurisdiction to hear old matters regarding sanctions and contempt against defendant arising out of custody issues, although defendant had no notice that these matters would be considered at the hearing, and in fact, had never received proper notice of these petitions. Once again, under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to conclude that defendant had received reasonable notice or opportunity to be heard. However, no court order issued as a result of this hearing, and therefore, under the PKPA, there is no need for us to review the propriety of the general master's actions in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b316-9\"> The Florida court permitted a move to California. The move to New Jersey actually brought the children geographically closer to plaintiff. We perceive no reason why the Florida court would have permitted the California move, which allowed defendant to move closer to her family there, but would have denied a request by defendant to accompany her new husband upon his transfer to New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\"> On Februaiy 16, 1993, plaintiff asserted before the New Jersey court that there were \"various motions currently pending\u201d in Florida regarding the parties\u2019 minor children. However, one of these \u201cmotions\" was apparently non-existent, and defendant had never been notified of the other. On February 4, 1993, plaintiff filed in Florida a \"Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement and/or for Re-Hearing.\u201d The notice was certified as having been mailed to defendant\u2019s Florida attorney. She, however, stated that she never received such papers. Given the history of non-service of the earlier motion papers, admitted by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, we give credence to this assertion. Defendant\u2019s New Jersey counsel also certified that he did not receive such a motion, but he did receive a March 1, 1993 notice of hearing for March 30, 1993, which referenced this motion. The notice also stated that the hearing would consider defendant\u2019s motion to transfer jurisdiction. However, as explained earlier, defendant had never filed such a motion. On March 8, 1993, defendant\u2019s counsel received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>notice of hearing on a \u201cMotion to Determine Jurisdiction.\" Defendant had no knowledge of any such motion and, aside from this notice, there is no evidence in the record that any such motion ever existed. Nonetheless, on March 12, 1993, the Florida court issued an order denying \"Respondent\u2019s [defendant\u2019s] Motion to Transfer Jurisdiction to New Jersey.\" The order does not refer to plaintiff\u2019s motion concerning the purported settlement agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b321-9\">KESTIN, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AG\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Because of Judge Dreier\u2019s prodigious effort in developing a detailed analysis of the sordid procedural history of this case, I am now persuaded that an adequate basis existed upon which a New Jersey trial court could validly assert subject matter jurisdiction over the custody and visitation issues. This is not to minimize defendant\u2019s primary responsibility to proceed by way of appeal in Florida to challenge any order of a Florida court by which she felt aggrieved. There was, however, an independent factual basis for the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction by our trial court, as Judge Dreier has so capably demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Between the time the Florida trial court expressly established the terms governing its relinquishment of jurisdiction (the expiration of six months after the entry of its August 28,1991 order) and the date of New Jersey\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction, no putative modification of the Florida order can be seen as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>having emanated from a proceeding that satisfied basic due process requirements. Thus, there was no impediment to the assertion of jurisdiction by a New Jersey court, whether motivated by its general <em>parens patriae </em>concerns with the best interests of children resident here for some time, or by a more particularized, straightforward application of the standards contained in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">It must be stressed that, in reaching this conclusion, we are not reviewing the correctness of any determination made in a Florida trial court. That is a responsibility belonging exclusively and completely to the appellate courts of Florida. It is a function which we do not share and which we may not usurp. As I see it, we are merely applying a standard rule that no court is obliged by the full faith and credit clause of <em>U.S. Const, </em>art. IV, \u00a7 1, nor by any other rule of comity, to recognize or give effect to a judgment or order of another state that is clearly unsupported by adherence to fundamental due process standards such as notice and a fair opportunity to be heard. <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>286, 291, 100 <em>S.Ct </em>559, 564, 62 L.Ed.2d 490, 497 (1980) (\u201cA judgment rendered in violation of due process is void in the rendering State and is not entitled to frill faith and credit elsewhere. <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 <em>U.S. </em>714, 732-738, 24 <em>L.Ed. </em>565 (1878). Due process requires that the defendant be given adequate notice of the suit, <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 <em>U.S. </em>306, 313-314, 70 <em>S.Ct. </em>652, 657, 94 <em>L.Ed. </em>865 (1950)[.]\u201d). Such a conclusion follows from a customary and regular exercise of our judicial responsibilities in a matter before us, and is in no way intended to evince anything but the highest respect for the authority and proceedings of the courts in a sister state.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In the latter connection, I believe it is essential, while affirming our trial court\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction, that we emphatically disavow the general tone and some of the terms of its April 13, 1993 order to show cause, from which the Florida trial court has taken justifiable offense. The reference to a decision of a Florida trial judge as having been \u201cimprovidently taken\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>provision that \u201cenjoined\u201d the Florida court from issuing any further orders affecting the issues in dispute were particularly ill advised. The trial court had no right to make the finding and no authority to order the injunctive relief. It not only acted <em>ultra vires </em>in doing so, but it also failed to accord a decent and essential respect to the courts of a sister state. Furthermore, the trial court omitted to address adequately the only valid basis for declining to afford full faith and credit, the due process issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">No judge of this state should ever treat the proceedings or authority of courts and judges in other states with such disdain. None of us is privileged to evaluate the quality or correctness of sister state determinations, as we might well do in respect of decisions by coordinate or subordinate courts in our own state. Nor do we have any warrant whatsoever to enjoin the courts of a sister state from acting according to their best lights. The full faith and credit clause substantially limits our freedom of action in these respects; and our own sense of comity should confine the manner in which we deal with the judicial proceedings of sister states. Absent an independent, temperately expressed determination that due process was lacking, reached with the greatest reluctance, we are commanded to defer to the rulings of courts in other states, and institutionally compelled to exhibit every bit of the grace we expect to be reciprocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Judge CUFF joins in this concurrence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
