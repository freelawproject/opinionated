(U.S. Bronze) from three separate groups of orders affording summary judgments favorable to defendant insurers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and resulting in dismissal of its declaratory judgment complaint. U.S. Bronze instituted the declaratory action seeking to establish coverage under a number of general liability policies for cleanup costs, future remediation and containment expenses it will incur resulting from soil pollution, including soil of neighboring proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>ty, caused primarily by copper sulphates used in its manufacturing processes. The pollutants may be deemed to have migrated by spills, leakage, airborne contamination, and contaminated storm-water runoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The first summary judgments were granted under policies containing the so-called \u201cabsolute pollution exclusion.\u201d Providence Washington Insurance Company (Providence) moved for summary judgment, and Commerce and Industry Insurance Company (C &amp; I) for partial summary judgment under two of its six policies with U.S. Bronze that contained the absolute pollution exclusion. Judge Bernhard\u2019s opinion respecting those motions is reported as <em>United States Bronze Powders, Inc. v. Commerce &amp; Industry Insurance Co., </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. 109, </em>611 A.2d 667 (Law Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">A second series of partial summary judgment motions was initiated seeking judgment that plaintiff was not covered for current and future costs, including fines, associated with treatment and disposal of contaminated stormwater runoff. On May 20, 1993, Judge Herr entered an order on those motions, granting partial summary judgment to C &amp; I, and to defendants Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (Lumbermens), Federal Insurance Company (Federal), Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company (Hartford), Puritan Insurance Company (Puritan), and First State Insurance Company (First State).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">C &amp; I later moved for summary judgment on the remaining U.S. Bronze claims, arguing that they were barred by the standard pollution exclusion clause in its policies; that there was no \u201coccurrence\u201d covered by the policies; and that U.S. Bronze\u2019s knowledge of a risk or loss in progress barred coverage. Hartford, First State, Puritan (by its successor, Westport Insurance Company), and Insurance Company of North America (INA) similarly moved, as did Lumbermens. The latter insurer also contended that its policies were not triggered because no property damage was suffered by the neighboring landowner until the Lumbermens policies had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>On July 7, 1994, Judge Herr heard oral argument on the third set of motions, upholding application and efficacy of the standard pollution exclusion clauses in defendants\u2019 policies because U.S. Bronze was aware that copper emissions were a pollutant, yet intentionally discharged them into the atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The judge also denied portions of those motions concerning existence of a covered \u201coccurrence.\u201d She ruled that there were material areas of dispute regarding U.S. Bronze\u2019s ability and attempts to reduce emissions, the nature of the emissions that were the subject of Department of Environmental Protection concern, toxicity levels on neighboring property, and other factual issues going to the applicability of the \u201cknown loss\u201d doctrine (considered in <em>Astro Pak Corp. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>491, 665 A.2d 1113 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>323, 670 A.2d 1065 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Defendants C &amp; I, Lumbermens, First State, Hartford, Federal, INA and Puritan cross-appealed from the latter rulings. The cross-appeals need not be addressed. First, were we to reverse the grants of summary judgment in favor of the insurers, any other determinations would be rendered interlocutory. More importantly, the cross-appeals are mooted by our view that the U.S. Bronze complaint was properly dismissed following grant of summary judgments to the several insurers, substantially for the reasons set forth in <em>U.S. Bronze, supra, </em>and in the oral opinions of Judge Herr dated May 14,1993 and July 7,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">We add, as to the opinion by Judge Bernhard based upon the absolute pollution exclusion, that <em>In re Hub Recycling, Inc., </em>106 <em>B.R. </em>372 (D.N.J.1989), cited by U.S. Bronze, is clearly distinguishable because here, unlike in <em>Hub, </em>there are no confusing examples of pollutants in the policies that might render the pollution clauses ambiguous. <em>All </em>contaminants or pollutants are unambiguously excluded in the C &amp; I and Providence policies that were the subject of the first motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Respecting U.S. Bronze\u2019s contention (applicable only to C &amp; I) that the neighboring property owner\u2019s allegations of nuisance and negligence fall within the C &amp; I coverage for \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d we recognize that the argument was not considered below. It was apparently engendered by a Law Division opinion, <em>Harvard Industries, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 642 A.2d 438 (Law Div.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In <em>Harvard, </em>the policy excluded coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by pollutants, but specifically included coverage for \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d which had been defined to embrace, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cwrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475-76, 642 A.2d 438. It was there held that permitting environmental contamination to migrate to the property of another was both a trespass and a nuisance, as well as an entry or other invasion of private occupancy. <em>Id. </em>at 478-79, 642 A.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The C &amp; I policy similarly includes \u201cwrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\u201d within the definition of \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d However, we are not bound by, nor do we agree with, the holding in <em>Harvard </em>or its rationale. While the view set forth in <em>Harvard </em>is not without some support, we are persuaded by the reasoning of the majority of courts, exemplified by <em>Harrow Products, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>64 F.3d 1015 (6th Cir.1995), which have declined to render meaningless the unambiguously stated specific pollution exclusion language in liability policies by distorting the scope of personal injury coverage to a point beyond the reasonable expectations of a sophisticated insured. <em>Accord Northbrook Indem. Ins. Co. v. Water Dist. Management Co., </em>892 <em>F.Supp. </em>170, 175-76 (S.D.Tex.1995); <em>East Quincy Sens. Dist. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>864 <em>F.Supp. </em>976, 980-82 (E.D.Cal.1994); <em>Staefa Control-System Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Co., </em>37 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>930,44 Cal.Rptr.2d 4, 7-10 (1995); <em>Legarra v. Federated Mut. Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>Co., </em>35 <em>Cal.App.4th. </em>1472, 42 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>101,108-09 (1995); <em>Titan Corp. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>22 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>457, 27 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>476, 486-87 (1994); <em>County of Columbia v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>83 <em>N.Y.2d </em>618, 612 N.Y.S.2d 345, 634 N.E.2d 946, 948-50 (1994); <em>O\u2019Brien Energy Sys., Inc. v. American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>427 <em>Pa.Super. </em>456, 629 A.2d 957, 964 (1993), <em>appeal denied, </em>537 <em>Pa. </em>633, 642 A.2d 487 (1994). <em>But see Pipefitters Welfare Educ. Fund v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., </em>976 F.2d 1037 (7th Cir.1992); <em>Titan Holdings Syndicate v. City of Keene, </em>898 F.2d 265 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Lastly, as to the third and final series of motions, resolved on July 7, 1994, our review of the record confirms Judge Herr\u2019s statement, \u201cIt is incontrovertible that U.S.B. intentionally discharged a known pollutant.\u201d That efforts were made to reduce the extent of the discharges does not alter the validity of the court\u2019s observation. Thus, <em>Morton International, Inc. v. General Accident Insurance Co. of America, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>1, 78, 629 A.2d 831 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>2764, 129 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>878 (1994) , is apt, as the court held, and summary judgment was properly afforded. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 539-40, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">It is unnecessary to consider the respondents\u2019 arguments on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-12\">The counts against defendants Integrity Insurance Company and American Mutual Liability Insurance Company were dismissed by reason of liquidation and insolvency, respectively. Additionally, U.S. Bronze entered into a stipulation of dismissal without prejudice with American Empire Surplus Lines Insurance Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
