The conviction followed the denial of a renewed motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">On appeal, defendant raises two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-16\">POINT I THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTIONS FOR VIOLATING <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50 and <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.2 MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE ARRESTING OFFICER UNCONSTITUTIONALLY ENTERED THE DEFENDANT\u2019S DWELLING, WITHOUT AN ARREST WARRANT OR A SEARCH WARRANT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-17\">POINT II EVEN IF THE ARRESTING OFFICER\u2019S ACTIONS WERE CONSTITUTIONAL, THE DEFENDANT\u2019S D.W.I. CONVICTION MUST STILL BE REVERSED BECAUSE THERE IS INSUFFICIENT CREDIBLE EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD TO SUPPORT SUCH A CONVICTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Our review of the record discloses that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact on the motion to suppress as well as its findings and conclusions on the merits are well supported by substantial evidence and are entitled to deference. <em>State v.
