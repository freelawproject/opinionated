For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below, together with all reasonable inferences that may be drawn. <em>Garcia v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 184, 189, 578 S.E.2d 97, 99 (2003). So viewed, the evidence established that, around 10:00 a.m. on September 28, 2002, Stephanie Moroffko left her residence and walked to a convenience store where she bought milk and wine. She then sat on a brick wall nearby and started drinking the wine. Molina, whom Moroffko did not know, approached and spoke to her. She and Molina engaged in conversation about Moroffko\u2019s family problems, and Moroffko remembered engaging in some hugging and kissing with Molina before she was struck on the head with something hard and lost consciousness. Moroffko awoke in the hospital, suffering facial lacerations, broken facial bones, and a head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Officer Michael Koltz was patrolling the area around the convenience store on September 28, 2002. As he drove his police car to the rear of a laundromat located in the area, he saw Molina standing behind a bush looking toward the ground. Molina was fully dressed and appeared to be talking to someone. Koltz noted another individual lying on the ground; the individual was later identified as Jose Membrano. Within twenty seconds of Koltz\u2019s arrival, Molina \u201cleaned over at the waist and looked in [the police officer\u2019s] direction.\u201d He then \u201cstood up and began to walk away from the bush, across the parking lot in a northeasterly direction.\u201d Koltz approached Molina and engaged him in conversation, at which time he saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Membrano exit from behind the bush. Subsequently, he found Moroffko lying on the ground behind the bush where Molina and Membrano had been when Koltz arrived. Moroffko was unconscious and partially nude. Koltz\u2019s efforts to revive her were unsuccessful. Based on Molina\u2019s conduct, flushed face, reddened eyes, and an odor of alcohol that he emitted, Koltz arrested Molina for being drunk in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Emergency Medical Services (EMS) worker Lieutenant Linda Arnold responded to Koltz\u2019s call for assistance. Arnold testified that she found Moroffko unconscious and unresponsive, lying face up on the ground in the midst of debris, behind a tree. She was unclothed from the waist down, and swelling on her face and eyes was observable.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Nancy Susco, a registered nurse in the emergency room at INOVA Fairfax Hospital where EMS personnel transported Moroffko, collected evidence from her using a physical evidence recovery kit (PERK). Susco described Moroffko as disheveled, her hair matted, and covered in blood and debris. Using a special dye and a medscope, Susco found that Moroffko had some \u201cscattered uptake\u201d injuries to her vaginal area.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Detective John Kelly, the lead detective in the investigation, interviewed Molina on September 29, 2002. Molina admitted having consensual sexual intercourse with Moroffko, but denied having anal intercourse. In his statement to Kelly, Molina described what occurred during his encounter with Moroffko. According to Molina, after Moroffko told him about her family problems, she said she wanted to lie down and have sexual intercourse. Molina further recounted that Moroffko \u201cpulled him down on top of her\u201d after he helped her lie down, \u201cand they had sex.\u201d Afterwards, Molina left the area to speak with some friends. When he realized that Membrano was not among the group, he returned to the area behind the bush and saw Membrano on top of Moroffko. Molina said he told Membrano to leave Moroffko alone. Membrano refused and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>turned Moroffko over, instead. According to Molina, Moroffko was less clothed than she had been when he had sex with her and, in contrast with her earlier appearance, she looked sick and drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Jennifer Gombos, a forensic scientist for the Department of Forensic Science, was qualified as an expert in DNA analysis. Molina stipulated to the admission of the certificate of analysis, which showed that his DNA was found in vaginal and anal swabs taken from Moroffko. Molina could not be eliminated as a possible contributor of the material on either swab; the test eliminated Membrano. On cross-examination, Gombos testified that it is \u201cpossible in certain circumstances\u201d that seminal fluid can be transferred to another part of the body, with the caveat that \u201cit\u2019s highly unlikely that it gets transferred from an external portion of the body to an internal area of the body naturally, without being manually done or some physical force being used in order to take something from the external part of the body and insert it vaginally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">At trial, Moroffko testified that she took prescribed doses of Xanax, Zanaflex, Lithium, Zoloft, Zethacoat, and Nexium the night before the incident. However, she denied taking cocaine or any other illicit drugs and could not explain the presence of cocaine in her system. Addressing her drug intake on September 28th, Moroffko stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">I hadn\u2019t taken anything. I don\u2019t know if I had taken my medication or not, but if I had it was what was prescribed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">And I drank just the wine that I said I drank and had a seizure, so it was not just because of my pills or the alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Moroffko could not recall the interview she had with the police at the hospital on the day of the incident, despite being shown a transcript of the interview. She was able to recall a second interview conducted by the police at the hospital the next day. When confronted with inconsistencies or certain responses elicited in the second interview, Moroffko either could not recall having made the statements or denied the accuracy of the information. Moroffko conceded she experienced past episodes of losing consciousness and \u201cblack outs\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>which she suffered a loss of memory. She further acknowledged a history of abusing alcohol and prescribed drugs, as well as a history of seizures and bipolar disease. She attributed the blackout episodes she experienced to an excessive use of prescribed medication or alcohol or both. She denied the occurrence of either circumstance in this case, and she consistently denied ingesting illegal dugs or giving consent to any sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">After the Commonwealth rested its case-in-chief, Molina moved to strike the evidence. The trial court granted the motions as to abduction and malicious wounding charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In his defense, Molina introduced testimony from five experts: Dr. Kamal Jajoda, a psychiatrist; Patrick Slifka, a licensed clinical social worker; Dr. Cynthia Gauss, a psychiatrist; Dr. Magnus Ikhinmwin, an emergency room physician; and Dr. William Morton, Jr., a psychopharmacologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Dr. Jajoda was Moroffko\u2019s treating physician. She began treating her in July or August 2002, one to two months before the incident. Based on the history that Morrofko reported which included \u201cmood changes, depression \u2014 occasionally with hypomania,\u201d Dr. Jajoda thought she \u201cprobably had a bipolar disorder and that she was in what we call a mixed state,\u201d meaning she manifested \u201csymptoms of both moods.\u201d Moroffko did not report symptoms consistent with mania when she began treatment with Dr. Jajoda, and symptoms of mania were not observed during the period she treated her, ending in September 2002. She noted, however, that Moroffko appeared to suffer from manic \u201cepisodes,\u201d namely, irritability, sleeplessness, and anxiety. Dr. Jajoda indicated in her progress notes that Moroffko was \u201ccycling,\u201d which meant her \u201cmood is not stabilized.\u201d Moroffko was \u201cstill going between depression and up moods, which are mild hypomania,\u201d according to this physician. She further testified that a bipolar patient who fails to take the lithium as prescribed could \u201cgo into depression or into hypomania, depending on individual response.\u201d Dr. Jajoda described hypomania as \u201ca state when there is decreased need for sleep and increased energy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>physical energy and impulsive behavior.\u201d She prescribed 900 mg of lithium per day, as well as Depakote and Tegretol, all of which \u201care used as mood stabilizers,\u201d in order to control Moroffko\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Patrick Slifka, a consultant and certified substance abuse counselor for Northern Virginia Counseling Group, testified that he first met with Moroffko in March 2003 following Dr. Jajoda\u2019s referral to him. Moroffko told Slifka she drank alcohol on a daily basis. Slifka recommended she be detoxified and undergo long-term residential treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Cynthia Gauss, an in-patient psychiatric physician at Fair-fax Hospital, first encountered Moroffko on July 13th or 14th, 2002, when she was admitted to the psychiatric unit from the medical unit. Moroffko entered the medical unit on July 10, 2002, after swallowing a large amount of prescription drugs, which she had received on July 9, 2002. Gauss was treating Moroffko for a depressive disorder, although she had related a history of bipolar disease. Moroffko left the psychiatric unit on July 15, 2002, against medical advice. Gauss believed Moroffko needed more extensive hospitalization in order to stabilize her moods and assure her safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Dr. Magnus Ikhinmwin is a physician at INOVA Fairfax Hospital who treated Moroffko in the emergency room for the multiple drug overdose on July 10, 2002, described earlier. \u201cIn addition to the diagnosis of multi drug overdose,\u201d Dr. Ikhinmwin made \u201ca secondary diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\u201d Moroffko also tested positive for opiates at that time. Dr. Ikhinmwin subsequently cared for Moroffko when she was brought to the hospital on September 28, 2002. On that date, Moroffko could not relate any information about her medical condition. Moroffko\u2019s lab tests revealed the presence of benzodiazepine, an opiate, cocaine, a blood alcohol level \u201cmore than two times normal,\u201d and a very low lithium level. Dr. Ikhinmwin noted that the laboratory results showed the drug levels at the time the blood sample was taken in the hospital, however, he could draw no conclusions from the reports regarding Moroffko\u2019s drug levels at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Dr. William Alexander Morton, Jr., Molina\u2019s fifth expert witness, is a psychopharmacologist, having earned a PhD in pharmacy and completed a residency in clinical pharmacy. He is not a medical doctor, however. Defense counsel asked Dr. Morton how an individual would behave or appear after consuming a bottle of wine and having present in their system an \u201cindefinite quantity of cocaine, the presence of opiates, the presence of benzodiazepines, as well as a lithium level of 0.2.\u201d Morton explained that the alcohol \u201cwould be additive to the drugs that were already in the system and it follows an unpredictable type of synergistic effect where one and one makes three or one and one makes four.\u201d Dr. Morton noted that Moroffko\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC) of 292 milligrams per deciliters was \u201csignificantly high.\u201d He stated Moroffko\u2019s BAC could have been as high as 300 or 350 one to three hours earlier. Dr. Morton also explained that people who consume alcohol on a regular basis can acquire a \u201cbehavioral tolerance where [one] learn[s] to walk and stand up longer than [he or she] would have initially\u201d and \u201cmay not look as intoxicated.\u201d According to Dr. Morton, such individuals can require greater quantities to achieve the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Describing \u201c[w]hat effect ... these factors have on memory,\u201d Dr. Morton responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">[A]lcohol has a significant [ejffect on memory and it correlates with levels, higher levels. You can have memory effects in the hundreds, but certainly they\u2019re of typically [sic] blackout in the 200s and 300-milligram percent level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">So one would not be able to recall events as they may have happened. If you add those with other substances, benzodiazepines such as Xanax, they\u2019re all in the same class. There is that additive phenomena where you actually \u2014 that combination can be quite deadly, so we try not to have that combination present because it can cause excessive response, like I was saying earlier, synergistic effect where one equals four.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">Valium, Ativan and Xanax in themselves cause problems with memory, cause a similar blackout problem,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and then the other sedative, hypnotic drug you mentioned, the opiate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>that causes some sedation. So that would have some effects with memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">Cocaine would not necessarily diminish memory, but the alcohol and the benzodiazepine and opiate would have a dramatic effect on it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Dr. Morton further explained that, because alcohol can significantly affect psychiatric disorders, \u201cwe would always caution against the mixing of the benzodiazepines, such as Ativan, Xanax, Valium, those type drugs, with alcohol. It should not be used,\u201d because \u201cit can be deadly, it can cause problems with control, impulse problems with driving.\u201d Morton concluded his testimony by observing that a 0.2 level of lithium is low.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The jury found Molina guilty of rape and forcible sodomy. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">ISSUE I: JURY INSTRUCTION 14</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">At trial, the Commonwealth proffered Jury Instruction 14.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The instruction reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">The court instructs the jury that the defendant is charged with the crime of rape. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">(1) That the defendant had sexual intercourse with Stephanie Moroffko who was not then the defendant\u2019s spouse; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>(2) That it was against her will and without consent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">(3) That it was by force, threat or intimidation; or by the use of her mental incapacity or physical helplessness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the above elements of the offense as charged, then you shall find the defendant guilty but you shall not fix punishment until your verdict has been returned and further evidence has been heard by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">If you find that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt either of the above offenses, then you shall find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">In addition, the trial court granted Instruction V, which defined \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d as a \u201ccondition which prevented [the victim] from understanding the nature or consequences of the sexual act involved,\u201d and Instruction W, which defined \u201cphysical helplessness\u201d as \u201cunconsciousness or any other condition existing at the time of the offense which otherwise rendered the complaining witness physically unable to communicate an unwillingness to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Relying on <em>Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 332, 457 S.E.2d 382 (1995), Molina argued that \u201cmental incapacity simply would not apply at this time.\u201d He contended that the legislative purpose underlying the offense based on mental incapacity \u201cis to protect persons who are mentally impaired or retarded from being sexual[ly] exploited due to their mental incapacity.\u201d The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">MR. KENSKY [Appellant\u2019s Attorney]: The <em>A[d]kins </em>case dealt with mental retardation and said that when we\u2019re looking at evidence of whether the victim in the case is able to appreciate the consequences of the sexual act and they said although she has mental retardation, she understands pregnancy, she had some sex ed in school, she used the words penis and vagina properly to describe intercourse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">So it deals with her capacity to appreciate the sex act as it applies to her mental retardation. So under <em>A[d]kins v. Commonwealth, </em>mental incapacitation isn\u2019t just anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>that may have \u2014 from her memory of consenting. It\u2019s limited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">THE COURT: It\u2019s not limited. Supposing a victim were so intoxicated as to not be able to say yes or no and totally incapacitated due to voluntary intoxication and a criminal defendant took advantage of it and raped that individual, wouldn\u2019t that come under this? Wouldn\u2019t that be mental incapacity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">It doesn\u2019t say mental incapacity of a particular nature, does it? You intend to argue that this individual has some mental difficulties, do you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">MR. KENSKY: Yes. We\u2019ll be arguing that, Judge, but certainly under the way you presented it, if someone is so inebriated that they\u2019re not able to consent, you could say the exact same thing. Physical helplessness also means that and you\u2019re rendering physical helplessness to be a synonym to mental incapacitation. They mean two different things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">THE COURT: The criteria, is there some scintilla of evidence which would indicate mental incapacity and there is in this case and you intend to argue it. I grant 14. I\u2019ll note your exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">During deliberations, the jury submitted written questions to the trial judge. In Question 4, the jury asked whether \u201cthe defendant and the victim could be in the same mentally incapacitated state at the time of the incident.\u201d In response, the trial court read the voluntary intoxication instruction to the jury, apparently construing the question as one prompted by evidence in the case that Molina appeared intoxicated at the scene and that he was arrested on a drunk in public charge. In that instruction, the jury was told that \u201cvoluntary intoxication is not a defense to either the crime of rape or sodomy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">In Question 8, the jury noted that Instruction U defined consent, but that no instruction defined \u201cagainst her will.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury to \u201cgive the words in the instructions their plain meaning.\u201d In Question 9, the jury asked for clarification of Instruction R, which defined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>elements of sodomy. Specifically, the jury asked if the element \u201cagainst her will\u201d meant \u201cthat the victim was or could be in a mental state that could prevent her from rendering a rational decision as to her will.\u201d It also asked if the act of exercising one\u2019s will involves or implies \u201ca process of decision making.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The trial judge instructed the jury, \u201cYou have in your possession all instructions of the court. You should use all of these instructions as they apply to the evidence in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">On October 24, 2003, Molina\u2019s attorney moved for a mistrial, contending that the questions the jury propounded evidenced jury confusion. Specifically, defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">[Bjecause their question necessarily assumes that you can be mentally incapacitated through intoxication. That\u2019s simply not what the law allows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">So my fear is the jury\u2019s going to decide this case applying mental incapacity. I know they have the definition of mental incapacity but I think that just underscores my earlier argument that mental incapacity is not appropriate to instruct the jury in Instruction 14, the Commonwealth\u2019s \u2014 in arguing in the alternative, force, threat or intimidation or by mental incapacity or by physical helplessness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">Now we have clear evidence from the jury that they\u2019re confusing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The trial judge found the motion untimely and refused to \u201crevisit those issues which I have already addressed dining the process of deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">A. GRANTING INSTRUCTION 14 AS WRITTEN DID NOT CONSTITUTE REVERSIBLE ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">Molina contends the trial court erred in granting Jury Instruction 14 because it combines two alternative bases upon which the Commonwealth sought to convict Molina on the rape charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In rejecting Molina\u2019s claim of reversible error on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>this ground, we begin with a review of the statute defining the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A) defines the following alternative elements of proof upon which the conviction for rape can rest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">If any person has sexual intercourse with a complaining witness who is not his or her spouse or causes a complaining witness, whether or not his or her spouse, to engage in sexual intercourse with any other person and such act is accomplished (i) against the complaining witness\u2019s will by force, threat or intimidation of or against the complaining witness or another person, or (ii) through the use of the complaining witness\u2019s mental incapacity or physical helplessness, ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Two separate Virginia Model Jury Instructions define the alternative elements of proof set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(i) and 18.2-61(A)(ii). Virginia Model Jury Instruction G44.100 tracks the language in Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(i) and requires the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant had sexual intercourse with the victim, \u201c[t]hat it was against her will and without her consent\u201d and \u201c[t]hat it was by force, threat or intimidation.\u201d 2 <em>Virginia Model Jury Instructions, </em>Criminal G44.100.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Virginia Model Jury Instruction G44.300 defines the elements required to prove rape under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii). It requires the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant had sexual intercourse with the complaining witness and further prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>(2) That at the time [the complaining witness] was (mentally incapacitated; physically helpless); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">(3) That at the time of the offense the defendant knew or should have known [the complainant] was (mentally incapacitated; physically helpless); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">(4) That the sexual intercourse was accomplished through the use of the complaining witness\u2019s (mental incapacity; physical helplessness).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">2 <em>Virginia Model Jury Instructions, </em>Criminal G44.300. To establish rape under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii), the Commonwealth need not prove force, threat or intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Molina contends that the instruction erroneously combines the two alternative theories of conviction and that it confused and misled the jury about the elements to be proved. Molina specifically asserts that Instruction 14, with its \u201cblending\u201d of two theories of conviction \u201clightens the Commonwealth\u2019s burden because it allowed the Commonwealth to prove that the act was non-consensual (\u2018against her will\u2019) without proving force, threat or intimidation____\u201d He further argues that the instruction permitted the jury to \u201cinfer, wrongly, that one who has a \u2018mental incapacity\u2019 may not be able to manifest consent, that the accused is not entitled to rely on her manifestation of consent,\u201d or that the instruction permitted the jury to convict him \u201cwithout proving that the complaining witness did not understand the nature and consequences of the sexual act.\u201d Finally, he contends that the instruction based on the victim\u2019s mental impairment was not supported by the evidence. We disagree with these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">\u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (quoting <em>Swisher v. Swisher, </em>223 Va. 499, 503, 290 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1982)). Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A) lists alternative theories by which the Commonwealth may prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>rape. Each theory rests on different elements of required proof. We assume without deciding that combining the elements set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(i) and 18.2-61(A)(ii) into one instruction constitutes trial court error and turn to the question whether such error was harmless.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">The standard for non-constitutional error is established in Virginia\u2019s harmless error statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-678, which provides, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">\u201cWhen it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached, no judgment shall be arrested or reversed ...

United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), to non-constitutional error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">\u201cIf, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand____But if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected----If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-14\"><em>Clay, </em>262 Va. at 260, 546 S.E.2d at 731-32 (quoting <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 764-65, 66 S.Ct. at 1248).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">Applying the standard of review articulated in <em>Clay, </em>we find the error to be harmless. Although the instruction combined two theories of conviction, the theories are stated in the disjunctive. Under that disjunctive formulation, the instruction directs the jury to consider either the \u201cforce\u201d theory set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(i) or the \u201cincapacity\u201d theory set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>forth in Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 61(A)(ii) as a basis for conviction, but not both at once. Although certain elements were common to both theories, <em>(viz., </em>that Molina had sexual intercourse with the victim who was not then his spouse and that the sexual intercourse was against her will and without consent), in order to proceed to conviction under one or the other theory of conviction, the jury had to make distinctive evidentiary findings and apply distinctive legal principles as instructed. Stated differently, depending on the facts the jury found proved by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the instruction directed the jury to <em>either </em>apply the law regarding \u201cforce, threat or intimidation,\u201d <em>or </em>the law regarding the \u201cuse of mental incapacity or physical helplessness.\u201d Thus, Molina\u2019s argument that the instruction allowed the jury to convict him of rape pursuant to Cod\u00e9 \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(i) without proving \u201cforce, threat or intimidation\u201d is belied by the language of the instruction itself which the jury is presumed to follow. <em>Green v. Young, </em>264 Va. 604, 611, 571 S.E.2d 135, 139 (2002) (citing <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 540, 113 S.Ct. 933, 938-39, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Molina\u2019s contention that the instruction was improper and erroneously misled the jury with respect to the elements of the crime under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii) is likewise without merit. Molina contends that the instruction improperly required the jury to find that the sexual intercourse in which he engaged with Moroffko was against her will and without consent in addition to finding that she was mentally or physically incapacitated. To be sure, the model instruction based on this theory of conviction does not require an express finding that the sexual intercourse was against the will and without the consent of the victim. However, we conclude that Molina was not prejudiced by the inclusion of this additional element of proof. First, we note that the crime of rape is, at core, an offense against the will and consent of the victim, irrespective of the manner and means by which the rape is accomplished. <em>See Mings v. Commonwealth, </em>85 Va. 638, 640, 8 S.E. 474, 475 (1889) (the essence of the crime of rape \u201cconsists in the ravishment of a [victim] without her consent;\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>therefore, the issue is whether the victim was willing or not); <em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>82 Va. 107, 111 (1886) (whenever there is a carnal connection without consent, the wrongful act itself supplies the requisite force that the law demands as an element of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Second, we note that the inability to freely exercise will and give consent is not solely a function of force, threat or intimidation by the perpetrator. When the offense involves a victim who is mentally incapacitated or physically helpless, the inability to consent or willingly engage in the sexual act is inherent in the very condition from which the victim suffers, as the definitions make manifest. Mental incapacity is a \u201ccondition\u201d that \u201cprevents the [victim] from understanding the nature or consequences of the sexual act involved.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3). Consent without understanding is no consent at all. Similarly, physical helplessness rests on definitional elements, which in themselves signify the absence of consent or an unwillingness to engage in the sexual act. Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(4). Physical helplessness is defined as \u201cunconsciousness or any other condition\u201d which physically prevents the victim from communicating unwillingness to act. <em>Id. </em>If the victim is unconscious or physically unable to communicate an unwillingness to act, consent surely cannot be established. In short, Molina\u2019s argument misapprehends the implicit relationship between mental or physical incapacitation and consent in the context of a rape charge. In such cases, proof of mental or physical incapacitation, in itself and without more, establishes the absence of consent or willing participation in the context of a rape charge. As such, when seeking a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii), the Commonwealth need not independently prove either the absence of consent or an unwillingness to engage in the sexual act. Nor need there be an express finding by the trier of fact that the sexual act was against the will and without the consent of the victim when the charge is brought under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii). But, to the extent the Commonwealth was required by the instruction in this case to expressly prove those elements and the jury was required to expressly make such a finding, it does not follow that revers<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ible error occurred as Molina contends. The instruction did nothing more than impose on the Commonwealth a heavier burden of proof in order to convict under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii). If that be error at all, it favored Molina and was harmless. <em>Pettus v. Commonwealth, </em>128 Va. 806, 808, 96 S.E. 161, 162 (1918) (instruction erroneously defined crime of storing ardent spirits as storing spirits in any other place than in defendant\u2019s bona fide home, although storage in the home was also unlawful; finding error harmless where \u201cerror is favorable to the defendant and not against his interest\u201d); <em>see also State v. Duett, </em>175 W.Va. 233, 332 S.E.2d 246, 255 (1985) (holding that erroneous instruction was harmless where it \u201ceffectively greatened and not lessened\u201d the government\u2019s burden of proof).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In summary, we find the trial court\u2019s presumed error in combining what should have been given as separate instructions to be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">B. GRANTING INSTRUCTION 14 AS TO MENTAL INCAPACITY WAS SUPPORTED BY MORE THAN A SCINTILLA OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Finally, Molina claims that Instruction 14 was improperly given on the ground that \u201cno evidence whatsoever [establishes] that Moroffko suffered from a mental impairment such that she was unable to understand the nature and consequences of sexual intercourse.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Adkins, </em>he rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>sons that the evidence only established impaired judgment due to \u201cmood swing and/or drugs and alcohol,\u201d and he further argues such impairment does not constitute \u201cmental incapacity\u201d under Virginia law. Molina\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">As noted <em>supra, </em>\u201cmental incapacity\u201d is defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3) as \u201cthat condition of the complaining witness existing at the time of an offense under this article which prevents the complaining witness from understanding the nature and consequences of the sexual act involved in such offense and about which the accused knew or should have known.\u201d The victim must also be \u201c[injcapable of making a volitional choice to engage or not engage in such conduct.\u201d <em>Adkins, </em>20 Va.App. at 345, 457 S.E.2d at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The evidence shows that, on the day in question, Molina approached Moroffko while she sat on a brick wall drinking wine, and engaged her in conversation. Moroffko recalled that they kissed and that she was then hit on the head with something hard causing her to lose consciousness. She next remembered awakening in the hospital, suffering facial lacerations, broken bones in her face, and a head injury. Koltz found Moroffko behind a bush, nude from the waist down, lying on the ground, unconscious. Koltz tried to revive Moroffko, but she was not responsive. Moroffko was not revived until after she was admitted to a hospital. At trial, Moroffko denied consenting to any sexual activity. Tests disclosed that Moroffko had over twice the normal amount of alcohol in her system and that the level was even higher at the time Molina had intercourse with her. She also tested positive for the presence of cocaine and benzodiazepines. The prescribed medications Moroffko had taken, in combination with her alcohol intake, were described as \u201cdeadly\u201d by Molina\u2019s expert. The evidence is in sharp contrast to Molina\u2019s statement that Moroffko was able to consent to sexual intercourse a short time before the police arrived and provides a sufficient basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>from which the jury could conclude that Moroffko had either lost consciousness or was too disoriented to give valid consent before Molina had sexual intercourse with her and remained in that incapacitated state until she awoke in the hospital. The evidence is clearly sufficient to support an instruction on mental incapacity at the time of the alleged rape. <em>See State v. Al-Hamdani, </em>109 Wash.App. 599, 36 P.3d 1103, 1107 (2001) (\u201cIt is important to distinguish between a person\u2019s general ability to understand the nature and consequences of sexual intercourse and that person\u2019s ability to understand the nature and consequences <em>at a given time and in a given situation.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)), <em>review denied </em>148 Wash.2d 1004, 60 P.3d 1211 (2003); <em>see also State v. McDowell, </em>427 So.2d 1346, 1350 (La.Ct.App.1983) (in rape cases, the fundamental question is whether or not the mental condition of the victim is so impaired that legal consent cannot be exercised or given).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Molina\u2019s argument that the mental incapacity contemplated by the statute is confined to permanent mental conditions such as retardation ignores the fundamental, operative principle in rape convictions and is unpersuasive. The touchstone of the legal concept is whether the victim has \u201cthe capacity to make a volitional choice to engage or not engage in [a sexual] act.\u201d <em>Adkins, </em>20 Va.App. at 346, 457 S.E.2d at 389. The cause underlying the victim\u2019s impaired capacity to give consent is not determinative. <em>See State v. Farnum, </em>554 N.W.2d 716, 721 (Iowa Ct.App.1996) (recognizing that although incapacity \u201cis generally applied in cases of retarded or low-functioning victims,\u201d it may be applied to a seriously intoxicated victim); <em>AlHamdani, </em>36 P.3d at 1107.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Molina\u2019s reliance on <em>Adkins </em>to support his position is misplaced. <em>Adkins </em>does not limit the protections afforded under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii) to individuals afflicted with mental retardation. Rather, <em>Adkins </em>identifies two classes of individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>who come within the protection of the statute. \u201cThe legislative purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii) is to protect persons who are mentally impaired <em>or </em>retarded from being sexually exploited due to their mental incapacity.\u201d <em>Adkins, </em>20 Va.App. at 342-43, 457 S.E.2d at 387 (emphasis added). Furthermore, the term \u201cmentally impaired\u201d is broadly general in nature; no cause of the impairment is identified or allied to the term in <em>Adkins. </em>That one is \u201cimpaired,\u201d that is one is suffering from a \u201ccondition ... at the time of an offense ... which [precludes an] understanding [of] the nature and consequences of the sexual act involved,\u201d is the crux of the Court\u2019s choice of words, not the reason for the impairment. By contrast, impairment by mental retardation is separately identified, distinguishing its more narrow import from the broad import of the term \u201cmentally impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">On these grounds, we find that \u201cmental incapacity\u201d includes conditions other than those in which a victim is unable to understand the sex act due to mental retardation and that the phrase \u201cmentally impaired,\u201d as used in <em>Adkins, </em>includes mental incapacity induced by voluntary intoxication. We, therefore, cannot say the trial court erred in rejecting the limitation on the statute\u2019s reach urged by Molina and in finding the Commonwealth\u2019s instruction was supported by more than a scintilla of evidence of mental incapacity based on the victim\u2019s intoxication. <em>See Commonwealth v. Sands, </em>262 Va. 724, 729, 553 S.E.2d 733, 736 (2001) (an instruction is proper when it is supported by more than a scintilla of evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">ISSUE II: LIMITING DR. MORTON\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"Aqa\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Molina asserts the trial court erred in limiting the testimony from his final witness, Dr. Morton. Dr. Morton is a psycho-pharmacologist, not a medical doctor. During his direct examination, Molina\u2019s attorney attempted to have him testify about the symptoms of bipolar disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>[Dr. Morton would be] combining information and basing his opinion on information that we\u2019ve gotten into evidence and he\u2019s going to give the jury his opinion about how Ms. Moroffko would appear to someone \u2014 would appear lucid, impulsive, gregarious and at the same time not remember anything [on the day in question].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Defense counsel further proffered a power point presentation prepared by Dr. Morton defining Bipolar Disorder, listing Bipolar and Psychotic Symptoms, Manic Symptoms, Hypo-manic Episode Signs and Symptoms, Psychotic Symptoms, Presentation and Perception of Manic Episode Symptoms, Manic Episodes, Bipolar Responses and Treatment of Bipolar Disorder. According to Molina\u2019s attorney, Dr. Morton would use the power point presentation to discuss \u201cwhy, based on her bipolar disorder [and] medications and various other factors, why her memory would be impaired and that explains to the jury why she\u2019s on the one hand saying I was knocked unconscious, but also at the same time has these vague memories, these inconsistent statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The trial court concluded that the evidence was cumulative, and furthermore questioned whether Dr. Morton was qualified to testify about bipolar disorder, in general, and manic episodes, specifically, since he was not a medical doctor or Moroffko\u2019s treating physician. The trial court required defense counsel to lay a proper evidentiary foundation for such testimony and pointed out that defense counsel had \u201chad four witnesses ... capable of testifying to that [issue] and ... [he] chose not to elicit [the] testimony.\u201d The trial court also noted that, although Dr. Morton had training in bipolar disorder, he did not make diagnoses but rather he \u201cwork[ed] with doctors that make diagnoses.\u201d Finding that Dr. Morton qualified only as an expert in psychopharmacology, the trial court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq9\">He may not testify that she has bipolar disorder. He may not testify as to any medical disorder of the brain, which is what is supposed to be medical disorder of the brain. He may not testify to that. If he is properly qualified, he may testify as a pharmacologist. If you want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>to ask him questions of what the effect of these medications might be, you may ask it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">You may not present this manic episode power point presentation because I think it\u2019s clearly outside his expertise. If you want to qualify him you\u2019re welcome to do that, but I\u2019m not going to allow you to ask him all kinds of medical questions when he\u2019s not a medical doctor, he\u2019s not a psychiatrist and you\u2019ve done that four times with four witnesses and it\u2019s cumulative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Subsequently, defense counsel made further attempts to have Dr. Morton qualified as an expert who could address the symptoms and treatment of bipolar disorder. He explained that such testimony was necessary and relevant \u201c[b]ecause the doctors that we put on can\u2019t say how Stephanie Moroffko is [at] times they were not able to see her.\u201d Defense counsel argued that Dr. Morton \u201ccan testify about the general characteristics of a bipolar person.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">THE COURT: My understanding is that it\u2019s your intention to ask this witness what do other bipolar people act like and therefore this witness must have acted that way; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ2\">MR. KENSKY: What are the general characteristics \u2014 I want to educate the jury on what are the general characteristics of bipolar and I also want to use Dr. Morton to \u2014 and to ask him about based on if a person has consumed a lot of alcohol, who has cocaine, opiates, other drugs in her blood, based on someone who was taking prescription drugs, how would she appear to another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">THE COURT: That, I think you may ask because there\u2019s a factual foundation. You may not ask the other question of what his medical opinion is about bipolar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The trial court ruled that Dr. Morton\u2019s medical opinion about bipolar disorder \u201cis ... outside [his area of] expertise ... and it\u2019s too cumulative.\u201d We find the trial court did not err in limiting Dr. Morton\u2019s testimony on the following grounds: his testimony was 1) beyond the scope of his expertise; 2) cumulative; and 3) speculative. Furthermore Molina failed to proffer Dr. Morton\u2019s expected testimony on bipolar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>disorder generally, or on the disorder as it specifically related to Moroffko at the time of the alleged rape. Finally, contrary to Molina\u2019s contention, Dr. Morton was permitted to address how the prescribed drugs and alcohol Moroffko had ingested affected her memory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201c[W]hether a witness is qualified to render an expert opinion is a question submitted to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Combs v.

Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 95, 557 S.E.2d 213 (2002), for the proposition that an expert need not be a medical doctor to testify about a medical condition. In <em>Velazquez, </em>the defendant objected to a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) testifying \u201cas an expert in the field of sexual assault diagnosis because such diagnosis constitutes the practice of medicine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>and [the SANE] is not a licensed physician.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 557 S.E.2d at 217. The Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVY\">a SANE nurse need not be licensed to practice medicine to express an expert opinion on the causation of injuries in the context of an alleged sexual assault, nor does the expression of such an opinion by a SANE in a trial constitute the unlawful practice of medicine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 104, 557 S.E.2d at 218 (noting that whether a witness is qualified as expert will not be disturbed \u201cunless it plainly appears that the witness was not qualified\u201d). In <em>Velazquez, </em>the Court reasoned that, although the SANE was not a medical doctor, she was qualified under the facts presented to render an expert opinion concerning the \u201ccausation of injuries in the context of an alleged sexual assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(record showed the SANE had been a nurse for twenty-six years, she underwent special training on sexual assaults and had examined about 500 sexual assault victims).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The Supreme Court later clarified that its</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9F\">holding in <em>Velazquez </em>is limited to the unique context of a SANE\u2019s expert opinion concerning the causation of injuries in a sexual assault case, [and] that holding does not change the general rule stated above that only a medical doctor may give an expert opinion about the cause of a physical human injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\"><em>John, </em>263 Va. at 321 n. 2, 559 S.E.2d at 697 n. 2 (citing <em>Combs, </em>256 Va. at 496, 507 S.E.2d at 358).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">To the extent Molina sought to elicit Dr. Morton\u2019s testimony that Moroffko\u2019s conduct at the time of the incident was consistent with or caused by bipolar disease or any of its phases, particularly, the manic or hypomanic phase, we find such testimony was properly excluded on the ground that it sought to elicit from Dr. Morton a diagnosis of Moroffko\u2019s medical condition at the time of the incident. Such testimony was beyond the scope of Dr. Morton\u2019s expertise. Dr. Morton was qualified as an expert in psychopharmacology. As such, he was competent to render an opinion on the effects of drugs in general and the effects of certain drugs on someone diag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>nosed as having bipolar disorder. In fact, the record shows that Dr. Morton was allowed to testify about the effects of the drugs Moroffko was found to have ingested. Indeed, contrary to Molina\u2019s assertions, he was specifically permitted to testify about the effects of certain drugs on Moroffko\u2019s ability to remember the events of that evening, particularly in light of the high level of alcohol found in her blood.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, Dr. Morton was not a medical doctor and did not observe or treat Moroffko. Therefore, he was not qualified to testify that Moroffko suffered from bipolar disease or that she exhibited behavior consistent with mania or hypomania at the time of the incident. Such testimony is in the nature of a medical diagnosis that Dr. Morton was not qualified to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Molina also asserts that, based on his experience, Dr. Morton was qualified to give testimony generally describing bipolar disease and its various phases. The purpose of such testimony was, in part, to establish that Moroffko\u2019s conduct during the incident in question was consistent with the disorder. We find that the testimony Molina sought to elicit was properly excluded. First, testimony about the general characteristics of bipolar disease and its manic or hypo-manic phases was cumulative.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, Molina failed to proffer the details of Dr. Morton\u2019s intended testimony about the general nature of bipolar disease or the characteristics of the disease in its manic or hypomanic phase and he failed to proffer on what basis Dr. Morton would apply the general characteristics of bipolar disease to Moroffko\u2019s conduct at the time of the incident in question. The failure to proffer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>expected testimony is fatal to his claim on appeal. \u201cWithout such a proffer, [the appellate court] cannot determine the admissibility of the proposed testimony, and, if admissible, whether the court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence prejudiced [the party].\u201d <em>Holles v. Sunrise Terrace, </em>257 Va. 131, 135, 509 S.E.2d 494, 497 (1999); <em>see also Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 229, 236, 572 S.E.2d 481, 484 (2002) (citations omitted). Third, Molina\u2019s intended use of Dr. Morton\u2019s testimony about the general characteristics of bipolar disease was improper. As he explained to the trial court, Molina sought such testimony from Dr. Morton \u201c[b]eeause the doctors that we put on [earlier] can\u2019t say how Stephanie Moroffko is [at] times they were not able to see her.\u201d In other words, Molina sought to use Dr. Morton\u2019s general description of bipolar disease to establish that Moroffko\u2019s conduct at the time of the incident was consistent with the disease and with its manic or hypo-manic phase, in particular. As such, it called for speculation and surmise on the part of the trier of fact and was improper. Finally, Molina failed to proffer what evidence regarding the nature and character of Moroffko\u2019s behavior during the incident that was to be explained by Dr. Morton\u2019s testimony about bipolar disorder and its manic phases.

When emergency personnel arrived, Moroffko was unconscious and nonresponsive and Moroffko did not regain consciousness until she was in the hospital. Molina\u2019s DNA was found in Moroffko\u2019s vaginal cavity, and she denied consenting to have sexual intercourse. The jury, as fact finder, believed Moroffko and rejected appellant\u2019s self-serving statement to Detective Kelly that he and Moroffko had con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>sensual intercourse. \u201cThe weight which should be given to evidence and whether the testimony of a witness is credible are questions which the fact finder must decide.\u201d <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601-02 (1986). The jury had competent, credible evidence with which to find appellant guilty of rape. Under these facts, we cannot say the jury\u2019s verdict is plainly wrong or lacked evidentiary support. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not err in refusing to strike the evidence relating to the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\n<em>Forcible Sodomy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Molina argues that, because Moroffko \u201cdoes not know what happened to her,\u201d the forcible sodomy verdict rested entirely on speculation. Moroffko testified that \u201csomething\u201d or \u201csomeone\u201d hit her while she was talking with Molina, causing her to lose consciousness. Test results disclosed that Molina\u2019s DNA was found inside Moroffko\u2019s anal/rectal cavity, and Moroffko denied consenting to having any sexual relations. DNA evidence excluded Membrano, the only other person on the scene, as a contributor. Molina\u2019s claim that his seminal fluid was transferred to Moroffko\u2019s anal/rectal cavity by Membrano was ostensibly rejected by the trier of fact who is charged with crediting and weighing the evidence. <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 577, 582, 484 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1997) (noting that jury\u2019s function is to weigh the evidence and resolve all factual issues). Finally, the jury believed Moroffko and rejected the self-serving denials and explanations that Molina gave to Detective Kelly. <em>See id. </em>(jury also charged with judging witness credibility). We find that sufficient evidence in the record supports the jury\u2019s verdict, and we cannot say the trial court erred in refusing to strike the evidence on forcible sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">.

I also believe that the convictions were improperly rendered because the trial judge erred by limiting the testimony of an expert witness on an issue of critical significance to Molina\u2019s defense and by improperly instructing the jury on three disjunctive theories of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">At trial, the Commonwealth contended that Molina rendered the complaining witness unconscious by hitting her with some object, abducted her, and raped her. A jury instruction allowed the jury to convict Molina of rape under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A) if he had sexual intercourse with the complaining witness \u201cagainst her will and without her consent; and ... by force, threat or intimidation; or by the use of her mental incapacity or physical helplessness.\u201d At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge found the evidence was insufficient to prove malicious wounding and abduction, and he struck those charges. I would hold that the evidence was also insufficient to support a conviction for rape. Even if we disregard Molina\u2019s statement that the two had consensual sexual intercourse, what occurred after Molina and the complaining witness kissed, hugged, talked about sexual things, and went behind the store was mere conjecture and speculation based on inconclusive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Our review of the sufficiency of the evidence in this case is guided by a well-settled principle.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">\u201c[I]f the proof relied upon by the Commonwealth is wholly circumstantial, as it here is, then to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt all necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence. They must overcome the presumption of innocence and exclude all reasonable conclusions inconsistent with that of guilt. To accomplish that, the chain of necessary circumstances must be unbroken and the evidence as a whole must satisfy the guarded judgment that both the corpus delicti and the criminal agency of the accused have been proved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the exclusion of any other rational hypothesis and to a moral certainty....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">But, circumstances of suspicion, no matter how grave or strong, are not proof of guilt sufficient to support a verdict of guilty. The actual commission of the crime by the accused must be shown by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain his conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><em>Clodfelter v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 619, 623, 238 S.E.2d 820, 822 (1977) (quoting <em>LaPrade v. Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 410, 418, 61 S.E.2d 313, 316 (1950)). This is so because, as a matter of constitutional law, the Due Process Clause protects an accused from conviction \u201cexcept upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). In other words, the evidence must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence and, therefore, it is insufficient to support a conviction when it creates merely a suspicion or probability of guilt. <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 218, 441 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1994); <em>Burrows v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 317, 320, 295 S.E.2d 893, 895 (1982); <em>Hyde v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 950, 954-55, 234 S.E.2d 74, 77-78 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The Commonwealth failed to prove an unbroken \u201cchain of necessary circumstances\u201d to establish Molina\u2019s guilt to the exclusion of other hypotheses. According to the prosecutor\u2019s theory, Molina hit the complaining witness on the head with some object, rendering her unconscious, then moved her behind a convenience store, raped her, and forcibly sodomized her. Yet, the complaining witness never testified that Molina did any of those things. The record contains ample evidence, including the complaining witness\u2019 admissions, that she did not recall all the events that occurred after she met Molina. She has a bipolar disorder and could only recall that at some point she was unconscious from a seizure. She had a history of mixing prescription drugs, illegal drugs, and alcohol, and a history of similar seizures. Simply put, the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the Commonwealth\u2019s theories of forcible rape and sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Significantly, the complaining witness gave conflicting testimony that was vague, malleable, and not specific as to the events that transpired. The complaining witness testified that she sat on a wall beside a convenience store at ten o\u2019clock in the morning and drank the entire bottle of wine she had just purchased. A \u201cbrick column [was] right behind\u201d her perch on the wall. After drinking the wine, the complaining witness drank milk and talked with Molina about her life. During this conversation, she and Molina engaged in mutual hugging and kissing. The following events are the extent of her direct testimony regarding what happened as she sat on the wall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">A: A gentleman approached me____He sat down next to me and started talking to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">Q: Did you know who that person was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">Q: Did you speak with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">Q: What happened after you spoke with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">A: We spoke for awhile. The next thing I remember is my head being hit by something hard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-13\">Q: Where were you when your head was hit by something hard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-14\">A: Sitting on the bricks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-15\">Q: Do you know who hit you in the head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-16\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">On cross-examination, the complaining witness disclosed she was speculating about what actually occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-18\">Q: ... You\u2019re telling us that you don\u2019t know how it was that you lost consciousness. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-20\">A: I was hit with something\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-21\">Q: But you never saw\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-22\">A: \u2014or hit against something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-23\">Q: You never saw anything hit you. Is that fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMj\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Q: And you never saw any person with anything that hit you. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">She testified that she did not remember anything from that point until she awoke in the hospital. She also told the jury she does not know where she was when she lost consciousness. She acknowledged, however, that in the hospital shortly after the incident she gave another version.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">Q: But you told the detectives at least once during one of your tape recorded statements that you remember banging your hand or your head while one person was there and then that person left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">Then another person came, and it was after that person came that you lost consciousness. Remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">A: That\u2019s how it happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The complaining witness and her physician testified she has a bipolar disorder with both depressive and manic episodes. The complaining witness also admitted she was prone to seizures after using drugs and alcohol. These seizures resulted in periods when she would blackout, that is, when she had no memory of events. During a period in July (two months before the incident), the complaining witness was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for overdosing on Xanax, Oxycodone, Doxepine, Thorazine, and alcohol. Abundant evidence proved she had been misusing her prescription medications in the months prior to the morning she met Molina.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">The complaining witness\u2019 treating physician testified that she had a history of hypomania \u2014 \u201ca state when there is decreased need for sleep and increased energy and physical energy.\u201d She also testified that the complaining witness reported times when she had not slept over a period of several days. Although the complaining witness testified at trial that she was at home the night before the incident, she admitted to the officers who questioned her at the hospital that she had been in Washington, D.C., all night before the morning she went to the convenience store. That night, the complaining witness had ingested undisclosed quantities of \u201cXanax, Zana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>flex, ... Lithium, Zoloft, Zethacoat(ph), and Nexium.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She made these admissions only after the officers learned from her father that she had not returned home at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The evidence proved that in addition to those drugs she drank alcohol the day of this incident and suffered a seizure. Although her doctors had instructed her not to combine her prescription medications with alcohol, she testified that the morning after ingesting the drugs she purchased a bottle of wine at the store and drank all of it. Indeed, at different points in her testimony, she admits that she drank beer, a bottle of wine and/or a wine cooler. A blood test at the hospital revealed that the alcohol content in her blood was 292 mg/dL when measured. A textual footnote on the blood test report indicates a depression of the central nervous system when a reading is \u201cgreater than 100 mg/dL\u201d and \u201cfatalities reported: greater than 400 mg/dL.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The complaining witness could not recall which drugs she took that morning before consuming the alcohol. She testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">The day of September 28th, I hadn\u2019t taken anything. I don\u2019t know if I had taken my regular medication or not, but if I had it was what was prescribed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">And I drank just the wine that I said I drank and had a seizure, so it was not just because of my pills or the alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A70\">The blood tests showed, however, that she tested positive for benzodiazepines, an opiate, and cocaine and that she had a much lower level of lithium in her body than normally prescribed for her diagnosis of bipolar disorder. In addition, the para-medical technician who examined her at the convenience store reported foam around her mouth, which was evidence of a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The complaining witness claimed to have suffered facial lacerations, broken bones in her face, and \u201csome type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>injury\u201d to her head that bled profusely. However, the paramedical technician, who testified that she is trained to accurately record any injuries and that she attended the complaining witness for a substantial length of time, told the jury she did not notice any injury other than some puffiness in the complaining witness\u2019 face. The complaining witness also testified she told the police she may have sustained those injuries before going to the store that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses contradicted the complaining witness\u2019 testimony in other significant aspects. A police officer who interviewed the complaining witness after she was examined in the hospital testified that the complaining witness was conscious and responsive and that she gave a different version of the events in the hospital. She told the officer that while she was sitting on the wall, she and the man talked \u201cabout sexual things.\u201d She also said she walked away from the wall and struck her face on a tree. In addition, she told the officer she was conscious when she was having sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The officer who interviewed the complaining witness also interviewed Molina. Molina said the complaining witness talked to him about her family and her life before saying she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him. They went to the rear of the store where \u201cshe laid down\u201d and pulled him down upon her. He denied having anal intercourse with her. According to Molina, when they finished having sexual intercourse she said she wanted to stay there and sleep. He also said he left her, later returned, and then saw another man atop her.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">A repetition of the complaining witness\u2019 testimony graphically demonstrates that she told the detectives at the hospital a version of events that was consistent with Molina\u2019s statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">Q: But you told the detectives at least once during one of your tape recorded statements that you remember banging your hand or your head while one person was there and then that person left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Then another person came, and it was after that person came that you lost consciousness. Remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">A: That\u2019s how it happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Indeed, when the police arrived behind the store, Molina was standing, fully clothed and another man was on the ground beside the complaining witness.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar1\">The evidence does not exclude the hypothesis that the complaining witness voluntarily went behind the store after hugging and kissing Molina and engaging in conversation about sexual activity. She consented to sexual intercourse with Molina, then had a seizure and lost consciousness after Molina left and before the other man arrived. Indeed, the trial judge found that the evidence was insufficient to prove Molina either wounded her or abducted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Simply put, the evidence, including the complaining witness\u2019 own testimony, established she did not accurately remember the events that led to her having sexual intercourse because of her drug and alcohol abuse and the effects of those substances on her bipolar disorder.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">Q: You\u2019ve just told us that you have a history of having seizures. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">A: It happens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">Q: You\u2019ve told us that you have a history of when you drink, you don\u2019t remember things sometimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">Q: And you told us that when you take pills you don\u2019t remember things some times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-15\">Q: You told us you have a history of taking too many drugs. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-16\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-17\">Q: Too much alcohol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-18\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-19\">Q: The detectives were asking you questions [the same day of the incident] and you were having trouble remember<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ing some of the things that supposedly happened that day. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">A: At the time they were asking me questions, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">Q: ... [W]ould it be fair to say that when you were speaking with the detectives there were various points where they would ask you questions about what happened and you would have a problem recalling what had happened, and you couldn\u2019t answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">Q: The same problem you\u2019ve had today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">Q: The same problem you had at the preliminary hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxI\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">At the close of the evidence, the Commonwealth argued to the jury that the complaining witness \u201cwas beaten that day, that she was beaten to the point where she was unconscious and that she was raped and sodomized.\u201d Yet, the Commonwealth failed to disprove the reasonable hypothesis, supported by the evidence, that the complaining witness consented to sexual intercourse with Molina and that, as a result of later \u201cblacking out\u201d from the effect of drugs and alcohol on her bipolar disorder, she had no accurate memory of the events. The complaining witness did not testify that Molina hit her on the head or otherwise used force, threat or intimidation when interacting with her; she specifically testified that Molina never made any threats toward her. Indeed, at trial she said she \u201cwas hit with something <em>... or hit against something,\u201d </em>but did not attribute this to Molina. The jury was left to speculate about what occurred because the Commonwealth presented no physical evidence showing forcible penetration and provided no coherent chain of events showing that Molina raped the complaining witness. The complaining witness kissed and hugged Molina and talked \u201cabout sexual things\u201d before having sexual intercourse with him. The evidence left the jury to speculate when, during the events behind the store, the complaining witness became unconscious. Though she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>testified at trial that she did not remember having sexual intercourse, she told the officers in the hospital the day of the event that she was conscious while having sexual intercourse. Thus, I would hold that no evidence proved Molina acted against her will and no evidence proved forcible penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">I believe the jury was misled by an instruction that the Commonwealth offered which provided in the disjunctive two additional theories under Code \u00a7 18.2-61 to convict of rape: that the rape was accomplished through the complaining witness\u2019 physical helplessness or that the rape was accomplished through the complaining witness\u2019 mental incapacity. No evidence proved the complaining witness suffered from physical helplessness or from mental incapacity when she engaged in sexual intercourse with Molina.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">With regard to proof of physical helplessness in a rape charge, we have made an important distinction between being physically unable to communicate at the time of the intercourse and physically unable to communicate afterward. <em>Howard v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 473, 465 S.E.2d 142 (1995). In <em>Howard, </em>the complaining witness lost consciousness shortly after having intercourse. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 465 S.E.2d at 143. We explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">The Commonwealth asserts that the trial court reasonably could have inferred physical helplessness from the fact the victim went to a neighbor\u2019s apartment shortly after the alleged incident, partially clothed, before vomiting and collapsing. The Commonwealth highlights the fact that the victim could not recognize her parents for a period of hours and passed in and out of consciousness after being taken to the hospital, where doctors determined she was intoxicated. However, assuming the victim was intoxicated to the point of being physically unable to communicate at the time she exited the apartment, this does not prove she was intoxicated to the same degree when she engaged in sexual intercourse with appellant. Even in conjunction with other evidence, the Commonwealth\u2019s case was not strong enough to prove appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In so holding, we find the following admonition appropriate: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u201c[t]he conduct of [appellant] cannot be condoned. It was disgraceful. It was enough to shame one steeped in moral infamy. But he was not tried for that. Rape was the charge laid at his door and the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence fail[ed] to sustain it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 480-81, 465 S.E.2d at 145-46 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In this case, the Commonwealth argued to the jury that the complaining witness \u201cwas beaten to the point where she was unconscious and [then] ... raped and ... sodomized.\u201d No evidence proved Molina beat her or assisted in beating her. Significantly, the trial judge found that the evidence failed to prove malicious wounding and struck that charge. In the absence of evidence, the jury had to speculate to conclude that the complaining witness was physically helpless when she was having intercourse. She admitted to the detectives that she was conscious while having sexual intercourse. By her own admission, when she mixed alcohol and her prescribed medication, she was prone to seizures and to blackouts that caused her to be unable to remember events. She testified that on the day at issue, she drank wine, took drugs whose names she could not recall, and had a seizure. The evidence failed to disprove that her use of drugs and alcohol caused her failure to remember and that her lapse into unconsciousness occurred after she had sexual intercourse with Molina.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The Commonwealth never argued at trial that the complaining witness was mentally incapacitated. \u201cMental incapacity\u201d is a statutory term that does not connote the ordinary meaning; it is defined as \u201cthat condition of the complaining witness existing at the time of an offense under this article which prevents the complaining witness from understanding the nature or consequences of the sexual act involved in such offense and about which the accused knew or should have known.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(8). As we explained, in <em>Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 332, 342-43, 457 S.E.2d 382, 387 (1995), the statute exists \u201cto protect persons who are mentally impaired or retarded from being sexually exploited due to their mental incapacity.\u201d A person is mentally incapacitated only when \u201che or she has a mental \u2018condition\u2019 that \u2018prevents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the person from being able to \u2018understand\u2019 either the \u2018nature\u2019 or \u2018consequences\u2019 of engaging in sexual intercourse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 457 S.E.2d at 387. Thus, we explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax_\">To \u201cknow, apprehend, or appreciate\u201d the \u201cnature and consequences\u201d of sexual intercourse can range from a simple understanding of how the act of coitus is physically accomplished together with an understanding that a sensation of pleasure may accompany the act, to a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the complex psychological and physiological \u201cnature\u201d of \u201cthe sexual act involved\u201d and that, aside from immediate gratification, the act may have dire familial, social, medical, physical, economic, or spiritual consequences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><em>Id. </em>In other words, to obtain a conviction under the statute, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove ... that the person does not understand \u2018the nature and consequences of the sexual act involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343, 457 S.E.2d at 387. <em>See also White v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 593, 597, 478 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument to the jury during opening and closing arguments is devoid of any suggestion that Molina accomplished the rape or sodomy through the use of the complaining witness\u2019 mental incapacity. Indeed, the Commonwealth never offered evidence to establish that the complaining witness was not able to understand the nature and consequences of sexual intercourse within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A). The Commonwealth\u2019s own witness testified that the complaining witness said she was kissing and hugging Molina and discussing \u201csexual things.\u201d Furthermore, no evidence proved Molina knew or should have known the complaining witness was not comprehending the nature of the sexual acts. Thus, the jury could not find beyond a reasonable doubt mental incapacity because no evidence in the record supported such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Simply, the complaining witness testified she was unable to recall what occurred. Beyond the presence of Molina\u2019s semen, which equally supported the hypothesis that the sex was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>consensual, there was no physical evidence of rape. If one disregards Molina\u2019s testimony that the two had consensual sex, what occurred when Molina and the complaining witness went behind the store could only be discerned by conjecture and speculation. Conviction on this circumstantial evidence that raises only suspicion and speculation is precisely what <em>Clodfelter </em>prohibits. 218 Va. at 623-24, 238 S.E.2d at 822. \u201c \u2018Suspicion ... no matter how strong is insufficient to sustain a criminal conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>259 Va. 780, 784, 529 S.E.2d 78, 79 (2000) (quoting <em>Stover v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 618, 624, 283 S.E.2d 194, 197 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">For these same reasons, I would reverse the conviction for sodomy. The indictment alleged that anal intercourse occurred and was committed \u201cby force, threat or intimidation.\u201d However, no evidence proved penetration of the anal cavity occurred. A nurse who interviewed and examined the complaining witness at the hospital found only minor abrasions in the genital rectal area that were not visible to the naked eye. The nurse\u2019s written report required her \u201cto check off a box under anal contact\u201d and listed the options \u201cyes, no, attempt, or unknown.\u201d The nurse checked \u201cno.\u201d Iri contrast, she checked \u201cyes\u201d for \u201cvaginal contact\u201d and notes \u201cpenis.\u201d This report is consistent with Molina\u2019s admission that they engaged in vaginal intercourse but not anal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The evidence merely established that a rectal anal swab revealed the presence of Molina\u2019s DNA; however, the evidence also established that semen can be transferred to various body parts during the act of sexual intercourse. The jury had to speculate that anal intercourse occurred between Molina and the complaining witness. A verdict \u201cbased only upon speculation and conjecture ... cannot be permitted to stand.\u201d <em>Dunn v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 704, 706, 284 S.E.2d 792, 793 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">I would hold that the trial judge\u2019s limitation on Dr. William Alexander Morton\u2019s testimony was reversible error. Molina\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>defense was that the complaining witness had consented to the sexual intercourse. He was prepared to offer the testimony of an expert concerning the behavioral effects of prescription drugs, illegal drugs, and alcohol on a person with a bipolar disorder. Molina\u2019s attorney proffered that Dr. Morton has a PhD in pharmacy, is a professor of pharmacy, and is an assistant professor of psychiatry in behavioral science. Dr. Morton would have explained how the complaining witness \u201ccould appear to be lucid, impulsive, and gregarious,\u201d yet be unable to remember her behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The trial judge limited Dr. Morton\u2019s testimony to the effects of alcohol and drugs without reference to bipolar disorder, ruling that Dr. Morton is not a \u201cmedical doctor\u201d and, thus, could not refer to the complaining witness\u2019 bipolar disorder. This was reversible error. The record proved that Dr. Morton is an expert in the field of \u201cpsychopharmacology, which is [the study of] how drugs affect the brain.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">The sole purpose of permitting expert testimony is to assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence presented or to determine a fact in issue. Generally, a witness is qualified to testify as an expert when the witness possesses sufficient knowledge, skill, or experience to make the witness competent to testify as an expert on the subject matter at issue. <em>Sami v. Varn, </em>260 Va. 280, 284, 535 S.E.2d 172, 174 (2000); <em>Noll v. Rahal, </em>219 Va. 795, 800, 250 S.E.2d 741, 744 (1979). \u201cAn expert\u2019s testimony is admissible not only when scientific knowledge is required, but when experience and observation ... give the expert knowledge of a subject beyond that of persons of common intelligence and ordinary experience. The scope of such evidence extends to any subject in respect of which one may derive special knowledge by experience, when [the witness\u2019s] knowledge of the matter in relation to which [the witness\u2019s] opinion is asked is such, or is so great, that it will probably aid the trier [of fact] in the search for the truth.\u201d <em>Neblett v. Hunter, </em>207 Va. 335, 339-40, 150 S.E.2d 115, 118 (1966); <em>cf. </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-401.3. In essence, all that is necessary for a witness to qualify as an expert is that the witness have sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>knowledge of the subject to give value to the witness\u2019s opinion. <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co. v. Anderson, </em>207 Va. 567, 571, 151 S.E.2d 628, 631 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><em>Velazquez v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 95, 103, 557 S.E.2d 213, 218 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The record proved that Dr. Morton\u2019s specialized field is psychopharmacology, and he studies the effects of prescription and illegal drugs, as well as alcohol, on thinking and behavior. He is not, as the trial judge seemed to insist, merely \u201ca pharmacist.\u201d He has extensive experience in treating, evaluating, and studying the effects of drugs and alcohol on behavior. He is a professor of pharmacy and assistant professor of psychiatry in behavioral science at the University of South Carolina. In that setting, he \u201cwork[s] with psychiatrists and other pharmacy students, medical students, instructing them what to expect from various drug therapies.\u201d He is board certified in the \u201cfairly specialized\u201d area of psychiatric pharmacy practice. At the time of the trial, he was working in a general and psychiatric clinical practice where patients undergo drug and alcohol treatment in an \u201cin patient unit.\u201d In addition to his extensive experience in the field generally, Dr. Morton has studied and dealt specifically with the effects of lithium on persons diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He has written numerous publications (forty-six) in the field of lithium and bipolar disorder, \u201clooking at how to monitor and utilize lithium and ... in the area of treatment of bipolar disorder, as well as ... other areas of psychopharmacology.\u201d He has established several lithium climes, one of which was specifically for persons with bipolar disorder, and, for eighteen years, he worked in clinics where he saw from 200 to 280 patients on a regular basis. He worked as a consultant on a regular basis for drug and alcohol programs, and he was a regular faculty member in a setting where he saw patients and made recommendations on their drug therapies. In his practice, he consulted with physicians who needed to ascertain if and what kind and dosage of drugs a patient should take. In certain cases, he was the primary care practitioner for patients who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The Supreme Court has unequivocally held, \u201cwe will reverse a holding that a witness is not qualified to testify as an expert when it appears clearly from the record that the witness possesses sufficient knowledge, skill, or experience to make him competent to testify as an expert on the subject matter at issue.\u201d <em>Sami, </em>260 Va. at 284, 535 S.E.2d at 174. The record proves that Dr. Morton was qualified to give an opinion about the effects of drugs and alcohol on a bipolar person who combined alcohol with drugs. Other experts and the complaining witness\u2019 own testimony established that she suffered from a bipolar disorder and that she had taken lithium, other prescription drugs in unprescribed overdoses, illegal substances, and alcohol. Dr. Morton\u2019s breadth of experience, which included lengthy and extensive clinical experience, treatment of patients, and knowledge of the effects of prescription and illegal drugs on the behavior of individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder, satisfied the requirements for expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The trial judge erred by requiring that Dr. Morton be a medical doctor to testify as to the effect of drugs and alcohol on persons with a bipolar disorder. As Molina correctly notes, the Supreme Court has allowed a nurse to testify about the causation of physical injuries of rape victims, even though a nurse is not a licensed physician, because \u201cit has long been accepted that nurses and other healthcare professionals with the proper training, expertise, and experience are qualified to give expert opinions on medical causation in appropriate circumstances.\u201d <em>Velazquez, </em>263 Va. at 103-04, 557 S.E.2d at 218. Dr. Morton is an expert in the field in which he was called to testify, psychopharmacology.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">This error was not harmless. Dr. Morton\u2019s expertise included evaluating the effects of a number of illicit and prescribed drugs, in varying amounts, and alcohol on the behavior of persons with bipolar disorder. His testimony was critical to Molina\u2019s defense. Dr. Morton\u2019s testimony about the effects of alcohol, cocaine, and other substances on the complaining witness\u2019 bipolar disorder would have allowed the jury to infer that she could have appeared quite normal (and consenting) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Molina, yet have no memory of engaging in sexual intercourse. The exclusion of his testimony left the jury uninformed about the effect of the combination of the drugs and alcohol on the behavioral pattern and memory of a bipolar person whose lithium level was abnormally low. This was a matter beyond the understanding of lay persons. By excluding the testimony, the trial judge deprived Molina of evidence of a factual basis upon which the jury could have decided in Molina\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">I would also hold that the trial judge erred in granting Instruction 14, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">The Court instructs the jury that the defendant is charged with the crime of rape. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">(1) That the defendant had sexual intercourse with [the victim] who was not then the defendant\u2019s spouse; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">(2) That it was against her will and without her consent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">(3) That it was by force, threat, or intimidation; or by the use of mental incapacity or physical helplessness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the above elements of the offense as charged, then you shall find the defendant guilty....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">This instruction erroneously combined the elements of \u201cagainst her will and without her consent\u201d with the elements of \u201cmental incapacity or physical helplessness\u201d in a way not contemplated by the rape statute. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">If any person has sexual intercourse with a complaining witness ... and such act is accomplished (i) against the complaining witness\u2019s will, by force, threat or intimidation of or against the complaining witness ... or (ii) through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>use of the complaining witness\u2019s mental incapacity or physical helplessness ... he or she shall be guilty of rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajr\">Thus, the statute defines three distinct circumstances of sexual intercourse: (i) against a person\u2019s will by force (or threat or intimidation), (ii) through the use of the person\u2019s mental incapacity, and (iii) through the use of the person\u2019s physical helplessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The jury asked questions that reasonably suggested that the melding of these elements in one instruction created confusion. For example, the jury wrote to the judge the following inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">Assumption: The defendant and the victim could be in the same mentally incapacitated state at the time of the incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">(1) Based on the assumption, does Virginia Law specify whether a defendant would be <em>expected </em>to render a <em>rational </em>decision as to the state of mental capacitation and incapacitation of the woman whom he desires to engage in a sexual act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">(2) Per se, are two adults, one male and one female, that are mentally incapacitated at the time of the sexual encounter engaged in an act of \u201crape\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">These inquiries are significant because the instructions the trial judge gave to the jury did not require the jury to find that the complaining witness was either mentally incapacitated or physically incapacitated. The Commonwealth offered, and the judge gave, an instruction that permitted the jury to convict Molina upon a finding of Molina\u2019s \u201cuse of mental incapacity.\u201d Significantly, the Commonwealth never argued that the complaining witness was mentally incapacitated. In other words, the jury could have found that the complaining witness was intoxicated and that Molina, who was also intoxicated, was guilty of rape because he engaged in sexual relations with her without the use of force, threat, or intimidation, but at a time when he was mentally unable to comprehend her intentions. The jury gave an indication it was considering this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>when it inquired whether \u201cthe defendant and the victim could be in the same mentally incapacitated state at the time of the incident.\u201d It is certain that \u201cthe same ... state\u201d the jury addressed was intoxication because it is undisputed that the evidence proved both Molina and the complaining witness were similar in this respect \u2014 they both consumed alcohol at \u201cthe time of the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We have held that a complaining witness is not rendered physically helpless or mentally incapacitated solely because \u201cshe was \u2018drunk\u2019 ... [and] was taking \u2018antidepressant\u2019 medication that day.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>21 Va.App. at 476, 465 S.E.2d at 143. Yet, the instruction in this case permitted the jury to substitute for the \u201cforce, threat or intimidation\u201d element its belief that the complaining witness\u2019 will was overcome merely because she was voluntarily intoxicated. Indeed, the jury, which specifically had indicated to the trial judge its lack of unanimity, asked: \u201cCan you define \u2018against her will?\u2019 Consent is defined ... but \u201cwill\u2019 is not.\u201d The jury\u2019s focus on the issue of complainant\u2019s \u201cwill\u201d is also evident by its further inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2K\">Element (8): \u201cThat it was against her will; and\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">(1) Under Virginia law, does Element (8) mean that the victim was or could be in a mental state that could prevent her from rendering a rational decision as to her will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">(2) Under Virginia law, does the act of exercising one\u2019s \u201cwill\u201d directly involves or implies a process of decision making?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The jury\u2019s focus on the complaining witness\u2019 consent and will was compromised by the instruction\u2019s disjunctive use of three distinct circumstances of sexual intercourse. I disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that the instruction, which intertwined the three theories of rape, was harmless. The Commonwealth never argued that the complaining witness was mentally incapacitated. Yet, the instruction placed before the jury a basis upon which to impermissibly use the complaining witness\u2019 intoxication. Furthermore, as the instruction is crafted, it is impossible to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>jury was unanimous on any one of the instruction\u2019s theories of the event. Fewer than twelve jurors could have believed the complaining witness was raped by threat, force, or intimidation (a theory that was submitted to the jury even though the trial judge struck the wounding and abduction charges). Others could have believed that the complaining witness was conscious during intercourse (as she told the officers) and that the rape was accomplished while she was intoxicated (that is, according to the jurors\u2019 inquiry, \u201cin the same mentally incapacitated state\u201d as Molina). Others could have found that the complaining witness\u2019 intoxication equated with mental incapacity or physical helplessness. It is not possible to tell which set of facts the jury agreed on.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u201cUnder established Virginia law, the verdict in all criminal prosecutions must be unanimous.\u201d <em>Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 468, 481, 323 S.E.2d 114, 121 (1984) (citing Rule 3A:17(a)). The requirement of unanimity means that the jury must unanimously find each element exists. <em>See Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 817-18, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 1710, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">The Supreme Court explained in <em>Richardson </em>that, for example, the jury must unanimously find force as an element of the crime of robbery, but whether the force is created by the use of a gun or a knife is not an element of the crime and therefore does not require jury unanimity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\"><em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 423, 434-35, 587 S.E.2d 532, 541 (2003) (citing <em>Richardson, </em>526 U.S. at 817, 119 S.Ct. at 1710). In this case, however, the question is not \u201cwhich of several possible sets of underlying brute facts make up a particular element.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>526 U.S. at 817, 119 S.Ct. at 1710. Rather, this is a case where the elements of \u201cagainst [a person\u2019s] will\u201d or \u201cthrough ... mental incapacity\u201d or \u201cthrough ... physical helplessness\u201d are three conceptually distinguishable concepts that are independent elements of the same crime. Because the jury had a menu of permissible ways to convict, the verdict failed to show that the jury reached unanimity on one set of facts. Thus, the Commonwealth failed to prove \u201cevery <em>fact </em>necessary to constitute the crime with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>which he is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winskip, </em>897 U.S. at 364, 90 S.Ct. at 1073 (emphasis added). We have no basis to know from the record what essential element the jury found. Therefore, I would hold that the instruction was erroneous, failed to properly inform the jury of the law, and was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">For all of these reasons, I would reverse the convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\">.
