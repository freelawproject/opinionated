Thus, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Hill was indicted for possession of Oxycodone, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. Hill filed a pretrial motion to suppress, arguing that the affidavit underlying a search warrant for his residence was \u201cso lacking in an indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d After the trial court denied the motion, Hill entered a guilty plea. Specifically, when asked \u201c[h]ow do you plead,\u201d Hill responded, \u201cguilty.\u201d The trial judge told defense counsel to remove the guilty plea form from the podium and to fill it out while he asked Hill several questions relevant to his plea. During this series of questions, the following colloquy occurred between Hill, the court, and Hill\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">THE COURT: Do you understand that by entering a plea of guilty you may waive your right to appeal the decision of this Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">THE COURT: Mr. Lawrence, is it your intention to reserve your motion to suppress matters for appellate purposes, or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">MR. LAWRENCE: We haven\u2019t decided at this point. I would say for the record \u2014 I would say yes at this moment, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Following entry of the guilty plea, the trial court sentenced Hill to five years imprisonment, but suspended the sentence on condition of good behavior. Hill now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">On appeal, Hill contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, arguing that the affidavit used to secure the search warrant for his residence was \u201cso lacking in an indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in it existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d The Commonwealth, however, argues that we lack jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>of this appeal because Hill entered a guilty plea, thereby waiving his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress. For the following reasons, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">A. <em>Hill\u2019s Plea Was Not A Conditional Guilty Plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-t\">According to Article 1, Section 8 of the Virginia Constitution, \u201c[i]n criminal cases, the accused may plead guilty.\u201d We have interpreted this constitutional provision to mean that the Commonwealth must accept any guilty plea tendered before a jury has rendered its verdict, so long as the plea is entered \u201cknowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.\u201d <em>See Graham v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 133, 139, 397 S.E.2d 270, 273 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">However, although an accused has the constitutional right to enter a guilty plea, an accused does not have a constitutional right to enter a <em>conditional </em>guilty plea. Rather, this right \u2014 established by Code \u00a7 19.2-254 \u2014 is a statutory one. Specifically, Code \u00a7 19.2-254 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">With the approval of the court <em>and the consent of the Commonwealth, </em>a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty in a felony case, reserving the right, on appeal from the judgment, to a review of the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion. If the defendant prevails on appeal, he shall be allowed to withdraw his plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">According to the \u201cplain-meaning\u201d rule of statutory construction, if a statute is clear on its face, we need not resort to rules of statutory construction, but rather, we must give full effect to the plain meaning of the words chosen by the legislature. <em>See Brown v. Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). Thus, as we recently held, in order to enter a conditional guilty plea, the statute clearly requires approval of the court <em>and </em>the Commonwealth\u2019s consent. <em>See Witcher v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 273, 623 S.E.2d 432 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">In this case, when asked \u201c[h]ow do you plead,\u201d Hill responded, \u201cguilty.\u201d Although the trial court asked defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>counsel whether he intended \u201cto reserve [his] motion to suppress matters for appellate purposes,\u201d neither Hill nor the Commonwealth ever clearly asserted that Hill\u2019s guilty plea was conditional in nature. And even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the aforementioned conversation alerted the Commonwealth to Hill\u2019s attempt to enter a conditional guilty plea, nowhere in the record is there any indication that the Commonwealth expressly consented to such a plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Moreover, although it is true that the Commonwealth may manifest its consent to a conditional guilty plea through \u201crelated assurances\u201d to the defendant, this record is completely devoid of such assurances. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 137, 144, 562 S.E.2d 341, 344 (2002) (holding that the Commonwealth manifested its consent \u201cin related assurances to defendant and subsequent hearings and rulings\u201d). Hill argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to object or otherwise clarify the plea, along with the Commonwealth\u2019s filing of a reply brief addressing the merits of this appeal, are both \u201crelated assurances\u201d manifesting its consent to a conditional guilty plea. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the parties and the court engaged in an extended discussion \u2014 on the record \u2014 regarding a potential double jeopardy issue. <em>See id. </em>During that exchange, the prosecutor expressly stipulated that, if the defendant prevailed on appeal with regard to the double jeopardy argument, the Commonwealth was \u201cnot going to try somebody twice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, at the conclusion of the trial proceedings, the court told defense counsel to \u201ctake the initiative\u201d and pursue the issue on appeal. <em>Id. </em>Under those circumstances, we concluded that \u201cthe sole promise upon which [the] guilty plea was conditioned was [the defendant\u2019s] ability to contest the issue of successive prosecutions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(first alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Here, in contrast, there is no similar exchange between the trial court, defense counsel, and the Commonwealth regarding the motion to suppress. In fact, there is no dialogue at all on behalf of the Commonwealth. The colloquy regarding the motion to suppress was solely between the court and Hill. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Also, unlike in <em>Johnson, </em>there are no assurances by the Commonwealth that, if the Fourth Amendment issue were later resolved in favor of Hill, the Commonwealth would drop the charge. <em>Cf. id. </em>(noting that, while discussing the double jeopardy issue with the court, the prosecutor \u201cstipulated on the record if that\u2019s the case, the Commonwealth will be joining in [a] defense motion as we\u2019re not going to try somebody twice\u201d). Moreover, the Commonwealth never entered into a written plea agreement with Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Thus, we find that, under the circumstances of this case, the Commonwealth\u2019s silence during the exchange between the trial court and defense counsel, even when combined with the filing of a brief addressing the merits of the appeal, does not constitute \u201crelated assurances\u201d of consent to entry of a conditional guilty plea. Therefore, because the Commonwealth did not consent to a conditional guilty plea, either expressly or by \u201crelated assurances\u201d to Hill, we find that Hill entered a guilty plea. And because, as discussed below, this plea was both knowing and intelligent, we hold that Hill waived his right to appeal. <em>See Witcher, </em>47 Va.App. at 275, 623 S.E.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">B. <em>Hill\u2019s Guilty Plea Constituted a Knowing and Intelligent Waiver of His Right to Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">\u201c \u2018When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\u2019\u201d <em>Terry v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 192, 196-97, 516 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1999) (quoting <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 1608, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973)). In other words, \u201c \u2018[a] voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty by an accused is, in reality, a self-supplied conviction authorizing imposition of the punishment fixed by law,\u2019 \u201d constituting a \u201c \u201cwaiver of all defenses other than those jurisdictional, effective as such not only in the lower court but as well in this court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Savino v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 534, 539, 391 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1990) (quoting <em>Peyton v. King, </em>210 Va. 194, 196-97, 169 S.E.2d 569, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>571 (1969)). Essentially, once a guilty plea has been entered, and a punishment fixed, \u201cthere is nothing to appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Thus, because a defendant who enters a guilty plea waives several rights, including his right to appeal, a \u201cplea of guilty is constitutionally valid only to the extent it is \u2018voluntar/ and \u2018intelligent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 618,118 S.Ct. 1604, 1609,140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (quoting <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1469, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970)). Moreover, to withstand scrutiny on appeal, the record must contain an \u201caffirmative showing\u201d that the guilty plea was entered voluntarily and intelligently. <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1712, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969) (holding that an appellate court \u201ccannot presume a waiver of ... [the defendant\u2019s] rights from a silent record\u201d); <em>see also Stokes v. Slayton, </em>340 F.Supp. 190, 192 (W.D.Va.1972) (holding that, in order for a guilty plea to withstand constitutional scrutiny, the trial record must affirmatively show that guilty plea was entered freely and intelligently), aff<em>'d, </em>473 F.2d 906 (4th Cir.1973); <em>Bridgers v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 370, 371, 177 S.E.2d 526, 527-28 (1970) (noting that <em>Boykin </em>\u201cestablished a new rule that the record show on its face that the guilty plea was voluntarily and intelligently made\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Here, even though the allegedly \u201cconditional\u201d guilty plea fails to meet the statutory requirements, we must still address whether, in the context of his \u201cconditional\u201d guilty plea, Hill entered his guilty plea freely, intelligently, and knowingly. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the trial record \u201caffirmativel/\u2019 shows that Hill\u2019s plea was made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <em>Boykin, </em>395 U.S. at 242, 89 S.Ct. at 1711-12. Accordingly, the guilty plea constituted an effective waiver of Hill\u2019s right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Before accepting Hill\u2019s plea, the trial court asked Hill a series of standard questions regarding his guilty plea. Hill stated he understood that he was waiving many rights, including the right to a trial by jury, the right not to incriminate himself, and the right to confront and cross-examine his accusers. Hill also assured the court that he was entering the plea \u201cfreely and voluntarily,\u201d that he had discussed it with his attorney, and that he was entering the plea because he was guilty of the crime charged. When asked, Hill stated he understood the questions .asked by the court, that he had answered the questions truthfully, and that he had no further questions of the court. He also signed a document acknowledging that the questions were asked, and answered, in open court while under oath. Moreover, while accepting Hill\u2019s plea, the Court expressly found that Hill \u201cfreely, voluntarily, and intelligently, with advice of competent counsel, entered [his] plea of guilty\u201d and that Hill had \u201cdone so knowing the elements of the offense, [and the] consequences of [his] criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">There is no evidence in the record to suggest that Hill was unsure about entering his guilty plea. He acknowledged that he had discussed the issue with his counsel and that he understood the consequences of entering the plea. Moreover, Hill declined the opportunity to ask questions regarding his plea. Therefore, based on this record, we find that Hill voluntarily and intelligently entered his guilty plea. <em>See generally Anderson v. Warden of Powhatan Corr. Ctr., </em>222 Va. 511, 516, 281 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1981) (holding that where, \u201c[d]uring the course of [the trial court\u2019s questioning], the accused positively and without equivocation ... professed the voluntariness of his plea of guilty,\u201d the voluntariness of that plea was \u201cconsidered conclusively established by the trial proceedings\u201d). And, because Hill\u2019s guilty plea was both knowing and intelligent, Hill has waived his right to appeal. <em>See Burton v. Peyton, </em>210 Va. 484, 489, 171 S.E.2d 822, 826 (1970) (\u201cThe evidence amply supports a finding that the plea of guilty was made knowingly and intelligently by petitioner, with full knowledge of its effect____ From such a plea there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>appeal.\u201d); <em>see also Witcher, </em>47 Va.App. at 275, 628 S.E.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Because Hill entered a guilty plea, rather than a conditional guilty plea, and because Hill entered his guilty plea \u201cvoluntarily and intelligently,\u201d we hold that Hill waived his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress. Therefore, we dismiss Hill\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">.
