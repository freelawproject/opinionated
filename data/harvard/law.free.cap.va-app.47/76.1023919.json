Turner, Sr., husband, on appeal contends the trial court erred in (1) entering a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) without any prior order granting wife an actual defined portion of his pension, (2) modifying the final decree in violation of Rule 1:1, and (3) recognizmg/enforcing a predivorce oral agreement. Essentially, husband argues the trial court created substantive rights in the QDRO that were not awarded in the final decree. For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">The parties married on November 29, 1980, and separated November 15, 1995. Husband filed a bill of complaint for divorce in the Circuit Court for the City of Chesapeake, Virginia. The matter was referred to a commissioner in chancery. At the commissioner\u2019s hearing on March 11, 1999, counsel for both parties proffered that the parties reached an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>oral agreement as to child support, spousal support, and health care coverage. The stipulation also included husband\u2019s waiver of any interest in wife\u2019s pension. The stipulation continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">Mr. Turner has a retirement, and we have decided that the numerator in this particular case is fifteen years, and the agreement is that Mrs. Turner would be awarded a share of Mr. Turner\u2019s retirement, based on the total number of years that they were married and together, which would be fixed at fifteen, divided by the total number of years it takes to get the benefit, times .5; and that this retirement would be the subject of a Quadro [QDRO] that may be prepared at a later time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">* * * # # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">any item pertaining to equitable distribution that has not been previously mentioned in this agreement would be waived by both parties; and that\u2019s the agreement, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Each party, under oath, acknowledged the proffer to be their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The commissioner recommended \u201cthat the [wife] be awarded a share of the [husband\u2019s] pension, based on fifteen (15) years of marriage contemporaneous with the employment, as described in counsel\u2019s statement contained on page 5 of the Transcript, beginning at line 5 through line 22.\u201d This reference is to the stipulation that wife would be entitled to 50% of the marital share of husband\u2019s pension. Neither party excepted to the commissioner\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The trial court entered a final decree on November 16,1999, that \u201cconfirmed and approved\u201d the commissioner\u2019s report and provided <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">It is further ADJUDGED, ORDERED and DECREED that both the plaintiff and the defendant are denied equitable distribution relief under Virginia Code section \u00a7 20-107.3, as amended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">It is further ADJUDGED, ORDERED and DECREED that Idell Turner is awarded a share of the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>pension based on fifteen (15) years of marriage contemporaneous with the employment by the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The final decree was not appealed. Upon learning that husband had retired from his employment and was receiving retirement benefits, wife sought to enforce the provisions of the final decree of divorce. Wife filed a petition for a rule to show cause, along with a notice to enter a QDRO, to hold husband in contempt for not paying wife her share of husband\u2019s pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The court held a hearing on February 4, 2004, on the rule to show cause. Husband testified he retired November 1, 2003, from the Hampton Roads Shipping Association-International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (HRSA-ILA). This pension fund was the only one available to him during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Over husband\u2019s objection, the trial court entered a QDRO awarding wife a portion of husband\u2019s retirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">5. <em>RETIREMENT: </em>Pursuant to the parties\u2019 oral stipulation and Final Decree of Divorce, former spouse is entitled to receive 25% of Member\u2019s monthly retirement benefit until the date on which payments to the Member shall end pursuant to the Plan\u2019s provisions or upon the death of the Former Spouse whichever shall first occur. This amount represents 50% of the marital share of Member\u2019s retirement benefit. The marital share is determined by a fraction of which the numerator is the number of years married while accumulating said benefit and has previously been stipulated by the parties to be Fifteen (15) years and the denominator is the total number of years Member has accumulated said benefit and is determined to be Thirty (30) years. HRSA-ILA is ORDERED to pay Former Spouse\u2019s share directly to Former Spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Husband contends the trial court, by awarding wife 50% of the marital share of his pension, created substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>rights not awarded in the final decree. Wife answers by maintaining the QDRO simply was an administrative mechanism to effectuate the intent and purpose of the final decree\u2019s award. We agree with wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The jurisdiction of the court to enter orders effectuating and enforcing its equitable distribution order entered pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3 is limited. Equitable distribution orders become final within twenty-one days of entry. <em>See </em>Rule 1:1; <em>see also Fahey v. Fahey, </em>24 Va.App. 254, 256, 481 S.E.2d 496, 497 (1997). Thereafter, the court\u2019s power to modify such orders is governed by statute. Under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4), an equitable distribution order \u201cintended to affect or divide any pension or retirement benefits pursuant to ... federal laws ... [may be modified by subsequent order] only for the purpose of establishing or maintaining the order as a qualified domestic relations order or to revise or conform its terms so as to effectuate the expressed intent of the order.\u201d <em>See Wilson v. Wilson, </em>25 Va.App. 752, 757-58, 492 S.E.2d 495, 498 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Thus, based on Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4), a trial court has authority to reinstate an equitable distribution decree on its docket in order to make the terms of the retirement or pension provisions \u201ceffectuate the expressed intent\u201d of the original decree. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4) does not, however, allow a court to modify a final divorce decree simply to adjust its terms in light of the parties\u2019 changed circumstances. <em>Caudle v. Caudle, </em>18 Va.App. 795, 798, 447 S.E.2d 247, 249 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">We have previously held that [QDRO] orders that alter critical terms of the [equitable distribution order], such as timing or amount of payments, exceed the authority granted under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4). <em>See, e.g., Fahey, </em>24 Va.App. at 256, 481 S.E.2d at 497 (holding that the division of the actual value of a Keogh account rather than the agreed value was a substantive change); <em>Decker v. Decker, </em>22 Va.App. 486, 495, 471 S.E.2d 775, 779 (1996) (holding that reduction in spousal support by amount of mortgage pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ments on recipient spouse\u2019s house was a substantive change).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><em>Hastie v. Hastie, </em>29 Va.App. 776, 781, 514 S.E.2d 800, 803 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Here, the QDRO did not alter the critical terms of the equitable distribution order, as the final decree had already established wife\u2019s marital share of husband\u2019s pension. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) defines \u201cmarital share\u201d as \u201c[t]hat portion of the total interest, the right to which was earned during the marriage and before the last separation of the parties.... \u201d This statutory language is mandatory and can be implemented through the use of a simple formula in the form of a fraction. The number of years that the spouse was in the pension plan while in the marriage serves as the numerator and the total number of years in the pension plan serves as the denominator. This fraction establishes the marital share of the pension as defined by the statute. <em>See Primm v. Primm, </em>12 Va.App. 1036, 1037, 407 S.E.2d 45, 46 (1991). When the parties divorced, husband had not yet retired, thus, the denominator was unknown. Based on the oral agreement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>and the commissioner\u2019s recommendation to award wife 50% of the marital share, the trial court confirmed wife\u2019s share of husband\u2019s pension. Thus, the trial court awarded wife 50% of the marital share of husband\u2019s pension. The amount of the marital portion of husband\u2019s pension could only be established upon husband\u2019s retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">While the final decree did not specify that wife would get 50% of the marital portion of the pension, the final decree certainly made the award by affirming the commissioner\u2019s recommendation. \u201cOnce adopted by the chancellor ... the actions, findings and recommendations of the commissioner become those of the supervising court and are due considerable deference on appeal.\u201d <em>Haase v. Haase, </em>20 Va.App. 671, 679, 460 S.E.2d 585, 588 (1995). If the final decree did not fix wife\u2019s share, then the presence of the formula to ultimately determine the marital share of the pension would be meaningless. Clearly, the parties intended wife would receive 50% of the marital share of the pension. The commissioner recommended that percentage. Neither party excepted to that recommendation. The final decree expressly confirmed and affirmed the commissioner\u2019s report. This decree was not appealed. Now, husband asks this Court to relieve him of his oral agreement. We will not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The QDRO simply supplies the denominator in the equation to determine the marital portion of the pension. Wife\u2019s 50% share had already been established in the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The trial court, in the QDRO, did not create substantive rights, but only effectuated \u201cthe express intent of the [final decree].\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4). We conclude the trial court did not err in entering the QDRO, and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\">. Husband argues that under <em>Flanary v. Milton, </em>263 Va. 20, 556 S.E.2d 767 (2002), the trial court erred in relying on an invalid oral agreement as a basis for the QDRO ruling. Husband correctly notes that <em>Flanary </em>ruled that an oral agreement violated the requirement of Code \u00a7 20-149 that an agreement must be in writing and signed by the parties. Thus, the trial court erred in finding the oral agreement valid. However, the oral agreement, as part of the commissioner\u2019s recommendation, was confirmed and approved in the final decree. The final decree was not appealed and became the law of the case. \"Under such circumstances, the decree became and remains the law of the case.\u201d <em>Walt Robbins, Inc. v. Damon Corp., </em>232 Va. 43, 49, 348 S.E.2d 223, 228 (1986). <em>See Norris v. Mitchell, </em>255 Va. 235, 240, 495 S.E.2d 809, 812 (1998) (holding that when an unappealed decree becomes \u201cthe final order ... and the law of this case ... we treat the order as correctly entered\"). Therefore, the oral agreement is valid. Having so ruled, we need not address the retroactivity of the 2003 amendments to Code \u00a7 20-155, which provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">If the terms of such agreement are (i) contained in a court order endorsed by counsel or the parties or (ii) recorded and transcribed by a court reporter and affirmed by the parties on the record personally, the agreement is not required to be in writing and is considered to be executed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\"><em>. </em>We reject husband's contention that the final decree contains contradictory provisions, i.e., the decree denies equitable distribution and then awards wife a share of husband\u2019s pension. From the proffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>before the commissioner in chancery, it is clear the parties waived any equitable distribution claim other than to husband\u2019s pension.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
