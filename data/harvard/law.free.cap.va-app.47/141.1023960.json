McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">Michael Paul Shiflett appeals his misdemeanor conviction, on a conditional guilty plea, for driving after having been adjudicated an habitual offender in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. Shiflett contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of the violation because the officer who stopped him lacked a reasonable, articulable suspicion of unlawful conduct to justify an investigatory traffic stop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of Shiflett\u2019s motion to suppress, we consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below. <em>See Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 666, 672, 594 S.E.2d 595, 598 (2004). On November 1, 2003, Warden Daniel Ross, a game warden with the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, issued Shiflett a summons for a \u201cspotlighting\u201d violation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, Ross checked Shiflett\u2019s driving record and determined that his driving privilege was revoked, as Shiflett had been adjudicated an habitual offender. Ross also spoke with Shiflett about his habitual offender status when issuing the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">On March 31, 2004, Ross observed Shiflett walk out of a market, get into a vehicle, and drive onto a public highway. Ross proceeded to \u201c[fall] in behind\u201d Shiflett, at which time Ross observed objects \u201cdangling\u201d from the rearview mirror of Shiflett\u2019s vehicle. Based on Ross\u2019s observation of those objects and his knowledge of Shiflett\u2019s status as an habitual offender five months earlier, Ross stopped and detained Shiflett while checking on the current status of Shiflett\u2019s driving record. After confirming that Shiflett\u2019s driving privilege had not been restored, Ross issued Shiflett a summons for driving after being adjudicated an habitual offender, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ross did not issue Shiflett a summons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>any violation regarding objects hanging from the rearview mirror.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">At a pretrial suppression hearing, Shiflett moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the stop, contending the stop was illegal. Specifically, Shiflett argued that Ross effected the stop without a reasonable, articulable suspicion that Shiflett was involved in some form of criminal activity, in violation of Shiflett\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. The trial court concluded that the stop was legally justified, and therefore denied the motion, upon finding that Ross possessed a reasonable suspicion that Shiflett was driving without a license as an habitual offender.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shiflett subsequently entered a conditional guilty plea, preserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">When this Court reviews a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201c \u2018the burden is upon the [defendant] to show that the ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u2019\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)). Where a Fourth Amendment challenge is at issue, \u201c \u2018[ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to make a warrantless search\u2019 involve questions of both law and fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197-98, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 691, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1659, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). Thus, \u201cwe give deference to the factual findings of the trial court but independently decide whether, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>applicable law, the manner in which the challenged evidence was obtained satisfies constitutional requirements.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>267 Va. at 673, 594 S.E.2d at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In this case, Warden Ross stopped Shiflett\u2019s vehicle and detained him, effecting a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes. <em>See Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979); <em>Jackson, </em>267 Va. at 672, 594 S.E.2d at 598; <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 437, 441, 452 S.E.2d 364, 367 (1994) <em>(en banc). </em>To justify such action, a police officer must have a \u201creasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity \u2018may be afoot.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884-85, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). \u201cActual proof that criminal activity is afoot is not necessary.\u201d <em>Harmon v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 440, 444, 425 S.E.2d 77, 79 (1992). Consequently, \u201c[a]n investigatory stop under <em>Terry </em>anticipates that some innocent people may be stopped. Nevertheless, it is a lawful stop designed to permit an officer with reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to quickly confirm or dispel that suspicion.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 533, 539, 546 S.E.2d 252, 255 (2001) (citing <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 126, 120 S.Ct. 673, 677, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">A reasonable suspicion justifying an investigatory stop is \u201csomething more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch\u2019 of criminal activity,\u201d but \u201csomething less than probable cause.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>267 Va. at 673, 594 S.E.2d at 598 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883) (some internal quotation marks and other citations omitted). However, \u201c[t]here are no bright line rules to follow when determining whether a reasonable and articulable suspicion exists to justify an investigatory stop. Instead, the courts must consider \u2018the totality of the circumstances \u2014 the whole picture.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reel v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 262, 266, 522 S.E.2d 881, 883 (2000) (quoting <em>Hoye v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 132, 135, 442 S.E.2d 404, 406 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The question thus presented under this objective standard is: \u201cwould the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure ... \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate?\u201d <em>Iglesias v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 93, 102, 372 S.E.2d 170, 175 (1988) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880). Because of Ross\u2019s recent knowledge of Shiflett\u2019s habitual offender status and his discussion with Shiflett about that status, Ross possessed a reasonable, articulable suspicion at the time of the stop that criminal activity was \u201cafoot,\u201d i.e. that Shiflett was driving on a public highway without the privilege to do so, after having been declared an habitual offender. <em>See Prouse, </em>440 U.S. at 663, 99 S.Ct. at 1401 (explaining that investigatory traffic stop does not violate Fourth Amendment when officer possesses reasonable and articulable suspicion that driver is unlicensed). Thus, Warden Ross did act appropriately in stopping and detaining Shiflett.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Shiflett contends that the stop was based on no more than Ross\u2019s \u201chunch\u201d that Shiflett was driving without a license. He argues that, because Ross\u2019s information regarding Shiflett\u2019s habitual offender status was five months old at the time of the stop, the information was stale, thus negating it as justification for the stop. In support of this contention, Shiflett relies on <em>Stovall v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 67, 189 S.E.2d 353 (1972), in which the Supreme Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of illegal drugs because the incriminating evidence was the product of a search warrant issued upon information that was \u201ctoo stale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 189 S.E.2d at 356. There, the information was 72 days old. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court reasoned that \u201cevidence that one was illegally in possession of drugs on a given date is not probable cause to believe that he possesses illegal drugs 72 days thereafter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><em>Stovall </em>is clearly distinguishable from the instant case. First, <em>Stovall </em>involved a review of a search warrant under the probable cause standard, not a review of an investigatory traffic stop under the reasonable suspicion standard. Second, one\u2019s possession of illegal drugs, transitory in nature, does not equate with one\u2019s ongoing status upon being adjudicated an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>habitual offender. Under Code \u00a7 46.2-356, a person who has been adjudicated an habitual offender generally will continue in that status for ten years and thereafter until the privilege has been restored by a court of competent jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 660, 507 S.E.2d 670, 672 (1998) (holding that defendant\u2019s habitual offender status remained in effect twenty-three years after he had been adjudicated an habitual offender). Although Ross\u2019s knowledge that Shiflett was an habitual offender five months earlier was not conclusive evidence that Shiflett was still an habitual offender, that fact gave Ross a reasonable basis to suspect that he was still an habitual offender, which, in turn, justified the investigatory stop. <em>See Glasco v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 763, 771, 497 S.E.2d 150, 154 (1998) (holding that officer\u2019s knowledge of defendant\u2019s arrest two weeks earlier on charges that often, but not always, resulted in suspension of driver\u2019s license established reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving without license at time of stop); <em>see also Anderson v. State, </em>265 Ga.App. 146, 592 S.E.2d 910, 913 (2004) (holding that officer\u2019s knowledge four months earlier that defendant\u2019s license was suspended was not \u201ctoo remote\u201d to establish reasonable suspicion that defendant \u201cmight be driving on a suspended license\u201d at time of stop); <em>State v. Yeargan, </em>958 S.W.2d 626, 633 (Tenn.1997) (holding that officer\u2019s knowledge six months earlier that defendant\u2019s license was revoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>for DUI conviction established reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving on revoked license at time of stop).</p>\n<p id=\"Ak7\">Shiflett also contends that Ross acted unreasonably because he could have used a less intrusive means of confirming Shiflett\u2019s habitual offender status by first obtaining the information on his patrol car radio before making the stop. This contention is also without merit. The United States Supreme Court has expressly rejected such notion, stating that \u201c[t]he reasonableness of the officer\u2019s decision to stop a suspect does not turn on the availability of less intrusive investigatory techniques. Such a rule would unduly hamper the police\u2019s ability to make swift, on-the-spot decisions ... and it would require courts to indulge in unrealistic second-guessing.\u201d <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 11, 109 S.Ct. at 1587 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Finally, we reject Shiflett\u2019s assertion that our affirmance of the trial court\u2019s decision would mean a person adjudicated an habitual offender would be \u201cforever subject to the whim of law enforcement seizure for the alleged purpose of ascertaining the status of his driving privileges.\u201d Courts must judge the validity of investigatory traffic stops, as seizures under the Fourth Amendment, based on \u201cthe facts of each case,\u201d even if such determinations \u201c \u2018create difficult line-drawing problems.\u2019 \u201d <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 577, 586, 359 S.E.2d 540, 544 (1987) (quoting <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 685, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1575, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985)). The relevant passage of time (five months) was of short enough duration, relative to the general duration of one\u2019s habitual offender status (ten years), to compel our conclusion that the officer\u2019s earlier knowledge of that information was an objectively reasonable justification for his suspicion at the time of the investigatory stop that Shiflett was driving illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">For these reasons, we hold that the stop of Shiflett\u2019s vehicle did not violate the Fourth Amendment and that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>properly denied the motion to suppress. Therefore, we affirm Shiflett\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\">.
