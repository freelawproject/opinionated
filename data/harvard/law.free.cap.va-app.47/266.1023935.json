On appeal, Gilbert contends the trial court erred in finding the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that he was the child\u2019s employer sufficient, as a matter of law, to prove he maintained a \u201ccustodial or supervisory relationship\u201d over the child within the meaning of the statute. We disagree and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and Gilbert\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">The relevant facts in this case are undisputed. Gilbert was a co-owner and manager of Manhattan Bagel, a food establishment located in Prince William County. Gilbert was responsible for the hiring and firing of the store\u2019s employees, fixing the employees\u2019 work schedules, and directing the employees regarding their duties during work hours. In June 2003, Gilbert hired the victim. The victim worked for Gilbert at the bagel store from June to December 2003. Occasionally, the victim worked with Gilbert in his office. Gilbert told the victim he was going to teach him accounting procedures so he could be \u201ca supervisor\u201d by the time he was a senior in high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">In December 2003, the victim, who was seeking a raise, agreed to work with Gilbert at the store on Christmas day, even though the store would be closed. After being dropped off at the store that day around noon by his mother, the victim worked with Gilbert for about an hour, preparing the store for the next business day. After completing their work, Gilbert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>suggested they talk in his office and the victim agreed to do so \u201cfor a few minutes.\u201d No one else was in the store. Gilbert was fifty-six years old at the time, and the victim was fifteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">After talking briefly about Christmas and sports, Gilbert directed the conversation toward sexual matters. As the conversation progressed, Gilbert touched the victim\u2019s ear, neck, and chest. He then told the victim to pull down his pants. \u201cIn shock\u201d and \u201c[not] know[ing] what to do,\u201d the victim complied. After touching the victim\u2019s thighs, Gilbert got up and closed the office door so no one outside the store could see them through the window. Gilbert then pulled down the victim\u2019s undershorts and, telling the victim he wanted \u201cto see [his] erection,\u201d proceeded to touch the victim\u2019s scrotum and rub the victim\u2019s penis for more than five minutes. Unable to provoke an erection, Gilbert told the victim to pull his pants back up. After hugging the victim and telling him not to be embarrassed, Gilbert drove him home.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Upon learning from the victim what had happened, the victim\u2019s mother contacted the police. Gilbert admitted to the police that he had \u201ctouched the victim\u2019s penis, scrotum, and nipples.\u201d He also admitted that he had \u201cmanipulated\u201d the victim and that the victim had no \u201cidea what his intentions were when he took him into the back office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">A grand jury indicted Gilbert, charging that he, \u201ca person at least eighteen years of age who maintained a custodial or supervisory relationship over [the victim], a minor, did knowingly, and with lascivious intent, sexually abuse such child,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">At the conclusion of the evidence at trial, Gilbert moved to strike the charge, claiming the Commonwealth failed to prove he maintained a \u201ccustodial or supervisory\u201d relationship over the victim. The trial court denied the motion and convicted Gilbert of the crime charged, ruling that, although the evidence did not establish the existence of a \u201ccustodial\u201d relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ship, it did establish that Gilbert maintained a \u201csupervisory\u201d relationship over the victim at the time of the sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">On appeal, Gilbert contends the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to convict him under Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 because the Commonwealth failed to prove he maintained a \u201ccustodial or supervisory relationship\u201d over the victim within the meaning of the statute. Specifically, Gilbert argues, the mere fact he was the victim\u2019s employer was not sufficient to establish the existence of the statutorily required relationship. In support of this argument, he asserts that no precedential case in Virginia has \u201cextended the meaning of \u2018custodial or supervisory relationship\u2019 to include an employer\u201d or drawn a distinction between \u201ccustodial\u201d and \u201csupervisory\u201d in considering the nature of the relationship required under Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. Thus, Gilbert concludes, his employer-employee relationship with the victim did not bring him within the purview of the statute and the trial court erred in determining that such a relationship was a sufficient predicate for conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u201cWe review questions of law, and mixed questions of law and fact, utilizing a de novo standard of review.\u201d <em>Muhammad v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 451, 479, 611 S.E.2d 537, 553 (2005). In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, \u201cwe determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, the Commonwealth, and the reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence support each and every element of the charged offense.\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 145, 149-50, 521 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1999). We will affirm the conviction \u201cunless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Shackleford v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 196, 209, 547 S.E.2d 899, 906 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">The version of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1(A) in effect at the time of the charged offense provided, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Any person eighteen years of age or older who maintains a <em>custodial or supervisory relationship </em>over a child under the age of eighteen, including but not limited to the parent, step-parent, grandparent, step-grandparent, or who stands in loco parentis with respect to such child and is not legally married to such child, and who, with lascivious intent, knowingly and intentionally ... sexually abuses the child ..., shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u201cWhen the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language and may not assign the words a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually stated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Diaz, </em>266 Va. 260, 265, 585 S.E.2d 552, 554 (2003). Moreover, when \u201ca statute contains no express definition of a term, the general rule of statutory construction is to infer the legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the language used,\u201d in light of the context in which the term at issue is used. <em>Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. Partnership, </em>255 Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">As this Court has previously stated, \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-370.1 is clear and unambiguous in requiring proof of a \u2018custodial\u2019 <em>or </em>\u2018supervisory1 relationship over the victim.\u201d <em>Krampen v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 163, 167, 510 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1999) (emphasis added). The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in the statute between the terms \u201ccustodial\u201d and \u201csupervisory\u201d clearly indicates that proof of either a \u201ccustodial\u201d relationship or a \u201csupervisory\u201d relationship, or both, will satisfy the statute\u2019s relationship requirement. <em>See Chappelle v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 272, 275, 504 S.E.2d 378, 379 (1998) (\u201cBecause element six [of common law robbery] is constructed using the disjunctive \u2018or,\u2019 it is satisfied when a defendant instills fear in the heart of his victim, when he perpetrates violence against the victim, or both.\u201d). \u201cProof of both conditions is not necessary so long as one is present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hence, although, as Gilbert points out, this Court has dealt in the past almost exclusively with the \u201ccustodial\u201d aspect of Code \u00a7 18.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>370.1, <em>see, e.g., Guda v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 453, 592 S.E.2d 748 (2004); <em>DeAmicis v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 437, 524 S.E.2d 151 (2000) (en banc); <em>Krampen, </em>29 Va.App. 163, 510 S.E.2d 276, the statute clearly contemplates that a \u201csupervisory\u201d relationship alone may serve as a predicate to conviction under the statute. Indeed, to read the phrase \u201ccustodial or supervisory relationship\u201d as a \u201csingle descriptive term,\u201d as Gilbert urges, would require us to replace the phrase\u2019s disjunctive \u201cor\u201d with the conjunctive \u201cand,\u201d which we may not do. <em>See Barr v. Town &amp; Country Props., Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (\u201c \u2018Courts are not permitted to rewrite statutes. This is a legislative function.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 560, 566, 29 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1944))).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We turn next to the question whether, as the trial court determined, Gilbert\u2019s relationship over the victim constituted a \u201csupervisory relationship\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. The word \u201csupervisory\u201d is not defined in the statute. Thus, we \u201cmust give it its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 35, 531 S.E.2d 580, 593 (2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Pursuant to its common usage, the word \u201csupervisor\u201d means \u201ca person having authority delegated by an employer to hire, transfer, suspend, recall, promote, assign, or discharge another employee or to recommend such action.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2296 (1993). A \u201csupervisor\u201d is also defined as \u201c[o]ne having authority over others; a manager or overseer\u201d and \u201cany individual having authority to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, discipline, and handle grievances of other employees, by exercising independent judgment.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1479 (8th ed. 2004). As is evident from these definitions, having authority over an employee is the irrefutable mark of a \u201csupervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Here, the evidence established that Gilbert had authority over the employees at the bagel store, including the victim. As the co-owner and manager of the store, Gilbert was responsible for the hiring and firing of the store\u2019s employees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>creating the employees\u2019 work schedules, and directing the employees\u2019 work duties. Exercising that authority, Gilbert hired the victim, arranged for him to work alone at the store with Gilbert on Christmas day, maneuvered him into the store\u2019s back office on Christmas day, and sexually abused him. Gilbert admitted that he manipulated the victim and that the victim had no idea what Gilbert intended to do to him in the office that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">It may be reasonably concluded from this evidence that, as the victim\u2019s employer, Gilbert had authority over the victim when he sexually abused him at the store and was, thus, the victim\u2019s \u201csupervisor\u201d at the time. We conclude, therefore, that the evidence was sufficient, as a matter of law, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gilbert maintained a \u201csupervisory\u201d relationship over the victim within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 at the time of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">For these reasons, we hold that Gilbert\u2019s employer-employee relationship over the victim constituted a sufficient predicate for conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and Gilbert\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
