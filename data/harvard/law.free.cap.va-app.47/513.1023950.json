Carpitcher (\u201cCarpitcher\u201d) petitioned this Court for a Writ of Actual Innocence Based Upon Nonbiological Evidence pursuant to Chapter 19.3 of Title 19.2 of the Code of Virginia. Carpitcher claims he is innocent of aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>sexual battery, taking indecent liberties with a minor, and animate object sexual penetration, of which he was convicted in the Circuit Court of Roanoke County on August 30, 1999. Upon consideration of the petition, Carpitcher\u2019s memorandum in support of the petition, the Attorney General\u2019s response and motion to dismiss, Carpitcher\u2019s reply thereto, and the record, this Court remanded the matter to the trial court to certify findings of fact regarding factual issues in dispute. The trial court conducted a hearing in this matter and supplied this Court with its certified findings of fact. Upon consideration thereof, we dismiss the petition for failing to establish previously unknown or unavailable evidence sufficient to justify the issuance of the writ. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">On August 30, 1999, a jury convicted Carpitcher of aggravated sexual battery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(1), taking indecent liberties with a minor, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.3, and three counts of animate object sexual penetration, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2. The trial court imposed a prison sentence of 73 years, with 35 years suspended, resulting in an active sentence of 38 years in prison. Both this Court and the Virginia Supreme Court denied Carpitcher\u2019s petitions for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">All of the convictions arose out of Carpitcher\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of H.L., the ten-year-old daughter of his then-girlfriend. H.L., who was eleven years old when she testified at the jury trial, stated that Carpitcher \u2014 on at least three separate occasions \u2014 pulled down her underwear and penetrate ed her vagina with his finger. H.L. also testified that, on another occasion, she saw Carpitcher urinating, and he told her to come over and touch his penis. H.L. said that she did not tell her mother about these incidents because she had seen Carpitcher act violently towards her mother on at least two previous occasions. H.L. was the Commonwealth\u2019s only witness during the trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, thus, the jury predicated Carpitch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>er\u2019s convictions solely upon her testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">However, in March 2000, H.L. told her therapist \u2014 who had been pressing her for details about the sexual abuse \u2014 that she had fabricated those portions of her trial testimony dealing with the inappropriate touching. H.L. told the therapist that she created the story because she missed being able to spend time with her mother. Then, in April 2000, H.L. \u2014 who was still only eleven years old \u2014 wrote a letter to the governor, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Governor Gilmore,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">Well I guess my Mother has informed you about Aleck Carpitcher &amp; how I[ ] falsely accused him of wrongdoings. Well I just want to let everyone to know that I <em>am </em>sorry, but as you probably know I was only 9 years of age at the time so I <em>actually really </em>didn\u2019t know what exactly I was doing. I just thought that he would go away. I was wrong about that though! Well I hope this letter will help you with getting him out of prison. Thank you! Sincerely, [signature]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Later that same month, Carpitcher\u2019s trial counsel videotaped a statement by H.L. in which she said that, although Carpitcher had made an inappropriate sexual comment to her, he had never touched her inappropriately. During the interview, H.L. told Carpitcher\u2019s trial counsel that she was \u201ccoming forward now\u201d because her \u201cmom told [her] if [she] did not [she\u2019d] have to go live with [her] dad and [she] hate[s] living with [her] dad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>On October 30, 2000, H.L. signed a handwritten affidavit in which she stated that her \u201ctestimony given in court during the trials against [Carpitcher] was not true ... [he] did not touch me or do any of the things I said he did.\u201d In December 2001, H.L. signed a second affidavit in which she stated that she fabricated her allegations of sexual abuse because she had decided to force an end to Carpitcher\u2019s relationship with her mother. In the affidavit, H.L. further stated that her trial testimony was untrue and that she \u201ctried very hard to get him convicted\u201d so that she could return to live with her mother. On at least one occasion after she initially recanted her trial testimony, however, H.L. told her mother that the sexual abuse did, in fact, occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On January 3,2002, based on H.L.\u2019s recantation of her trial testimony, Carpitcher filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Roanoke County Circuit Court, alleging that he was innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. During the evidentiary hearing, H.L. testified that Carpitcher never touched her inappropriately, but she maintained that he had once asked her to touch his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In a letter opinion dated August 11, 2003, the circuit court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, holding that Rule 1:1 barred consideration of the actual innocence claim. <em>See Carpitcher v. Hinkle, </em>62 Va. Cir. 391, 395 (2003). The Virginia Supreme Court denied Carpitcher\u2019s petition for appeal in the state habeas proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">On November 29, 2004, Carpitcher filed in this Court a petition for a writ of actual innocence based upon newly-discovered non-biological evidence, contending that the \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence was H.L.\u2019s post-trial statement to Car-pitcher\u2019s attorney, in which H.L. asserted that her trial testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>mony was untrue. Carpitcher also alleged that H.L. had taken and passed a polygraph examination to \u201cprove\u201d that she had lied at trial and that Carpitcher had never touched her inappropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss Carpitcher\u2019s petition for a writ of actual innocence, alleging that the petition was unwarranted because it was questionable whether H.L.\u2019s recantation was, in fact, truthful. The Commonwealth also proffered an affidavit from Henry Bryant, owner of the home in which Carpitcher, H.L., and H.L.\u2019s mother lived.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the affidavit, Bryant asserts that Carpitcher had once told him that, if H.L. lived on a reservation, she would have already been \u201cbroke <em>in\u201d </em>\u2014 ie., would no longer have been a virgin. Bryant also stated that there were occasions during which Carpitcher and H.L. were left alone together.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The Commonwealth also proffered evidence that Carpitcher has a past record of statutory rape. Specifically, in one reported case from Oklahoma, an eighty-year-old woman, who had learned that Carpitcher was having sexual intercourse with her fourteen-year-old foster daughter, shot Carpitcher in the back. <em>See Garrett v. State, </em>586 P.2d 754, 755 (Okla.Crim. App.1978). Also, in February of 1982, Carpitcher was charged with the rape of a seventeen-year-old woman in Oklahoma. According to the Commonwealth\u2019s proffer, the charge was subsequently dropped at the request of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">After considering the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss, this Court ordered the circuit court to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to make findings of fact relating to the following two certified questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>1. Whether the victim in this case has recanted the testimony she gave at the trial in any material way with regard to the culpability of the petitioner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">2. If such material recantation of her trial testimony has taken place, whether or not such recantation is the product of duress, undue influence or inappropriate pressure from others?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">On June 27, 2005, the circuit court conducted an evidentiary hearing. During the hearing, H.L. testified that she had lied both during the criminal trial and during the state habeas proceeding, stating that Carpitcher had never committed any of the alleged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">As to the findings of fact relating to the first certified question, the circuit court found that, \u201con all three occasions when the juvenile victim was required to testify, she was a person to whom an oath was lawfully administered, and that she did, willfully, on at least two of those occasions, swear falsely to material matters or things involving one or more of the elements of the felonies for which the defendant was charged.\u201d The court further stated that, \u201c[hjaving testified differently about the same issues on three separate occasions, she is no longer credible.\u201d However, the trial court concluded that it \u201ccannot determine which, if any, of the three versions of her testimony is truthful.\u201d In other words, the court found that, although H.L. had lied on two of the three occasions that she testified, the court could not identify which of those three occasions was the one during which she was telling the truth. Moreover, the court held that \u201cnothing has been proven\u201d in terms of whether the recantation was actually true and, thus, whether H.L. perjured herself during the jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">As to the second certified question, the circuit court noted that, \u201c[djuring the past six years the juvenile victim has been questioned over and over again concerning the events surrounding the crimes for which defendant stands convicted.\u201d The court further observed that, \u201cNotwithstanding whatever inappropriate pressure those occurrences may have placed upon the child from the time she was 11 years old until now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>when she is 17 years old, her mother, who has never believed that her daughter was sexually abused, told her \u2018more times that [she] can remember,\u2019 that she was sick and tired of her daughter\u2019s lies and that if she didn\u2019t tell the truth about the defendant, she could pack her bags and go live with her father.\u201d Reasoning that \u201c[t]he infant victim was and is fearful of leaving her mother and she does not want to live with her father,\u201d and also noting that H.L. \u201cfalsely denied that her mother made those threatening statements to her,\u201d the court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">The infant victim was threatened, intimidated and coerced to comply with the various subtle, and not so subtle, demands that she change her trial testimony. A summary of her latest sworn testimony is that she did not materially recant her trial testimony because of undue influence, duress or inappropriate pressure from others. Her veracity is questionable. The Court cannot determine, under any evidentiary standard, the truthfulness of her most recent testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Following the issuance of the certified findings of fact, Carpitcher filed a \u201cBrief Regarding Certified Findings of Fact\u201d and an accompanying appendix, asserting that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact were erroneous and requesting oral argument before this Court. Three days later, Carpitcher filed a \u201cMotion for Leave to File Brief Regarding Certified Findings of Fact,\u201d alleging that further briefing is warranted because the trial court, \u201cin its consideration of the facts has implicitly imposed a higher burden of proof on Petitioner than is required by Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-327.19 [sic] <em>et seq.,\u201d </em>further contending that the findings of fact \u201care clearly erroneous and are inaccurate in many critical respects that will effect [sic] and undermine this Court\u2019s consideration of the issues and resolution of this case.\u201d In response, the Commonwealth filed a motion to strike, requesting that this Court both deny the motion for leave to file a supplemental brief and strike Carpitcher\u2019s \u201cBrief Regarding Certified Findings of Fact\u201d for failure to comply with the applicable procedural rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we grant the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to strike the supplemental briefing. And, because the record now before the Court provides an adequate basis upon which to resolve the merits of this case, we deny Carpitcher\u2019s motion for leave to file additional briefing, deny his request for oral argument, and dismiss the petition for a writ of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction over a petition for a writ of actual innocence. And, according to Rule 5A:5, \u201c[a]ll proceedings before the Court of Appeals pursuant to its original jurisdiction shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure prescribed by Rule 5:7 of the Rules of the Supreme Court____\u201d Rule 5A:5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nothing in Rule 5:7, however, authorizes a party to file a supplemental briefing without first obtaining leave of court. Rather, Rule 5:7 expressly provides that, after a petition and a responsive pleading (if ordered) have been filed, \u201c[fjurther proceedings shall be taken in accordance with the orders of this Court____\u201d Rule 5:7(e); <em>see also </em>Rule 5:7B(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Here, Carpiteher filed his supplemental brief before requesting leave to file additional briefing and, thus, without waiting for this Court to rule upon his motion. By filing a brief without first obtaining leave of court, Carpiteher violated Rule 5:7. Accordingly, we grant the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to strike Carpitcher\u2019s supplemental brief. <em>See, e.g., Lenz v. Warden of the Sussex I State Prison, </em>267 Va. 318, 325 n. 3, 593 S.E.2d 292, 296 n. 3 (2004) (noting that a \u201csupplemental brief\u2019 filed in a habeas proceeding \u201cwas rejected\u201d by order of the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">We must also decide, however, whether to grant Car-pitcher\u2019s motion for leave to file supplemental briefing. Nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ther the provisions of the actual innocence statute nor the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia address the circumstances under which this Court should permit the parties to file additional briefing in a case within the original jurisdiction of this Court. The decision to grant or deny a motion for leave to file supplemental briefing, therefore, lies in the discretion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Because the certified findings of fact issued by the trial court clearly resolve the merits of this petition, we conclude that neither additional briefing nor oral arguments would aid in the resolution of this case. Accordingly, we deny Carpitcher\u2019s motion for leave to file supplemental briefing, and we also deny his request for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-327.10 provides that any individual who is \u201cconvicted of a felony upon a plea of not guilty\u201d may file a petition for a writ of actual innocence in the Virginia Court of Appeals. The writ \u201cshall lie to the court that entered the conviction,\u201d and \u201cthat court shall have the authority to conduct hearings ... as directed by order from the Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>Id.) see also </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12 (providing that the Court of Appeals may order the circuit court to \u201cconduct a hearing\u201d and to issue \u201ccertified] findings of fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">According to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11, the petition for a writ of actual innocence must allege, <em>inter alia, </em>that the newly-discovered evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">(1) \u201cwas previously unknown or unavailable to the petitioner or his trial attorney of record at the time the conviction became final in the circuit court,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(iv),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">(2) \u201cis such as could not, by the exercise of diligence, have been discovered or obtained before the expiration of 21 days following entry of the final order of conviction by the court,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vi),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">(3) \u201cis material and when considered with all of the other evidence in the current record will prove that no rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">(4) \u201cis not merely cumulative, corroborative or collateral,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2 \u2014 327.11(A)(viii).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The petitioner must prove each of these four elements by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13. And, if the petitioner fails to carry his burden of proof, this Court \u201cshall ... dismiss the petition for failure to establish previously unknown or unavailable evidence sufficient to justify the issuance of the writ.\u201d Id.; <em>see also In re Bowling, </em>46 Va.App. 50, 55, 615 S.E.2d 489, 491 (2005); <em>In re Dicks, </em>46 Va.App. 44, 47, 614 S.E.2d 677, 678 (2005); <em>In re Barron, </em>44 Va.App. 536, 540, 605 S.E.2d 777, 779 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Of the four elements listed above, only the third is at issue in this case. Specifically, we must determine whether Car-pitcher has carried his burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the victim\u2019s recantation of her testimony is \u201cmaterial\u201d and, thus, renders the Commonwealth\u2019s case so tenuous that, had the recantation been produced at trial, <em>\u201cno </em>rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">This Court has never addressed whether a victim\u2019s recantation, standing alone, is sufficient to justify issuance of a writ of actual innocence. However, we begin our analysis with a well-settled legal principle: A verdict resulting from a trial, during which the evidence has been tested by the adversarial process, is presumed to be correct, and, thus, a heavy burden is placed upon those seeking to overturn it. <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>262 Va. 661, 669, 553 S.E.2d 760, 764 (2001) (\u201cAs we explained in <em>Justis v. Young, </em>202 Va. 631, 632, 119 S.E.2d 255, 256-57 (1961), the circuit court\u2019s judgment is presumptively correct and the burden is on the appellant to present a sufficient record to permit a determination whether the circuit court committed an alleged error.\u201d); see <em>also McDonald v. Nat\u2019l Enters., Inc., </em>262 Va. 184, 195, 547 S.E.2d 204, 211 (2001); <em>White v. Morano, </em>249 Va. 27, 30, 452 S.E.2d 856, 858 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>(1995); <em>Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>85 Va.App. 286, 296-97, 544 S.E.2d 870, 875-76 (2001). We further note that, in the context of other cases in which a petitioner has sought post-conviction relief based upon the recantation of a witness\u2019 testimony, the Virginia Supreme Court has observed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agj\">\u2018While discovery after trial, brought to the attention of the court in due time, that false testimony with respect to material facts has been given by a witness for the prosecution may constitute ground for a new trial, recantation by a State\u2019s witness does not necessarily entitle the accused to a new trial. The opportunity and temptation for fraud are so obvious that courts look with suspicion upon such an asserted repudiation of the testimony of a witness for the prosecution, and this is so even though the repudiation be sworn to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><em>Font v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 184, 192, 98 S.E.2d 817, 823 (1957) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 612, 625, 70 S.E.2d 293, 301 (1952)). As one court has commented, \u201c[t]here is no form of proof so unreliable as recanting testimony. In the popular mind it is often regarded as of great importance[, but] [t]hose experienced in the administration of the criminal law know well its untrustworthy character.\u201d <em>People v. Shilitano, </em>218 N.Y. 161, 112 N.E. 733, 736 (1916); <em>see also Dobbert v. Wainwright, </em>468 U.S. 1231, 1233-34, 105 S.Ct. 34, 35-36, 82 L.Ed.2d 925 (1984) (Brennan, J., dissenting from denial of application for stay of execution); <em>Hysler v. Florida, </em>315 U.S. 411, 413, 62 S.Ct. 688, 689-90, 86 L.Ed. 932 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Accordingly, where a witness\u2019 recantation is used to collaterally attack a conviction, \u201c[t]here must be clear and convincing proof that the witness testified falsely at the trial, <em>and not merely proof that by reason of conflicting statements his testimony is unworthy of belief.\u201d Lewis, </em>193 Va. at 626, 70 S.E.2d at 302 (emphasis added). The controlling inquiry, then, is not merely whether the recantation was true, but whether, considering the recantation in light of all the other evidence, the conviction was predicated upon perjured testimony. <em>See Ortega v. Duncan, </em>333 F.3d 102, 104, 107 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>To prove the materiality of the recantation, the petitioner must therefore establish either: (1) that the recantation is true, or (2) if the recantation is not true, that the witness\u2019 lack of credibility, when considered along with all the evidence in the case, establishes that the trial testimony was perjured. <em>See id.; see also Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>133 Va. 741, 756, 112 S.E. 657, 661 (1922) (holding that, where a witness recants her trial testimony, a new trial is warranted only if \u201cthe court has evidence before it which establishes the ... perjury or mistake, in such a clear and convincing manner as to leave no room for doubt\u201d). Where the evidence merely proves that the witness made conflicting statements and, therefore, \u201cspoke falsely on one occasion,\u201d the recantation is insufficient to justify post-conviction relief because it does not, standing alone, \u201cestablish that his testimony at the trial was false and the statements in the subsequent affidavit were true.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>193 Va. at 626, 70 S.E.2d at 302 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Thus, for H.L.\u2019s recantation to be deemed \u201cmaterial,\u201d such that it \u201cwould\u201d produce a different result in another trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Carpitcher must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that H.L. perjured herself at trial. <em>See Lewis, </em>193 Va. at 626, 70 S.E.2d at 302 (\u201cThere must be clear and convincing proof that the witness testified falsely at the trial____\u201d). Carpitcher may carry his burden of proof either by establishing that the recantation is true, <em>see, e.g., State v. Eder, </em>78 Wash.App. 352, 899 P.2d 810, 811 (1995) (&lt;cWe hold that recantation testimony, in the form of newly discovered evidence, warrants [post-conviction relief] only if it is material; [and] it is material only if it is true ...\u201d), or by establishing that H.L.\u2019s lack of credibility, when considered along with all of the other evidence in the case, demonstrates that her trial testimony was perjured.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">It is well settled that the truthfulness of a recantation is a question of fact to be resolved by the trial court. <em>See State v.

He has the benefit of observing the witnesses at the time of the trial, is able to appraise the variable weight to be given to their subsequent affidavits, and can often discern and assay the incidents, the influences, and the motives that prompted the recantation. He is, therefore, best qualified to determine what credence or consideration should be given to the retraction, and his opinion is accordingly entitled to great weight. If the rule were otherwise, the right of new trial would depend on the vagaries and vacillations of witnesses rather than upon a soundly exercised discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><em>Taylor v.

Wynn, </em>178 Wash. 287, 34 P.2d 900, 901 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, the circuit court, in its certified findings of fact, expressly found that, although H.L. \u201cis no longer credible,\u201d Carpitcher did not prove \u201cwhich, if any, of the three versions of her testimony is truthful.\u201d Similarly, the circuit court held that it \u201ccannot determine ... the truthfulness of her most recent testimony,\u201d and that \u201cnothing has been proven\u201d in terms of whether the recantation was actually true. This finding is supported by evidence in the record, specifically, the inconsistencies in H.L.\u2019s post-trial recantations as well as the evidence tending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>to establish that, at least briefly, H.L. recanted her recantation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Because this Court gives \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the circuit court\u2019s certified findings of fact, we hold that Carpitcher did not carry his burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the \u201cstatements in the subsequent affidavit were true.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>193 Va. at 626, 70 S.E.2d at 302. Accordingly, the recantation \u2014 standing alone \u2014 is insufficient to establish that H.L. committed perjury during the original criminal trial. <em>Cf. Borgess, </em>455 So.2d at 490 (holding that the trial court did not err in denying a motion for a new trial where a child victim of sexual abuse recanted her testimony but the trial court \u201cwas not satisfied that the recanting testimony was true,\u201d reasoning that \u201cthe trial judge was in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the child\u2019s conflicting stories\u201d and that the trial court was not \u201crequired to find that the true version was the one told at the post trial hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">B. <em>Whether H.L. Committed Perjury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Although Carpitcher has not carried his burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that H.L.\u2019s recantation of her trial testimony is true, the circuit court also found that \u201c[h]aving testified differently about the same issues on three separate occasions, [H.L.] is no longer credible.\u201d Thus, Carpitcher may carry his burden of proving the materiality of the recantation if he establishes that H.L.\u2019s newly-discovered lack of credibility, when considered along with all of the other evidence in the case, demonstrates that her \u201ctestimony at the trial was false____\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>193 Va. at 626, 70 S.E.2d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Here, other than the recantation, there is no additional evidence tending to establish that H.L. perjured herself during trial. Although H.L. had an alleged motive to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>perjury (specifically, to end the relationship between Carpitcher and her mother), the existence of a motive to lie does not establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the witness did, in fact, perjure herself during the criminal trial. Indeed, evidence of H.L.\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d to lie was introduced during H.L.\u2019s cross-examination during the original criminal trial and was, therefore, implicitly rejected by the jury. Also, as noted by the Commonwealth, there is additional evidence, discovered post-trial, that tends to corroborate H.L.\u2019s trial testimony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Considering, as the trial court found in its certified findings of fact, that the victim was \u201cthreatened, intimidated and coerced to comply with the various subtle, and not so subtle, demands that she change her trial testimony,\u201d a reasonable fact finder could disregard the recantation and conclude that the victim, during her initial trial testimony, was telling the truth. Accordingly, the recantation, standing alone, is insufficient to prove that H.L.\u2019s trial testimony was perjured. <em>See United States v. Rouse, </em>410 F.3d 1005, 1009 (8th Cir.2005) (affirming denial of motion for a new trial where the child victims, who recanted their trial testimony, \u201chad been living with their mothers for at least two years,\u201d and \u201c[t]hese women never believed the children\u2019s accusations, and testified on the defendants\u2019 behalf at trial\u201d); <em>U.S. v. Provost, </em>969 F.2d 617, 621 (8th Cir.1992) (affirming denial of a new trial where \u201cthe district court found that [the child victim\u2019s] recantation was influence by family pressures\u201d and that \u201cher recantation was not credible\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Nicholson, </em>170 W.Va. 701, 296 S.E.2d 342, 345 (1982) <em>(per </em>curiam) (affirming denial of a motion for a new trial where the court \u201cd[id] not believe that there is even a remote possibility that the jury would find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>recanting affidavits and subsequent testimony any more believable than the original trial testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">For these reasons, we hold that Carpitcher has failed to carry his burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the recantation is truthful, and that, had the inconsistent statement been produced during trial, \u201cno rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii).

There were inconsistencies in H.L.\u2019s statements to the police officers regarding what she was wearing and what was on TV at the time of the alleged incidents. Because Carpitcher\u2019s trial counsel decided that he was not going to \u201cbeat up\u201d on the victim or \"nit pick\u201d at her story, however, these inconsistencies were not brought out during H.L.'s cross-examination.

After the petition was filed, Virginia enacted the actual innocence statute, Code \u00a7 19.2-327.10 <em>et seq. </em>Thus, in January of 2005, the federal court dismissed the habeas petition, reasoning that Carpitcher\u2019s state remedies were not exhausted because Carpitcher had not yet petitioned for a writ of actual innocence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\">.

Although many jurisdictions seem to end the inquiry upon determining that the recantation is false, the more appropriate approach requires the appellate court to also consider whether the witness\u2019 lack of credibility (as established by the false recantation) tends to also establish that the witness perjured herself at trial. <em>See, e.g., Lewis, </em>193 Va. at 626, 70 S.E.2d at 302; <em>see also Ortega, </em>333 F.3d at 104-07; <em>State v.
