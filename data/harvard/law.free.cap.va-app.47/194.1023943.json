ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The trial court found Nicholas Ohin, a convicted felon, guilty of possession of a concealed weapon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-808.2. Ohin appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by not granting his motion to strike. We find no error and affirm Ohm\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">While patrolling a \u201chigh drug, high crime\u201d area of Newport News, police officers made a traffic stop of a vehicle. Standing on a nearby sidewalk, Ohin disrupted the investigation by shouting to the driver of the vehicle. One of the officers noticed Ohin conspicuously placing his hands in his pockets. The officer told Ohin to keep his hands in view, but Ohin refused to do so. Having removed \u201cseveral guns and weapons\u201d from individuals in this area before, the officer asked Ohin if he \u201chad any weapons on him.\u201d Ohin said he did not. The officer then requested and obtained consent to search Ohin. As the officer approached to search him, Ohin pulled a concealed knife out of his pants pocket. The officer later determined that Ohin was a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">A grand jury charged Ohin with violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. At trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the arresting officer. The officer said he did not know what \u201ctype of knife\u201d he took from Ohin, but described it as having a \u201cside-folding, locking blade.\u201d He explained that the lock fixed the blade in the open position until manually released. Acknowledging he was \u201cnot an expert on knives,\u201d the officer stated he would not identify the knife as a bowie knife, dirk, switchblade, ballistic, or butterfly knife. He did agree it was a type of \u201cvery large\u201d poeketknife.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Ohin\u2019s knife was introduced into evidence for the trial judge, as factfinder, to examine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The knife has several distinctive features, all obvious from a visual inspection. The metal hilt of the knife has a cross-guard to protect the hand from sliding forward during a thrusting motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Measuring <em>1% </em>inches, the cross-guard extends perpendicularly to the handle. The oversized hilt has notched indentations to enhance finger grip. On both sides of the hilt appears a raised metal relief of an oriental dragon. The knife blade comes to a point and has a serrated cutting edge. The blade locks securely in place when extended. It can be retracted only when manually unlocked. The total length of the knife, when locked in an extended position, is 8 inches. Of that length, the blade takes up 3j\u00e9 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Ohin moved to strike the evidence on the ground that his knife \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 did not fit the statutory definition of a concealed weapon. It was nothing more than a common poeketknife, Ohin argued. After the trial court denied the motion, Ohin elected to present no evidence and to renew his motion. The court found against Ohin, holding that the knife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>though not one of the specifically enumerated weapons, was a weapon of \u201clike kind\u201d because of its physical properties\u2014 particularly its \u201chilt like a sword.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The trial court found Ohin guilty of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), which makes it a Class 6 felony for a felon \u201cto knowingly and intentionally carry about his person, hidden from common observation, any weapon described in subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-808.\u201d The concealed weapon statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A), lists various prohibited weapons, including \u201cany dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, ballistic knife, machete, razor, slingshot, spring stick, metal knucks, or blackjack\u201d and \u201cany weapon of like kind as those enumerated\u201d in the statute. <em>See generally O\u2019Banion v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 47, 57-58, 531 S.E.2d 599, 604 (2000) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">As the Virginia Supreme Court has explained, the \u201cpurpose of the statute was to interdict the practice of carrying a deadly weapon about the person, concealed, and yet so accessible as to afford prompt and immediate use.\u201d <em>Schaaf v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 429, 430, 258 S.E.2d 574, 574-75 (1979) (quoting <em>Sutherland v. Commonwealth, </em>109 Va. 834, 835-36, 65 S.E. 15,15 (1909)). To achieve this purpose, the General Assembly listed knives commonly used as fighting weapons. Dirks and bowie knives, for example, make useful \u201cstabbing\u201d weapons. <em>O\u2019Banion, </em>33 Va.App. at 58 n. 2, 531 S.E.2d at 604 n. 2. They have fixed blades and often, like small swords or stilettos, have cross-guards to protect the hand from sliding onto the blade during a thrust. The bowie knife has only one sharpened side, but the other side curves into a point useful for piercing. <em>See id. </em>While technically a folding \u201cpocketknife,\u201d <em>id., </em>a switchblade is also prohibited as it locks into a fixed position for fighting purposes. It too sometimes has a small cross-guard on its hilt for hand protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The General Assembly, however, did not provide an exhaustive list of fighting knives. Added to those specifically mentioned is a nonspecific category for \u201cweapons of like kind.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(v). To fit within this category, a knife \u201cmust first be a weapon.\u201d <em>Delcid v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 14, 17-18, 526 S.E.2d 273, 275 (2000). As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">Common experience teaches that bladed instruments may be possessed and used for non-aggressive as well as aggressive purposes. In the former instance, they are deemed implements; in the latter, weapons. Any given bladed instrument may fall into either category or both, depending on the circumstances and purpose surrounding its possession and use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\"><em>Id. </em>This focus on a knife\u2019s weapon-like properties excludes \u201cfrom concealed weapons statutes innocuous household and industrial knives which may be carried for legitimate purposes.\u201d <em>Richards v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 242, 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d 177, 179 n. 2 (1994). Thus, a schoolboy\u2019s common pocketknife would necessarily fall outside the reach of the statute. <em>See Wood ex rel. Wood v. Henry County Pub. Sch., </em>255 Va. 85, 95, 495 S.E.2d 255, 261 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">A \u201cweapon of like kind\u201d includes a knife that, while not possessing the exact physical properties of the enumerated knives, has the characteristics of a fighting knife just the same. A butterfly knife, for example, is a locking pocketknife that folds into a two-part hinged handle. Its unusual handle does not resemble any of the knives listed in the statute. But its utility as a fighting weapon makes it a \u201clike kind\u201d weapon under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(v). <em>Delcid, </em>32 Va.App. at 18, 526 S.E.2d at 275. In particular, its \u201cfixed blade, sharp point, and single-sharpened edge afford unquestionable utility as a stabbing weapon, useful in the same manner as a dagger, stiletto, or dirk.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Whether a knife\u2019s fighting qualities make it a \u201cweapon of like kind\u201d involves \u201ca question of fact determined by the trier of fact according to the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>18 Va.App. at 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d at 179 n. 2; <em>see also Delcid, </em>32 Va.App. at 17, 526 S.E.2d at 274 (holding that the question whether a particular knife is a \u201cweapon of like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>kind\u201d is \u201ca question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact\u201d). We can overturn this factual determination only if it is \u201cplainly wrong\u201d or \u201cwithout evidence to support it.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-680.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In this case, Ohin\u2019s knife is not a common poeketknife as he claims it to be. It has physical features making it similar to several of the prohibited knives listed in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(ii) and dissimilar to the kinds of \u201cinnocuous household and industrial knives which may be carried for legitimate purposes.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>18 Va.App. at 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d at 179 n. 2. Ohin\u2019s knife has a \u201chilt like a sword,\u201d as the trial judge described it. This hilt includes a cross-guard to improve the stabbing capability of the knife by protecting the hand during the thrusting motion. The same can be said for the oversized, notched handle \u2014 a feature that enhances the user\u2019s grip. These physical properties make the knife of \u201clike kind\u201d to the dirk and the switchblade, given that both are designed primarily for stabbing motions. The knife\u2019s substantial hilt and cross-guard make it quite unlike a common poeketknife, kitchen carving knife, or other type of non-fighting blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Ohin\u2019s knife blade also locks securely when opened, much like a switchblade or a butterfly knife, and can be retracted only when unlocked. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Banion, </em>33 Va.App. at 60, 531 S.E.2d at 605 (noting that a \u201cretractable blade that can be locked into place\u201d gives a knife a weapon-like quality). The blade comes to a point like a bowie knife, with one side sharpened and the other side shaped with a concave curvature. This blade design likewise improves the knife\u2019s fighting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>capabilities. What was said about the butterfly knife in <em>Delcid </em>can be said also about Ohin\u2019s knife: It has a \u201cfixed blade, sharp point, and single-sharpened edge\u201d affording it \u201cunquestionable utility as a stabbing weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 526 S.E.2d at 275; <em>see also Richards, </em>18 Va.App. at 246, 448 S.E.2d at 179 (finding on \u201cexamination of the weapon\u2019s blade\u201d it was a \u201cweapon of like kind\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In sum, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual finding that Ohin\u2019s knife constitutes a \u201cweapon of like kind\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(v). We affirm Ohin\u2019s conviction, finding no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to strike the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\">.
