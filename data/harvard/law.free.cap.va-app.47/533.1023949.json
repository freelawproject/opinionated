Robinson and Elisa K. Robinson (collectively, \u201cthe Robinsons\u201d) appeal their multiple convictions for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371. Elisa Robinson contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress, reasoning that, because the investigating police officer was located in the curtilage of their home when he witnessed the illicit activity, the resulting search violated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. George Robinson, in contrast, argues that, although the police officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment when he initially entered the premises, the officer lacked the exigent circumstances necessary to permit his further intrusion onto the property. For the following reasons, we disagree with both appellants\u2019 arguments and, therefore, affirm their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In accord with our usual standard of review, on the appeal of a denial of a motion to suppress, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences flowing from the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>Garcia v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 184, 189, 578 S.E.2d 97, 99 (2008); <em>Sabo v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 63, 69, 561 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2002). So viewed, the evidence in this case establishes the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">On August 16, 2002, the Albemarle County Police Department received three separate telephone calls reporting an alleged underage drinking party at the Robinsons\u2019 home. Corporal Scott Cox was dispatched to investigate these allegations, and he arrived at the Robinsons\u2019 home at approximately 11:00 p.m. From the state road in front of the house, Officer Cox saw between ten and twenty cars parked on the state road, and he also saw two or three cars parked on the left-hand side of the driveway. From that position, Officer Cox could also see the house, the front porch, the front door, and the front yard, although he could not see the backyard or the end of the driveway. The floodlights above the front door were turned on, and the lights along the sidewalk leading to the front door were also illuminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Officer Cox, who was driving a marked police car -with its headlights on, \u201cgot on the radio\u201d and told the other officers in the area to \u201cstart heading this way\u201d because \u201c[i]t appears that there\u2019s a party.\u201d Officer Cox then turned into the driveway and started to drive towards the house. Almost immediately after pulling into the driveway, Officer Cox saw several additional parked vehicles near the right side of the driveway, as well as \u201cseveral parked vehicles near the side of the house.\u201d Officer Cox continued up the driveway in his police car. From his position inside the police car, he began to see some \u201cactivity\u201d in the backyard. Before reaching the point where the walkway to the front door intersects with the Robinsons\u2019 driveway, Officer Cox saw two individuals holding clear beer bottles. The individuals, both of whom appeared to be under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>age, were standing by a pine tree about seven or eight yards away from Officer Cox\u2019s police car. The two juveniles \u201clooked at [Officer Cox], looked at the house, yelled \u2018cops,\u2019 dropped the beer bottles, and ran down a fence line toward the woods.\u201d Officer Cox then pulled his police vehicle behind a car parked by the garage, and he looked to his left. From that vantage point, \u201c[h]e saw juveniles running toward the woods.\u201d Also, \u201c[h]e could see a patio table covered with beer bottles and noticed beer bottles strewn about the backyard.\u201d Officer Cox got out of his car, \u201cyelled for people to stop running, and radioed other officers who were waiting off the property that kids were running east into the woods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">After radioing the other officers, Officer Cox proceeded into the backyard \u201cto look for the juvenile host.\u201d According to Officer Cox, he went into the backyard because he \u201c[w]anted to find out what was going on, [and] find out who the people were that were running away,\u201d because he \u201cwas worried for their safety.\u201d After speaking with one of the party attendees, Officer Cox then \u201cwalk[ed] up to the back door of [the] house\u201d and knocked on a clear glass sliding door. From outside the residence, he could see \u201ctwo adults sitting at the kitchen table.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The Robinsons were arrested, and each was charged with nineteen counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Both parties filed a motion to suppress, contending that Officer Cox was unlawfully present on their property when he viewed the illicit activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">During the suppression hearing, Officer Cox testified that his police car was next to a bush planted by the front sidewalk when he \u201cclearly\u201d saw \u201ctwo male juveniles standing on the other side of the tree holding beer bottles.\u201d To clarify the position in the driveway from which the officer observed the juveniles, the trial court asked Officer Cox, \u201cSo you were at the bush when you saw the two individuals?\u201d Officer Cox responded, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">By letter opinion dated August 4, 2003, the trial court held that Officer Cox \u201cplanned to enter the property to investigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the allegations of underage consumption of alcohol.\u201d The trial court also observed that, \u201c[a]s Cox went down the driveway, he could not see the backyard or the garage,\u201d but that \u201c[h]e could see the house, the front yard, and the front porch.\u201d Additionally, the trial court found that \u201c[t]here were no signs posted\u201d \u2014 such as a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign \u2014 at the entrance to the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Based on this evidence, the trial court found that the Robinsons\u2019 driveway was not part of the curtilage of the house and, therefore, concluded that \u201cCox\u2019s presence there [did] not implicate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d The court additionally held that Officer Cox\u2019s presence in the Robinsons\u2019 driveway was justified by the officer\u2019s right to conduct a \u201cknock and talk,\u201d that is, to approach a home and knock on the front door to speak with an occupant. Under either of the preceding rationales, the trial court concluded that \u201cCox was in a lawful place in the driveway\u201d when he observed the two juveniles drinking beer, and his observations were therefore admissible pursuant to the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. Finally, the trial court concluded that Officer Cox\u2019s entry into the backyard was justified because he had both probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed and exigent circumstances \u201cgiven the likelihood of evidence being destroyed and juveniles running away.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court denied the Robinsons\u2019 motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The trial court convicted each appellant of nine counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Both parties appealed their convictions to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">On appeal, a three-judge panel, with one judge dissenting, affirmed the Robinsons\u2019 convictions. <em>See Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 592, 612 S.E.2d 751 (2005). The panel majority reasoned that, although the driveway was part of the curtilage of the home, Officer Cox\u2019s presence did not violate any reasonable expectation of privacy, and, therefore, his conduct did not implicate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>By orders dated June 21, 2005, this Court granted the Robin-sons\u2019 petitions for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandates of the panel opinion. <em>See Elisa Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 24, 614 S.E.2d 667 (2005); <em>George Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 23, 614 S.E.2d 667 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">During the <em>en banc </em>oral arguments, the Commonwealth conceded that Officer Cox was located on the curtilage of the Robinsons\u2019 home when he observed the unlawful activity. Accordingly, this question \u2014 which was in dispute before the three-judge panel, <em>see Robinson, </em>45 Va.App. at 604-07, 612 S.E.2d at 757-58 \u2014 is no longer at issue on appeal. However, the Commonwealth maintains that, although Officer Cox intruded upon the curtilage, he did not violate the Fourth Amendment because, for the reasons stated in the majority panel opinion, the Robinsons lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area from which he viewed the illegal activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Also during the <em>en banc </em>oral arguments, George Robinson conceded that he lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in their driveway on the night in question. He argues, however, that the officer\u2019s further intrusion onto the property was unconstitutional, reasoning that the officer \u2014 once his suspicions of underage drinking had been validated \u2014 should have left the property or otherwise secured the premises and then obtained a search warrant. This argument was not previously raised before the three-judge panel and, thus, was not addressed in the panel opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Elisa Robinson, in contrast, continues to maintain that she possessed a reasonable expectation of privacy in the driveway and, thus, argues that Officer Cox violated the Fourth Amendment when he entered the property without a warrant. However, Elisa Robinson concedes that, if the officer was legitimately present on the premises when he witnessed the illegal activity, the officer\u2019s further intrusion onto the property was justified because the officer possessed the requisite exigent circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Although \u201c \u2018[w]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them,\u2019 ... we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of legal standards ... to the particular facts of the case.\u201d <em>McCracken v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 254, 258, 572 S.E.2d 493, 495 (2002) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc)) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). Further, \u201c[i]n reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018the burden is upon [the appellant] to show that the ruling ... constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee, </em>25 Va.App. at 197, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we hold that, contrary to Elisa Robinson\u2019s position, Officer Cox did not violate the Fourth Amendment when he drove up the driveway of the Robinsons\u2019 home. We further hold that, contrary to George Robinson\u2019s position, once the officer observed the teenagers fleeing from the backyard, his further intrusion onto the property was permissible pursuant to the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. Accordingly, we affirm both parties\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">A. <em>Elisa Robinson: Implied Consent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>Elisa Robinson<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> maintains that Officer Cox violated the Fourth Amendment when he entered the driveway of the property without first obtaining a search warrant. Initially, we agree that, \u201cabsent (1) exigent circumstances and probable cause or (2) consent, law enforcement agents cannot enter the curtilage of a person\u2019s home either to search or seize without previously obtaining a warrant.\u201d <em>Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 1, 16, 497 S.E.2d 474, 481 (1998). Although Officer Cox possessed neither probable cause nor exigent circumstances which would justify a search when he initially entered the property, we hold that, on the night in question, Robinson impliedly consented to have members of the public \u2014 including police officers \u2014 enter the premises in an attempt to contact the residents of that property. Because Officer Cox had not exceeded the scope of this implied consent when he viewed the illicit activity, we affirm her convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">It is generally recognized that, absent any affirmative attempts to discourage trespassers, owners or possessors of private property impliedly consent to have members of the general public intrude upon certain, limited areas of their property. As we have noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201cPeople commonly have different expectations, whether considered or not, for the access areas of their premises than they do for more secluded areas. Thus, we do not place things of a private nature on our front porches that we may very well entrust to the seclusion of a backyard, patio or deck. In the course of urban life, we have come to expect various members of the public to enter upon such a driveway, e.g., brush salesmen, newspaper boys, postmen, Girl Scout cookie sellers, distressed motorists, neighbors, friends. Any one of them may be reasonably expected to report observations of criminal activity to the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><em>Shaver v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 789, 796, 520 S.E.2d 393, 397 (1999) (quoting <em>State v. Corbett, </em>15 Or.App. 470, 516 P.2d 487, 490 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\"> This invitation, where it exists, extends only to those areas of the property that would be used when approaching the residence in an ordinary attempt to speak with the occupants. <em>See id. </em>Thus, areas of the curtilage that a visitor could reasonably be expected to cross when approaching the front door \u2014 for example, the driveway, front sidewalk, and front porch \u2014 are generally exempted from Fourth Amendment protection. <em>See, e.g., State v. Clark, </em>124 Idaho 308, 859 P.2d 344, 349 (1993) (\u201cThere is an implied invitation for the public to use access routes to the house, such as parking areas, driveways, sidewalks, or pathways to the entry, and there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy as to observations which can be made from such areas.\u201d). As a result, if the property owner has impliedly consented to have members of the public use a particular \u201cpath\u201d when attempting to access his home, he has waived any reasonable expectation of privacy in areas of the curtilage associated with that \u201cpath.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">By extension, the same implied consent is extended to police officers who enter the curtilage and, while on the premises, restrict their conduct to those activities reasonably contemplated by the homeowner. <em>See Shaver, </em>30 Va.App. at 796, 520 S.E.2d at 397 (\u201c \u2018If one has a reasonable expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>that various members of society may enter the property in their personal or business pursuits, he should find it equally likely that the police will do so.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Corbett, </em>516 P.2d at 490)); <em>see also State v. Cada, </em>129 Idaho 224, 923 P.2d 469, 477 (1996) (\u201c[T]he direct access routes to the house, including parking areas, driveways and pathways to the entry, are areas to which the public is impliedly invited, and [ ] police officers restricting their activity to such areas are permitted the same intrusion and the same level of observation as would be expected from a \u2018reasonably respectful citizen.\u2019\u201d); <em>State v. Gabbard, </em>129 Or.App. 122, 877 P.2d 1217, 1221 (1994) (\u201cAn officer\u2019s right to go to the front door of a house is based on implied consent to allow visitors to take reasonable steps to make contact with the occupant.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201c[w]hen police enter onto private property ... and restrict their entry to places that other visitors would be expected to go, such as walkways, driveways, or porches, any observation made from these areas is permissible under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Trimble v. State, </em>816 N.E.2d 83, 88 (Ind.Ct.App.2004); <em>see also State v. Maxfield, </em>125 Wash.2d 378, 886 P.2d 123, 134 (1994) (\u201cIf a law enforcement officer or agent does not go beyond the area of the residence that is impliedly open to the public, such as the driveway, the walkway, or an access route leading to the residence, no privacy interest is invaded.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The landowner\u2019s implied consent is generally presumed to exist absent evidence of an affirmative intent to exclude the public from the premises. <em>See, e.g., People v. Kozlowski, </em>69 N.Y.2d 761, 513 N.Y.S.2d 101, 505 N.E.2d 611, 612 (1987) (\u201cAbsent evidence of intent to exclude the public, the entryway to a person\u2019s house offers implied permission to approach and knock on the front door.\u201d); <em>State v. Somfleth, </em>168 Or.App. 414, 8 P.3d 221, 227 (2000) (\u201cA homeowner can abrogate the presumption of implied consent to approach the front door by undertaking sufficient steps to exclude casual visitors from the front yard.\u201d). Here, then, we must consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>whether, under the totality of the circumstances, Robinson affirmatively intended to exclude members of the public from her premises. <em>See generally State v. Wyatt, </em>131 Idaho 562, 961 P.2d 653, 656 (1998) (\u201cThe determination whether a particular citizen had a legitimate expectation of privacy depends upon the unique facts of each case. We therefore examine the citizen\u2019s efforts to protect his own privacy from observation by the general public, taking into account norms of social conduct and the nature of the premises.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Factors that may be particularly relevant to this determination include, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) whether the homeowner has erected any physical barriers, such as gates or fences, across the entrance to the property, and (2) whether the homeowner has posted signs, such as \u201cno trespassing\u201d or \u201cprivate property\u201d signs, indicating a desire to exclude the public from the premises. <em>See, e.g., State v. Christensen, </em>131 Idaho 143, 953 P.2d 583 (1998) (no implied invitation to enter where the entrance to the driveway was obstructed by a closed gate posted with a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign); <em>State v. Pacheco, </em>101 S.W.3d 913, 919 (Mo.Ct.App.2003); <em>State v. McIntyre, </em>123 Or.App. 436, 860 P.2d 299, 301 (1993) (\u201c[C]ourts must consider all surrounding circumstances, including the existence of a fence, to determine the residents\u2019 intent.\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>State v. Ridgway, </em>57 Wash.App. 915, 790 P.2d 1268, 1265 (1990) (holding that marijuana recovered from doorstep should have been suppressed because police observed the marijuana after walking around a closed gate and evading guard dogs while approaching the house).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Here, Robinson did not erect any physical barriers barring entry onto her property. There were no gates, fences, wires, highway cones, or other obstacles indicating that members of the public were not welcome to use the driveway and front sidewalk in an effort to speak with the occupants of the premises. Nor did she post any signs indicating that the public in general \u2014 or police officers in particular \u2014 were not welcome to enter the property and approach the front door. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that, on the night in question, Robinson impliedly consented to have members of the general public \u2014 including law enforcement officers \u2014 enter the driveway and front sidewalk of her premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Although we hold that Robinson extended an implied invitation to the public to enter her property and approach the front door, we must also consider whether Officer Cox\u2019s conduct on the night of the party exceeded the scope of that implied consent. Ultimately, whether the officer exceeded the scope of the implied consent \u201ccannot be determined by a fixed formula,\u201d but must instead \u201cbe based on the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>People v. Thompson, </em>221 Cal. App.3d 923, 270 Cal.Rptr. 863,874 (1990).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\u201c[U]nder normal circumstances, uninvited visitors coming to a residence to speak with an owner or resident are expected to come to the residence\u2019s most direct, obvious, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>prominent entryway, which in most cases is the front door.\u201d <em>Trimble, </em>816 N.E.2d at 88. These visitors \u201care also expected to leave by the same route after knocking on the front door and receiving no response,\u201d unless the \u201cnature of the circumstances surrounding the visit\u201d indicate that the visitor \u201ccould reasonably be expected to seek out residents through areas other than the front door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Generally, \u201ca substantial and unreasonable departure from the normal access route will exceed the scope of the implied invitation and intrude upon a constitutionally protected privacy interest.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>859 P.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Similarly, entering the property late at night, especially if accompanied by the use of subterfuge, may exceed the scope of the implied invitation. As noted by one court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">Furtive intrusion late at night or in the predawn hours is not conduct that is expected from ordinary visitors. Indeed, if observed by a resident of the premises, it could be a cause for great alarm. As compared to open daytime approaches, surreptitious searches under the cover of darkness create a greater risk of armed response \u2014 -with potentially tragic results \u2014 from fearful residents who may mistake the police officers for criminal intruders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\"><em>Cada, </em>923 P.2d at 478; <em>see also Brown v. State, </em>392 So.2d 280, 284 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1980) (finding that police violated defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy when they entered defendant\u2019s driveway without a warrant at 1:45 a.m. and arrested him); <em>State v.

State v. Lee, </em>633 P.2d 48, 51 (Utah 1981) (\u201c[T]he use of a flashlight to assist the natural vision at night does not make an \u2018observation\u2019 a \u2018search.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Here, considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that Officer Cox did not exceed the scope of Robinson\u2019s implied consent to enter the premises and approach the front door of her home. Officer Cox entered the driveway, began to drive toward the residence, and, <em>before </em>he reached the area of the driveway where the front walk intersects with the driveway, he saw the minors drinking in the backyard. At that point, Officer Cox had gone no further than any member of the public would have gone in an attempt to contact the owners of the property. He did not stray from the \u201cpath\u201d leading directly from the road to the front door (i.e., the driveway and the front sidewalk), nor did he attempt to conduct a general search of the premises through use of an overly intrusive means of investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Moreover, although Officer Cox parked his police car in the parking area by the garage, those portions of the curtilage impliedly open to the public encompass areas \u201cthat other visitors would be expected to go,\u201d <em>Trimble, </em>816 N.E.2d at 88, including \u201cparking areas\u201d in which a visitor might reasonably be expected to leave his vehicle when attempting to contact the residents of the property. <em>See Cada, </em>923 P.2d at 477 (\u201c[T]he direct access routes to the house, <em>including parking areas, </em>driveways and pathways to the entry, are areas to which the public is impliedly invited____\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Clark, </em>859 P.2d at 349 (\u201cThere is an implied invitation for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>public to use access routes to the house, <em>such as parking areas, </em>driveways, sidewalks, or pathways to the entry____\u201d (emphasis added)). Because the parking area by the garage is at the end of the driveway and directly adjacent to the front sidewalk, Robinson could reasonably expect a visitor to park his vehicle in that area when attempting to contact the residents of the home. Accordingly, Officer Cox did not exceed the scope of the implied consent when he pulled his car into the parking area by the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Also, although Officer Cox entered the curtilage of Robinson\u2019s home at 11:00 p.m., a late hour of the evening, this entry did not necessarily exceed the scope of the implied consent. \u201cUnder some circumstances, the mere fact that the intrusion was made late at night may be a factor suggesting that the police conduct was unduly intrusive.\u201d <em>State v. Morris, </em>131 Idaho 562, 961 P.2d 653, 657 n. 3 (1998). Here, however, the lights along Robinson\u2019s front sidewalk and the lights on the front porch were still illuminated. Also, multiple cars were parked along the driveway and on the public road in front of the house. These factors give rise to a reasonable inference that the landowner\u2019s implied consent to approach the front door of the residence had not yet been rescinded for the night.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Also, we note that Officer Cox drove up the driveway with his headlights turned on \u2014 the same way that any member of the general public would presumably have approached the house \u2014 rather than using subterfuge or the \u201ccover of darkness\u201d in an attempt to disguise his approach. <em>Compare Cada, </em>923 P.2d at 478 (officers exceeded scope of implied consent where they engaged in a \u201cclandestine intrusion ... under cover of darkness in the dead of night\u201d), <em>with Clark, </em>859 P.2d at 346 (officers did not exceed scope of implied consent where the officers went to the front door of the residence at 10:00 p.m. to investigate a neighbor\u2019s complaint about a loud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>party).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that, on the night in question, the implied invitation to enter Robinson\u2019s premises was still open even at this late hour, and Officer Cox did not exceed the scope of this implied consent when he drove up Robinson\u2019s driveway and parked his car in the parking area by the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Robinson argues, however, that Officer Cox\u2019s subjective intent \u2014 specifically, to see if the party attendees \u201cscattered\u201d as he approached the house \u2014 renders the entry unconstitutional, reasoning that the officer subjectively intended to conduct a general search of the premises. Because a homeowner who impliedly consents to have law enforcement officers enter the property does not also consent to a general search of that property, Robinson concludes that Officer Cox exceeded the scope of the implied consent by entering the premises while subjectively intending to search the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Initially, we agree that, although a property owner\u2019s implied consent generally authorizes law enforcement officers to seek out the occupants of the residence in order to \u201cinvestigate,\u201d <em>see, e.g., United States v. Hammett, </em>236 F.3d 1054, 1059 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cLaw enforcement officers may encroach upon the curtilage of a home for the purpose of asking questions of the occupants.\u201d), the scope of this implied consent does not also encompass the right to conduct a general search of the premises, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Bradshaw, </em>490 F.2d 1097, 1100 (4th Cir.1974) (noting that the officer may not extend the scope of the implied consent to conduct \u201ca search of such premises\u201d); <em>see also Rogers v. Pendleton, </em>249 F.3d 279, 288 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Alvarez v. Montgomery County, </em>147 F.3d 354, 358 (4th Cir.1998). Thus, if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>law enforcement officer, while searching for evidence of illicit activity, strays from the \u201cpath\u201d that is impliedly open to the public, he has exceeded the scope of the implied consent and, as a result, violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">However, the determination of whether a Fourth Amendment violation has occurred is based on \u201c \u2018an objective assessment of the officer\u2019s actions ... and not on the officer\u2019s state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Limonja, v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 532, 538, 383 S.E.2d 476, 480 (1989) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 470-71,105 S.Ct. 2778, 2783, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985)); <em>see also Deer v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 730, 734, 441 S.E.2d 33, 36 (1994) (\u201cAttention must be focused on objective reasonableness rather than on the police officer\u2019s subjective intent.\u201d). Although cases from other jurisdictions have inquired into whether the officer subjectively intended to search the property, we note that, in each of those cases, the officer\u2019s subjective intent only became relevant if the officer exceeded the ordinary scope of the implied consent by, for example, invading other areas of the curtilage <em>after </em>attempting a \u201cknock and talk.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Estate of Smith v. Marasco, </em>318 F.3d 497, 520-21 (3d Cir.2003) (remanding qualified immunity case for further factual determinations where the officers knocked on the front door, the defendant failed to answer, and the officers then entered the backyard of the residence); <em>Alvarez, </em>147 F.3d at 357 (inquiring into officer\u2019s subjective purpose for entering the backyard where the officers, who were investigating an underage drinking party, approached the front door, noticed a sign that said \u201cParty in Back,\u201d and then went to the backyard to \u201cspeak with the party\u2019s host\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Here, however, Officer Cox had not yet performed a \u201cknock and talk,\u201d nor had he invaded any areas of the curtilage other than those associated with the \u201cpath\u201d to the front door. Indeed, when Officer Cox first viewed the illicit activity, he had not yet finished driving up the driveway. Under the circumstances of this case, then, there is no additional intrusion into the curtilage that would necessitate an inquiry into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>whether Officer Cox subjectively intended to conduct a general search of the property when he first entered the driveway. Accordingly, we hold that Officer Cox\u2019s subjective intent is irrelevant under the circumstances of this case. <em>See Edwards v. Commonwealth, 38 </em>Va.App. <em>823, </em>827, 568 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2002) (\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has articulated the standard for measuring the scope of an individual\u2019s consent under the Fourth Amendment to be <em>\u2018objective </em>reasonableness ....\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 251, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 1804, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added))); <em>see also McIntyre, </em>860 P.2d at 302 (holding that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s reliance on the officers\u2019 investigative purpose was misplaced\u201d because \u201c \u2018[c]riminal investigation is as legitimate a societal purpose as is census taking or mail delivery1 \u201d (quoting <em>Corbett, </em>516 P.2d at 490) (second alteration in original)); <em>cf.

We further conclude that Officer Cox did not exceed the scope of this implied consent because, by driving up the driveway and parking in the parking area, he went no further than an ordinary member of the public would have gone in an attempt to contact the occupants of the premises. Accordingly, because Robinson extended an implied invitation to enter the property, and because Officer Cox did not exceed the scope of that implied consent, the Fourth Amendment had not been implicated at the point in time when the officer observed the individuals drinking beer and then fleeing into the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Because Officer Cox was legitimately present on the property when he viewed the illegal activity, and because Robinson presents no further arguments in support of her position that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the trial court should have granted her motion to suppress,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we hold that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.

Any further intrusion into the property, Robinson reasons, including the \u201csearch and seizure subsequently conducted in the ... backyard,\u201d violated the Fourth Amendment because the officer lacked the exigent circumstances sufficient to justify the warrantless entry onto the property. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">As Robinson argues, it is true that, \u201cabsent (1) exigent circumstances and probable cause or (2) consent, law enforcement agents cannot enter the curtilage of a person\u2019s home either to search or seize without previously obtaining a warrant.\u201d <em>Jefferson, 27 </em>Va.App. at 16, 497 S.E.2d at 481. Here, as discussed in Part 111(A), <em>supra, </em>and as Robinson concedes, Officer Cox\u2019s initial intrusion into the curtilage was justified because Robinson \u2014 by extending an implied invitation to members of the public to enter his driveway \u2014 impliedly consented to that limited intrusion. The only remaining question that must be resolved, then, is whether Officer Cox, once he had observed the minors drinking beer and fleeing into the woods, could intrude further into the curtilage without violating Robinson\u2019s constitutional rights. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the entry was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Initially, we note that the facts, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, establish that Officer Cox did not exceed the scope of Robinson\u2019s implied consent until <em>after </em>he had observed the underage individuals drinking alcohol and then fleeing from the scene. Specifically, as discussed above, Robinson had impliedly consented for members of the public to intrude upon certain, limited areas of the curtilage, including the driveway, the sidewalk, the area of the driveway immediately adjacent to the sidewalk, and the parking area at the end of the driveway. Thus, Officer Cox, who was located \u201cat the bush\u201d when he \u201cclearly\u201d saw \u201ctwo male juveniles standing on the other side of the tree holding beer bottles,\u201d had not exceeded the scope of the implied consent when he initially viewed the illegal activity. And, before Officer Cox could proceed significantly further up the driveway,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the individuals \u201clooked at [Cox], ... looked ... towards the back of the house, [ ] yelled \u2018cops,\u2019 ... dropped their beer bottles[,] and [then] ran down [the] fence line, towards the woods.\u201d It was only then that Officer Cox parked his car, got out of the police vehicle, and entered the backyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Considering these facts, the trial court found that Officer Cox\u2019s subsequent intrusion into the backyard was justified because he possessed both probable cause and exigent circumstances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We agree. Clearly, once the officer observed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>seemingly underage individuals holding beer bottles and then fleeing from the police presence, he had probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 4.1-305(A) (providing that \u201c[n]o person\u201d under the age of 21 \u201cshall consume, purchase or possess, or attempt to consume, purchase or possess, any alcoholic beverage\u201d); <em>see also State v. Jangala, </em>154 Or.App. 176, 961 P.2d 246, 247 (1998) (holding that a law enforcement officer had probable cause to believe the crime of furnishing alcohol to a minor was taking place after the officer observed a group of people who appeared to be minors \u201cholding red plastic cups that [the officer] recognized as the type commonly used to serve beer from a keg\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The only remaining issue, then, is whether exigent circum-' stances justified the warrantless entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">As noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, factors to consider when determining whether exigent circumstances justified a warrantless entry include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">(1) the degree of urgency involved and the time required to get a warrant; (2) the officers\u2019 reasonable belief that contraband is about to be removed or destroyed; (3) the possibility of danger to others, including police officers left to guard the site; (4) information that the possessors of the contraband are aware that the police may be on their trail; (5) whether the offense is serious, or involves violence; (6) whether officers believe the suspects are armed; (7) whether there is, at the time of entry, a clear showing of probable cause; (8) whether the officers have strong reason to be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>lieve the suspects are actually present in the premises; (9) the likelihood of escape if the suspects are not swiftly apprehended; and (10) the suspects\u2019 recent entry into the premises after hot pursuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><em>Verez v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 405, 410-11, 337 S.E.2d 749, 753 (1985); <em>see also Cherry v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 347, 360, 605 S.E.2d 297, 303 (2004). Moreover, in evaluating whether exigent circumstances justified a warrantless entry, we concern ourselves with \u201cwhat an objectively reasonable officer on the scene could have believed.\u201d <em>United States v. Leveringston, </em>397 F.3d 1112, 1116 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 159, 163 L.Ed.2d 145 (2005). \u201cIf such an officer would have had sufficient grounds to believe there was an exigency, then the Fourth Amendment does not require a warrant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Here, there is ample evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry. Specifically, Officer Cox could reasonably have believed that multiple, underage individuals had gathered at a party in the country and consumed significant quantities of alcohol. Many of these individuals had driven to the residence and, if left to their own devices pending issuance of a search warrant, may have attempted to drive home, placing both themselves and the general public at risk of significant harm. <em>See, e.g., Radloff v. City of Oelwein, </em>380 F.3d 344, 348 (8th Cir. 2004) (holding that \u201c[ejxigent circumstances existed ... because of the threat to public safety if the juveniles left the house in cars while under the influence of alcohol,\u201d further noting that \u201c[i]t would have been unreasonable ... to require the officers to quarantine the juveniles\u2019 cars during the period of time it would have taken to obtain a warrant\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1090, 125 S.Ct. 967,160 L.Ed.2d 900 (2005); <em>see also Howes v.

Moreover, Officer Cox could reasonably have believed that, had he left the premises to secure a search warrant, there was a significant likelihood that the remaining partygoers \u2014 who were, at that point, aware of the police presence \u2014 would either flee or destroy physical evidence in an attempt to \u201ccover up\u201d the existence of the underage drinking party. <em>See, e.g., Howes, </em>66 F.Supp.2d at 215 (holding that \u201cthe threat of destruction of evidence was sufficient to permit the warrantless entry\u201d where \u201can objectively reasonable police officer ... could have concluded that ... many of the besotted teenagers would have fled\u201d once they became aware of the police presence, and \u201c[o]thers would have attempted to destroy or at least conceal evidence of the teenagers\u2019 drinking had the officers waited patiently to obtain a warrant\u201d); <em>Jangala, </em>961 P.2d at 247-48 (noting that \u201cevidence of the crime of furnishing alcohol to minors is easily destroyed,\u201d and concluding that, because the officers \u201cwere aware that the evidence that they needed to seize was easily destroyed, combined with the fact that party-goers were aware of the police presence and had either run from the scene or otherwise attempted to avoid detection, there were exigent circumstances supporting the warrantless entry\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Considering the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the exigencies of this situation were sufficient to authorize Officer Cox\u2019s warrantless entry into Robinson\u2019s backyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Moreover, we disagree with Robinson\u2019s argument that this situation is one in which the investigating officer \u201cmanufactured the exigency.\u201d It is well settled that, where law enforcement officers \u201ccreate the exigency themselves, warrantless activity is per se unreasonable and we require suppression of any evidence obtained thereby.\u201d <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>v. Webster, </em>750 F.2d 307, 328 (5th Cir.1984). However, as we have noted, law enforcement officers \u201c \u2018are under no duty to call a halt to a criminal investigation the moment they have the minimum, evidence to establish probable cause, a quantum of evidence which may fall far short of the amount necessary to support a criminal conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cherry, </em>44 Va.App. at 360-61, 605 S.E.2d at 303 (quoting <em>United States v. Tobin, </em>923 F.2d 1506, 1511 (11th Cir.1991) (internal quotations omitted)); <em>see also Cardwell v. Lewis, </em>417 U.S. 583, 595, 94 S.Ct. 2464, 2472, 41 L.Ed.2d 325 (1974) (\u201c[W]e know of no case or principle that suggests that the right to search on probable cause and ... under exigent circumstances [is] foreclosed if a warrant was not obtained at the first practicable moment.\u201d). Thus, where the exigencies arise during the course of a continued investigation, those exigencies will not be deemed \u201cmanufactured\u201d unless the officer had a meaningful opportunity to obtain a search warrant prior to the development of the exigencies upon which he relied. <em>See, e.g., Webster, </em>750 F.2d at 327 (\u201cOur first concern in analyzing a claim of manufactured exigency is whether agents could have obtained a search warrant prior to the development of the exigent circumstances upon which they relied.\u201d); <em>see also United State v.

Hultgren, </em>713 F.2d 79, 87 (5th Cir.1983))).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Despite Robinson\u2019s argument to the contrary, then, Officer Cox was \u201cunder no duty\u201d to leave the premises \u201cthe moment\u201d he had the \u201cminimum evidence to establish probable cause.\u201d <em>Cherry, </em>44 Va.App. at 360-61, 605 S.E.2d at 303. And, as discussed above, negligible time passed between the moment that Officer Cox \u201cclearly\u201d saw \u201ctwo male juveniles standing on the other side of the tree holding beer bottles,\u201d and the moment that these individuals became aware of his presence and fled. Because the development of probable cause and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>creation of the exigencies were virtually contemporaneous, Officer Cox had no meaningful opportunity in which to obtain a search warrant for the property before exigent circumstances necessitated his further intrusion onto the premises. Accordingly, we conclude that the \u201cmanufactured exigency\u201d doctrine is inapplicable under the circumstances of this case. <em>See Webster, </em>750 F.2d at 328 (declining to hold \u201cthat agents manufactured exigent circumstances by placing the [property] under surveillance\u201d while attempting to gather further information).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in concluding that the officer had both probable cause and exigent circumstances sufficient to justify his warrantless entry into Robinson\u2019s backyard.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">We hold that, under the facts of this case, the Robinsons extended an implied invitation to members of the public to enter the driveway and approach the front door of the residence. Because the Robinsons impliedly consented to the initial, limited intrusion, Officer Cox\u2019s presence on the driveway did not constitute an illegal search. Moreover, once he observed the underage individuals drinking beer and fleeing into the woods, Officer Cox\u2019s further intrusion onto the property was justified because he possessed both probable cause and exigent circumstances. Because Officer Cox did not violate the Fourth Amendment, we hold that the trial court properly denied the Robinsons\u2019 motions to suppress.

However, because the assignment of error does question whether the officer\u2019s \"entry into the Robinsons\u2019 backyard\u201d was constitutionally permissible, we will assume for purposes of this opinion that Robinson's third \"Question Presented\u201d is sufficient to encompass the trial court\u2019s ruling that exigent circumstances justified the officer's entry into the backyard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b588-8\">.

However, I disagree with the majority that Officer Cox\u2019s entry onto the curtilage was reasonable under the facts of this case. I believe it is the subjective intent of <em>the citizen </em>regarding whether to waive a constitutional right that ultimately controls. The legal fiction that implied consent exists for the police to enter the curtilage of a private residence for a knock- and-talk has never been held by the United States or Virginia Supreme Court to override the pronouncement of <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973), that assessing the voluntariness of consent to a search is to be judged from the subjective perspective of the particular citizen involved. Because the evidence fails to prove either (1) that anyone with a reasonable expectation of privacy in the Robinsons\u2019 curtilage in fact consented to Officer Cox\u2019s entry thereon or (2) that Officer Cox could reasonably have concluded, under the facts of this case, that those with a reasonable expectation of privacy would have consented if asked, I would hold the evidence fails to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Officer Cox\u2019s presence on the Robinsons\u2019 property was reasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s pronouncement against unreasonable searches. Thus, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s affirmance of the Robinsons\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The majority states, \u201cHere, ... we are not questioning whether Robinson extended her consent to <em>search </em>the property, but rather, whether, under the totality of the circumstances, she had rescinded her implied consent to <em>enter </em>that property.\u201d Settled principles establish that Officer Cox\u2019s entry onto the Robinsons\u2019 property, in and of itself, was a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness requirement, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 301, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 1139, 94 L.Ed.2d 326, 334 (1987), albeit one arguably less intrusive than an entry or actual search of the dwelling itself. The majority concludes the entry was reasonable based on the existence of what it finds was the homeowners\u2019 implied consent \u201cto have members of the general public \u2014 including law enforcement officers \u2014 enter the driveway and front sidewalk,\u201d parts of the property they could be expected to cross if entering for purposes of a \u201cknock and talk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Although Fourth Amendment issues are generally judged by standards of the objective reasonableness of a police officer\u2019s beliefs or actions, not all Fourth Amendment issues are judged by such standards. <em>See, e.g., Kyer v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 473, 481 n. 2, 612 S.E.2d 213, 217 n. 2 (2005) (en banc) (noting community caretaker standard considers officer\u2019s subjective intent). This case presents an example of the inherent tension between the general Fourth Amendment standard for assessing the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s actions and the standard for determining whether an individual has consented to a search. The United States Supreme Court has held that the test for determining the voluntariness of a consent to search is based on the subjective intent of the individual claimed to have waived his right to be free from unreasonable searches. <em>See Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 227, 93 S.Ct. at 2047-48, 36 L.Ed.2d at 862-63; <em>see also United States v. Wilson, </em>895 F.2d 168, 171 (4th Cir.1990) (comparing objective standard for determining whether seizure has occurred with subjective standard for determining consent to search).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Under a subjective test, the fact that the Robinsons did not take affirmative steps to exclude <em>all </em>trespassers does not establish that they subjectively intended to consent to <em>police </em>entry onto the curtilage of their property for purposes of a knock-and-talk or any other purpose. Neither the United States nor the Virginia Supreme Court has ever held, as the majority of our Court does today, that \u201cimplied consent [to entry by <em>the police </em>for a knock-and-talk] is presumed to exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>absent evidence of an affirmative intent to exclude <em>the public </em>from the premises,\u201d <em>see </em>discussion, <em>supra, </em>at 548 n. 6 (citing <em>State v. Somfleth, </em>168 Or.App. 414, 8 P.3d 221, 227 (2000)) (emphasis added), or that \u201c[an] implied invitation [to enter for such a purpose] arises by operation of law,\u201d <em>see id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Here, the police made no claim that the Robinsons gave actual consent to have the police enter the curtilage of their home on the night at issue. Officer Cox testified that the police made no attempt to contact the Robinsons\u2019 home by telephone or any other means before driving onto the property that night. The fact that the Robinsons had not posted \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs and may have consented, if asked, to allow other members of society such as letter carriers and Girl Scouts onto the curtilage does not mean that they would, if asked, have granted the same privilege to the police on the night at issue. Thus, if the entry is to be judged purely from the subjective perspective of the homeowner, the absence of actual consent ends the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">At most, then, the Commonwealth might claim that, although Officer Cox lacked actual consent, his entry onto the curtilage did not violate the Fourth Amendment because a reasonable officer would have believed those having a reasonable expectation of privacy in the curtilage did consent or would have consented, if asked, to have the police enter for a knock-and-talk on the night at issue. <em>Cf. Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 251, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 1803-04, 114 L.Ed.2d 297, 302 (1991) (holding \u201c[t]he standard for measuring <em>the scope </em>of a suspect\u2019s consent under the Fourth Amendment is that of \u2018objective\u2019 reasonableness \u2014 what would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect?\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 185-86, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 2799-2800, 111 L.Ed.2d 148, 159-60 (1990) (holding that general rule that officer\u2019s assessments of fact need not always be correct as long as they are reasonable applies to officer\u2019s assessment of whether party giving consent to search has authority to do so); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>395 F.3d 516, 519 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201c[The Fourth Amendment does not even require that the suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>actually </em>consent to a government search; factual determinations by the government, such as the presence of consent, must be <em>reasonable, </em>but are not required always to be correct.\u201d). I believe the objective reasonableness of an officer\u2019s assessment of whether a homeowner has consented should not be relevant when the issue deals with protecting one\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights in his home and its curtilage. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ronald Bacigal, <em>Choosing Perspectives in Criminal Procedure, </em>6 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill of Rts. J. 677, 729 (1998). As one commentator has opined,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">The fundamental right of individuals to control their own fate by exercising or waiving constitutional rights must take precedence over a police officer\u2019s mistaken perception of consent, no matter how objectively reasonable or understandable the mistake may have been. From the police perspective, the only sensible guide is that \u201cthey should never rely on consent as the basis for a search unless they must. If they do search relying on consent, they should be prepared to meet a heavy burden of proof that consent was in fact meaningfully given. And even then, because of the difficulties of proof, they should expect to be told often that the search was not proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Lloyd L. Weinreb, <em>Generalities of the Fourth Amendment, </em>42 U. Chi. L.Rev. 47, 64 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Nevertheless, even if we examine whether Officer Cox could reasonably, albeit erroneously, have believed those having a reasonable expectation of privacy in the curtilage would have consented to his entry, if asked, we must conclude the entry violated the Fourth Amendment. The evidence fails as a matter of law to support a finding that Officer Cox could reasonably have believed <em>these particular citizens </em>would have consented to his entry on the night at issue. Under the facts of this case, both the adult homeowners and any juveniles who resided with them had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the home and the portions of the curtilage not viewable from the public road. <em>See, e.g., State v. Reddick, </em>207 Conn. 823, 541 A.2d 1209, 1213-14 (1988) (holding adult child legitimately residing in home of parent has reasonable expectation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>home will be free of government intrusion); <em>see also Grant v. State, </em>267 Ark. 50, 589 S.W.2d 11, 14 (1979) (recognizing implicitly that, absent parental consent for search, child has reasonable expectation of privacy in premises in which he resides with parent). Officer Cox went to the property that night because the police had received multiple reports that an underage drinking party was underway at the Robinsons\u2019 home. Under these circumstances, Officer Cox could not reasonably have concluded that either (a) the Robinsons, if they were at home, or (b) \u201cthe juvenile host\u201d of the party, if the Robinsons were not present,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> would have consented to entry of the police on the curtilage, where they could readily discover evidence of criminal activity not visible from the public road.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">For these reasons, I would hold the evidence fails to support the majority\u2019s conclusion that implied consent justified the entry of the Robinsons\u2019 curtilage. Further, absent evidence (1) that anyone with a reasonable expectation of privacy in the Robinsons\u2019 curtilage in fact consented to Officer Cox\u2019s entry thereon or (2) that Officer Cox could reasonably have concluded, under the facts of this case, that those with a reasonable expectation of privacy would have consented if asked, I would hold that Officer Cox\u2019s presence on the Robinsons\u2019 property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>was unreasonable and violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s pronouncement against unreasonable searches. Thus, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s affirmance of the Robinsons\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\">. Officer Cox testified that he was searching for the party\u2019s juvenile host and appeared to have believed, at least after he confirmed that underage drinking was occurring, that he would not find any adults present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\">.

Although guilty persons may be found to have given valid consent to search, even though such consent is against their self-interest, <em>see United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 555, 559, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1878, 1880, 64 L.Ed.2d 497, 510, 513 (1980), it is not objectively reasonable for an officer to assume, without asking, that a person he suspects is guilty of engaging in some criminal activity on his property would consent to law enforcement entry onto the curtilage if asked.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b612-5\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\u201c[A] search or seizure carried out on ...

Officer Cox\u2019s conduct was consistent with that plan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">The distinction between approaching a house to knock on the front door, as citizens do every day, and persisting ... in a comprehensive search for ... underage drinkers ... would seem obvious____[G]eneral searches of the curtilage of a private home may [not] be conducted without a warrant or exigent circumstances, based simply upon reasonable suspicion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-10\"><em>Rogers, </em>249 F.3d at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">For these reasons, and for the reasons more fully discussed in Judge Elder\u2019s dissent to the majority opinion and Judge Annunziata\u2019s dissent to the panel\u2019s opinion, <em>see Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 592, 622-32, 612 S.E.2d 751, 765-71 (2005), I would hold that the police officers\u2019 entry and search was violative of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\">. Obviously, the occupants of a residence have not issued an implied invitation to the public to enter the premises to search or rummage around or to engage in illegitimate conduct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">A government agent, in the same manner as a private person, may accept an invitation to do business and may enter upon the premises <em>for the very purposes contemplated by the occupant. </em>Of course, this does not mean that, whenever entry is obtained by invitation ... an agent is authorized to conduct a general search for incriminating materials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\"><em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 206, 211, 87 S.Ct. 424, 428, 17 L.Ed.2d 312 (1966). Thus, when, as here, an officer enters the curtilage \"to establish probable cause to investigate the scene further,\u201d his intrusion does not fall within the property owner\u2019s implied invitation to the public. <em>See Lo-Ji Sales, Inc. v. New York, </em>442 U.S. 319, 329, 99 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>2319, 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 920 (1979) (holding that \"there is no basis for the notion that because a [property owner] invites the public to enter, it consents to wholesale searches and seizures that do not conform to Fourth Amendment guarantees\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
