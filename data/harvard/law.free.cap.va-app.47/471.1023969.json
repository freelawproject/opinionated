Stillwell contends that the commission erroneously determined that he was at least partially responsible for causing the fight and, thus, that the so-called \u201caggressor defense\u201d barred his recovery of benefits for that injury. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the commission did not err and, therefore, affirm the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">On appeal, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to employer, the party prevailing below. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 72, 577 S.E.2d 588, 539 (2003); <em>Tomes v. James City (County of) Fire, </em>39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Va.App. 424, 429, 573 S.E.2d 312, 315 (2002). So viewed, the evidence in this case establishes the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Beginning in June of 2003, Stillwell worked as a groundsman and a bucket operator for appellee Lewis Tree Service (\u201cemployer\u201d). Stillwell\u2019s specific job duties included cutting tree limbs away from power lines, cutting up trees \u201cas they were put on the ground,\u201d and carrying wood. On September 30, 2003, Stillwell was working with Daniel Jones, a co-employee. The two men were part of a group of employees cutting down trees \u201cto make a right-of-way for the power line.\u201d Stillwell and another employee were responsible for cutting the limbs off of the felled trees and moving the wood, and Jones was responsible for \u201cbush hogging\u201d the remaining debris. According to Jones, however, Stillwell did not want to move the wood after it had been cut. Thus, Jones got off of his tractor and informed Stillwell that, \u201cif [Stillwell] wanted to grind the bush, he could do it\u201d while Jones moved the rest of the wood. Stillwell then \u201c[came] running over [] towards [Jones],\u201d the two men \u201chad a few words,\u201d and, when Jones \u201cwent to step back,\u201d Stillwell \u201cswung and knocked [his] hard hat off.\u201d Jones then \u201cgrabbed\u201d Stillwell, and the two men \u201cfell to the ground and started rolling around and scuffling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANI\">The foreman approached the two men and told them to \u201cbreak it up.\u201d Jones got up, and the two men started \u201cyelling back and forth.\u201d When Jones tried to walk away, Stillwell grabbed him around the neck, and the men tumbled to the ground. Jones landed on top of Stillwell, causing Stillwell to break his right shoulder. The foreman then called the office and was told to fire both men immediately for fighting on the job. The foreman, therefore, fired both Jones and Stillwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Jones, who had been working for employer for eight years, had never been involved in any previous, similar incidents. Thus, the foreman \u201cbegged\u201d to rehire Jones because he was the only person, other than himself, with a commercial driver\u2019s license. Employer allowed the foreman to rehire Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">By application dated October 30, 2003, Stillwell filed a claim for disability and medical benefits, alleging that the injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>his right shoulder was incurred when a \u201cco-worker attacked [him] on [the] job site.\u201d Employer denied the claim, asserting that Stillwell\u2019s injury was caused by \u201cwillful misconduct,\u201d specifically, \u201cviolating] a known safety rule\u201d by \u201cfight[ing] at work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">During the hearing before the deputy commissioner, Still-well testified that, on the day of the fight, Jones had criticized Stillwell\u2019s work by stating that Stillwell \u201cdidn\u2019t know what [he was] doing.\u201d Stillwell responded that, \u201cif [he was] doing such a bad job that he could come over and he could do it.\u201d Stillwell testified that he then \u201cturned around and [Jones] had pulled the tractor behind [Stillwell] and jumped off and was standing there, he was all red in the face and mad.\u201d According to Stillwell, Jones then said, \u201cwell, here you go \u2014 here's my truck, you do my job and I\u2019ll do yours.\u201d Stillwell said that he told Jones, \u201cjust get on the tractor and do your job\u201d and that he was \u201cjust doing the best [he] can.\u201d According to Stillwell, \u201cwhen [he] went to turn around [Jones] jumped on [him] and that was when [he] hit the ground\u201d and broke his shoulder. Stillwell also testified that, after the foreman intervened, Stillwell told Jones to \u201ccut it out,\u201d but that Jones then \u201ctackled [him] again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Stillwell admitted, however, that he knew he was not \u201csupposed to fight on this job.\u201d The foreman similarly testified that, if employees fight, they are to be fired \u201cimmediately,\u201d no \u201cifs, ands, or buts about it.\u201d The foreman also testified that, prior to the fight, Stillwell had once called Jones a \u201ctattletale\u201d because Jones had reported Stillwell to the foreman for poor job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">By opinion dated August 19, 2004,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the deputy commissioner held that Stillwell carried his burden of proving an injury by accident. The deputy commissioner reasoned that, although Stillwell \u201cprobably struck the first blow,\u201d the two employees were \u201cequally at fault in the fight.\u201d And, because employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>only fired one of the two employees involved in the accident, the deputy commissioner concluded that \u201cthe employer cannot use the willful misconduct defense successfully in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Employer appealed to the full commission, which, by opinion dated May 20, 2005, reversed the award of benefits. The commission reasoned that, because Stillwell failed to carry his burden of proving that he was not the aggressor in the fight, he also \u201cfailed to prove that his injury arose out of his employment.\u201d Stillwell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the commission erred in determining that Stillwell failed to carry his burden of establishing that his shoulder injury arose out of his employment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u201cThe question of \u2018[wjhether an accident arises out of the employment is a mixed question of law and fact and is reviewable by the appellate court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cleveland v. Food Lion L.L.C., </em>43 Va.App. 514, 518, 600 S.E.2d 138, 140 (2004) (quoting <em>Plumb Rite Plumbing Serv. v. Barbour, </em>8 Va.App. 482, 483, 382 S.E.2d 305, 306 (1989)). Accordingly, although we are bound by the commission\u2019s underlying factual findings if those findings are supported by credible evidence, <em>see Artis v. Ottenberg\u2019s Bakers, Inc., </em>45 Va.App. 72, 83-84, 608 S.E.2d 512, 517 (2005) <em>(en banc), </em>we review <em>de novo </em>the commission\u2019s ultimate determination as to whether the injury arose out of the claimant\u2019s employment, <em>see Caplan v. Bogard, </em>264 Va. 219, 225, 563 S.E.2d 719, 722 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\u201cThe language \u2018arising out of refers to the origin or cause of the injury____\u201d <em>Briley v. Farm Fresh, Inc., </em>240 Va. 194, 197, 396 S.E.2d 835, 836 (1990). An injury will therefore be deemed to \u201carise out of\u2019 the claimant\u2019s employment \u201cwhen there is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>resulting injury.\u201d <em>Combs v. Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co., </em>259 Va. 503, 509, 525 S.E.2d 278, 282 (2000); <em>see also United Parcel Serv. of Am. v. Fetterman, </em>230 Va. 257, 258, 336 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1985) (\u201cAn accident arises out of the employment when there is a causal connection between the claimant\u2019s injury and the conditions under which the employer requires the work to be performed.\u201d). Thus, if an injury \u201ccannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause,\u201d the injury is not compensable because it did not \u201carise out of\u2019 the claimant\u2019s employment. <em>Combs, </em>259 Va. at 509, 525 S.E.2d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In <em>Farmers\u2019 Manufacturing Co. v. Warfel, </em>144 Va. 98, 131 S.E. 240 (1926), the Virginia Supreme Court observed that an employee is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u201cwhere a [claimant] suffers injuries from an assault when the claimant is himself in fault as the aggressor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 131 S.E. at 241. The rationale for denying benefits to the aggressor is that, \u201cin such cases the proximate cause of the injury is not the employment, but the fault of the claimant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, if an employee is at fault in causing a fight and is injured during the course of that fight, those injuries do not \u201carise out of\u2019 the aggressor\u2019s employment because the injuries were not proximately caused by the employment, but rather, by \u201cthe fault of the claimant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Accordingly, where a claimant\u2019s injuries are incurred during a fight with another employee, those injuries \u201carise out of\u2019 the employment only if the fight \u201c \u2018[1] was not a mere personal matter, but grew out of a quarrel over the manner of conducting the employer\u2019s business, <em>and </em>... [2] <em>the injured employee was not responsible for the assault.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 131 S.E. at 241 (quoting <em>Edelwiess Gardens v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, </em>290 Ill. 459, 125 N.E. 260, 262 (1919)) (emphasis added); <em>see also Lynchburg Steam Bakery, Inc. v. Garrett, </em>161 Va. 517, 520, 171 S.E. 493, 494 (1933) (indicating that the quoted language from <em>Farmers\u2019 </em>was intended to \u201cconstrue[ ] the [statutory] language \u2018arising out of and in the course of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>employment\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To establish that his shoulder injury arose out of his employment, Stillwell therefore bore the burden of proving both: (1) that the fight was not personal, but rather, was related to the manner of conducting business, and (2) that he was \u201cnot responsible\u201d for the fight. <em>See id.] see also Dublin Garment Co. v. Jones, </em>2 Va.App. 165, 168, 342 S.E.2d 638, 639 (1986) (noting that an injury sustained in an assault is \u201ccompensable where the attack <em>was directed against </em>the claimant\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Park Oil Co. v. Parham, </em>1 Va.App. 166, 168, 336 S.E.2d 531, 533 (1985) (\u201cAn assaulted claimant must show that the assault <em>was aimed at him </em>... in order to recover.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The commission found, and the parties agree, that the fight \u201cgrew out of a quarrel about work issues,\u201d specifically, Still-well\u2019s \u201cperformance of his job.\u201d Thus, Stillwell successfully established that the fight was not personal in nature, but rather, was related to employer\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The commission also found, however, that Stillwell failed to prove that he was not responsible for the fight. Credible evidence in the record supports this finding. Specifically, Jones testified that, after the two men exchanged words, Stillwell \u201cswung and knocked [Jones\u2019] hard hat off.\u201d Jones responded by grabbing Stillwell and pulling him to the ground. After the foreman broke up the fight, the two men resumed arguing. Stillwell then grabbed Jones around the neck, and the men tumbled to the ground again, causing Stillwell to break his shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">From these facts, the commission could reasonably have concluded that Stillwell, by striking the first blow, initiated the physical confrontation. Similarly, by grabbing Jones after the foreman interceded, Stillwell actively sought to continue that confrontation. Thus, Stillwell did not carry his burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>proving that he was without fault in causing the fight that resulted in his shoulder injury. And, because Stillwell instigated the fight, his shoulder injury did not arise out of his employment because it was not caused by his employment, but rather, by his own conscious decision to engage in a physical altercation on the jobsite. <em>See Farmers\u2019, </em>144 Va. at 104, 131 S.E. at 241; <em>cf. Jones, </em>2 Va.App. at 168, 342 S.E.2d at 639 (permitting recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits where the claimant \u201cwas an unsuspecting nonparticipating victim of the unilateral act of her co-worker\u201d). Said differently, Still-well\u2019s intentional conduct constituted the proximate cause of the accident and, therefore, broke the chain of causation between the employment and the injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Stillwell argues, however, that the commission improperly placed the burden upon him to establish that he was \u201cnot responsible\u201d for the assault. He reasons that the issue of whether he was the aggressor in the fight is analogous to the issue of whether he engaged in \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5). Because the \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d defense is an affirmative defense, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-306(B), \u201cthe employer has the burden to prove that claimant\u2019s conduct ... was in \u2018willful\u2019 disregard of a reasonable rule established by employer____\u201d <em>Brockway v. Easter, </em>20 Va.App. 268, 271, 456 S.E.2d 159, 161 (1995). Stillwell argues that, similarly, the issue of whether he was \u201cresponsible\u201d for the fight should be deemed an affirmative defense, and he concludes that the commission therefore erroneously placed the burden of proof with respect to this issue upon him rather than employer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>We disagree. What Stillwell characterizes as the \u201caggressor defense\u201d is, in fact, not an affirmative defense at all. It is well-established that it is the claimant who has the burden of proving a causal connection between the injury and the employment sufficient to establish that the injury arose out of the employment. <em>See, e.g., A.N. Campbell &amp; Co. v. Messenger, </em>171 Va. 374, 380, 199 S.E. 511, 514 (1938); <em>see also Bailey v. Stonega Coke &amp; Coal Co., </em>185 Va. 653, 659, 40 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1946) (\u201c[Tjhere must be a causal connection between the employment and the accident. The burden of showing this rests upon the petitioner.\u201d); <em>Continental Life Ins. v. Gough, </em>161 Va. 755, 760, 172 S.E. 264, 266 (1934) (noting that, before a claimant can recover for injuries sustained in an assault, \u201cthe <em>employee ... </em>must ... prove that the assault was directed against him as an employee, ... that is, that [the injury] arose out of as well as in the course of his employment\u201d (emphasis added)). And, as discussed above, where a claimant has been injured while fighting with a co-worker, that injury \u201carises out of\u2019 the claimant\u2019s employment only if two elements are satisfied: (1) the fight was not personal, but rather, was related to the manner of conducting business, and (2) the claimant was not responsible for the fight. <em>See Farmers\u2019, </em>144 Va. at 104, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>131 S.E. at 241. Where the alleged injury is incurred during a fight with a co-worker, then, the claimant must affirmatively prove <em>both </em>elements in order to establish the requisite causal connection between the injury and the employment. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In <em>AN. Campbell &amp; Co., </em>for example, the claimant was shot \u201cthree or four times\u201d while he was carrying a battery \u201cdown a public road in the direction of and towards his company\u2019s operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378, 199 S.E. at 513. It was not clear whether the claimant was shot because he \u201csometimes indulged in a game of poker,\u201d which was \u201cdistasteful\u201d to the shooter, or whether the claimant was shot because he \u201chad worked on [a] Sunday.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378-79, 199 S.E. at 513-14. The Virginia Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201ca recovery [cjould be sustained ... if the shooting resulted from ... the employment of claimant ... on the Sabbath day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 199 S.E. at 514 (internal quotations omitted). The Court further noted, however, \u201cthat poker playing had nothing whatever to do with [the claimant\u2019s] employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because it was unclear why the claimant was shot, the Court reversed the award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, reasoning that the claimant had failed to carry his burden of proving a \u201ccasual connection between the employment and the shooting\u201d sufficient to establish that his injuries \u201carose out of\u2019 his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 380, 199 S.E. at 514; <em>see also Hopson v. Hungerford Coal Co., </em>187 Va. 299, 307-08, 46 S.E.2d 392, 396 (1948) (affirming denial of benefits where it was not clear whether the decedent employee was shot \u201cwhile he was attempting to protect his employer\u2019s property from theft\u201d or whether the shooting was a result of a \u201cpersonal matter between [the employee] and [the third party],\u201d reasoning that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\u201cto conclude that the death of [the employee] arose out of his employment would be conjectural\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The holdings in <em>AN. Campbell &amp; Co. </em>and <em>Hopson </em>were therefore predicated on the claimant\u2019s failure to establish the first of the elements identified in <em>Farmers\u2019, </em>specifically, that the altercation was not a personal matter, but rather, grew out of a quarrel over the manner of conducting the employer\u2019s business. <em>See Farmers\u2019, </em>144 Va. at 104, 131 S.E. at 241. Thus, the Virginia Supreme Court has clearly placed the burden of proving this first element upon the claimant. <em>See Hopson, </em>187 Va. at 307-08, 46 S.E.2d at 396; <em>AN. Campbell &amp; Co., </em>171 Va. at 380, 199 S.E. at 514; <em>Gough, </em>161 Va. at 760,172 S.E. at 266. It follows, then, that the claimant also bears the burden of proving the second element identified in <em>Farmers\u2019, </em>specifically, that the claimant did not initiate the fight. <em>See Farmers\u2019, </em>144 Va. at 104, 131 S.E. at 241. Thus, the issue of whether the claimant initiated the fight is not an affirmative defense, but rather, an \u201cintegral part of the proximate causation analysis.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Mkt. Share, Inc. v. Sterling Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>392 F.3d 520, 527 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. McCain, </em>414 F.2d 369, 374 (5th Cir.1969) (\u201cThe theory of new and independent cause is not an affirmative defense; it is but an element to be considered by the jury in considering the existence or non-existence of proximate cause.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)); <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. KPMG Peat Marwick, </em>845 F.Supp. 621, 625 (N.D.Ill.1994) (holding that the issue of whether the plaintiffs claim was barred by an intervening cause was \u201cnot an affirmative defense,\u201d but merely \u201can assertion that [the plaintiff] cannot prove a necessary element of its claim\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the commission did not err in placing the burden of proof with respect to this second element upon Stillwell rather than employer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">For these reasons, we hold that credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that Stillwell\u2019s shoulder injury did not \u201carise out of\u2019 his employment.

We disagree with Stillwell\u2019s assertion that, by denying workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee who initiates a fight, this Court is impermissibly \u2018\u2018revert[ing] to the doctrines of negligence.\u201d <em>Farmers\u2019, </em>144 Va. at 105, 131 S.E. at 242. Stillwell's injuries were not incurred as a result of his negligent conduct, but rather, as a result of his intentional decision to fight with a co-employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\">. Quoting at length from Larson's <em>Worker\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8.01 [5][a] &amp; [c], Stillwell also contends that this Court should reject the so-called \"aggressor defense,\u201d reasoning that the language from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>Farmers' </em>\u2014 which he refers to as <em>dicta </em>\u2014 \"has been misunderstood and misapplied here and in other cases.\" Stillwell concludes that <em>Farmers\u2019 </em>\u201ccannot be considered as binding precedent\u201d on this issue. However, in <em>Farmers', </em>the Virginia Supreme Court clearly intended to \"construe[ ] the [statutoiy] language \u2018arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u2019 \" <em>Garrett, </em>161 Va. at 520, 171 S.E. at 494. Although the facts of that case ultimately did not require an inquiry into whether the claimant initiated the assault, we are without authority to overrule clear precedent from the Virginia Supreme Court regarding the interpretation of specific statutory language. <em>See Roane v. Roane, </em>12 Va.App. 989, 993, 407 S.E.2d 698, 700 (1991) (\"We are bound by decisions of the Supreme Court of Virginia and are without authority to overrule [them].\u201d); <em>see also Martinez v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 9, 19, 590 S.E.2d 57, 62 (2003) (\"We cannot and do not ignore the clear precedent established by [] cases [from the Virginia Supreme Court].\"). <em>See generally Tate v. Showboat Marina Casino P\u2019ship, </em>431 F.3d 580, 582 (7th Cir.2005) (noting that \"the holding of a case includes, besides the facts and the outcome, the reasoning essential to that outcome,\u201d reasoning that, \"as a practical matter,\u201d a contrary rule \"would erase stare decisis because two cases rarely have identical facts\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b526-5\">. Stillwell also argues that the so-called \"aggressor defense\u201d should only be available in cases \"when it is shown by the employer that a claimant was hurt while attempting to injure another person based on some motive unrelated to the workplace.\u201d However, in such cases, the injury would not have arisen out of the employment, regardless, because the claimant would be unable to prove the first of the two elements identified in <em>Farmers\u2019. </em>Stillwell\u2019s suggested \"fix\u201d would, therefore, have the practical effect of eliminating the issue altogether.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b527-5\">. We also disagree with Stillwell\u2019s assertion that, by requiring him to prove that he was \"not responsible\" for the fight, the commission impermissibly required him to \"prove a negative.\u201d The issue of whether an employee was responsible for a fight is a question of fact: either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Stillwell instigated the fight, or he did not. And, as noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, \"the general principle ... that no man shall be called upon to prove a negative\u201d has no application where the \"negative has a corresponding affirmative.\u201d <em>Hinchman v. Lawson, </em>32 Va. (5 Leigh) 695, 696 (1834). Moreover, \" \u2018[w]hen a [claimant\u2019s] right of action is grounded on a negative allegation, <em>which is an essential element in his case, </em>... the burden is on him to prove that allegation, the legal presumption being in favor of the [defendant].\u2019 \u201d <em>United Dentists, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>162 Va. 347, 356, 173 S.E. 508, 511 (1934) (quoting <em>Colorado Coal Co. v. United States, </em>123 U.S. 307, 8 S.Ct. 131, 31 L.Ed. 182 (1887)) (emphasis added). Thus, although the commission phrased this particular element in the negative (questioning whether Stillwell was \"not responsible\u201d for the fight, as opposed to whether Stillwell \"initiated,\u201d \"instigated,\u201d or \"was the aggressor in\u201d the fight), this phraseology did not impermissibly force Stillwell to \"prove a negative.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
