ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">In <em>Rahnema v. Rahnema, </em>2000 WL 251679, 2000 Va.App. Lexis 163 (March 7, 2000) <em>(Rahnema I), </em>we affirmed the trial court\u2019s enforcement of a marital agreement between Dr. Mansur Rahnema and Shahla Rahnema. Four years later, Dr. Rahnema filed an annulment action seeking to declare his prior marriage to Ms. Rahnema void as bigamous and the agreement unenforceable as a consequence. The trial court, sitting as factfinder, found Dr. Rahnema\u2019s evidence of bigamy unpersuasive and entered final judgment dismissing the annulment action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s judgment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">A. <em>Background &amp; Prior Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The parties married in 1993. Three months later, they entered into an agreement specifying Ms. Rahnema\u2019s property and support rights in the event of a divorce and granting her a contractual right to 80% of Dr. Rahnema\u2019s assets upon his death. The marriage ended in divorce in 1999. After we approved this agreement in <em>Rahnema I,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the case continued on the circuit court\u2019s docket for several years. The court scheduled the final equitable distribution hearing in April 2004. The day before the hearing, Dr. Rahnema filed this annulment action seeking to declare his marriage void due to Ms. Rahnema\u2019s alleged bigamy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Rahnema also became the complaining witness in a criminal action against Ms. Rahnema charging bigamy. The criminal jury trial ended with an acquittal in August 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">B. <em>Pretrial Discovery Disputes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In support of his annulment action, Dr. Rahnema scheduled two overseas depositions in October 2004. The first was taken in London of Hedayatollah Mortazavi, an Iranian national. Mortazavi claimed to witness Ms. Rahnema\u2019s prior divorce from another man and to recognize a handwritten copy of the Iranian divorce decree showing the divorce took place after her marriage to Dr. Rahnema.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Dr. Rahnema also attempted to take a deposition of Ms. Rahnema\u2019s alleged former spouse, Mohammad Hossein Aliza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>deh, in Istanbul, Turkey. The deposition was originally scheduled for London, changed with notice to Ankara, and then changed without notice to Istanbul. The deposition actually took place a day after the date specified in the amended deposition notice. Ms. R\u00e1hnema\u2019s counsel did not attend this deposition. The witness testified in an unidentified foreign language and dialect (presumably some variation of Farsi) while an interpreter translated the witness\u2019s responses into English. The interpreter, however, presented no credentials verifying his competence to translate the witness\u2019s language and dialect into English.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Dr. Rahnema\u2019s counsel began and finished her questioning of the witness before the court reporter arrived. The court reporter, Tamar Kogyan, showed up just as the interview had ended. Kogyan obtained two audiotapes of the interview and later produced a document entitled \u201cOfficial Transcription.\u201d Identifying herself as a Turkish \u201cSworn Translator\u201d and \u201cNotary Public,\u201d Kogyan\u2019s transcription stated that she \u201ctranscribed the English parts\u201d of the audiotapes \u201cto the extent\u201d she could understand them. \u201cAny parts left blank, marked as xxx or written wrong,\u201d Kogyan noted, were \u201cdue to [her] inability to understand the exact words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The circuit court entered a scheduling order setting the trial date as October 18, 2004. The order required each party to produce exhibit and witness lists ten days before trial and to file objections to those lists no later than five days before trial. Untimely objections, the order stated, would be \u201cdeemed waived absent leave of court for good cause shown.\u201d Shortly after the entry of the scheduling order, the trial date was continued to December 13, 2004. Neither the parties nor the trial court, however, amended the scheduling order to reflect this change.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In another pretrial order, entered in the parallel equitable distribution case, the circuit court directed that all \u201cexhibits admitted at the trial\u201d of the criminal case against Ms. Rahnema \u201cbe transferred\u201d to the annulment case. Prior to the December 13 trial in the annulment action, Dr. Rahnema filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>an exhibit list that included, among other things, all of the \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s exhibits\u201d from the criminal trial as well as the \u201ctranscript of the criminal trial.\u201d Dr. Rahnema also listed as exhibits the <em>de bene esse </em>deposition taken in London and Kogyan\u2019s \u201cOfficial Transcription\u201d she made from the audiotapes recorded in Istanbul.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">C. <em>The Annulment Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Four days before trial, Ms. Rahnema filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the use of the \u201cOfficial Transcription\u201d of the Istanbul witness as a <em>de bene esse </em>deposition. The trial judge asked the parties to address the motion <em>in limine </em>at the start of the trial. Ms. Rahnema argued that the \u201cOfficial Transcription\u201d violated multiple procedural requirements governing the taking and use of foreign <em>de bene esse </em>depositions. <em>See </em>Rules 4:3, 4:5, 4:7 &amp; 4:7A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, Dr. Rahnema argued that Ms. Rahnema\u2019s objections should be deemed untimely pursuant to the pretrial scheduling order.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The trial judge did not rule on the specific procedural objections raised by Ms. Rahnema. Instead, he found the transcription too unreliable to have any evidentiary weight in any event. Kogyan\u2019s \u201cOfficial Transcription,\u201d the trial judge stated, could not \u201cbe relied upon by the Court with any degree of certainty in making a determination that this Court has to make with regard to the very important issue which is before the Court____\u201d The judge came to this conclusion because the document \u201cwas really not a deposition at all, but was an audiotape which was later supposedly, I guess, translated and transcribed subsequent to the actual occurrence of it.\u201d Particularly troublesome for the trial judge was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-10\">the fact that it was taken by audiotape beforehand, [and] we don\u2019t have the audiotapes. There is no way for us to know whether or not the transcription was accurate from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>audiotapes. It\u2019s too unreliable, and the Court is not going to consider it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The \u201cmethod of taking the deposition,\u201d the trial judge concluded, rendered the final product inherently untrustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Dr. Rahnema then sought to introduce into evidence the testimony given by his brother, an 84-year-old Iranian national, during the criminal trial. Ms. Rahnema objected, arguing that this evidence did not satisfy the requirements of the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. In response, Dr. Rahnema took the witness stand and testified that his brother intended to stay in the United States for the annulment trial which was initially scheduled for October 2004. When the trial was continued to December 2004, his brother decided to return to Iran. Dr. Rahnema admitted he did not ask his brother to testify at the rescheduled trial because of concerns about his health. Dr. Rahnema added that he was familiar with correspondence between counsel addressing the possibility of a <em>de bene esse </em>deposition being taken of his brother. No such deposition, however, ever took place. Finding the evidence of unavailability unpersuasive, the trial judge sustained Ms. Rahnema\u2019s objection to the use of the transcript from the criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The next dispute at trial involved Dr. Rahnema\u2019s request that the prosecution exhibits from the criminal trial be admitted in the annulment proceeding. Dr. Rahnema argued that a prior order in the related divorce case \u201ctransferred <em>every exhibit </em>from the criminal trial to this case.\u201d The trial judge agreed, noting that the criminal trial exhibits were \u201call here\u201d allowing him \u201cto consider <em>all of those exhibits.\u201d </em>\u201cAll right, sir,\u201d Dr. Rahnema\u2019s counsel replied. Neither party objected to the trial judge\u2019s decision to consider these exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The trial judge then confirmed his understanding: \u201cSo now I have before me the exhibits previously filed in this suit, <em>additional exhibits filed in the criminal trial of Ms. Rahnema, </em>and an original deposition as previously set forth on the record which was taken in London. Now, with that having been said, what\u2019s next?\u201d It was at this point during the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Dr. Rahnema concedes, that both the prosecution and defense exhibits from the criminal case \u201cwere received into evidence\u201d by the trial judge. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8 (citing JA 497).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Dr. Rahnema then ended his case-in-chief with his only live witness, Armad Askarinan, an Iranian cab company owner living in Sweden. Testifying through an interpreter, Askarinan claimed to be familiar with \u201cmarriage and divorce registry books in Iran\u201d because prior employment in Iran gave him access to such records. He testified that, under Iranian law, a wife could not travel abroad without her husband\u2019s permission. The Iranian passport, he added, would reflect whether such permission had been given. By agreement, the parties then read into evidence a portion of Askarinan\u2019s testimony at Ms. Rahnema\u2019s criminal trial. In it, Askarinan described his visit to the Iranian registry office and his videotaping of Ms. Rahnema\u2019s alleged prior marriage certificate. The videotape was replayed for the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Dr. Rahnema also presented to the trial judge a copy of a discovery order entered in the equitable distribution proceeding. The order directed Ms. Rahnema to produce copies of any passport in her possession. Dr. Rahnema had an incomplete copy of her Iranian passport, as it lacked the information showing her marital status. The failure to produce the entire passport, Dr. Rahnema argued, permitted an adverse inference that the complete passport would show her alleged prior marriage. In response, Ms. Rahnema pointed out that the order had not been entered in the annulment case and, in any event, she did not have her Iranian passport because Dr. Rahnema had taken it years earlier. The trial judge took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Following the close of Dr. Rahnema\u2019s case-in-chief, Ms. Rahnema moved to strike the evidence on the ground that he had not proven bigamy by clear and convincing evidence and thus could not be awarded an annulment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\u201cthe documents that this Court has before it are a part of the criminal proceeding.\u201d Included in those exhibits were statements from Iranian officials declaring the alleged marriage certificate to be a forgery. Ms. Rahnema also contended that the prosecution exhibits from the criminal case should be disregarded due to the lack of any credible authentication or foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Dr. Rahnema\u2019s counsel objected to the motion, arguing that \u201cthe law in Virginia is quite clear there is no such thing as a motion to strike in a chancery case. The chancellors are required to hear all the evidence and then to make a decision.\u201d In any event, Dr. Rahnema argued, the prosecution exhibits at the criminal trial, coupled with the videotape of the documents found in the Iranian registry office, demonstrated the existence of Ms. Rahnema\u2019s prior marriage. Ms. Rahnema\u2019s failure to produce her complete Iranian passport, Dr. Rahnema added, itself created an adverse inference against her on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In response, the trial judge again confirmed that the criminal exhibits had been made part of the evidentiary record by agreement. \u201cLet me make sure we understand each other,\u201d the judge stated. \u201cI think we all agreed what was submitted to the Court in the criminal case was to be made a part of the record?\u201d Dr. Rahnema\u2019s counsel answered, without qualification, \u201cYes, sir, that\u2019s correct.\u201d Ms. Rahnema\u2019s counsel agreed: \u201cThat\u2019s correct. All of that is in____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">After advising counsel he would take the motion to strike under advisement, the trial judge asked Ms. Rahnema\u2019s counsel if he intended to \u201cput on any evidence.\u201d Ms. Rahnema\u2019s counsel replied that he wanted to inventory the contents of the exhibits from the criminal trial. If they all \u201cmatched up with what I have here,\u201d he advised the court, \u201cthat would be it, Judge.\u201d The trial judge then encouraged the parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>double-check the exhibits so that \u201cnobody starts crying foul at the eleventh hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">After a recess, Dr. Rahnema\u2019s counsel stated for the first time that he objected on authentication grounds to the <em>defense </em>exhibits from the criminal case. \u201cEven though everybody agreed that what was in the criminal trial would be put into evidence at this trial,\u201d the trial judge asked, \u201cyou still object to them because they are not authenticated?\u201d Dr. Rahnema\u2019s counsel said yes. Ms. Rahnema\u2019s counsel then stated, if so, he too would \u201cobject to everything that went in the criminal trial for the same reasons.\u201d In response, the trial judge adjourned court with the comment that he had \u201ctried to be patient with this for as long as\u201d he could, but that he intended to consider all the evidence admitted in the case and to render his decision the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The next morning, the trial judge announced he had reached a decision \u201cas the trier of fact.\u201d Based upon all of \u201cthe facts as presented in this case,\u201d the judge held Dr. Rahnema failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Rahnema \u201cwas, in fact, married at the time that she entered into the marriage ceremony\u201d with Dr. Rahnema.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">On appeal, Dr. Rahnema argues that the trial judge (a) excluded evidence that should have been admitted and admitted evidence that should have been excluded, (b) erroneously considered the merits of the case when deciding the motion to strike, and (c) applied an incorrect burden of proof when assessing the evidence of bigamy.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">A. <em>Evidentiary Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">Dr. Rahnema raises three issues concerning the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. We find no reversible error in any of the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">(i) <em>The Exhibits from Ms. Rahnema\u2019s Criminal Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">Dr. Rahnema claims the trial judge erred by admitting the defense exhibits from the criminal trial. We disagree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The trial judge made these exhibits \u201cpart of the record\u201d in reliance on counsel\u2019s representations, which the judge expressly confirmed. A stipulation of counsel, particularly when relied upon by a court, cannot later be unilaterally withdrawn. Trial judges must be able to rely on counsel to make tactical concessions during trial, especially those \u201cdesigned to narrow the issues and expedite the trial or settlement of litigation,\u201d <em>McLaughlin v. Gholson, </em>210 Va. 498, 500, 171 S.E.2d 816, 817 (1970), without the risk of such reliance being undermined later. Once a stipulation is made, \u201cthere can be no objection to it.\u201d <em>Burke v. Gale, </em>193 Va. 130, 137, 67 S.E.2d 917, 920 (1951). The trial court, therefore, did not err in refusing to sustain Dr. Rahnema\u2019s belated objections to the defense exhibits from the criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">(ii) <em>Kogyan\u2019s \u201cOfficial Transcription\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Dr. Rahnema also challenges the trial judge\u2019s decision not to consider Kogyan\u2019s \u201cOfficial Transcription\u201d of the Istanbul audiotapes, offered at trial as a <em>de bene esse </em>deposition. Ms. Rahnema waived her objections to the deposition, Dr. Rahnema contends, by failing to make a timely objection as required by the pretrial scheduling order.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">We find no fault with Dr. Rahnema\u2019s underlying premise. To be effective, pretrial deadlines in Rule 1:18 scheduling orders must be enforced by Virginia trial courts. There is little point in issuing such orders if they amount to nothing more than a juristic bluff \u2014 obeyed faithfully by conscientious litigants, but ignored at will by those willing to run the risk of unpredictable enforcement. The impartial, consistent enforcement of scheduling orders provides systemic benefits to litigants and trial courts alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">We do not agree, however, that this premise has been offended in this case. Even if Ms. Rahnema waived all of her objections to the <em>admissibility </em>of Kogyan\u2019s \u201cOfficial Transcription,\u201d that would not preclude her from arguing that the evidence should be given no probative weight by the factfinder. \u201cA litigant\u2019s failure to raise an evidentiary objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>cannot, <em>ipso facto, </em>enhance the probative weight of evidence that is otherwise incompetent as proof of a particular fact in controversy.\u201d <em>Exxon Corp. v. United States, </em>45 Fed.Cl. 581, 692 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Consequently, if evidence admitted without objection \u201chas no probative force or insufficient probative value to sustain the proposition for which it is offered, the want of objection adds nothing to its worth; and it will not support a finding.\u201d 1 John W. Strong, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 54, at 243 (5th ed. 1999) (footnote omitted). An inattentive litigant, for example, can waive a hearsay objection simply by forgetting to raise it. But he remains free to argue that the hearsay should nonetheless be disregarded <em>in toto </em>because, truth be told, it is still hearsay and thus entitled to little or no evidentiary weight. <em>See, e.g., Marshall v. Kleinman, </em>186 Conn. 67, 438 A.2d 1199, 1201-02 (1982) (observing that unobjected-to evidence remains \u201csubject to any infirmities due to any inherent weaknesses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In this case, the trial judge did not sit merely as the gatekeeper for admitting or excluding evidence. He also served as factfinder. And, in that capacity, the trial judge refused Kogyan\u2019s \u201cOfficial Transcription\u201d not because of any of Ms. Rahnema\u2019s procedural objections (whether waived or not) to its admissibility as a <em>de bene esse </em>deposition. Instead, the judge found the proffered exhibit inherently unreliable and consequently of no use to him in deciding the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The trial judge reached this conclusion primarily because the conspicuous absence of the interview audiotapes made it impossible to check, at any level, the accuracy of the after-the-fact transcription. To be sure, the need for doing so was apparent: Kogyan\u2019s transcription did not identify the language or dialect of the witness; disclose the translation credentials of the interpreter; establish that the interpreter was disinterested and unbiased; or provide any basis for discerning the competence of the putative court reporter (identified only as a Turkish \u201ctranslator\u201d and \u201cnotary public\u201d) who transcribed the interpreter\u2019s English \u201cto the extent\u201d she understood it.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>For these reasons, even if the trial judge erred in failing to treat Ms. Rahnema\u2019s evidentiary objections as waived under the pretrial scheduling order, that error would be at most irrelevant and at best harmless. Any waiver caused by Ms. Rahnema\u2019s untimely objections to the transcription\u2019s admissibility did not preclude the trial judge, as factfinder, from finding the transcription (whether admitted or not) inherently unreliable and thus wholly undeserving of evidentiary weight.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">(iii) <em>Criminal Trial Testimony of Dr. Rahnema\u2019s Brother</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Dr. Rahnema\u2019s brother, an Iranian national, testified against Ms. Rahnema at her criminal trial in August 2004. He intended to stay and testify at the annulment trial, but decided to travel back to Iran after the trial was continued from October to December 2004. Before making the trip home, he stayed with his son who was living in New York. Dr. Rahnema did not take a deposition of his brother. Nor did Dr. Rahnema ask his brother to testify at the rescheduled trial. His brother was an elderly man with health problems, Dr. Rahnema explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">In the annulment proceeding, Dr. Rahnema sought to introduce into evidence his brother\u2019s testimony at the criminal trial, claiming it fell within the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. He argued that his infirm brother, at the time of the annulment trial, was unavailable because he was then outside the reach of Virginia process. The trial judge disagreed and excluded the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Under Virginia law, the \u201cdetermination of the \u2018unavailability\u2019 of a witness is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Sapp v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 415, 423-24, 559 S.E.2d 645, 649 (2002). \u201cThe party offering the testimony bears the burden of establishing the witness\u2019 unavailability.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 335, 347, 533 S.E.2d 22, 28 (2000) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cIn cases involving absent witnesses, we have required \u2018that a sufficient reason be shown why the original witness is not produced; and that it is impossible, fairly speaking, for the person offering the evidence to produce the living witness or to take his deposition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sapp, </em>263 Va. at 424, 559 S.E.2d at 650 (quoting <em>Wise Terminal Co. v. McCormick, </em>107 Va. 376, 379, 58 S.E. 584, 585 (1907)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">By examining whether it was truly \u201cimpossible, fairly speaking\u201d to bring the witness to trial and whether the proponent made a \u201cdiligent inquiry\u201d into that possibility, Virginia law shows \u201ca clear preference for live testimony and cross-examination rather than resorting to recitation of prior testimony.\u201d <em>Sapp, </em>263 Va. at 424, 559 S.E.2d at 650; <em>see also Doan v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 87, 102, 422 S.E.2d 398, 406 (1992) (examining whether proponent exercised \u201creasonable diligence\u201d). \u201cWe have held that reasonable or due diligence is that amount of prudence as is properly to be expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent man under the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>33 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>App. at 347-48, 533 S.E.2d at 29 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In this case, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in rejecting Dr. Rahnema\u2019s assertion of his brother\u2019s unavailability. Dr. Rahnema\u2019s explanation, even if accepted at face value, did not necessarily demonstrate his due diligence. Dr. Rahnema\u2019s concern about his brother\u2019s infirm condition might explain why his brother would not be asked to fly back to the United States. But it does not explain why his brother could not have stayed for the rescheduled trial date or, if returning home was imperative for other reasons, why his brother could not have given a <em>de bene esse </em>deposition prior to leaving the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">B. <em>Ruling on the Merits in Response to a Motion to Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Dr. Rahnema next argues that the trial court improperly addressed the underlying merits of the case in response to the motion to strike, rather than merely determining whether a <em>prima facie </em>case had been demonstrated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On this issue, however, Dr. Rahnema specifically invited the trial judge to skip the motion to strike issue and rule directly on the merits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Asserting that \u201cthe law in Virginia is quite clear there is no such thing as a motion to strike in a chancery case,\u201d Dr. Rahnema argued that the trial judge was \u201crequired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>to hear all the evidence and then to make a decision.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial judge did exactly that. After inquiring about any further evidence and being told nothing more would be offered, the trial judge considered all the evidence and rendered a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Having taken this position with the trial judge, Dr. Rahnema cannot take an opposite position with us on appeal. \u201cThe principle is long standing in Virginia that an appellate court will not \u2018notice error which has been invited by the party seeking to take advantage thereof on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>McBride v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 526, 529, 605 S.E.2d 773, 774 (2004) (citation omitted). No litigant can \u201cbe permitted to approbate and reprobate, ascribing error to an act by the trial court that comported with his representations.\u201d <em>Boedeker v. Larson, </em>44 Va.App. 508, 525, 605 S.E.2d 764, 772 (2004) (quoting <em>Asgari v. Asgari, </em>33 Va.App. 393, 403, 533 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2000)); <em>see also Bomar v.

Pretlow, </em>177 Va. 524, 548-49, 14 S.E.2d 381, 387 (1941). Applying the burden of proof generally applicable to rescission claims in equity\u2014 the clear-and-convincing standard \u2014 the trial judge addressed the merits of the bigamy claim and found Dr. Rahnema\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>evidence unpersuasive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dr. Rahnema argues that a lesser burden of proof, a mere preponderance of the evidence, should govern claims seeking an annulment based upon bigamy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">When a party asserts that a prior marriage renders a later one void as bigamous, \u201cthe second marriage is presumed to be valid.\u201d <em>Parker v. Am. Lumber Corp., </em>190 Va. 181, 185, 56 S.E.2d 214, 216 (1949). It has been described as a \u201cstrong presumption,\u201d <em>DeRyder v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>206 Va. 602, 608, 145 S.E.2d 177, 181 (1965), \u201cone of the strongest disputable presumptions known in law,\u201d <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>169 Or. 650, 131 P.2d 447, 447 (1942).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While the presumption can be rebutted, <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 448, 456, 374 S.E.2d 303, 309 (1988), the rebuttal proof must demonstrate not only a prior marriage, but also that the earlier marriage did not end before the later one began. <em>Parker, </em>190 Va. at 185, 56 S.E.2d at 216; <em>see also Hewitt v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>490 F.Supp. 1358, 1362 (E.D.Va.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Given the strength of the presumption, \u201cmany courts place a special burden of persuasion upon the party attacking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the validity of the second marriage by declaring that the presumption can only be overcome by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.\u201d 2 John W. Strong, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 344, at 449 (5th ed. 1999); <em>see, e.g., Smith v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 1284, 1285-56 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Panzer v. Panzer, </em>87 N.M. 29, 528 P.2d 888, 892 (1974). This principle parallels the general rule accepting \u201cstrong presumptions\u201d unless \u201c\u2018clear and convincing\u2019 evidence has been introduced by the party opposing the presumption which establishes the nonexistence of the presumed fact.\u201d Kent Sinclair <em>et al, Virginia Evidentiary Foundations </em>\u00a7 12.1[B][1], at 145-46 (Supp. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We agree that the clear-and-convincing standard, when applied to annulment claims alleging bigamy, provides the appropriate counterweight to the strong presumption favoring the challenged marriage. The trial court, therefore, did not err in applying this standard to Dr. Rahnema\u2019s annulment claim alleging bigamy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Finding no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s evidentiary decisions, its response to the motion to strike, or its use of the clear-and-convincing standard, we affirm the final judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\">.
