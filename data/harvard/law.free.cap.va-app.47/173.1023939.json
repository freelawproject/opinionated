For the reasons that follow, we reverse two of the three convictions for abduction and the two related firearm charges. The remaining convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In accord with settled standards of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>Yopp v. Hodges, </em>43 Va.App. 427, 430, 598 S.E.2d 760, 762 (2004). So viewed, the evidence in this case establishes the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">A. <em>The December 29, 2002 Robbery and Abduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">At approximately 6:05 a.m. on December 29, 2002, Wiggins entered a Hardee\u2019s fast-food restaurant located in Hampton, Virginia. Wiggins, who was masked and carrying a gun wrapped in a sock, jumped across the counter, pointed the gun at an employee, and said, \u201cMove back.\u201d The employee, along with a co-worker, \u201cmoved back against the wall with [her] hands up.\u201d At that point, Robert Eatman, the shift supervisor, came out of the manager\u2019s office and started to close the door. Eatman saw the two employees with their hands up and said, \u201cOh, shit.\u201d Wiggins then pointed the gun at Eatman and told Eatman to \u201cgive him the money.\u201d Eatman turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>around and, with Wiggins following him, walked approximately seven feet back into the office. Once inside the office, Eatman knelt, opened the safe, and gave Wiggins the night deposit bag containing the money. Wiggins left the office, said, \u201cHave a nice day\u201d to the employees still standing against the wall with their hands up, and left the restaurant. The robbery lasted approximately five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">B. <em>The January 17, 2003 Robbery and Abduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">At approximately 5:30 a.m. on January 17, 2003, Wiggins entered another Hardee\u2019s fast-food restaurant. Wiggins, who was again masked and holding a gun covered by a sock, jumped over the counter, entered the kitchen, and pointed the gun at Jodi Mendoza, manager of the restaurant. Wiggins told Mendoza that \u201che wanted the money.\u201d Mendoza told Wiggins that she needed to go into the office and open the safe. Mendoza then walked approximately five feet to the office, unlocked the office door, entered the office, opened the safe, and handed Wiggins a bag of money. Wiggins then tried to open another safe in the office. When Mendoza told him that it was on an alarm system, he told her to open it for him. Mendoza informed Wiggins that she could not open the second safe for another fifteen minutes because it was on a time delay. Wiggins then left the office and went out the back door of the restaurant. The robbery lasted between five and ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">C. <em>The February 6, 2003 Robbery and Abduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">On the evening of February 6, 2003, Wiggins entered a Subway fast-food restaurant, again masked and carrying a gun wrapped in a sock. Wiggins jumped over the counter and entered the back of the restaurant, where Wiggins told two Subway employees to \u201cgive [him] the money in the registers.\u201d One of the employees, Jamie Drewery, walked approximately twenty-three feet from the back of the restaurant to the front cash register. Wiggins followed. Drewery opened the front cash register, and Wiggins took the money from the register. Wiggins then told Drewery to open the cash register for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>drive-through. Drewery walked over to the drive-through cash register, which was located \u201cseven or eight\u201d feet away, and opened that register as well. Wiggins then took the money from the drive-through cash register. Wiggins also asked Drewery to open the safe, but Drewery told Wiggins that she could not open it because it was on a time delay. Wiggins \u201clooked around a little bit,\u201d and he then left the restaurant through the back door.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">D. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">On December 1, 2003, a grand jury indicted Wiggins for three counts of robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58, three counts of abduction with intent to extort money, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-48, six counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, and three counts of wearing a mask in public, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-422.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">During trial, Wiggins moved to strike the three abduction charges and the three related charges for use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, arguing that the alleged abductions were not \u201cseparate and distinct offense[s]\u201d but were, instead, \u201cjust an intrinsic part of the robber[ies].\u201d The Commonwealth responded that the act of \u201cmoving each of these three managers from one point to another within the store\u201d constitutes an act \u201cseparate and apart and not incidental to the restraint.\u201d The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth and denied the motion to strike, reasoning that the evidence \u201csuggests that the abductions ... were separate and apart and not intrinsic to the robbery,\u201d but further noting that \u201cthe jury, as the fact finders, may come to some different conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Wiggins renewed his motion to strike at the close of all the evidence, and the trial court again denied the motion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>court then instructed the jury that, to establish that Wiggins committed the crime of abduction with the intent to extort money, the Commonwealth \u201cmust prove that there was a detention of the victim greater than the restraint that is intrinsic in a robbery.\u201d During closing arguments, however, Wiggins did not argue to the jury that the abductions were merely incidental to the armed robberies, focusing instead on the defense of mistaken identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The jury found Wiggins guilty of all fifteen counts charged in the indictments, and they recommended that Wiggins be sentenced to twenty years for each of the three counts of abduction with intent to extort money, five years for each of the three counts of robbery, and five years for each of the six counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony, resulting in a total recommended sentence of 105 years in prison. The jury also recommended that Wiggins receive a $50 fine for each of the three counts of wearing a mask in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Defense counsel then moved to set aside the verdict \u201cwith regard to the abduction.\u201d The trial court, noting that \u201cthe matters that the jury had to decide were matters of fact[ ] appropriate for the finder of fact,\u201d denied the motion and imposed the sentence recommended by the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wiggins appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">On appeal, Wiggins argues that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to strike the three abduction charges and the three related firearm charges, contending that his convictions should be reversed because the alleged abductions \u201cwere merely the detentions inherent in carrying out the robberies.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Citing <em>Hoyt v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 489, 605 S.E.2d 755 (2004), Wiggins reasons that, \u201cin each instance, the duration of the detention and the distance of asportation was slight,\u201d the acts \u201cwere not [] separate and apart from the robber[ies],\u201d Wiggins \u201cdid no more than what was necessary to accomplish the robbery,\u201d and he did not \u201cdetain[ ] and move[ ] the robbery victim[s] in order to avoid the detection of the robbery.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we agree that two of the three detentions were incidental to, rather than separate and apart from, the underlying robbery. Accordingly, we reverse two of Wiggins\u2019 convictions for abduction with intent to extort money and the two related convictions for using a firearm in the commission of a felony. We affirm the remaining convictions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-47, provides, in pertinent part, that [a]ny person, who, by force, intimidation or deception, and without legal justification or excuse, seizes, takes, transports, detains or secretes the person of another, with the intent to deprive such other person of his personal liberty or to withhold or conceal him from any person, authority or institution lawfully entitled to his charge, shall be deemed guilty of \u201cabduction\u201d....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, an abduction generally inheres in a robbery because \u201cthere is usually some detention, and often a seizure, of the victim.\u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 519, 526, 328 S.E.2d 572, 576 (1984). To avoid implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Virginia Supreme Court has therefore held that the statutory definition of \u201cabduction\u201d does not encompass \u201cthe kind of restraint which is an intrinsic element of crimes such as rape, robbery, and assault....\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 310, 314, 337 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1985). Rather, for abduction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>be punishable as a separate offense, the detention must be \u201cseparate and apart from, and not merely incidental to, the restraint employed in the commission of the other crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 337 S.E.2d at 713-14; <em>see also Jerman v. Director of the Dept. of Corrections, </em>267 Va. 432, 439, 593 S.E.2d 255, 259 (2004); <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 512, 540-41, 552 S.E.2d 344, 360 (2001); <em>Cardwell v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 501, 511, 450 S.E.2d 146, 152 (1994); <em>Hoyt v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 489, 493, 605 S.E.2d 755, 757 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">This Court has held that the issue of whether the restraint used during an alleged abduction is greater than the restraint inherent in the underlying crime is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Hoyt, 44 </em>Va.App. at 496 n. 4, 605 S.E.2d at 758 n. 4. Thus, the ultimate determination of whether a defendant may be convicted of both abduction and the underlying crime is a question of law. However, pursuant to jury instruction number nine, which stated that the Commonwealth \u201cmust prove that there was a detention of the victim greater than the restraint that is intrinsic in a robbery,\u201d this legal issue was submitted to the jury for determination. Thus, following oral argument, we asked the parties for additional briefing on the issue of whether Wiggins\u2019 failure to object to jury instruction number nine rendered that instruction the \u201claw of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In its supplemental brief, the Commonwealth contends that, by failing to object to the proffered jury instruction, Wiggins implicitly agreed that this issue should be determined by the jury as a factual matter, thereby rendering the jury\u2019s conclusion on the issue one of fact that is binding on appeal if supported by credible evidence in the record. Specifically, the Commonwealth contends that, \u201cbecause the defendant ultimately agreed at trial that the restraint issue was a factual one for the jury to determine, the legal claim that he advances in this Court necessarily is unavailable to him.\u201d Juries, however, are entitled to draw legal conclusions. <em>See, e.g., Terry v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 167, 171, 360 S.E.2d 880, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>882 (1987) (noting that the challenged jury instruction properly \u201cinformed the jury of the types of evidence the jury could use <em>to reach legal conclusions\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). The submission of this legal issue to the jury did not, therefore, automatically \u201cdowngrade\u201d the issue from one of law to one of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Moreover, as noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, \u201c[w]hile the doctrine of invited error remains good law, it simply has no application where, as here, the record shows that a party clearly objected to a specific ruling of the trial court to which error is assigned on appeal, even if the party failed to object to instructions applying or implementing the trial court\u2019s prior ruling.\u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 576, 582, 570 S.E.2d 863, 866 (2002) (holding that this Court erred in determining that an appeal was procedurally barred for failure to object to a proffered jury instruction, reasoning that the appellant had clearly preserved his objections in the form of a motion to strike); <em>see also WJLA-TV v. Levin, </em>264 Va. 140, 159, 564 S.E.2d 383, 395 (2002) (\u201c[W]hen the record is clear that the party is not waiving its objection to the prior ruling, but merely proffering or agreeing to an instruction consistent with the trial court\u2019s prior ruling, the previous objection will not be waived.\u201d); <em>Chawla v. BurgerBusters, Inc., </em>255 Va. 616, 623, 499 S.E.2d 829, 833 (1998) (holding that the appellant preserved an issue for appeal despite his failure to object to a proffered jury instruction implementing a prior ruling of the court, reasoning that \u201ccounsel made clear to the trial court his objection to the [challenged] ruling ... and never abandoned or evidenced an intent to abandon the objection\u201d). Thus, because Wiggins clearly presented his objections to the trial court\u2019s ruling while arguing his motion to strike and his renewed motion to strike, we hold that Wiggins was not required to object to this jury instruction in order to preserve his objections to the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Turning to the merits of the appeal, when deciding whether an abduction is \u201cincidental to another crime,\u201d this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Court \u201cdefer[s] to the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact____\u201d <em>Hoyt, </em>44 Va.App. at 496 n. 4, 605 S.E.2d at 758 n. 4. However, because the issue of whether \u201can abduction is merely incidental to another crime is a question of law,\u201d this Court \u201creview[s] <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of those facts to the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the circumstances of this case, although we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, we conclude that the court erred in holding that two of the three abductions were separate and apart from, rather than incidental to, the underlying robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In <em>Hoyt, </em>we identified several factors that Virginia courts have \u201cemployed on a case-by-case basis\u201d to determine whether an abduction \u201cis merely an incident of another crime.\u201d <em>Hoyt, </em>44 Va.App. at 494, 605 S.E.2d at 757. Specifically, we noted that courts should consider: \u201c \u2018(1) the duration of the detention or asportation,\u2019 \u201d (2) \u201c \u2018whether the detention or asportation occurred during the commission of a separate offense,\u2019 \u201d (3) \u201c \u2018whether the detention or asportation which occurred is inherent in the separate offense,\u2019\u201d and (4) \u2018\u201cwhether the asportation or detention created a significant danger to the victim independent of that posed by the separate offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Berry, </em>604 F.2d 221, 227 (3d Cir.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the December 29 and January 17 abductions (the \u201cHardee\u2019s abductions\u201d) were incidental to the underlying armed robberies. Accordingly, we reverse these two convictions for abduction as well as the two related firearm charges. However, we further conclude that the February 6 abduction (the \u201cSubway abduction\u201d) was not incidental to the underlying armed robbery. Thus, we affirm the third conviction for abduction as well as the related conviction for use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">1. <em>The December 29, 2002 and January 17, 2003 Abductions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">In <em>Hoyt, </em>a panel of this Court reversed a conviction for abduction, reasoning that the detention at issue in that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>was \u201cincidental to [the] commission of [the underlying] robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 605 S.E.2d at 755. Under the circumstances of that case, the defendant, who was masked and armed, entered a \u201cgas station store\u201d and told an employee to \u201clay on the floor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490-91, 605 S.E.2d at 755-56. Hoyt then told another employee to \u201cgive me the money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491, 605 S.E.2d at 756. The employee \u201cwalked approximately ten feet to the cash register, opened the drawer, placed the money in a bag, and handed the bag to Hoyt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hoyt then left the store. The robbery itself \u201clasted no more than five minutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In reversing Hoyt\u2019s conviction for abduction, we noted that \u201cthe duration of the detention and the distance of asportation were slight,\u201d reasoning that \u201cthe robbery lasted no more than five minutes\u201d and the victim \u201cwas forced to walk only ten feet to the cash register.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 605 S.E.2d at 758. We also observed that \u201cthe detention and asportation ... occurred during the commission of the separate offense of robbery, but ... were not acts separate and apart from the robbery itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we noted that \u201cthe detention and asportation of [the victim] [were] inherent in the robbery,\u201d reasoning that, although Hoyt \u201cdetained [the victim] for a few moments by threatening him with a gun and forc[ing] him to move ten feet to the cash register,\u201d he \u201cdid no more than was necessary to accomplish the robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, we observed that \u201cthe detention and asportation here did not pose a danger to [the victim] independent of and significantly greater than that posed by the robbery itself,\u201d nor did the evidence \u201csupport an inference that Hoyt detained and moved [the victim] in order to avoid the detection of the robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 605 S.E.2d at 758-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The circumstances of the two Hardee\u2019s abductions are not significantly different from those presented in <em>Hoyt. </em>First, during each robbery, \u201cthe duration of the detention and the distance of asportation were slight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 605 S.E.2d at 758. Specifically, the first robbery lasted for \u201cfour or five minutes,\u201d and the victim was forced to walk \u201cseven feet\u201d into an office. The second robbery lasted \u201cfive to ten minutes,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>and the victim was forced to walk \u201cfive feet\u201d into an office. As in <em>Hoyt, </em>neither of these victims was forced to move a significant distance, walking instead from one area of the restaurant to another, and neither of the victims was detained for a significant length of time. <em>Cf. Phoung v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 457, 462, 424 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1992) (upholding convictions for robbery and abduction where the defendant tied up the victim \u201cin the kitchen so she could not walk,\u201d dragged the victim \u201cto the staircase,\u201d carried the victim \u201cup the stairs and placed her on the bed,\u201d bound the victim \u201cmore securely,\u201d and then \u201ctook jewelry, money, and other property\u201d from the bedroom, reasoning, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[t]he robbery was remote in time and distance from the initial abduction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Second, the acts allegedly constituting the detentions \u201cwere not acts separate and apart from the robbery itself.\u201d <em>Hoyt, </em>44 Va.App. at 496, 605 S.E.2d at 758. During each of the two robberies, Wiggins singled out one individual, forced that individual to move to a safe, forced the individual to open the safe, took the money, and then fled. Wiggins did not remove any of the employees from the premises or secure any of the employees in a locked room, nor did he force either of the victims to perform an act other than those required to accomplish the robbery itself. <em>Cf. Jerman, </em>267 Va. at 440, 593 S.E.2d at 259 (holding that the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of second-degree murder and abduction where the defendant bludgeoned the victim with a baseball bat, \u201ccarried [the victim\u2019s] body out of the house, through the backyard to the fence, and then tossed him over the fence,\u201d and the victim later died of his injuries, reasoning that the act of removing the victim from the house and throwing him over a fence was \u201cdistinct from\u201d the \u201cphysical attack upon [the victim]\u201d); <em>Cardwell, </em>248 Va. at 511, 450 S.E.2d at 153 (upholding convictions for abduction and robbery where the defendant forced the victim to he facedown on the floor of a car and drove him away from the scene of the robbery, reasoning that \u201cthe transporting of [the victim] from the robbery scene was a detention separate and apart from, and not merely incidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>to, the robbery and was greater than the restraint intrinsic in a robbery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Third, although Wiggins detained each victim \u201cfor a few moments\u201d by threatening them \u201cwith a gun\u201d and forcing them to walk to a cash register or safe, Wiggins \u201cdid no more than was necessary to accomplish the robbery.\u201d <em>Hoyt, </em>44 Va.App. at 496, 605 S.E.2d at 758. Specifically, Wiggins did not tie up or otherwise restrain either of the victims, nor did he use an amount of force that was disproportionate to the robbery itself. <em>Cf.

Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 360 S.E.2d 196 (1987), argues that Wiggins was properly convicted of both robbery and abduction because Wiggins\u2019 conduct constituted \u201ca means of gaining access to the scene or otherwise facilitating the commission of an intended robbery.\u201d Because the issues presented for consideration in <em>Barnes </em>are distinguishable from those presented in this appeal, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In <em>Barnes, </em>the defendant \u201cseized\u201d the victim in the parking lot of a convenience store \u201cand used him as a decoy to gain access to the store which, by [the defendant\u2019s] own admission, he intended to rob.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 360 S.E.2d at 201. Once inside the store, the defendant shot and killed two individuals before fleeing the scene. At trial, the defendant was convicted of capital murder, abduction for pecuniary benefit, attempted robbery, and various related firearm charges. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 360 S.E.2d at 198. On appeal, the defendant argued that his conviction for abduction for pecuniary benefit should be reversed because \u201che released [the victim] once he was inside the store----\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Virginia Supreme Court disagreed, holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for abduction because the defendant\u2019s conduct fell \u201csquarely within the ambit of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 360 S.E.2d at 201. Notably, the defendant in <em>Barnes </em>did not contend that his conviction for abduction was barred because the detention was incidental to the attempted robbery, nor did the Virginia Supreme Court address that issue. Rather, the defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal was that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for abduction. Accordingly, despite the Commonwealth\u2019s argument otherwise, we find <em>Barnes </em>unpersuasive and inapplicable to the issue being resolved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Considering all of the circumstances of this case, we conclude that we are bound by the precedent established in <em>Hoyt </em>and, therefore, hold that the detention of each victim in the two Hardee\u2019s abductions was incidental to the underlying robberies. Thus, we hold that the trial court erred in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Wiggins\u2019 motion to strike these two abduction charges as well as the two related firearm charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">2. <em>The February 6, 2003 Abduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">However, we further hold that the degree of restraint used in the third abduction was greater than, rather than incidental to, the restraint inherent in the underlying robbery. As in the first two robberies, the acts allegedly constituting this third detention \u201cwere not acts separate and apart from the robbery itself,\u201d <em>Hoyt, </em>44 Va.App. at 496, 605 S.E.2d at 758, Wiggins \u201cdid no more than was necessary to accomplish the robbery,\u201d <em>id., </em>and the detention of the victim \u201cdid not pose a danger to [the victim] independent of and significantly greater than that posed by the robbery itself,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 497, 605 S.E.2d at 758-59. During this third incident, however, the victim was forced to walk approximately \u201ctwenty-three feet\u201d to the front cash register and then approximately \u201ceight feet\u201d to the drive-through cash register, for a total of thirty-one feet. The degree of asportation was, therefore, significantly greater during this robbery than it was in <em>Hoyt </em>(ten feet) or either of Wiggins\u2019 prior robberies (seven feet and five feet, respectively)-</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Moreover, although the record does not reflect the exact duration of this third robbery, the record supports the inference that it was of greater length than the prior robberies. Specifically, the victim was forced to walk to two separate cash registers in the store located a significant distance away from the area where the victim was initially standing. After taking the money from both cash registers, Wiggins then asked the victim to open the safe, thereby prompting a conversation during which the victim explained that she could not open the restaurant safe because it was on a time-delay system. Finally, Wiggins \u201clooked around a bit\u201d before leaving the restaurant. Accordingly, a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that the detention of the third victim lasted significantly longer than the detention in <em>Hoyt </em>(five minutes) or the detention in either of Wiggins\u2019 prior robberies (five minutes and \u201cbetween five and ten minutes,\u201d respectively).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Finally, the record reflects that Wiggins\u2019 instructions to the victim dining the Subway robbery contained additional directional elements lacking in his two prior robberies. Specifically, Wiggins told the first victim to \u201cgive him the money,\u201d and he told the second victim that \u201che wanted the money.\u201d Each victim, without additional instruction from Wiggins, then walked over to the office safe and retrieved the money. <em>Cf. Hoyt, </em>44 Va.App. at 491, 605 S.E.2d at 756 (reversing conviction for abduction where the defendant merely told the victim, \u201cgive me the money\u201d). During the Subway robbery, in contrast, Wiggins told the victim to \u201cgive [him] the money <em>in the registers.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). After the victim opened the front cash register, Wiggins then told the victim to open the drive-through cash register as well. By giving these additional directions, Wiggins exercised a greater degree of control over the victim and her exact movements. Thus, when combined with the increased distance of asportation and the greater duration of the detention, this exercise of control rendered the degree of restraint used during this third robbery greater than that strictly necessary to accomplish the robbery itself. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in determining that Wiggins\u2019 conduct during the Subway robbery would support separate convictions for both abduction and robbery because the restraint used was greater than that inherent in the underlying robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Because the detention of the victims was no greater than that necessary to carry out the armed robberies, we hold that the two Hardee\u2019s detentions were incidental to, rather than separate and apart from, the underlying robberies. Accordingly, we reverse two of Wiggins\u2019 three convictions for abduction with intent to extort money, reverse two of his three related convictions for using a firearm in the commission of a felony, and dismiss these four indictments. The remaining convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\n<em>Affirmed, in part, and reversed and dismissed, in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\">. Wiggins was also convicted of three counts of robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58, three additional counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, and three counts of wearing a mask in public, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-422. Those nine convictions are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">. The grand jury also indicted Wiggins for two counts of attempted robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-58 and 18.2-26, and two additional counts of using a firearm while attempting to commit a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Those four indictments were <em>nolle prossed </em>and are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-9\">. Although the \"sentencing summary\u201d at the end of the sentencing order indicates that Wiggins was sentenced to 110 years in prison, the body of the order reflects that Wiggins was actually sentenced to 105 years, specifically, \"Twenty (20) years on each abduction charge, five (5) years on each Robbery charge, five (5) years on each Use of a Firearm charge and a fifty ($50.00) dollar fine on each of the Wearing a Mask in Public [charges].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">.

Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 489, 605 S.E.2d 755 (2004). My disagreement is rather with <em>Hoyt </em>itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Virginia has historically treated the incidental detention issue as one of fact for the jury, subject to the deferential review of Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Analyzing the issue under the heading \u201cSufficiency of the Evidence,\u201d the Virginia Supreme Court in <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 512, 540-41, 552 S.E.2d 344, 360 (2001), found \u201csufficient evidence to support the finding of the jury that Powell used greater restraint than was necessary to commit rape.\u201d <em>Cfi Jerman v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>267 Va. 432, 440, 593 S.E.2d 255, 260 (2004) (finding an acquittal improbable even \u201cif trial counsel had requested a jury instruction stating that the restraint inherent in the assault of [the victim] could not serve as the sole basis for a separate abduction conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">We looked at the incidental detention issue exactly the same way in <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 93, 96, 468 S.E.2d 114, 116 (1996). Citing Code \u00a7 8.01-680, the statutory standard governing appellate review of factual determinations, we held that \u201cthe jury\u2019s finding of an abduction separate and apart from both the robbery and the sexual assault is not plainly wrong and is supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Along the same lines, we held in <em>Coram v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 623, 626, 352 S.E.2d 532, 534 (1987), that \u201cthe record in its entirety sets forth sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the abduction was \u2018separate and apart from, and not merely incidental to\u2019 the crime of attempted rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 310, 314, 337 S.E.2d 711, 714 (1985)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Last year, a footnote in <em>Hoyt </em>retooled the appellate standard of review on the incidental detention issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">Whether an abduction is merely incidental to another crime is a question of law. However, because no two crimes are exactly alike, determining whether an abduction is incidental necessarily requires consideration of the historical facts of each case. We defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact, but we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of those facts to the law. <em>Cf. McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197-98, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (discussing the standard of review applied in search and seizure cases).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\"><em>Hoyt, </em>44 Va.App. at 496 n. 4, 605 S.E.2d at 758 n. 4. Without any further discussion of the subject, <em>Hoyt </em>adopted the <em>McGee </em>standard of review reserved for suppression rulings decided solely by trial judges. <em>McGee, </em>25 Va.App. at 197-98, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (applying the appellate standard of review mandated by <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 698-99, 116 S.Ct 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The <em>McGee </em>standard of review, however, governs only suppression hearings. It cannot be sensibly applied in this context. In criminal jury trials, trial judges do not make findings of historical facts. Neither do juries \u2014 they provide only a general verdict of guilty or not guilty. <em>See Rogers v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 337, 342-43, 362 S.E.2d 752, 755 (1987) (describing the difficulty in determining precisely the jury\u2019s findings as to the incidental nature of the abduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>simply based upon the verdict). Because there are no specific \u201cfindings of historical fact\u201d in criminal jury trials, <em>see ante, </em>at 47 Va.App. at 183, 622 S.E.2d at 778, what <em>Hoyt </em>ends up doing is placing appellate judges in the uncomfortable role of factfinders.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">By adopting this approach, <em>Hoyt </em>has produced an anomaly difficult to describe and harder still to administer. The irony has a certain symmetry to it, though, because <em>Hoyt </em>also invites jurors to render \u201clegal conclusions\u201d in response to jury instructions submitting the \u201clegal issue\u201d to them. <em>Ante, </em>at 47 Va.App. at 182, 622 S.E.2d at 778. I find this concept particularly hard to accept. \u201cIt is, indeed, a maxim of the law, almost coeval with the institution of juries, that it is the office of the judge to respond as to the law, and the jury as to the facts, and few rules are more essential in the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>86 Va. 466, 471, 10 S.E. 745, 747 (1890). \u201cIn this separation of the functions of court and jury is found the chief value, as well as safety, of the jury system.\u201d <em>Sparf v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 51, 106, 15 S.Ct. 273, 295, 39 L.Ed. 343 (1895); <em>see also Sims v. Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 736, 763, 115 S.E. 382, 391 (1922) (Burks, J.) (\u201cIn this State the jury are not judges of the law in criminal cases any more than they are in civil cases.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">I thus concur only in the result in this case, as I believe <em>Hoyt </em>requires me to do.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\">. Other appellate courts likewise treat the incidental detention issue as a question of fact for the jury. <em>See, e.g., People v. Bridges, </em>199 Colo. 520, 612 P.2d 1110, 1117 (1980) (holding that detention \"more than incidental to the commission of the underlying crime is circumstantial evidence of specific intent to kidnap for the factfinder, and a jury could be so instructed\u201d); <em>State v.
