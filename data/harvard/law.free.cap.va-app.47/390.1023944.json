As part of his sentence, Colbert was required to register as a sex offender, pursuant to Code \u00a7 9.1-902(A)(2). On appeal, Colbert contends that the trial court erred by imposing the registration requirement because his solicitations were not directed to an actual minor, but rather to an undercover police ofScer posing as a minor. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">On five separate occasions, Colbert used his computer to solicit sex with someone he thought was a thirteen-year-old girl. Colbert asked to engage in sexual intercourse or oral sodomy on each occasion. The person with whom Colbert corresponded on the Internet was, in fact, an undercover police officer posing as a thirteen-year-old girl. When the police confronted him, Colbert admitted to committing the offenses and subsequently pled guilty to five charges of computer solicitation for sex with a minor, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Upon Colbert\u2019s conviction of the five charges, the trial court sentenced Colbert to four years on each charge, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>sentences to run concurrently, suspended after serving six months in jail. The conditions of Colbert\u2019s suspended sentences were, <em>inter alia, </em>that he be placed on supervised probation for four years after his release from jail; have no unsupervised contact with any juvenile except his own children; have no access to the Internet except for business purposes; and register as a sex offender, pursuant to Code \u00a7 9.1-902(A)(2). Colbert objected to the sex offender registration requirement, which the court imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The sole issue presented on appeal is whether Colbert was required to register as a sex offender, pursuant to subsection (A)(2) of Code \u00a7 9.1-902, because his computer solicitations for sex were directed to an undercover police officer posing as a minor, rather than an actual minor. More specifically, even though Colbert was guilty of computer solicitation for sex with a minor under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) because he had reason to believe he was soliciting a thirteen-year-old girl, <em>see Hix v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 335, 619 S.E.2d 80 (2005) (discussed supra), Colbert asserts that the offender registration requirement is only triggered where there was an actual minor victim, pursuant to the prefatory language of Code \u00a7 9.1-902(A)(2). This is a question of law that involves the interpretation and application of Code \u00a7 9.1-902(A)(2), and, thus, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo. See Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (\u201c \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de </em>novo.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998))).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">As always in such cases, we are guided by well-established principles of statutory construction. \u201c \u2018The proper course [in] all these cases is to search out and follow the true intent of the legislature, and to adopt that sense of the words which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objects of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Rhea, </em>130 Va. 345, 372, 107 S.E. 814, 823 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>(1921) (quoting <em>United States v. Winn, </em>28 F. Cas. 733, 734 (D.Mass.1838)); <em>see also Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Med., </em>14 Va.App. 906, 910, 421 S.E.2d 201, 205 (1992) (explaining that statutory construction\u2019s main purpose is determining legislative intent, \u201c \u2018which, absent constitutional infirmity, must always prevail\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bd. of Supervisors v. King Land Corp., </em>238 Va. 97, 103, 380 S.E.2d 895, 897 (1989))).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Thus, while legislative intent \u201cmust be gathered from the words used, ... unreasonable or absurd results must not be reached by too strict adherence to literal interpretation.\u201d <em>Buzzard v. Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 641, 653, 114 S.E. 664, 667 (1922). In addition, statutes <em>in pari materia </em>must be considered together in construing their various material provisions. <em>Id. </em>This requires that \u201c[t]he literal meaning of separate provisions, if in apparent conflict[,] ... must yield to a reasonable and fair interpretation to be gathered from the context, the subject matter and the reason and spirit of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, \u201c \u2018[a] provision of a section of a statute ought not to receive a mere literal interpretation, when it would contravene the intention of the Legislature apparent from the other sections and provisions thereof....\u2019\u201d <em>Pound v. Dep\u2019t of Game and Inland Fisheries, </em>40 Va.App. 59, 68, 577 S.E.2d 533, 537 (2003) (quoting <em>Tabb v. Commonwealth, </em>98 Va. 47, 56-57, 34 S.E. 946, 949 (1900)). We do not isolate particular words or phrases but rather examine a statute in its entirety. <em>Altice v. Roanoke County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>45 Va.App. 400, 406, 611 S.E.2d 628, 631 (2005). In doing so, we have a \u201cduty to interpret the several parts of a statute as a consistent and harmonious whole so as to effectuate the legislative goal.\u201d <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Bd. of County Supervisors, </em>226 Va. 382, 387-88, 309 S.E.2d 308, 311 (1983) (citation omitted). Furthermore, where applicable, as here, we must keep in mind \u201cthe evil sought to be corrected by the legislature.\u201d <em>Southern Ry. Co. v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 114, 117, 135 S.E.2d 160, 164 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We must begin our analysis with the statutory scheme under which Colbert was required to register as a sex offender. <em>See </em>Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>istry Act (Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-900 to 9.1-920). The express purpose of the Act is \u201cto assist the efforts of law-enforcement agencies and others to protect their communities and families from repeat sex offenders and to protect children from becoming victims of criminal offenders by helping to prevent such individuals from being allowed to work directly with children.\u201d Code \u00a7 9.1-900. The Act also expressly states that it shall be liberally construed to effect its stated purpose. Code \u00a7 9.1-920.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">To provide such assistance, the Act creates a registry in the Commonwealth that requires registration with the Virginia State Police by those convicted of certain sex-related crimes (against both minors and adults) and certain other non-sexual crimes specifically targeted against minors, or those otherwise physically helpless or mentally incapacitated. All of these criminal offenses \u2014 the violation or attempted violation of which trigger the registration requirement upon conviction\u2014 are listed under Code \u00a7 9.1-902, consisting of non-violent (both sexual and non-sexual) offenses under subsections (A)(1), (2) and (3); \u201csexually violent offenses\u201d under subsection (A)(4), as defined therein; and murder, where the victim is a minor, under subsection (A)(5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)(iv), under which Colbert was convicted, is listed under subsection (A)(2) of Code \u00a7 9.1-902, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>A. For purposes of this chapter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\"><em>\u201cOffense for which registration is required </em>\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">2. Where the victim is a minor or is physically helpless or mentally incapacitated as defined in \u00a7 18.2-67.10, a violation or attempted violation of subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-47, clause (i) or (iii) of \u00a7 18.2-48, \u00a7 18.2-67.4, subsection C of \u00a7 18.2-67.5, 18.2-361, 18.2-366, or clause (iv) of subsection B of \u00a7 18.2-374.3;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Colbert points to the prefatory language in this subsection \u2014 \u201c[w]here the victim is a minor\u201d \u2014 in support of his contention that he is not subject to the Act\u2019s offender registration requirement. Colbert argues that, based on the plain meaning of that language, there had to be an actual minor victim in order for the registration requirement to have applied to him upon his conviction. Thus, even though Colbert believed that the undercover law-enforcement officer whom he solicited was a thirteen-year-old girl, and, in doing so, committed five separate criminal offenses of computer solicitation for sex with a minor, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)(iv), Colbert nevertheless contends that he is exempt from the Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Upon a review of Code \u00a7 9.1-902(A)(2)\u2019s prefatory language in its proper context, not in isolation as Colbert would have us view it, and in light of the Act\u2019s explicit statement of legislative purpose, we find that Colbert\u2019s interpretation of that language is without merit. First, under subsection (A)(1) of Code \u00a7 9.1-902, all of the listed substantive offenses are nonviolent sexual offenses, some of which pertain only to offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>against minors, <em>e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-63 (carnal knowledge of a child between thirteen and fifteen years old), while the other offenses are non-specific in terms of the age of the victim, <em>e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-90 (unauthorized entry in a dwelling house with intent to commit rape). In proscribing sex-related criminal conduct, each of the offenses listed under this subsection falls squarely within the scope of the Act. In contrast, the nonviolent offenses listed under subsection (A)(2) consist of both sexual and non-sexual offenses. Only Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)(iv) and 18.2 \u2014 48(iii) (kidnapping a child under the age of sixteen for the purpose of concubinage or prostitution) are limited, by their own terms, to offenses against minors. The other six offenses are non-specific in terms of the victim\u2019s age. Two of these are kidnapping offenses: Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-47(A) (kidnapping), and 18iM8(i) (kidnapping with the intent to extort money or pecuniary benefit). The other four are sexual offenses: Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.4 (sexual battery), 18.2-67.5(0) (attempted sexual battery), 18.2-361(crimes against nature), and 18.2-366 (adultery and fornication by persons forbidden to marry, and incest) (all of which are non-specific in terms of the victim\u2019s age, except for the degree of punishment in the case of incest, under Code \u00a7 18.2-366). And of these sexual offenses, sexual battery and attempted sexual battery are also listed offenses under subsection (A)(1) of Code \u00a7 9.1-902. There, the registration requirement is made applicable to those convicted of either of these two offenses where the offense was committed against an adult, but only upon a third or subsequent conviction of either offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The difference, therefore, in the application of subsections (A)(1) and (A)(2) relative to these two sexual offenses is the classification of the targeted victims; and the fact that, unlike subsection (A)(1), the registration requirement is triggered under subsection (A)(2) upon a single conviction of either offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Thus, in keeping with the scope of the Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and reflecting the Act\u2019s varying applications of the registration requirement according to the targeted victims of the particular offenses, the offender registration requirement for convictions of offenses listed under Code \u00a7 9.1-902(A)(2) is effectively limited to offenses against minors, or otherwise those who are physically helpless or mentally incapacitated, by the prefatory language of this subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">There is no indication, however, in Code \u00a7 9.1-902, or any other part of the Act, that the General Assembly intended by the prefatory language of subsection (A)(2) to modify the elements of the substantive offenses listed in this subsection for purposes of triggering the registration requirement. That language simply implements the Act\u2019s delineation between offenses against adults (addressed elsewhere in Code \u00a7 9.1-902) and offenses specifically targeted against minors, or otherwise those who are physically helpless or mentally incapacitated, for separate treatment under the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the Act\u2019s offender registration requirement was clearly applicable to Colbert upon his conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-874.3(B)(iv), being one of subsection (A)(2)\u2019s listed offenses against minors \u2014 regardless of the fact that there was no actual minor victim, as that was not a necessary element of the offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Hix, </em>270 Va. 335, 619 S.E.2d 80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>(affirming defendant\u2019s conviction of computer solicitation for sex with a minor, in absence of an actual minor victim, where defendant believed he was soliciting a thirteen-year-old girl, but was in reality soliciting an undercover police officer); <em>Brooker v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 609, 587 S.E.2d 732 (2003) (also affirming defendant\u2019s conviction for same crime arising out of similar circumstances, where defendant believed he was soliciting a twelve-year-old girl).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Our construction of Code \u00a7 9.1-902(A)(2) in this case is consistent with the Act\u2019s manifest remedial purpose of protecting children from sex offenders.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cCriminal solicitation involves the attempt of the accused to incite another to commit a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Branche v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 480, 490, 489 S.E.2d 692, 697 (1997). The solicitation offense presented here, computer solicitation for sex with a minor, as a listed offense, falls expressly within the evil contemplated by the Act; and therefore those who have been convicted of the offense are among the offenders subject to the Act\u2019s registration requirement, which seeks to \u201ccorrect [the] evil\u201d \u2014 sex offenses targeted against children (among other offenses and victims addressed under the Act). <em>Baldwin v. Commonwealth, </em>203 Va. 570, 574, 125 S.E.2d 858, 861 (1962) (construing Uniform Narcotic Drug Act in light of Act\u2019s purpose \u201cto correct an evil \u2014 the illegal traffic in narcotics\u201d). As such, it is of no moment that in the commission of this sexual solicitation offense the defendant\u2019s target is in reality an undercover law-enforcement officer, \u201can extraneous circumstance unknown to [the defendant] and beyond his control.\u201d <em>Hix, </em>270 Ya. at 346, 619 S.E.2d at 86. \u201c Whether the targeted victim is a child or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>an undercover agent, the defendant\u2019s conduct, intent, culpability, and dangerousness are all exactly the same.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Doe, </em>855 A.2d 1100, 1106 (D.C.2004)). <em>See generally, </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 6.1, at 528 (3d ed.2000) (explaining reasons for criminalizing solicitation, with the paramount reason being that it \u201cpermits the criminal justice process to deal with individuals who have indicated their dangerousness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Furthermore, it would clearly lead to an absurd result were the Act\u2019s registration requirement not extended to a defendant such as Colbert, upon a conviction of computer solicitation for sex with a minor, based solely upon a fortuity beyond his control \u2014 that the one receiving his sexual solicitations was actually an adult, despite his intent to target a child. In that regard, he is indistinguishable from one committing the same offense whose sexual solicitations were actually received by a minor. In the words of <em>Hix, </em>they are \u201cexactly the same.\u201d <em>Hix, </em>270 Va. at 346, 619 S.E.2d at 86 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Yet, the Act\u2019s registration requirement would apply to one, but not to the other, under Colbert\u2019s interpretation of the Act. <em>See Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 111, 116, 597 S.E.2d 84, 87 (2004) (noting that \u201cour case law uses the phrase \u2018absurd result\u2019 to describe situations in which the law would be internally inconsistent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\"><em>Hix, </em>in fact, presents another such example. In <em>Hix, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed Hix\u2019s convictions for both computer solicitation for sex with a minor and attempted indecent liberties with a minor, where, as here, Hix believed he was soliciting sex with a thirteen-year-girl, but was actually communicating via the Internet with an undercover agent of the Virginia State Police. In doing so, the Court rejected the defense of impossibility, which Hix raised in defense to the attempt crime.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court explained that \u201c[b]y definition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>crime of attempted indecent liberties required only that Hix make certain proposals or invitations to the [targeted] victim.\u201d <em>Hix, </em>270 Va. at 347, 619 S.E.2d at 87. Thus, the Court concluded, \u201c[t]he absence of the actual child in [the] case [had] no bearing on the crime of attempt.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Bloom v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 364, 372, 542 S.E.2d 18, 21-22, <em>affd, </em>262 Va. 814, 554 S.E.2d 84 (2001) (same holding regarding crime of attempted indecent liberties in nearly identical case). <em>See generally </em>Audrey Rogers, <em>New Technology, Old Defenses: Internet Sting Operations and Attempt Liability, </em>38 U. Rich. L.Rev. 477 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">As <em>Hix </em>makes clear, use of a computer to solicit sex with one believed to be a minor, though in reality there was no minor, constitutes a violation of both Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)(iv) and Code \u00a7 18.2-370. It would be inconsistent, therefore, to impose the offender registration requirement on one convicted of attempted indecent liberties with a minor, in the absence of an actual minor victim, and yet not impose the registration requirement on one convicted of computer solicitation for sex with a minor, where there also was no actual minor victim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The prefatory language in Code \u00a7 9.1-902(A)(2) at issue here does not dictate, and should not be construed to yield, such a result. \u201c \u2018[W]here a particular construction of a statute will result in an absurdity, some other reasonable construction which will not produce the absurdity will be found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Auer v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 637, 651, 621 S.E.2d 140, 147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>(2005) (quoting <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>180 Va. 36, 41, 21 S.E.2d 721, 723 (1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Finally, we note that courts in at least two other states have addressed the issue here presented on essentially the same facts, and held in each case that the defendant was required to register as a sex offender under the state\u2019s statutory scheme for sex offender registration. <em>See Spivey v. State, </em>274 Ga.App. 834, 619 S.E.2d 346 (2005); and <em>Michigan v. Meyers, </em>250 Mich.App. 637, 649 N.W.2d 123 (2002). The computer solicitations in both <em>Spivey </em>and <em>Meyers </em>were charged as attempt crimes (like <em>Hix </em>as to the attempted indecent liberties offense). <em>Spivey, </em>619 S.E.2d at 348; <em>Meyers, </em>649 N.W.2d at 125. As such, the court\u2019s statutory analysis in each case focused in part on rejecting the defendant\u2019s defense of impossibility, which Colbert does not assert.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The courts in <em>Spivey </em>and <em>Meyers </em>concluded that when the defendant\u2019s intent was to solicit sex with a minor, it would be contrary to clear legislative intent to hold the defendant exempt from the sex offender registration requirement. <em>Spivey, </em>619 S.E.2d at 352; <em>Meyers, </em>649 N.W.2d at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision requiring Colbert, upon his conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)(iv), to register as a sex offender pursuant to Code \u00a7 9.1-902(A)(2) as a condition of his suspended sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\">. When Colbert committed the offenses in May 2004, Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)(i) provided that a person eighteen years old or older was prohibited from using a computer to solicit \"any person he [knew] or [had] reason to believe [was] a child less than 18 years of age\u201d for any activity in violation of, among other offenses, Code \u00a7 18.2-370. Subsection (A) of Code \u00a7 18.2-370, in turn, prohibited an adult from taking indecent liberties with a child under fourteen years old, including, <em>inter alia, </em>a proposal to engage in an act of sexual intercourse or sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) was later amended in 2004, moving the reference to Code \u00a7 18.2-370 from subsection (B)(i) to (B)(iv), a new subsection, which specifically references \"any violation of subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-370.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)(iv). <em>See </em>2004 Acts, cc. 414, 444. At the same time (prior to Colbert\u2019s conviction), Code \u00a7 9.1-902(A)(2), the sex offender registration statute, was amended to include a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)(iv) as a trigger to the registration requirement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\">. This approach to construction of the Act is consistent with this Court\u2019s holding that the Act is regulatory, not penal, in its implementation of the remedial purpose of \u201d[p]rotecting the public and preventing crimes\u201d by \" \u2018helping law enforcement agencies keep tabs on [sex] offenders [among others].\u2019 \u201d <em>Kitze v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 213, 217, 475 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1996) (quoting <em>Artway v. New Jersey, </em>81 F.3d 1235, 1265 (3d Cir.1996)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\">. The significance of these distinctions is that those convicted of offenses classified as \u201csexually violent\u201d under Code \u00a7 9.1-902 are required to register as a sex offender for life, while all other offenders subject to the Act are required to register for a period of ten years. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9.1-908. In terms of classification, several sex-related offenses are classified as \u201csexually violent\u201d upon a single conviction, e.g., Code \u00a7 18.2-61 (rape) (all of which offenses are listed under paragraph 1 of Code \u00a7 9.1-902's definition of \"sexually violent offense\u201d). On the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>hand, several other sexual offenses listed under subsections (A) and (B) of Code \u00a7 9.1-902 are deemed \u201csexually violent\u201d upon multiple convictions of those offenses (all of which are listed under paragraph 2 of Code \u00a7 9.1-902\u2019s definition of \"sexually violent offense\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b442-5\">. Furthermore, where the targeted victims are those specified under subsection (A)(2), these two offenses, like most of the other sexual offenses listed under subsection (A)(2), are deemed to be \"sexually violent offense[s]\u201d under Code \u00a7 9.1-902 upon two or more convictions of either offense, or any of a number of other sexual offenses listed under paragraph 2 of the definition of \"sexually violent offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\">. If not for the limiting prefatory language of subsection (A)(2), the registration requirement would apply to the kidnapping of adults for two of the three kidnapping offenses listed under this subsection, i.e., Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-47(A) and 18.2 \u2014 48(i), which would clearly exceed the scope of the Act, with these being non-sexual offenses against adults.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\">. As discussed above, not only does the Act in various instances treat different offenses differently in its application of the registration requirement, in instances of sexual battery and attempted sexual battery, for example, different treatment is applied even to the same offenses, depending upon the classification of the targeted victims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\">. See <em>supra </em>footnote 1 (explaining, <em>inter alia, </em>that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)(iv) is violated where defendant either knew or had \u201creason to believe\u201d that he was soliciting sex with a minor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\">. In this regard, the United States Supreme Court recently observed that \u201c[s]ex offenders are a serious threat in this Nation. The victims of sex assault are most often juveniles, and when convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be re-arrested for a new rape or sex assault.\u201d <em>Connecticut v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 4, 123 S.Ct. 1160, 1163, 155 L.Ed.2d 98 (2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, every state \"has responded to these facts by enacting a [statutory scheme] designed to protect its communities from sex offenders and to help apprehend repeat sex offenders.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\">. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Hix,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">\"[Ilegal impossibility occurs when a defendant\u2019s actions, even if fully carried out exactly as he intends, would not constitute a crime. Factual impossibility occurs when the actions intended by a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>dant are proscribed by the criminal law, but a circumstance or fact unknown to the defendant prevents him from bringing about the intended result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsW\"><em>Hix, </em>270 Va. at 342, 619 S.E.2d at 84 (quoting <em>Parham v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 633, 636, 347 S.E.2d 172, 173-74 (1986)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\">. Similar inconsistencies would also result in relation to a number of other listed offenses under Code \u00a7 9.1-902, committed as attempt crimes, where there was no actual victim by virtue of the fact that the substantive offense was not completed, but rather only a \"slight act done in furtherance of [the defendant\u2019s] intent\" to commit the crime. <em>Fortune v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 225, 229, 416 S.E.2d 25, 28 (1992) (citation omitted) (explaining that such is all that is required for an overt act in an attempt crime where intent has been shown).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\">. In rejecting the impossibility defense, both courts applied the same reasoning relative to the sex offender registration statutes as did our Supreme Court in <em>Hix. </em>The holding in all three cases was that while legal impossibility was a defense, factual impossibility (as in the instant case) was not a valid defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
