On appeal, employer contends the evidence is insufficient to prove claimant\u2019s GERD is causally related to his compensable industrial injury. It contends further that, even if the GERD is causally related, it is a consequence of a compensable consequence and, thus, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>causal connection is too attenuated to be covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. For the reasons stated, we find the commission erred in finding the necessary causal connection between claimant\u2019s industrial injury and his GERD. Thus, we reverse the commission\u2019s award of medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On September 6, 2000, while working as a painter for employer, claimant fell twelve feet from a ladder onto a wall, injuring his back.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was diagnosed with \u201cT8 through LI fractures\u201d and \u201cthoracic spinal cord contusion with an ASIA level B paraplegia.\u201d He received emergency treatment and spent five weeks in a rehabilitation facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">While in the rehabilitation facility, claimant received numerous medications for pain, muscle spasms, and insomnia. He also was prescribed various medications for indigestion, nausea, bloating, and gas, including Famotidine, Maalox, Simethicone, and a \u201cGI cocktail\u201d of \u201clidocaine viscous\u201d and \u201cdonnatal elixir.\u201d On claimant\u2019s discharge from the rehabilitation hospital on October 17, 2000, he was instructed to continue taking numerous medications for pain. He was also prescribed Protonix, a drug similar to Nexium, to be taken as needed. Finally, he was \u201cinstructed ... to wear a soft corset\u201d and \u201cto use his wheelchair as provided with no unassisted ambulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Pursuant to a commission award entered May 21, 2001, claimant received medical benefits and ongoing temporary total disability benefits beginning September 7, 2000. In September 2002, claimant began treatment with Dr. Robert L. Muller, a licensed clinical psychologist. Dr. Muller noted claimant experienced chronic pain and had significant depression and anxiety secondary to his medical problems and permanent disability. Claimant obtained treatment from Dr. Muller intermittently through at least January 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In 2004, nearly 4 years after the injury, claimant was initially diagnosed with GERD. On June 18, 2004, family physician Dr. William R. Dandridge prescribed Nexium for the treatment of claimant\u2019s GERD. Claimant sought payment from the employer for the prescription, and when employer denied coverage, claimant sought a ruling by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Medical evidence before the commission included statements from several of claimant\u2019s treating physicians. Dr. Alan Alfano, one of the physicians who treated claimant at the rehabilitation facility shortly following his injury, was asked, \u201c[Pjlease advise of your opinion as to whether or not Mr. Marshall\u2019s GERD is a result of his back injury____\u201d In response, Dr. Alfano opined on July 15, 2004, that \u201cI <em>don\u2019t </em>believe that [claimant\u2019s] GERD <em>is [djirectly </em>caused by his [spinal cord injury]. However, I do believe that it is <em>indirectly </em>related to his injury in that it is likely exacerbated by stress. I have referred the treatment of his GERD to his [primary care physician].\u201d (Underlining in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">On July 27, 2004, Dr. Martin D. Katz, a partner of Dr. Dandridge, opined as follows: \u201c[Claimant] had no history of gastric reflux or gastric ulcer prior to his fall in September of 2000. The emotional and physical stress he endures everyday as a result of his injuries from that fall may have caused his present gastrointestinal problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Claimant also obtained an opinion from Dr. Muller, his treating licensed clinical psychologist. On August 2, 2004, Dr. Muller wrote: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">Mr. Marshall asked me to comment on his recent diagnosis of an acid reflux disorder. The past few years Mr. Marshall has been experiencing significant anxiety &amp; depression stemming from his physical disabilities and change of life. His stress level certainly must be considered as an etiological factor for the acid reflux &amp; also considered to significantly exacerbate his symptoms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">In a determination made on the record, the deputy commissioner found the medical opinions of Drs. Muller and Alfano \u201cpersuasive in implicating stress caused by the work accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>as a partial cause or exacerbating cause of the claimant\u2019s GERD.\u201d The deputy also rejected employer\u2019s argument that claimant\u2019s GERD nevertheless was not covered because it was a consequence of a compensable consequence. Because claimant\u2019s compensable back injury caused symptoms of emotional and physical stress, which, in turn, caused or aggravated claimant\u2019s GERD, the deputy held the GERD was a compensable consequence directly linked to the original injury. The deputy further opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">Our decision in the present matter turns upon a rather subtle distinction. Had we found that the GERD condition causing the need for the disputed medication was caused by depression resulting from physical disabilities and pain resulting from the work accident, we would have ruled against the claimant. This chain of causation is similar to the brain injury resulting from depression caused by the physical injury to the claimant\u2019s wrist caused by the work accident in <em>Paul Johnson Plastering [v. Johnson, </em>265 Va. 237, 576 S.E.2d 447 (2003)]. In the present matter, however, we find that the GERD condition is directly caused or aggravated, at least in part, by emotional and physical stress resulting from the work injury. Put another way, this is not a case where stress from the physical injury causes depression which, in turn, causes GERD. Rather, the stress directly causes (or aggravates or exacerbates) the GERD.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">On employer\u2019s request for review, the commission unanimously affirmed, agreeing with the deputy\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. It relied on the decision in <em>Berglund Chevrolet, Inc. v. Landrum, </em>43 Va.App. 742, 601 S.E.2d 693 (2004), in which an employer was held responsible for a prescription to treat erectile dysfunction caused, at least in part, by pain and medicines related to a compensable work accident. It also relied on case law holding that where stress from a work accident causes depression, that depression is covered as a compensable consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Employer noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">An accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of a claimant\u2019s employment is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See, e.g., Amoco Foam Prods. Co. v. Johnson, </em>257 Va. 29, 32, 510 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1999). The \u201ccausal connection\u201d necessary for compensability \u201cis established when it is shown that an employee has received a compensable injury which materially aggravates or accelerates a pre-existing latent disease.\u201d <em>Justice v. Panther Coal Co., </em>173 Va. 1, 6-7, 2 S.E.2d 333, 336 (1939), <em>cited with approval in Ohio Valley Constr. Co. v. Jackson, </em>230 Va. 56, 58, 334 S.E.2d 554, 555 (1985). The disease caused or aggravated may be physical or emotional. For example, when the original injury produces stress, thereby causing depression or aggravating a pre-existing case of depression or some other emotional or mental condition, the resulting disability is compensable. <em>Yellow Freight Sys. v. Robinson, </em>37 Va.App. 436, 441, 559 S.E.2d 381, 383 (2002). Generally speaking, an employer\u2019s liability for an industrial injury extends to \u201c \u2018all the medical consequences and <em>sequelae </em>that flow from the primary injury.\u2019\u201d <em>American Filtrona Co. v. Hanford, </em>16 Va.App. 159, 163, 428 S.E.2d 511, 513 (1993) (quoting 1 Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 13.11 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In keeping with this principle, the Supreme Court has adopted the doctrine of compensable consequences. <em>Immer &amp; Co. v. Brosnahan, </em>207 Va. 720, 152 S.E.2d 254 (1967). Under this doctrine, a covered employee who suffers a second injury that bears a sufficient \u201ccausal connection\u201d to the first injury is entitled to the protections of the Act for the second injury, as well. <em>Amoco Foam Prods., </em>257 Va. at 32, 510 S.E.2d at 444. \u201c When the primary injury is shown to have arisen out of and in the course of employment, every natural consequence that flows from the injury likewise arises out of the employment, unless it is the result of an independent intervening cause attributable to claimant\u2019s own intentional conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Imperial Trash Serv. v. Dotson, </em>18 Va.App. 600, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>606-07, 445 S.E.2d 716, 720 (1994) (quoting <em>Morris v. Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, 283, 348 S.E.2d 876, 879 (1986)). Under these circumstances, \u201cthe second injury is treated as if it occurred in the course of and arising out of the employee\u2019s employment.\u201d <em>Leonard v. Arnold, </em>218 Va. 210, 214, 237 S.E.2d 97,100 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">For example, where a claimant with a compensable industrial injury suffers an additional injury in an automobile accident while traveling \u201cto or from a doctor\u2019s office for the treatment of [the] work-connected injury,\u201d the second injury is \u201csufficiently causally related to the employment by the mere fact that [the] work-connected injury was the cause of the journey.\u201d <em>Brosnahan, </em>207 Va. at 722-23, 152 S.E.2d at 255-56. This is so even where the direct cause of the automobile accident is a pre-existing medical condition of the employee that is unrelated to the original industrial injury. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 152 S.E.2d at 258. A second injury also is considered a compensable consequence of the original industrial injury when weakness from the original injury precipitates a fall that causes the second injury. <em>Bartholow Drywall Co. v. Hill, </em>12 Va.App. 790, 407 S.E.2d 1 (1991) (holding wrist injury compensable consequence when claimant with compensable back injury fell as result of residual back weakness).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The Supreme Court has prescribed certain limits to the doctrine of compensable consequences. In <em>Amoco Foam Prods., </em>the Court considered whether a claimant may recover for a \u201ccompensable consequence of a compensable consequence,\u201d and decided a claimant could not. 257 Va. at 31, 510 S.E.2d at 444. The claimant in <em>Amoco Foam Prods, </em>suffered a compensable left ankle injury in 1992, and in 1994, while the claimant was recovering from surgery on her left ankle, the ankle gave way, causing injury to her right knee. <em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 510 S.E.2d at 443. The commission determined the 1994 right knee injury was a compensable consequence of the 1992 left ankle injury, and the employer did not appeal that determination. <em>Id. </em>at 31, 510 S.E.2d at 443. In 1995, due to ongoing pain from the 1994 right knee injury, the claimant fell again, causing a new injury to her right knee. <em>Id. </em>On these facts, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Supreme Court held \u201c[the 1995] injury did not arise out of the employment because there is absence of a causal connection between the incidents of claimant\u2019s employment and the 1995 injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 510 S.E.2d at 445. The occurrence of the 1994 injury, although causally related to the 1992 injury, was sufficient to break the causal connection between the 1992 and 1995 injuries. <em>Id. </em>Essentially, <em>Amoco Foam Prods., </em>found that if \u201cA,\u201d being the compensable injury, caused \u201cB,\u201d and \u201cB\u201d caused \u201cC,\u201d then \u201cC\u201d is not a compensable consequence. Only if \u201cA\u201d caused \u201cC\u201d can claimant recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The Court applied these same limitations in <em>Paul Johnson Plastering v. Johnson, </em>265 Va. 237, 576 S.E.2d 447 (2003). The claimant in that case suffered a compensable injury to his wrist and back in 1990 and subsequently was diagnosed with \u201cchronic depression\u201d and \u201ca major depressive disorder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 576 S.E.2d at 449. In 1995 he was diagnosed with a brain injury, and in 1998, he was found to be permanently and totally disabled as a result of his wrist, back, and brain injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 240, 576 S.E.2d at 449. Johnson contended his \u201cdisability resulted from a structural change in his brain or a brain injury that developed from his depression which in turn was caused by the injury to his wrist.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 241, 576 S.E.2d at 450. The Court held that, under <em>Amoco Foam Prods., </em>if the claimant\u2019s wrist injury caused depression and the depression, in turn, caused the claimant\u2019s brain injury, \u201cthe brain injury is not compensable because, under this theory, there is no direct causal link between that brain injury and the original industrial accident injury, the wrist injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 576 S.E.2d at 452. The original injury to claimant\u2019s back and wrist was \u201cA.\u201d The depression was \u201cB,\u201d and the brain injury was \u201cC.\u201d The Supreme Court found that while \u201cA\u201d caused \u201cB\u201d and \u201cB\u201d caused \u201cC,\u201d no evidence indicated \u201cA\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>caused \u201cC.\u201d As a result, the Court held the claimant was not entitled to compensation for the brain injury. <em>Id. </em>at 245, 576 S.E.2d at 452.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Our decision in <em>Berglund Chevrolet, Inc. v. Landrum, </em>43 Va.App. 742, 601 S.E.2d 693 (2004), can be explained with the \u201cA, B, C\u201d analysis. Landrum suffered a compensable back injury (\u201cA\u201d). As a direct result of that back injury, Johnson suffered from \u201cmajor depression\u201d (\u201cB\u201d) and was prescribed anti-depression medications, which, in part caused erectile dysfunction (\u201cC\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 747, 601 S.E.2d at 695. His doctor concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">Mr. Landrum is regularly followed through our office for complications of a closed head injury that occurred on June 8, 1990 with associated chronic headaches. He, in addition, has a history of back injuries associated with both the headaches and back pain, a chronic pain syndrome/complex regional pain disorder. As a result of the combination of these problems and the medications used to treat them, he has difficulty with erectile dysfunction, improved with Viagra. It is difficult to blame a specific medication or injury and it is likely that it is the combination of both injuries and his medications that have contributed to his sexual dysfunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 747, 601 S.E.2d at 696. We held the doctor \u201cattributed Landrum\u2019s sexual dysfunction (and, thus, his need for Viagra) to the original workplace injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752, 601 S.E.2d at 698. We further concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">Dr. Daugherty focused on the combination of the \u201cchronic pain syndrome/complex regional pain disorder\u201d caused in part by the workplace accident and \u201cthe medications used to treat them.\u201d In his view, the causal chain was not interrupted by any intervening accidents, unrelated injuries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>idiopathic conditions, or causal influences for which Land-rum should bear responsibility. Finding Dr. Daugherty\u2019s opinion persuasive, the commission concluded \u201cthe evidence predominates in establishing that the claimant has developed sexual/erectile dysfunction (and a need for Viagra), at least <em>in part, </em>as a <em>direct consequence </em>of the workplace injury to his back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Thus, in <em>Berglund, </em>the back injury (\u201cA\u201d) was a direct cause of the erectile dysfunction (\u201cC\u201d). It was not that the back injury caused depression, which in turn caused the dysfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">CAUSATION AND COMPENSABLE CONSEQUENCE</p>\n<p id=\"AIB\">The commission\u2019s determination regarding causation is a finding of fact. <em>Marcus v. Arlington County Bd. of Supers., </em>15 Va.App. 544, 551, 425 S.E.2d 525, 580 (1993). A finding of causation need not be based exclusively on medical evidence, and a claimant is not required to produce a physician\u2019s medical opinion in order to establish causation. <em>Dollar Gen. Store v. Cridlin, </em>22 Va.App. 171, 176-77, 468 S.E.2d 152, 154r-55 (1996). Causation of a medical condition may be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence, including medical evidence or \u201cthe testimony of a claimant.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 176, 468 S.E.2d at 154; <em>see Lee County Sch. Bd. v. Miller, </em>38 Va.App. 253, 260, 563 S.E.2d 374, 378 (2002). Any medical opinion offered into evidence \u201cis not necessarily conclusive, but is subject to the commission\u2019s consideration and weighing.\u201d <em>Hungerford Mech. Corp. v. Hobson, </em>11 Va.App. 675, 677, 401 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991). In determining whether credible evidence exists to support the commission\u2019s findings of fact, \u201cthe appellate court does not retry the facts, reweigh ... the evidence, or make its own determination of the credibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the witnesses.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991). Thus, unless we can say as a matter of law that claimant failed to sustain her burden of proving causation, the commission\u2019s findings are binding and conclusive upon us. <em>Marcus, </em>15 Va.App. at 551, 425 S.E.2d at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Employer contends that, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Amoco Foam Prods, </em>and <em>Paul Johnson Plastering, </em>the connection between claimant\u2019s back injury and his subsequent development of GERD is too attenuated to provide the necessary causal link. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We first must review the medical testimony to determine whether the facts support the commission\u2019s finding. It should be noted neither the deputy nor the commission found the original back injury caused the GERD condition. The deputy stated, \u201c[W]e find that the GERD condition is directly caused or aggravated, at least in part, by emotional and physical stress resulting from the work injury.\u201d The commission, in awarding benefits, concluded, \u201cFurther as the deputy commissioner noted, where stress from the work accident causes depression, case law uniformly holds the [employer] responsible in that situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">This is not the correct legal standard as set forth in <em>Amoco Foam Prods, </em>and <em>Paul Johnson Plastering. </em>The commission only related stress/depression to the GERD condition. Nowhere in the opinions is a finding that the original injury (\u201cA\u201d) caused the GERD condition (\u201cC\u201d). The record before the commission only showed that the original injury (\u201cA\u201d) caused the depression/stress (\u201cB\u201d), which in turn caused the GERD condition (\u201cC\u201d). This is the very causation pattern rejected by <em>Amoco Foam Prods, </em>and <em>Paul Johnson Plastering.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The evidence from the treating physicians, rather than proving causation, as the dissent suggests, indicates the error of the commission\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">When invited to comment on the relationship between claimant\u2019s GERD and his back injury, Dr. Alfano specifically concluded that there was no direct causation between the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>and the GERD. Thus, Dr. Alfano\u2019s medical opinion affords no basis for causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Dr. Katz indicated, \u201c[T]he emotional and physical stress [claimant] endures everyday as a result of his injuries from the fall <em>may </em>have caused his present gastrointestinal problems.\u201d (Emphasis added). The word \u201cmay\u201d is insufficient to prove causation. \u201cMay\u201d is defined as \u201cto express possibility.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>811 (2d ed.1997). \u201cA medical opinion based on a \u2018possibility\u2019 is irrelevant, purely speculative and hence, inadmissible.\u201d <em>Spruill v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 475, 479, 271 S.E.2d 419, 421 (1980). <em>See also Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Campbell, </em>7 Va.App. 217, 224, 872 S.E.2d 411, 416 (1988) (\u201c[I]f the expert medical witnesses cannot testify that it is at least more probable than not that the disease arose out of and in the course of employment, compensation must and should be denied, not because the law requires more of medicine than it can produce, but because the law requires more than simply proof that the disease \u2018might\u2019 have been caused by a particular result.\u201d). Again, Dr. Katz\u2019s finding establishes no causation between the original injury and the GERD condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Dr. Muller found claimant \u201chas been experiencing significant anxiety and depression stemming from his physical disabilities and his stress level certainly must be considered as an etiological factor for the acid reflux and also considered to significantly exacerbate his symptoms.\u201d Dr. Muller, at best, opines the original injury (\u201cA\u201d) caused the stress/depression (\u201cB\u201d), which in turn caused the GERD condition (\u201cC\u201d). Nothing in Dr. Muller\u2019s opinion can be interpreted to indicate the original back injury was a direct cause of the GERD condition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The dissent points to the fact that during claimant\u2019s initial hospitalization for the original injury, he was prescribed medication for indigestion, gas, nausea, and bloating.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The discharge summary indicates claimant was also prescribed Protonix, an acid blocker medication similar to Nexium. However, nothing in the record indicates that indigestion, nausea, bloating, and gas are symptoms of GERD. Nothing in the discharge summary indicates any symptoms of GERD, nor a diagnosis of GERD, nor any referral for treatment of a GERD condition. While Protonix is an acid blocker, as is Nexium, there is no medical evidence indicating that Protonix was prescribed for a GERD condition.

Johnson, </em>257 Va. 29, 510 S.E.2d 443 (1999), and <em>Paul Johnson Plastering v. Johnson, </em>265 Va. 237, 576 S.E.2d 447 (2003), that the connection between claimant\u2019s back injury and his subsequent development of GERD is too attenuated to permit coverage under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. I would hold credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s GERD is caused or exacerbated by stress resulting from his compensable injury and that this relationship is sufficiently \u201cdirect\u201d to establish the necessary causal connection between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>claimant\u2019s industrial injury and his GERD. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The commission\u2019s determination regarding causation is a finding of fact and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Marcus v. Arlington County Bd. of Supers., </em>15 Va.App. 544, 551, 425 S.E.2d 525, 530 (1993). A finding of causation need not be based exclusively on medical evidence, and a claimant is not required to produce a physician\u2019s medical opinion in order to establish causation. <em>Dollar Gen\u2019l Store v. Cridlin, </em>22 Va.App. 171, 176-77, 468 S.E.2d 152, 154-55 (1996). Any medical opinion offered into evidence \u201cis not necessarily conclusive, but is subject to the commission\u2019s consideration and weighing.\u201d <em>Hungerford Mech. Corp. v. Hobson, </em>11 Va. App. 675, 677, 401 S.E.2d 213, 214 (1991). In determining whether credible evidence exists to support the commission\u2019s findings of fact, \u201cthe appellate court does not retry the facts, reweigh ... the evidence, or make its own determination of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991). As the majority acknowledges, unless the appellate court can say as a matter of law that claimant failed to sustain her burden of proving causation, the commission\u2019s findings are binding and conclusive on appeal. <em>Marcus, </em>15 Va.App. at 551, 425 S.E.2d at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Here, credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s compensable back injury \u201cis a contributing factor in his [GERD].\u201d Claimant\u2019s primary care physician, Martin Katz, noted that claimant had no history of gastric reflux or ulcer prior to his industrial injury on September 6, 2000. Claimant\u2019s medical records show he was treated for digestive problems while in rehabilitation immediately following his injury and that, when he was discharged from the rehabilitation facility in October 2000, about five weeks after the accident, doctors gave him a prescription for Protonix, a drug similar to Nexium, to take as needed. Finally, after claimant was diagnosed with GERD in 2004, his treating physicians gave opinions supporting a finding that claimant\u2019s industrial injury directly caused or contributed to his GERD. Dr. Katz opined that the \u201cemotional and physical stress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>[claimant] endures everyday as a result of Ms injuries from [the compensable] fall may have caused Ms present gastrointestinal problems.\u201d Dr. Alan Alfano opined claimant\u2019s GERD was \u201cindirectly related to Ms injury in that it is likely exacerbated by stress.\u201d Finally, Dr. Robert Muller noted that claimant \u201chas been experiencing significant anxiety and depression stemming from Ms physical disabilities and change of life\u201d and that \u201c[h]is stress level certainly must be considered as an etiological factor for the acid reflux and also considered to significantly exacerbate Ms symptoms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Based on tMs evidence, the commission agreed with the deputy that \u201ctMs is not a case where stress from the physical injury causes depression which, in turn, causes GERD\u201d and that claimant\u2019s \u201cGERD condition is directly caused or aggravated, at least in part, by emotional and physical stress resulting from the work injury.\u201d The commission relied on stress, not depression, as a factor causing claimant\u2019s GERD. Credible evidence in the record supports tMs finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The majority concedes that Dr. Muller\u2019s opimon establishes \u201cthe original injury (\u2018A\u2019) caused the stress/depression (\u2018B\u2019), wMch in turn caused the GERD condition (\u2018C\u2019),\u201d but concludes as a matter of law based on <em>Amoco Foam Prods, </em>and <em>Paul Johnson Plastering </em>that tMs causal link is insufficiently direct. I believe the majority\u2019s interpretation of these holdings is overly simplistic and unnecessarily narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">As set out above, the commission agreed with the deputy that <em>stress, not depression, </em>related to claimant\u2019s compensable back injury was a direct cause of claimant\u2019s GERD. These facts are distinguishable from those in <em>Paul Johnson Plastering, </em>in which the claimant was \u201cdiagnosed ... as having a major depressive disorder,\u201d which was alleged to have caused, over a period of time, \u201ca structural change in Ms brain or a brain injury.\u201d 265 Va. at 239, 241, 576 S.E.2d at 449, 450. The Court held that Johnson\u2019s <em>depression </em>was an intervening \u201cinjury\u201d severing the causal link between the original wrist injury and subsequent brain injury. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 576 S.E.2d at 451-52. Here, by contrast, the evidence supported the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>mission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s <em>stress </em>from his back injury, like physical pain and weakness, was merely a <em>symptom </em>of the original compensable injury and disability rather than an <em>intervening injury. </em>Where pain or physical weakness from an original compensable injury causes a second injury, the case law uniformly holds that the second injury is a compensable consequence. <em>See Amoco Foam Prods., </em>257 Va. at 33, 510 S.E.2d at 444-45 (physical weakness); <em>Bartholow Drywall Co. v. Hill, </em>12 Va.App. 790, 791, 794, 407 S.E.2d 1, 2, 3 (1991) (physical weakness); <em>Berglund Chevrolet, Inc. v. Landrum, </em>43 Va.App. 742, 752 &amp; n. 3, 601 S.E.2d 693, 698 &amp; n. 3 (2004) (pain and medications used to treat pain). The result is no different simply because the <em>symptom </em>of the original injury is emotional or psychological rather than physical. <em>See Yellow Freight Sys. v. Robinson, </em>37 Va.App. 436, 441-42, 559 S.E.2d 381, 383-84 (2002) (rejecting employer\u2019s argument that it should be held responsible \u201conly for emotional or mental conditions caused by physical injury and not for those conditions aggravated by the physical injury,\u201d implicitly holding that law provides coverage for all aggravations and that distinguishing between aggravation of conditions based on whether they are emotional or physical would be error). The majority\u2019s \u201cABC\u201d argument, carried to its extreme as I believe it is in this case, would prevent recovery by even a claimant who suffers one physical injury (\u201cA\u201d), experiences physical weakness (\u201cB\u201d) two years later, and falls as a result of that weakness, injuring himself again (\u201cC\u201d). Yet existing case law recognizes that \u201cC\u201d is compensable under these facts. <em>See Amoco Foam Prods., </em>257 Va. at 33, 510 S.E.2d at 444-45; <em>see also Hill, </em>12 Va.App. at 791, 794, 407 S.E.2d at 2, 3 (holding 1989 wrist injury, incurred when claimant fell due to weakness caused by compensable 1986 back injury, was compensable consequence). Here, claimant\u2019s stress, proved to be at least aggravated by his compensable back injury, was nothing more than an emotional symptom of his original compensable injury. Thus, I believe credible evidence proved the necessary direct causal link existed between claimant\u2019s back injury and his GERD.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Our holding in <em>Landrum </em>supports this result. In <em>Land-rum, </em>we held the evidence supported a finding that the pain from the compensable industrial accident and the medications used to treat the pain were, \u201c \u2018at least <em>in part,\u2019 </em>\u201d a \u201c \u2018direct\u2019 \u201d cause of Landrum\u2019s erectile dysfunction. 43 Va.App. at 752, 601 S.E.2d at 698. Thus, we held the erectile dysfunction was a compensable consequence of the industrial injury and that the employer was responsible for the Viagra prescription needed by the claimant in order to combat this compensable consequence. <em>Id. </em>at 752-53, 601 S.E.2d at 698. We expressly rejected the employer\u2019s contention that the evidence proved no more than indirect causation \u2014 a noncompensable consequence of a compensable consequence \u2014 as in <em>Amoco Foam Prods. </em>and <em>Paul Johnson Plastering. Landrum, </em>43 Va.App. at 752 n. 3, 601 S.E.2d at 698 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Similarly, here, claimant\u2019s compensable back injury and resulting disability caused stress, and the medical evidence supported a finding that this stress either partially caused or \u201csignificantly exacerbate[d]\u201d claimant\u2019s GERD. The evidence established that, within weeks following the accident, claimant experienced emotional distress from the accident. Although he had never had GERD before the accident, while in rehabilitation following the accident, he had indigestion severe enough to require treatment, and upon his discharge from rehabilitation, he received a prescription for Protonix, a drug similar to Nexium, to take as needed. Evidence from claimant\u2019s treating physicians supported a finding that stress from claimant\u2019s back injury and resulting disability caused or \u201csignificantly exacerbate[d]\u201d his GERD. Thus, regardless of whether any physician expressly opined that a \u201cdirect\u201d causal connection existed between claimant\u2019s industrial injury and his GERD, <em>see Lee County Sch. Bd. v. Miller, </em>38 Va.App. 253, 260-61, 563 S.E.2d 374, 377-78 (2002) (noting physician\u2019s express statement of causation not required to permit commission to find necessary <em>\u201cdirect </em>causal connection\u201d between work and occupational disease under Code \u00a7 65.2-400 (emphasis added)), the medical and other evidence as a whole, viewed in the light most favorable to claimant, supported the commission\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>elusion that the requisite \u201cdirect\u201d causal connection existed. <em>Cf. Robinson, </em>37 Va.App. at 439-43, 559 S.E.2d at 382-84 (decided three years after <em>Amoco Foam Prods, </em>and, although not discussing impact of decision, holding doctrine of compensable consequences provided coverage where increased stress and anxiety caused by compensable physical injury aggravated pre-existing depression and rendered claimant totally disabled). Because I believe credible evidence in the record, interpreted in light of the applicable case law, supports that finding, I would affirm the commission\u2019s award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
