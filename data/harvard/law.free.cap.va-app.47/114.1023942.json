The trial court found Walker not guilty of robbery arising out of the same incident. On appeal, Walker claims (a) the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>was insufficient to prove that he intended to deprive the victim of his personal liberty, and (b) his abduction conviction must be reversed as a matter of law because it was incidental to the robbery of which he was acquitted. Finding the evidence sufficient and Walker\u2019s legal reasoning erroneous, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). That principle requires us to \u201c \u2018regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and <em>all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.'' </em>\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis in original and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">At the request of one of Walker\u2019s creditors, Robert Merrell went to Walker\u2019s home in Virginia Beach to repossess a vehicle parked in the driveway. Merrell \u201chooked up\u201d the vehicle to his tow truck and began to drive away. Walker drove up in a van, saw Merrell\u2019s tow truck, and parked his van in front of the tow truck to block its path of escape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Brandishing a 9-minimeter semiautomatic handgun, Walker approached Merrell. Merrell attempted to call the police on a cell phone. \u201cPut it down,\u201d Walker ordered as he pointed the handgun at Merrell\u2019s upper torso and head. Merrell dropped his cell phone and then tried to push the handgun away. Walker pushed back, putting the barrel of the handgun against Merrell\u2019s left upper breast. Merrell began screaming hysterically as Walker rocked back the hammer of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">At 6'5\" tall, weighing 240 pounds, Walker then picked up Merrell (a foot shorter and 120 pounds lighter) by his belt and \u201cjerked\u201d him around, apparently in an effort to disarm him. Walker carried Merrell to the front of the tow truck and \u201cstuffed\u201d him sideways into the cab of the truck. Walker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>searched Merrell, finding two handgun magazine clips and a knife. With his handgun pointed at Merrell\u2019s head, Walker continued to search for weapons. He eventually took from Merrell a .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and fired one round from it into the grass. During the encounter, Merrell never reached for or displayed his weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">As Walker looked on, Merrell frantically unhooked the vehicle from his tow truck and lowered it from the lift. Walker told him if you \u201cdo the job\u201d you \u201chave to suffer the consequences.\u201d Merrell then drove his tow truck to a nearby residence to find a phone to call the police. Walker followed and taunted him: \u201cGet out of here. I know my rights. I\u2019m calling ... somebody up in Richmond.\u201d Merrell drove around the corner and called the police from another neighbor\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Two police officers responded to Merr\u00e9ll\u2019s call. They first spoke with Merrell, who showed the officers the videotape from his truck surveillance camera. One of the officers then spoke with Walker, who said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">About one and a half years ago I had a car repossessed; and I had to pay about $5,500 to have the situation resolved. And after I paid that, they ended up selling it in an auction. I saw this, and I just snapped. I was thinking about work. I just snapped. When you guys were asking me about what happened, I see that I messed up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Walker also acknowledged that he \u201crealized how stupid this was\u201d and that Merrell \u201cwas in no way at fault.\u201d Because he had another vehicle repossessed before, Walker explained, he \u201cwas not going to let it happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">A grand jury charged Walker with robbery, use of a firearm in the commission of the robbery, abduction, use of a firearm in the commission of the abduction, and discharging a firearm in public. At trial, Walker denied most of the incriminating evidence presented against him. He thought at the time Merrell was a thief, Walker testified. Walker said he displayed his handgun in self-defense only after Merrell dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>played Ms. Walker denied picking Merrell up and stuffing Mm into the cab of the tow truck. As for the incriminating statements he gave the police, Walker said oMy that he had been \u201ccoached\u201d to say some of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The trial court found Walker not guilty of robbery because he had no intent to \u201cpermanently deprive\u201d Merrell of any of Ms property. The trial court, however, found the facts proved Walker guilty of abduction by unlawfully depriving Merrell of Ms personal liberty during the encounter. Walker was also convicted of use of a firearm during the commission of a felony and discharging a firearm in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">On appeal, Walker claims the evidence is insufficient to support Ms abduction conviction and, it would follow, Ms conviction for using a firearm during the commission of the abduction. Walker also argues that Ms abduction conviction is flawed as a matter of law under the incidental detention doctrine recognized by <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 310, 337 S.E.2d 711 (1985). We find neither assertion persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">A. <em>Evidentiary Sufficiency Under Code \u00a7 18.2-47</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">When addressing the sufficiency of the evidence, we \u201c \u2018presume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u2019 and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u2018plaiMy wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted). \u201cTMs standard comes from Code \u00a7 8.01-680\u2014 the basis for our appellate review of factfinding in civil and criminal cases as well as bench and jury trials.\u201d <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 747 n. 2, 595 S.E.2d 9, 13 n. 2 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">In practical terms, a reviewing court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 234, 249, 616 S.E.2d 754, 761 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (emphasis in original and citation omitted). We ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>only whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (emphasis in original)); <em>see also Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 7, 602 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2004); <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 663, 588 S.E.2d 384, 387 (2003); <em>Hoambrecker v. City of Lynchburg, </em>13 Va.App. 511, 514, 412 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1992).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In this case, the trial court found that Walker\u2019s treatment of Merrell violated Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A). In relevant part, that statute makes it a Class 5 felony for any person \u201cwho, by force, intimidation or deception, and without legal justification or excuse, seizes, takes, transports, detains or secretes the person of another, with the intent to deprive such other person of his personal liberty....\u201d This codification wholly \u201csupercedes the common law\u201d and effectively combines the common law offenses of kidnapping, abduction, and false imprisonment \u201cinto one statutory felony.\u201d John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 7.1, at 119-20 (3d ed.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In particular, common law principles of asportation did not survive the statute. <em>See Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 519, 526, 323 S.E.2d 572, 576 (1984). The statutory language specifically refers to seizure, secreting, and detention \u2014 acts which \u201cdo not necessarily involve movement.\u201d Roger D. Groot, <em>Criminal Offenses &amp; Defenses in Virginia </em>at 2-3 (5th ed.2005). Instead, a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A) requires only a showing of \u201cphysical detention of a person, with the intent to deprive him of his personal liberty, by force, intimidation, or deception\u201d without more. <em>Scott, </em>228 Va. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>526, 323 S.E.2d at 576. <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-48 (addressing detentions with more specific <em>mens rea </em>requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Here, the evidence demonstrates that Walker, after blocking Merrell\u2019s path of escape out of the driveway, personally detained Merrell at gunpoint and forcibly moved him from the back of the tow truck into the truck cab by picking him up by his belt. This fact pattern satisfies Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A) because Walker physically detained Merrell (by restricting his movements and carrying him to the truck cab), with the intent to deprive him of his personal liberty (by ensuring Merrell did not walk or drive away during the detention), using force and intimidation (by pointing a gun at him throughout and by manhandling him into the truck cab). <em>See generally Simms v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 614, 618, 346 S.E.2d 734, 736 (1986) (\u2018We find that abduction was established as a fact once the Commonwealth proved that Simms had deprived the victim of her liberty by threats of violence and use of force.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In reply, Walker says he really intended only to disarm Merrell \u2014 not detain him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The factfinder, however, could infer that Walker intended to <em>detain </em>Merrell because that is exactly what Walker did.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is entirely \u201cpermissible to infer,\u201d as the trial court did, \u201cthat every person intends the natural and probable consequences of his or her acts.\u201d <em>Schmitt v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 127, 145, 547 S.E.2d 186, 198 (2001); <em>see Gilbert v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 67, 71, 608 S.E.2d 509, 511 (2005). That he may have intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>detain Merrell for the purpose of disarming him (assuming <em>arguendo </em>Walker\u2019s explanation to be true)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> changes nothing, any more than it would if he intended to detain Merrell merely for the purpose of having a compulsory conversation about debt collection practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In finding Walker guilty, the factfinder necessarily found that Walker forcibly detained Merrell \u201cfor the length of time necessary for his purpose.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>228 Va. at 524, 323 S.E.2d at 575 (finding the evidence sufficient for an abduction conviction where defendant intended to make victim sit on the couch long enough for her to watch him kill himself). Ample evidence supports the rationality of the trial court\u2019s decision on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">B. <em>The Incidental Detention Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Walker also argues that, even if he unlawfully detained Merrell, that detention should be ignored because it was incidental to the claimed robbery. Citing <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 310, 337 S.E.2d 711 (1985), Walker argues that some crimes (like rape, forcible sodomy, and robbery) inherently involve a component of coerced detention of a victim. The detention inherent in these detention-plus crimes, Walker reasons, cannot also be the basis of an abduction conviction. We agree with Walker in principle, but disagree that this principle applies to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Faced with a defendant convicted of abduction after being previously found guilty of rape and forcible sodomy, the Virginia Supreme Court in <em>Brown </em>held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">one accused of abduction by detention and another crime involving restraint of the victim, both growing out of a continuing course of conduct, <em>is subject upon conviction to separate penalties for separate offenses </em>only when the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tention committed in the act of abduction is separate and apart from, and not merely incidental to, the restraint employed in the commission of the other crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><em>Brown, </em>230 Va. at 314, 337 S.E.2d at 713 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under this principle, a defendant \u201ccharged with abduction by detention and another crime that factually includes restraint of the victim <em>{e.g., </em>rape or robbery)\u201d as a matter of law cannot \u201cbe <em>convicted of both </em>unless the abduction-detention is factually distinct from the restraint inherent in the other crime.\u201d Groot, <em>supra, </em>at 3 (emphasis added). <em>Brown </em>interpreted Code \u00a7 18.2-47 this way to avoid the \u201cconstitutional problem\u201d of imposing two punishments for the same offense. <em>See Brown, </em>230 Va. at 313, 337 S.E.2d at 713. Absent the imposition of multiple punishments, however, the double jeopardy concerns animating <em>Brown\u2019s </em>interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-47 do not exist.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Walker\u2019s application of <em>Brown </em>to Ms case suffers from an obvious flaw: He was acquitted \u2014 not convicted \u2014 of robbery. Walker was not \u201csubject upon conviction to separate penalties,\u201d <em>Brown, </em>230 Va. at 314, 337 S.E.2d at 713-14, because he was convicted and pumshed only for an abduction. When the underlying principle is \u201cone of multiple conviction or multiple pumshment,\u201d it simply does not apply \u201cwhere the defendant was not convicted of the rape, robbery, or whatever was the object offense\u201d in addition to the mere detention crime. 3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 18.1(b), at 11 (2003). The incidental detention doctrine, therefore, \u201chas no application to a situation in wMch no conviction was obtained\u201d on the detention-plus crime. <em>State v. French, </em>139 Vt. 320, 428 A.2d 1087, 1088 (1981). The mere detention charge, \u201cif proven in every element, can stand on its own.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Walker contends tMs understanding of <em>Brown </em>makes Code \u00a7 18.2-47 too elastic. Rejecting the multiple-pumshment rationale of <em>Brown, </em>Walker argues that the statute must be applied exactly the same way whether the detention was incidental to a \u201crobbery conviction\u201d or a \u201crobbery acquittal\u201d or some other detention-plus crime \u201cthat was not charged but is shown by the evidence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 5. Due process required no less, Walker asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Following Walker\u2019s thesis through to its conclusion, however, would produce anomalies unrecognizable to, much less required by, traditional due process principles. For example, a man accused of robbery \u2014 but prosecuted only for abduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>(because, say, of some ambiguity over the ownership of the property) \u2014 could exonerate himself of the abduction charge by taking the stand and confessing to the robbery. A man accused of rape, but prosecuted only for abduction (due to some dispute over the nature of the sexual act), could defend himself by proving a consummated rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Though we did not address the issue from the perspective of due process, we rejected just this sort of theory in <em>Simms v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 614, 617-18, 346 S.E.2d 734, 735-36 (1986). There, we held a defendant is not entitled to an instruction on attempted rape where he was only charged with abduction, regardless of whether the \u201cproof adduced at trial was sufficient to show that a rape was attempted.\u201d <em>Id. Simms </em>similarly dismissed the complaint that Code \u00a7 18.2-47 was \u201coverly broad\u201d (thus implicating double jeopardy concerns addressed in Brown) because, in <em>Simms </em>(unlike Brown) the defendant \u201cwas not charged with <em>or convicted </em>of another crime which necessarily involved detention as an element.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). <em>Simms </em>thus recognizes, as Professor Groot has noted, that where the facts could prove both the detention and the detention-plus crimes, \u201cthe Commonwealth may choose to charge the abduction by detention or the other crime.\u201d Groot, <em>supra, </em>at 4; <em>see also State v. Weir, </em>506 S.W.2d 437, 440 (Mo.1974) (rejecting incidental detention doctrine where no crime \u201cother than\u201d the mere detention crime was charged).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s decision to convict Walker of abduction. Nothing in the incidental detention doctrine recognized by <em>Brown </em>or in any principle of due process precludes the trial court from reaching that conclusion. For these reasons, we affirm Walker\u2019s convictions for abduction and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-10\">.
