ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Daniel S. Roman (claimant) appeals a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission denying his request for a penalty award against Ondeo Degremont, Inc., and its insurer, American and Foreign Insurance Company, (collectively employer) for the late payment of attorney\u2019s fees. On appeal, he contends the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s provision requiring assessment of a penalty on late paid compensation \u2014 compensation not paid within a certain time period unless certain conditions are met \u2014 applies to the late payment of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that where the commission orders the attorney\u2019s fee to be paid out of the claimant\u2019s accrued compensation, the fee remains compensation within the meaning of the penalty statute. Thus, we reverse the decision of the commission denying the request for imposition of a penalty under the facts of this case and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Claimant suffered an occupational disease for which the commission concluded he was entitled to temporary total disability benefits in the amount of $645 per week from August 6, 2001, and continuing. By opinion of July 23, 2003, the deputy entered an award for those benefits and directed that attorney\u2019s fees of $12,000 be paid to claimant\u2019s counsel from accrued compensation. Employer filed a request for review, and the commission affirmed the award by opinion of May 4, 2004. Employer noted an appeal to this Court, which summarily affirmed the commission\u2019s decision dated October 26, 2004. The carrier took no action to obtain additional review of the ruling, and by check dated November 10, 2004, it paid claimant the accrued temporary total disability compensation due less the $12,000 the commission had ordered to be paid directly to claimant\u2019s attorney as attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">As of December 15, 2004, neither the attorney\u2019s fees nor the interest on accrued compensation had been paid, and claimant asked the commission to award a 20% penalty for their late payment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The deputy denied the request, citing several recent commission decisions concluding that Code \u00a7 65.2-524\u2019s provisions regarding penalties for the late payment of compensation apply only to \u201cactual disability benefits due a claimant\u201d and do not apply to the late payment of attorney\u2019s fees or interest. He reasoned that \u201cvalid policy reasons ... support providing a 20% penalty for late payments to an injured worker who depends upon such payments for week to week sustenance, but denying such a penalty to doctors and lawyers with respect to the late payment of their charges.\u201d Finally, he noted that \u201c[ojutside the realm of injured workers, the law generally disfavors and disallows penalties, and provides other remedies such as interest and attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d but that claimant \u201cha[d] not sought any such alternative remedies\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Claimant filed a request for review by the commission, which affirmed the deputy\u2019s decision by a vote of two to one. The majority noted the legal principle requiring the narrow construction of penalty provisions and the reasoning of the deputy, and it relied on a prior decision in which it concluded Code \u00a7 65.2-524 provides for a penalty on unpaid compensation and that an attorney\u2019s fee does not constitute compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Claimant noted his appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Subject to certain tolling provisions, Code \u00a7 65.2-524 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">If any payment is not paid within two weeks after it becomes due, there shall be added <em>to such unpaid compensation </em>an amount equal to twenty percent thereof, unless the Commission finds that any required payment has been made as promptly as practicable and (i) there is good cause outside the control of the employer for the delay or (ii) in the case of a self-insured employer, the employer has issued the required payment to the employee as a part of the next regular payroll after the payment becomes due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Here, the commission awarded claimant the disputed compensation benefits and directed that attorney\u2019s fees of $12,000 be paid directly to claimant\u2019s counsel from accrued temporary total disability compensation. <em>See </em>Ya. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Rule 9.2 (\u201cWhen an award provides for an attorney fee, the employer shall pay the fee directly to the attorney unless there is alternative provision in the award.\u201d). It is undisputed that employer paid to the claimant, in a timely fashion, his past due compensation less the $12,000 in attorney\u2019s fees that the commission ordered withheld and paid directly to counsel. However, employer did not pay the attorney\u2019s fees within that same time frame. This appeal requires us to determine whether attorney\u2019s fees ordered to be paid directly to counsel from accrued compensation are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>\u201cpayment[s]\u201d of \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-524.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is remedial in nature; its purpose is \u201cthe prompt payment of compensation to injured workers. The purpose of the penalty provision of Code \u00a7 [65.2-524] is to compel prompt payment____ [The statute\u2019s] time limit is designed to discourage \u2018slow and circuitous\u2019 payment of benefits due and to discourage inaction or inattention to a claim.\u201d <em>Weston v. B.J. Church Constr. Co., </em>9 Va.App. 283, 286-87, 387 S.E.2d 96, 97-98 (1989). Although penalty statutes must be \u201c \u2018strictly construed in favor of the party on whom the penalty is sought to be imposed,\u2019 \u201d this requirement of \u201c[n]arrow construction ... does not empower a court to relieve a party from the operation of a statute, absent fraud or other legally compelling circumstances. Likewise, the mandate of strict construction does not authorize courts to amend or modify clearly drafted statutes absent constitutional defect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 387 S.E.2d at 97 (quoting <em>Audobon Tree Serv. v. Childress, </em>2 Va.App. 35, 41, 341 S.E.2d 211, 215 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">We hold that the terms \u201cpayment\u201d and \u201ccompensation\u201d as used in the first sentence of Code \u00a7 65.2-524 are synonymous for purposes of our analysis. In the sentence\u2019s main clause, the word \u201csuch\u201d in the phrase \u201csuch unpaid compensation\u201d indicates that the term \u201cany payment\u201d in the introductory dependent clause is co-extensive with the term \u201cunpaid compensation.\u201d <em>See Strawberry Hill Land Corp. v. Starbuck, </em>124 Va. 71, 86, 97 S.E. 362, 367 (1918) (\u201c \u2018Such\u2019 is a descriptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>and relative word, and refers to the last antecedent, unless the meaning of the sentence would thereby be impaired. The word refers to what has been specified, and means the same as has been theretofore mentioned.\u201d (citation omitted)), <em>quoted with approval in Sharlin v. Neighborhood Theatre, Inc., </em>209 Va. 718, 721, 167 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1969). We hold further that the plain meaning of the terms \u201cpayment\u201d and \u201ccompensation\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 65.2-524 includes, at the very least, accrued temporary disability compensation due pursuant to Chapter 5 of the Act. <em>See Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Wilson, 46 </em>Va.App. 500, 503, 619 S.E.2d 476, 478 (2005) (holding that \u201cthe \u2018conventional meaning\u2019 of compensation includes only \u2018wage loss compensation,\u2019 also commonly known as \u2018indemnity payments\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Finally, contrary to the opinion of a majority of the commission in this case, we hold that such funds do not lose their character as \u201cpayment[s]\u201d of \u201ccompensation\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-524 simply because the commission, pursuant to its authority to approve and award attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 65.2-714,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> orders that the employer pay a particular portion of those funds directly to the claimant\u2019s attorney as a reasonable fee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Rose v. Bristol Compres</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number><em>sors, </em>No. 214-98-83, 2005 VA Wrk. Comp. Lexis 130, at *3 (Feb. 15, 2005) (noting \u201cthere is no provision contained in the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that addresses a lien for attorney\u2019s fees\u201d and that, although the commission \u201chas accepted and considered such \u2018liens,\u2019 \u201d \u201cthey are not true liens in the technical, legal sense\u201d). We also hold that neither the language of Code \u00a7 65.2-524 nor the statutory context in which it appears \u2014 in a chapter of the Act involving payments of disability compensation to claimants or their statutory dependents or trustees, see Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-500 to -531 \u2014 deprives such funds of their character as \u201cpayments]\u201d of \u201ccompensation\u201d for purposes of the twenty percent penalty provision. We recognize that \u201c \u2018the construction given to the Act by the ... commission is to be accorded great weight.\u2019 Nevertheless, when the Commission\u2019s interpretation of a statute runs counter to what we perceive to be the clear intent of the General Assembly ..., the former must yield.\u201d <em>Moore v. Va. Int\u2019l Terms., Inc., </em>254 Va. 46, 50, 486 S.E.2d 528, 530 (1997). We hold \u201c[t]his is such a case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Although we hold that attorney\u2019s fees to be paid from accrued compensation retain their character as compensation and are subject to the penalty provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-524, we need not decide whether all attorney\u2019s fees paid under the Act are necessarily so classified. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-713 (allowing commission, in its discretion, to sanction an employer or insurer who has \u201cbrought, prosecuted, or defended [a proceeding] without reasonable grounds\u201d or who has \u201cdelayed payment without reasonable grounds\u201d by \u201cassessing against the [offending] employer or insurer\u201d payment of \u201cthe whole cost of the proceeding, including attorney\u2019s fees to be fixed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>the Commission\u201d). We also need not address whether medical benefits are \u201cpayment[s]\u201d of \u201ccompensation\u201d to which the penalty provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-524 apply. <em>Cf. Wilson, </em>46 Va.App. 500, 619 S.E.2d 476 (holding term \u201ccompensation,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 65.2-520, which \u201callows unapproved settlement payments to \u2018be deducted from the amount to be paid as compensation,\u2019 \u201d is limited to Chapter 5 indemnity payments made directly to claimant). Finally, we need not decide whether the penalty for late payment should ordinarily be paid to the claimant or the claimant\u2019s attorney because claimant\u2019s attorney in this ease asks that the penalty be paid to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">We hold that where the commission orders an attorney\u2019s fee to be paid out of a claimant\u2019s accrued compensation, the fee remains compensation within the meaning of the penalty statute. Thus, we reverse the decision of the commission denying the request for imposition of a penalty under the facts of this case and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including the assessment of a penalty to be paid to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-12\">. Claimant contended before the deputy commissioner that he was entitled to \"a penalty assessment against the carrier for interest and attorney\u2019s fees not paid in a timely manner.\u201d The deputy disagreed. Appellant failed to obtain a ruling from the commission on the issue of his entitlement to a penalty on late paid interest. Thus, he may not raise that issue on appeal to this Court. <em>See Overhead Door Co. v. Lewis, </em>29 Va.App. 52, 62, 509 S.E.2d 535, 539-40 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">.
