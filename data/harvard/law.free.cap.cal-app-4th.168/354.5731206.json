[Citations.] Exempt from this certificate requirement are postplea claims, including sentencing issues, that do not challenge the validity of the plea. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cuevas </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 374, 379 [79 Cal.Rptr.3d 303, 187 P.3d 30] <em>(Cuevas).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">This case requires us to consider two recent California Supreme Court decisions construing this rule: <em>People </em>v. <em>French </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 36 [73 Cal.Rptr.3d 605, 178 P.3d 1100] <em>(French), </em>and <em>Cuevas, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">In <em>Cuevas, </em>the defendant was charged with \u201c27 counts of robbery, one count of grand theft, one count of attempted robbery, and two counts of kidnapping for robbery. (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 487, subd. (c), 664, 209, subd. (b)(1).)\u201d <em>(Cuevas, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 377.) There were also 31 firearm use allegations (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b)). <em>(Cuevas, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 377.) On all charges and allegations, Cuevas could have been sentenced to two life sentences plus 37 years. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 382-383.) He negotiated a plea agreement under which the prosecution reduced the kidnapping charges to simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>kidnapping and dismissed the 31 firearm use allegations but added a single allegation of using a deadly or dangerous weapon. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 377-378.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Under the deal, the maximum sentence was 37 years eight months. <em>(Cuevas, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 383.) While taking Cuevas\u2019s plea, the trial court said to him, \u201c \u2018[Y]our maximum is going to be a determinant sentence of thirty-seven years [sic] .... Do you understand that?\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.) Cuevas answered, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court imposed an aggregate term of 35 years eight months, consisting of the upper term of eight years for one kidnapping count, 27 consecutive one-year terms for the robbery counts, and a consecutive term of eight months for grand theft. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On appeal, at the urging of the appellate court following the filing of a brief under <em>People v. Wende </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 436 [158 Cal.Rptr. 839, 600 P.2d 1071], Cuevas argued that his sentence was improper because 15 of the robbery counts and the attempted robbery count arose from eight different occasions in which he robbed (or attempted to rob) both a store and the store employee. <em>(Cuevas, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at pp. 378-379.) Thus, he argued that sentence should have been stayed under section 654 on eight duplicative counts. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 379.) The Supreme Court held that a certificate of probable cause was required for this argument because, as in <em>People v. Shelton </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 759 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 354, 125 P.3d 290], the section 654 argument was, in essence, a challenge to the validity of the plea. <em>(Cuevas, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at pp. 376, 384.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The Supreme Court ruled, contrary to the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, \u201cthe presence or absence of a sentence lid [did] not dictate the result....\u201d <em>(Cuevas, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at pp. 378, 381.) What was significant to the Supreme Court was that \u201cdefendant agreed to a maximum possible sentence of 37 years eight months,\u201d he was not \u201cmerely <em>advised </em>of the maximum sentence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 382.) \u201cIn this case, defendant received a significant reduction in sentence, or in the prosecution\u2019s words, two \u2018very large breaks,\u2019 in exchange for his plea.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 383.) The court thus concluded that \u201c[b]y negotiating the reduction and dismissal of these charges, defendant necessarily understood and agreed that he faced a significantly reduced sentence of 37 years eight months. This maximum sentence was \u2018part and parcel\u2019 of the plea bargain the parties negotiated. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 383-384.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The foundation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cuevas </em>is by now well established: (1) a challenge to the court\u2019s authority to impose an agreed upon maximum sentence is a challenge to the validity of the plea requiring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>certificate of probable cause, but (2) a challenge to the trial court\u2019s exercise of individualized sentencing discretion within an agreed maximum sentence does not require a certificate of probable cause because it does not challenge the trial court\u2019s authority to impose the upper term, i.e., it does not attack the validity of the plea agreement but instead attacks the court\u2019s exercise of discretion permitted by the agreement. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding, however, is amplified by its prior ruling in <em>French, </em>where it explains what it means to challenge a trial court\u2019s authority to impose a particular sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In <em>French, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th 36, the defendant faced an aggregate term of 180 years to fife in prison. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 42.) He negotiated a charge bargain, i.e., he agreed to plead guilty to certain charges in exchange for the dismissal of others but did not negotiate a sentence lid or stipulated term, resulting in a maximum allowable term of 18 years in prison. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 42.) Finding true a single aggravating factor, the trial court imposed the maximum term under the plea agreement. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 42-43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On appeal, French argued the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment ' right to counsel in the course of determining the aggravating factor, and thus erred in imposing the maximum allowable term reached in the charge bargain. <em>(French, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th 36, 40.) The People argued French could not raise his claim on appeal because he failed to obtain a certificate of probable cause. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 43.) The Supreme Court ultimately ruled as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u201cA certificate of probable cause is not required in the present case, because defendant\u2019s claim does not constitute an attack upon the validity of the plea agreement. In contrast to a case in which the maximum term under the plea agreement would be unlawful under section 654, the Sixth Amendment would not render an upper term unlawful for defendant\u2019s crimes under all circumstances. Whether an upper term sentence was permissible for defendant\u2019s offenses depended upon whether aggravating factors were established at the sentencing hearing, and not upon the facts of the offenses themselves. Even without a jury trial on aggravating circumstances, the upper term would have been authorized if the prosecution had established an aggravating factor at the sentencing hearing based upon defendant\u2019s prior convictions or upon his admissions. (See <em>People v. Sandoval </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 836-837 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 161 P.3d 1146] <em>(Sandoval).) </em>Defendant\u2019s claim is that the upper term was not authorized because the prosecution failed to establish an aggravating circumstance at the sentencing hearing in the manner required by the Sixth Amendment. Such a claim does not affect the validity of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u201cFurthermore, we held in <em>Sandoval, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at pages 845-852, that a defendant who has established prejudicial Sixth Amendment error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>under <em>Cunningham </em>[v. <em>California </em>(2007)] 549 U.S. 270 [166 L.Ed.2d 856, 127 S.Ct. 856], is entitled to be resentenced under a scheme in which the trial court has full discretion to impose the upper, middle, or lower term, unconstrained by the requirement that the upper term may not be imposed unless an aggravating circumstance is established. Under our holding in <em>Sandoval, </em>if a defendant is successful in establishing <em>Cunningham </em>error on appeal, the trial court is not precluded from imposing the upper term upon remand for resentencing. The defendant is entitled only to be resentenced under a constitutional scheme and is afforded the opportunity to attempt to persuade the trial court to exercise its discretion to impose a lesser sentence. In contrast to the claims raised in <em>Panizzon </em>and <em>Shelton ([People v. ]Panizzon </em>[(1996)] 13 Cal.4th 68 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 851, 913 P.2d 1061]; <em>[People v. ]Shelton, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th 759), defendant\u2019s claim, if successful, would not deprive the People of the benefit of the plea agreement, because they still would have the opportunity to convince the trial court that the full 18-year term should be imposed. Accordingly, defendant is entitled to have his <em>Cunningham </em>claim addressed on appeal. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(French, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th at pp. 45-46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In short, French\u2019s legal argument on appeal\u2014that he was denied a jury trial on aggravating factors\u2014was not a challenge to the trial court\u2019s authority to impose the maximum allowable term. Consequently, if his claim on appeal succeeded, it did not mean the trial court would be precluded from imposing the maximum sentence when the case was remanded to the trial court. The prosecution would still be able to prove the aggravating factors by appropriate procedures. <em>(French, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th at pp. 45-46.) For that reason, there was no attack on the validity of the plea, and thus, no violation of the plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On the other hand, in <em>Cuevas, </em>if the defendant\u2019s section 654 argument was successful on appeal, the maximum sentence could not be imposed on remand. Accordingly, the section 654 claim was a challenge to the trial court\u2019s authority to impose that sentence. Importantly, the Supreme Court also held that a challenge to the court\u2019s authority to impose the maximum term reached in a charge bargain was an attack on the validity of the plea, and a certificate of probable cause is required. <em>(Cuevas, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at pp. 381-382.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Read together, <em>Cuevas, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th 374, and <em>French, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th 36, make clear that the maximum allowable term reached in a charge bargain, and agreed to by the defendant, is \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of the plea agreement. Consequently, a defendant is required to obtain a certificate of probable cause before challenging the trial court\u2019s authority to impose the maximum allowable term reached in a charge bargain. And finally, a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>challenges the trial court\u2019s authority if a successful appeal would preclude the trial court from imposing on remand the maximum term reached in the plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Here, in terms nearly identical to those in <em>Cuevas, </em>defendant agreed on the maximum possible term in writing and in open court and acknowledged his exposure. On appeal, he makes two constitutional arguments: (1) the maximum sentence agreed to constitutes cruel and/or unusual punishment, and (2) the maximum sentence agreed to violates the double jeopardy provisions of the federal and state Constitutions. If either argument is successful on appeal, the maximum sentence agreed to could not be imposed\u2014like <em>Cuevas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Defendant argues that <em>Cuevas </em>is distinguishable because there the Supreme Court found substantial consideration for the plea bargain in that Cuevas received a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in his potential prison term <em>(Cuevas, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 383), but here defendant contends he did not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant argues he would have been exposed to the same term had the count II felony not been dismissed because any sentence imposed on that count would have been stayed pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We decline defendant\u2019s invitation to inject a relativity calculation into evaluating plea bargains. Defendant had a felony charge dismissed that likely would have resulted in a felony conviction. A felony conviction itself is a serious matter. For example, if defendant committed future criminal conduct, the prior felony conviction would be an aggravating reason for imposing the maximum allowable sentence. (See <em>People v. Black </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 799, 815 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 569, 161 P.3d 1130] [a single aggravating factor is sufficient to impose the upper term]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.421(b)(2) [numerous prior convictions as aggravating factor].) This is sufficient consideration to enforce the plea bargain and require a certificate of probable cause before defendant disturbs the maximum term to which he agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Because defendant failed to obtain a certificate of probable cause, his constitutional claims are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Defendant\u2019s constitutional claims on appeal are dismissed and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Scotland, P. J., and Robie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 17, 2008, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 11, 2009, SI69396.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-16\"> Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\"> Defendant also argues the unrelated misdemeanor charge was not dismissed as part of his plea bargain, but was merely an afterthought.
