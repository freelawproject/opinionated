Eric Adorno, standing next to a van with a red bandanna on the steering column and wearing a red jersey, blue jeans, and red and white shoes, walked up to the car. A bullet fired from the passenger side of the car struck Adorno between the eyebrows and killed him. Police observed a red baseball cap on the ground near his head. Red is the color commonly associated with the Norte\u00f1os criminal street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">A jury found Barajas and Lopez guilty of first degree murder, found ' criminal street gang allegations true as to both, and found true as to Barajas an allegation of personal and intentional discharge of a firearm causing death. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 186.22, subd. (b)(1), 12022.53, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced Barajas to 50 years to life (25 years to life for first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>degree murder and 25 years to life consecutively for the firearm enhancement) and sentenced Lopez to 25 years to life for first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Nine issues arise on appeal. Two are evidentiary. Barajas and Lopez (1) argue insufficiency of the evidence that the Sure\u00f1os were a criminal street gang and (2) characterize as prejudicial error the trial court\u2019s ruling that a university sociology professor could not testify that gang culture would have prevented premeditation and instead given rise to an actual belief in the need for self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Three issues challenge jury instructions. Lopez argues (3) the trial court\u2019s instructing with CALCRIM No. 355 on a defendant\u2019s right not to testify without modifying the instruction to reflect his testifying in his own defense impermissibly lowered the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. Barajas and Lopez argue (4) that CALCRIM No. 521 erroneously conflated the elements of first degree murder and impermissibly lowered the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof by precluding the possibility of a second degree murder verdict and (5) that the trial court\u2019s rereading of certain instructions was a prejudicially inadequate response to the jury\u2019s request for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Additionally, Barajas and Lopez argue (6) that the section 1203.11 emergency medical services restitution fines which the statute authorizes solely \u201cas a condition of probation,\u201d must be stricken from the judgments since neither Barajas nor Lopez received a grant of probation and (7) that cumulative error requires reversal of the judgments. Finally, Lopez (8) argues that his deputy public defender\u2019s representation of him after the disclosure of a prosecution witness\u2019s prior representation by her office was a conflict of interest and (9) challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his midtrial Marsden<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> motion as \u201cnot timely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">As to both judgments, we will remand with directions to the trial court to strike the section 1203.11 restitution fines. Otherwise we will affirm Barajas\u2019s judgment. With reference to Lopez\u2019s judgment, we will reverse and remand with directions to the trial court to conduct a posttrial <em>Marsden </em>hearing and to exercise judicial discretion to order a new trial, to reinstate the judgment, or to proceed otherwise as authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">1.-7.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">8. <em>Lopez: Conflict of Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Lopez argues that his deputy public defender\u2019s representation of him after the disclosure of a prosecution witness\u2019s prior representation by her office was a conflict of interest. The Attorney General argues the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">On May 11, 2007, day 26 of the 42-day jury trial, Lopez\u2019s attorney and one of her colleagues from the public defender\u2019s office appeared in court. Her colleague said he had learned just days earlier that his office had represented prospective witness Carlos Chavez on an escape prior but that nowhere in the case management system that the district attorney\u2019s office and the public defender\u2019s office shared did Chavez \u201cshow up as a witness in this case.\u201d As to \u201cwhether or not we have a conflict,\u201d her colleague said that they \u201cknow nothing about that conviction other than that there is a conviction\u201d and that neither he nor she had spoken about Lopez\u2019s case with the former deputy public defender who had represented Chavez on the escape prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">The trial court inquired whether the public defender\u2019s office intended to declare a conflict if the prosecutor were to call Chavez as a witness. Lopez\u2019s attorney and her colleague both requested a continuance to investigate and to confer with the county public defender. With the concurrence of the prosecutor and Chavez\u2019s attorney, the trial court put the matter over to the following week.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">On May 16, 2007, day 28 of the 42-day jury trial, the trial court and half a dozen attorneys\u2014Lopez\u2019s attorney, her colleague, the county public defender, the prosecutor, Barajas\u2019s attorney, and Chavez\u2019s attorney\u2014discussed the circumstances under which Chavez might testify. Chavez\u2019s attorney expressed his client\u2019s willingness to waive any conflict of interest arising from his prior representation by the public defender\u2019s office and to testify for the prosecution if he were to receive use immunity, transactional immunity, and a release from custody. The prosecutor agreed to all three conditions. Chavez\u2019s attorney noted parenthetically that \u201cobviously, there\u2019s another side that has to waive also,\u201d but the trial court replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know that. I\u2019m just trying to find out what you want to do. Then we\u2019ll talk to everybody else to see what they want to do.\u201d After the trial court inquired, \u201cSo are there any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>conflict issues anybody wants to waive then before we proceed tomorrow?\u201d Lopez\u2019s attorney responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\">\u201c[LOPEZ\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Mr. Lopez has informed us that he does not intend to waive the conflict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I haven\u2019t heard that there\u2019s a conflict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">\u201c[LOPEZ\u2019S ATTORNEY]: He believes that there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I need to hear that, though, from the attorney. I don\u2019t generally take the client\u2019s word that there\u2019s a conflict, and if the attorney doesn\u2019t tell me anything, I\u2019m taking that at face value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-9\">\u201c[LOPEZ\u2019S ATTORNEY]: He believes there\u2019s a conflict because of our former representation of Mr. Chavez in both Juvenile Court and in the adult Superior Court and, apparently, we represented him and appeared with him as recently as April of this year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you want to put anything factually on the record about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\">\u201c[LOPEZ\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well, I can\u2019t. When this issue first arose, I contacted [the county public defender] wanting initially to set up an appointment for [my colleague] and I to speak to [the county public defender]. As it turns out, he was getting ready to leave the office; I was calling from the Court. So as an alternative, he asked me to explain the situation, which I did, and there was some\u2014a questioning and answering passed between us, and when I finished providing a recitation of the facts, as I understood them, he opined there was no conflict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2018He\u2019 being [the county public defender]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-13\">\u201c[LOPEZ\u2019S ATTORNEY]: \u2018He\u2019 being [the county public defender].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">After citing a journal article and a case on the issue of waiver, Lopez\u2019s attorney told the trial court that the county public defender \u201cinstructed me not to read the Chavez file, to not speak with [the former deputy public defender] who, we understand, represented him in the escape case\u201d on which he was in custody. Noting for the record the presence of Lopez\u2019s attorney, her colleague, and the county public defender, the trial court asked, \u201cDoes anybody think that there\u2019s a conflict, any of the three of you think there\u2019s a conflict, then?\u201d Lopez\u2019s attorney added, \u201cThere was one other thing I forgot to say. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>specifically directed that we not declare the conflict. With that in mind, on some level at least, it doesn\u2019t matter what I think about the conflict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Once the county public defender put his position on the record, the trial court quickly resolved the issue against Lopez:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, what is the public defender position? Let me just put it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">\u201c[COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER]: Your Honor, I will articulate that for you. I think there is no conflict in this case. I have looked at the [case Lopez\u2019s attorney cited]; I\u2019ve researched the law. I have no information nor even a hint of information that we received anything confidential from Mr.\u2014I think Chavez\u2014the potential witness, in our prior representation of him. We certainly won\u2019t and don\u2019t intend to undertake further representation of him should his case come on calendar for apparently some kind of sentence modification or custody terms\u2019 modification; that would be up to [Chavez\u2019s attorney]. And in light of that, I see no conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Good. So it looks like then we can be back here tomorrow morning at 9:30 with Mr. Chavez.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Chavez testified that just minutes after Barajas and Lopez showed up at the house where he and others were \u201ckickin\u2019 back\u201d shortly before the homicide Barajas said there were \u201cbusters in the alley\u201d so he \u201cwanted to go check it out,\u201d \u201cpull a job,\u201d and \u201cgo beat the busters in the alley.\u201d Chavez testified that \u201cbusters\u201d were members of the opposite gang and that \u201cpulling a job\u201d probably meant \u201cgo fight with them.\u201d Minutes after Barajas and Lopez took off together, Chavez heard a single gunshot. When Barajas and Lopez came back to the house a few hours later, Chavez asked Barajas \u201cwhat had happened and he said that somebody had got shot.\u201d About a week later, Chavez asked Barajas if he had shot the person in the alley. Barajas said, \u201cYeah. Don\u2019t trip. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Impeached on cross-examination, Chavez acknowledged that he was in custody, that he had recent convictions of auto theft and escape from jail, and that he had five months left to serve. He testified only after the district attorney agreed not to prosecute him for the homicide and let him serve out his sentence on electronic home monitoring due to a death threat he received in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">With commendable candor, Lopez acknowledges that no United States Supreme Court case is on point, that California case law fails to support his argument (see, e.g., <em>People v. Cox </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 916, 948-951 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>[135 Cal.Rptr.2d 272, 70 P.3d 277] <em>(Cox); People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 950, 1001-1002 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 689, 857 P.2d 1099] <em>(Clark); Rhabum </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1581 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 464] <em>(Rhaburn)), </em>and that our duty as an intermediate appellate court is to follow the decisional law of our Supreme Court <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937]). Here, as in <em>Cox, Clark, </em>and <em>Rhabum </em>alike, ample indicia of the <em>absence </em>of a conflict of interest are in the record. For example, Lopez\u2019s attorney never represented Chavez or possessed any confidential information about him. Nor, insofar as the county public defender was aware, did anyone in the office ever receive anything confidential from Chavez. In addition, the county public defender carefully instructed Lopez\u2019s attorney not to read Chavez\u2019s file and not to speak with the deputy public defender who represented Chavez before leaving the public defender\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">In the absence of any support in California case law, Lopez relies on a State Bar opinion and on a State Bar rule of professional conduct. In his words, the crux of the State Bar opinion is \u201cthat the entire public defender\u2019s office should be disqualified from representing a defendant if a previous client is. also involved in the case as a potential witness.\u201d Quite to the contrary, the State Bar opinion addresses the far narrower issue of \u201cwhether an attorney may represent a client in the common situation which occurs in public defender offices\u201d not only \u201cwhen a new client\u2019s case involves activities of a former client of the public defender\u201d but also when <em>\u201cthe proposed client has been arrested as the result of the cooperation of a former client with law enforcement </em>agents.\u201d (State Bar Standing Com. on Prof. Responsibility &amp; Conduct, Formal Opn. No. 1980-52, italics added.) Nothing in the record here shows, let alone intimates, Chavez\u2019s cooperation with law enforcement agents in Lopez\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Indeed, as the State Bar opinion digest carefully notes, \u201cIt is improper for counsel in a criminal case to represent a defendant where a previous client of that attorney\u2019s office is a witness against the new client <em>arid it is reasonably foreseeable that the confidences or secrets of the former client may be, or reasonably appear to the client to be, used.\u201d </em>(State Bar Standing Com. on Prof. Responsibility &amp; Conduct, Formal Opn. No. 1980-52, italics added.) Here, since no showing is in the record that the public defender\u2019s office ever received anything confidential from Chavez, no issue arises about either the reasonable foreseeability or the reasonable appearance of its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The State Bar rule of professional conduct on which Lopez relies states, \u201cA member shall not, without the informed written consent of the client or former client, accept employment adverse to the client or former client where, by reason of the representation of the client or former client, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>member has obtained <em>confidential information material </em>to the employment.\u201d (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 3-310(E), italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, no showing is in the record that Lopez\u2019s attorney obtained any confidential information from Chavez. Second, a justification \u201cfor declining to apply a rigid presumption [of possession of confidential information]\u201d in the context of representation by the public defender\u2019s office \u201cis that \u2018[ujnlike their private sector counterparts, public sector lawyers do not have a financial interest in the matters on which they work\u2019 \u201d so \u201c \u2018they may have less, if any, incentive to breach client confidences.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rhaburn, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1579.) Third, since Lopez\u2019s attorney never had \u201ca \u2018direct and personal\u2019 relationship\u201d with Chavez, whom a former colleague no longer with the public defender\u2019s office once represented, \u201cthe courts should normally be prepared to accept the representation of counsel, as an officer of the court, that he or she has not in fact come into possession of any confidential information acquired from the witness and will not seek to do so.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1581.) Lopez\u2019s reliance on the State Bar rule, like his reliance on the State Bar opinion, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">To obtain relief on appeal, the defendant must show either an actual conflict that adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance <em>(People v. Lawley </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 102, 146 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 38 P.3d 461]) or informed speculation with a factual basis in the record about a potential conflict that adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roldan </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 646, 674 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 360, 110 P.3d 289] <em>(Roldan)) </em>and an abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying his or her motion to disqualify counsel <em>(Rhaburn, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1573). Since none appears here, Lopez fails to discharge his burden on appeal. With candor equally commendable as before, he acknowledges that the goal of his conflict of interest argument is \u201cto obtain consideration of this issue in this Court and to preserve the issue for reconsideration in the California Supreme Court and for federal review.\u201d Duly noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">9. <em>Lopez: Midtrial </em>Marsden <em>Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Lopez challenges the court\u2019s denial of his midtrial <em>Marsden </em>motion as \u201cnot timely.\u201d The Attorney General agrees that the denial of Lopez\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motion on that ground was error but argues harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The history of Lopez\u2019s midtrial <em>Marsden </em>motion commences with three pretrial in camera <em>Marsden </em>hearings, at each of which he sought a substitution of attorneys on the ground of a conflict of interest with the public defender\u2019s office. At his first <em>Marsden </em>hearing, on September 14, 2005, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>informed the trial court that he had \u201cwitnesses on my case that have arrest histories and I tried to find out if there was a conflict in our case, if they were being represented by the public defender\u2019s office at one time or another. They refused to tell me.\u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s witnesses, even codefendants, that have arrest histories too.\u201d The trial court asked, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t get the criminal histories or the arrest histories of the witnesses?\u201d He replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t want the arrest histories, I just wanted to know if they were represented at one time or another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Asked by the trial court to address Lopez\u2019s concerns, his attorney, noting that she had represented him continuously since he was taken into custody two years earlier, distinguished her responsibility to do conflict checks from the county public defender\u2019s responsibility to declare conflicts: \u201cOne of the first things that I did after we\u2019d been assigned the case was to review the police reports. Not only for content, but to identify potential witnesses and do conflicts checks. And that review did not show any of the conflicts that my supervisor would accept, [f] So [even if] we might, for example have represented some of these people in misdemeanors years ago, [the county public defender] would not approve declaring a conflict on former clients unless there was something very special about the situation, [f] So I explained that to Mr. Lopez.\u201d She said that \u201cthe only thing that Mr. Lopez wanted us to investigate for him\u201d was to \u201cinterview the girlfriend\u201d and prepare a report and that the public defender\u2019s investigator did so. Finding she had \u201cproperly checked for conflicts, properly investigated it, [and] properly kept [Lopez] advised,\u201d the trial court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">At Lopez\u2019s second <em>Marsden </em>hearing, on September 22, 2005, his attorney said she had found out just the day before that a colleague of hers in the public defender\u2019s office and her colleague\u2019s former \u201cthree strikes\u201d client \u201chad attempted to negotiate a deal\u201d with the district attorney\u2019s office calling for the client to testify against Lopez to \u201cget a better deal for himself.\u201d Private counsel later substituted in for her colleague.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Lopez\u2019s attorney said the county public defender \u201cspecifically\u201d instructed her she \u201cwas not authorized to withdraw from this case\u201d but \u201cshould convey\u201d to Lopez \u201call of the information\u201d she had \u201cabout the situation.\u201d She said private counsel refused to let her talk with her colleague\u2019s former client. The trial court asked her if she was declaring a conflict. She replied, \u201cI have been instructed that I\u2019m not authorized to do that,\u201d but put on the record her own \u201cconsidered opinion\u201d that \u201cthere was an ethical breach.\u201d Her understanding of her assignment from the county public defender, she said, was to \u201cequip Mr. Lopez with the information so that he could, could make this motion on a theory of conflict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Lopez immediately did so. \u201cSomebody knows something about my case and they\u2019re being represented by the public defender\u2019s office and is willing to testify against me,\u201d he said. Noting that the prosecutor did not intend to call his attorney\u2019s colleague\u2019s former client as a witness, the trial court found no conflict of interest and denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">At his third <em>Marsden </em>hearing, on August 8, 2006, Lopez informed the trial court that the county public defender had refused to respond to his inquiry whether his office had represented any codefendant or any other witness and that he had found out that the public defender\u2019s office represented Hector Solis, a witness in custody on a pending murder case. Lopez\u2019s attorney replied that, once she brought the conflict to the attention of the deputy public defender representing Solis around the time of his preliminary hearing, the public defender\u2019s office conflicted off the Solis case.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Additionally, Lopez informed the trial court that the public defender\u2019s office had represented other witnesses against him. His attorney replied that the public defender\u2019s office \u201cdid represent some of them at some time\u201d but that she was aware of no open cases other than the Solis case. Finding neither a \u201cclassic conflict with witnesses\u201d nor \u201cproblems with the discovery or preparation of the defense\u201d nor a \u201cbreakdown of the relationship\u201d between attorney and client, the trial court denied Lopez\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Now we turn to the colloquy in open court on May 16, 2007, immediately after the trial court adopted the county public defender\u2019s point of view that there was no conflict of interest. <em>(Ante, </em>pt. 8.)

The <em>Marsden </em>motion at this time would not be timely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-19\">The trial court\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>ruling came hard on the heels of four developments during the conflict of interest colloquy in open court. First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>prosecutor granted Chavez use immunity, transactional immunity, and a release from custody in return for his testimony for the prosecution and for his waiver of any conflict of interest arising out of his prior representation by the public defender\u2019s office. Second, the county public defender denied the existence of a conflict of interest with Lopez arising out of his office\u2019s prior representation of Chavez. Third, Lopez declared, and refused to waive, a conflict of interest with the public defender\u2019s office. Fourth, the trial court found no conflict of interest. <em>{Ante, </em>pt. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In his attorney\u2019s words, Lopez\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motion \u201carises from his position with respect to the conflict.\u201d From the record of the colloquy in open court immediately before his motion, a deteriorating attorney-client relationship is arguably inferable. \u201cA criminal defendant is entitled to raise his or her dissatisfaction with counsel at any point in the trial when it becomes clear that the defendant\u2019s right to effective legal representation has been compromised by a deteriorating attorney-client relationship.\u201d <em>(Roldan, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 681.) \u201cIt is well settled that a criminal defendant, at any stage of the trial, must be given the opportunity to state reasons for a request for new counsel.\u201d <em>(People v. Mack </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1487 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 614].) The question that arises on the record here is whether Lopez had that opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">By \u201cfinding the <em>Marsden </em>motion to be not timely,\u201d perhaps the trial court meant that a <em>midtrial </em>motion is not timely. If so, that would be contrary to the law on the facts here. Although a trial court is entitled to deny as an impermissible disruption of the orderly processes of justice a midtrial <em>Marsden </em>motion belatedly challenging a pretrial ruling <em>(People v. Carr </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 287, 299 [104 Cal.Rptr. 705, 502 P.2d 513]), Lopez\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motion arose from the four developments in the conflict of interest issue that the trial court, half a dozen attorneys, and he had just memorialized. Alternatively, by \u201cfinding the <em>Marsden </em>motion to be not timely,\u201d perhaps the trial court meant that Lopez had already raised the conflict of interest issue at the three pretrial in camera <em>Marsden </em>hearings. Indeed, he had. Yet those hearings antedated the four conflict of interest developments that had just arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Yet another possibility is that the trial court might have considered the colloquy in open court a <em>Marsden </em>hearing. The appointment of new counsel was the remedy Lopez sought not only by declaring a conflict of interest with the public defender\u2019s office but also by mating a <em>Marsden </em>motion. Since \u201cno single, inflexible procedure exists for conducting a <em>Marsden </em>inquiry,\u201d and since case law sometimes shows the prosecutor\u2019s presence during a <em>Marsden </em>hearing, the prosecutor\u2019s presence at the colloquy in open court was possibly of no consequence. <em>(People v. Madrid </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 14, 18 [213 Cal.Rptr. 813] <em>(Madrid), </em>citing, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Avalos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 216, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>231 [207 Cal.Rptr. 549, 689 P.2d 121]; <em>Harris v. Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 786, 791 [140 Cal.Rptr. 318, 567 P.2d 750].) An in camera <em>Marsden </em>hearing is \u201cthe better practice,\u201d but a <em>Marsden </em>hearing in open court is permissible where, as here, neither the defendant nor defense counsel asks for an in camera hearing and the defendant\u2019s complaints neither disclose information that conceivably could lighten the prosecutor\u2019s burden of proof nor involve evidence or strategy to which the prosecutor is not privy. <em>(Madrid, supra, </em>at p. 19; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 388, 395 [217 Cal.Rptr. 306], disapproved on another ground in <em>People v. Smith </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 684, 696 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 863 P.2d 192], as stated in <em>People v. Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 346, fn. 16 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374].) So a <em>Marsden </em>motion requesting the <em>Marsden </em>hearing that had just occurred could, among other things, be considered not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Lamentably, the record before us fails to clarify the trial court\u2019s enigmatic comment. So we agree with Lopez and the Attorney General that the denial of Lopez\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motion as \u201cnot timely\u201d was error. In the usual case, <em>Marsden </em>error requires a new trial since an inadequate record denies meaningful appellate review. <em>(Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 126.) Yet no indication of ineffective assistance of counsel is in the record, the trial was free of error, and the only outstanding issue is the <em>Marsden </em>motion arising from the conflict of interest issue. In light of that set of unique circumstances, we will reverse the judgment and remand the matter with directions to the trial court to conduct a posttrial <em>Marsden </em>hearing and to exercise judicial discretion to order a new trial, reinstate the judgment, or proceed otherwise as authorized by law. <em>(People v. Olivencia </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1391, 1400-1402 [251 Cal.Rptr. 880]; <em>People v. Maese </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 803, 808-810 [214 Cal.Rptr. 365]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Minor </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 194, 199-200 [163 Cal.Rptr. 501] and cases cited; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 168, 174 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 784, 137 P.3d 959] [citing <em>Minor </em>with approval]; <em>People v. Hall </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 161, 170 [197 Cal.Rptr. 71, 672 P.2d 854] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">As to both judgments, the matter is remanded with directions to the trial court to strike the section 1203.11 restitution fines, to issue amended abstracts of judgment, and to send certified copies to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Barajas and Lopez have no right to be present at those proceedings. (See <em>People v. Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 407-408 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610], superseded by statute on another ground as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hinks </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1157, 1161-1165 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 440].) Otherwise, Barajas\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Lopez\u2019s judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to the trial court to conduct a posttrial <em>Marsden </em>hearing and exercise judicial discretion to order a new trial, to reinstate the judgment, or to proceed otherwise as authorized by law.
