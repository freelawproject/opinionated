J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">An employee who was terminated after closing down a 24-hour service station for several hours, in violation of company policy, sued her employer and her supervisor, alleging claims of harassment on the basis of mental disability, retaliation, and wrongful termination, among others. The employer and supervisor sought and obtained summary judgment, and the supervisor then sought attorney fees. The court found the claims against the supervisor were frivolous and brought in bad faith, but awarded nominal attorney fees of $1 because the supervisor\u2019s fees were paid by the employer. The employee appealed from the grant of summary judgment, and the employer and supervisor cross-appealed from the award of attorney fees. We find no merit in either appeal and affirm the judgment, with a modification in the amount of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">Laura Young, a student at Antelope Valley College, worked as a sales associate at an ExxonMobil service station in Lancaster on a part-time basis from April 2004 until she was fired on September 16, 2004. The station was open 24 hours a day. On September 15, 2004, Young worked a shift, alone, from 9:00 p.m. until midnight. The person scheduled to relieve her at midnight did not arrive. Young called Wanda Najera, the assistant station manager, \u201csome time after midnight,\u201d yelling and very angry, saying she had to leave because she had to study, and that she was shutting down the station. Najera told her she couldn\u2019t do that, and that she (Young) should wait for Najera to come to the station. At 12:25 a.m., Young shut down all the gas pumps and never turned them back on, effectively closing the station (a \u201cposted offense\u201d which she knew could result in a suspension or discharge without prior notice). At 1:12 a.m., she logged off her cash register, and the station was then completely shut down. Young called Angela Lopez, the station manager, about 1:30 a.m., yelling and, according to Lopez, \u201cout of control.\u201d Lopez told Young she would get someone there as soon as she could, and called Najera. Young also called Najera a second time, again yelling at Najera, and Najera told her she would be there as soon as possible. When Najera got to the station around 3:00 a.m., the station was completely shut down; Najera restarted the pumps and started operating the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">The next morning, Lopez called Karen Johnson, a territory manager for Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon). Johnson went to the station on September 17 and met with Lopez about the incident. Johnson also reviewed Young\u2019s personnel file, which reflected a number of verbal and written warnings to Young concerning absences, problems with customers, and incidents of insubordination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lopez had prepared forms for Young\u2019s termination. Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>did not have authority to terminate employees; she contacted Exxon\u2019s human resources department in Houston and described the circumstances. The department concluded that termination was proper on grounds of insubordination and neglect of duty, based on Young\u2019s conduct during the early morning hours of September 16th, and provided an \u201cendorse code\u201d demonstrating that Young\u2019s termination was endorsed by the department. Johnson thereupon signed the separation form terminating Young\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">A few months later, Young filed a charge with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, alleging she was fired, harassed, and retaliated against by Lopez and other Exxon employees based on a mental disability. She requested and received a right-to-sue notice, and on February 9, 2005, filed a complaint against Exxon and Lopez. The complaint alleged causes of action against Exxon and Lopez for disability discrimination and harassment in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA; Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.) and for intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as causes of action against Exxon for wrongful termination in violation of public policy and violation of Labor Code section 1102.5, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The substance of Young\u2019s complaint was as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">As a result of a tumor removed from her brain when she was a child, Young suffers from a mental disability: visual and auditory processing deficiencies,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> manic depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Exxon was not aware of Young\u2019s disability when she was hired in April 2004, but on July 3, 2004, Young was given a warning for showing disrespect to Lopez when Lopez reprimanded her for failing to appear for work without calling. Young then advised Lopez of her disability, telling Lopez that she needed to take medication \u201cto avoid becoming manic and to control compulsive behaviors associated with [her] mental and physical disabilities associated with her childhood brain surgery.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>Young\u2019s complaint alleged that shortly after Lopez learned of Young\u2019s disabilities, Young\u2019s coworkers \u201cengaged in a continuous, severe and pervasive campaign of harassing\u201d Young. This consisted of ignoring Young; physically obstructing her from moving around in the station\u2019s work area; telling customers, vendors and suppliers that they worked with a \u201cpsycho-retard\u201d; and showing up late to work so that Young would be required to work longer hours. Young reported her co workers\u2019 behavior to Lopez and asked Lopez to instruct them to stop the harassing behavior. Instead of doing so, Lopez retaliated against Young by telling her \u201cthis type of stuff just happens\u201d; cutting Young\u2019s hours; refusing to schedule around Young\u2019s school schedule; refusing to allow Young to train new employees assigned to the graveyard shift; telling other employees that she (Lopez) did not know why Young was attending college because Young was retarded; and telling another ExxonMobil manager that she (Lopez) was working with a \u201cretard.\u201d On September 7, 2004, after Young \u201cmade a number of verbal complaints\u201d to Lopez, Young drafted a handwritten letter about her complaints and gave it to Lopez along with printouts from Web sites discussing the laws on disability discrimination. The \u201cultimate act of retaliation\u201d occurred when Lopez told Young her employment was terminated. Young sought general, special and punitive damages, as well as attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">Exxon and Lopez moved for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of each cause of action and of Young\u2019s claim for punitive damages. They asserted there was no evidentiary support for Young\u2019s claims; even if Young could establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, Exxon had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating Young, and Young could not establish those reasons were pretextual. As for Young\u2019s harassment claim, Exxon contended most of her allegations lacked evidentiary support, and her coworkers\u2019 conduct was not severe or pervasive enough to constitute disability harassment (and, as to her claim against Lopez, Young admitted in her deposition that Lopez herself did not harass her). Finally, Exxon contended the punitive damages claim failed as a matter of law because the alleged wrongful acts were not committed by officers or managing agents of Exxon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-5\">The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, finding Exxon showed legitimate, nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reasons for terminating Young\u2019s employment, and Young presented no facts showing Exxon\u2019s stated reasons were pretextual.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1473\">*1473</page-number>Lopez then filed a motion for attorney fees under Government Code section 12965, contending that Exxon, on behalf of Lopez, incurred substantial attorney fees defending Young\u2019s \u201cunreasonable, frivolous, and meritless claims against Lopez individually.\u201d Lopez sought $18,750 in attorney fees, approximately one-quarter of the total fees incurred in the action. (Exxon\u2019s counsel stated this was a fair and reasonable apportionment, as the harassment wrong targeting Lopez \u201cmade up approximately 1/4 of the case . . . .\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">The trial court found that Young\u2019s claims against Lopez were \u201cunreasonable, frivolous, meritless and vexatious,\u201d \u201cwithout foundation\u201d and \u201cbrought in subjective bad faith.\u201d However, while the fees claimed to be attributable to Lopez\u2019s defense were reasonable in amount, Exxon paid for the defense. The court observed that an award to Lopez \u201cwould actually be an award to Exxon, which does not claim [Young\u2019s] claims against it were frivolous.\u201d The trial court concluded this \u201cdoes not seem right,\u201d and awarded nominal attorney fees of $1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">On April 4, 2006, judgment was entered in favor of Exxon and Lopez in the amount of $25,999.93 ($1 in attorney fees and $25,998.93 in costs). (Exxon admits the amount of costs shown in the judgment was erroneous, and the judgment should have reflected a total amount of $7,249.93 ($1 in attorney fees and $7,248.93 in costs).) Young appealed, and Exxon and Lopez cross-appealed the attorney fee award of $1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-8\">I.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">Exxon and Lopez cross-appealed from the order and judgment awarding attorney fees of only $1 to Lopez. They assert that because the trial court found Young\u2019s claims against Lopez individually were \u201cunreasonable, frivolous, meritless and vexatious,\u201d and the fees \u201cclaimed to be attributable to the defense of Ms. Lopez [were] reasonable in amount,\u201d the trial court abused its discretion in nonetheless refusing to award the $18,750 requested to Lopez. We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">We review the principles governing attorney fee awards in FEHA actions, and then turn to the trial court\u2019s order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">In actions under the FEHA, the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12965, subd. (b).) California courts have followed federal law, and hold that, in exercising its discretion, a trial court should ordinarily award attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff, unless special circumstances would render an award of fees unjust. A prevailing defendant, however, should be awarded fees under the FEHA only \u201cin the rare case in which the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>(Rosenman v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil &amp; Shapiro </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 859, 864 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 903], capitalization &amp; italics omitted <em>(Rosenman).) Rosenman </em>cites the high court\u2019s observation that the strong equitable considerations supporting an attorney fee award to a prevailing plaintiff\u2014including that fees are being awarded against a violator of federal law, and that the federal policy being vindicated by the plaintiff is of the highest priority\u2014are not present in the case of a prevailing defendant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 865, citing <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC </em>(1978) 434 U.S. 412, 418-419 [54 L.Ed.2d 648, 98 S.Ct. 694] <em>(Christiansburg).) Rosenman </em>imposed \u201ca nonwaivable requirement that trial courts make written findings\u201d reflecting the criteria supporting an award \u201cin every case where they award attorney fees in favor of defendants in FEHA actions.\u201d <em>(Rosenman, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 868.) <em>Rosenman </em>added that the trial court \u201cshould also make findings as to the plaintiff\u2019s ability to pay attorney fees, and how large the award should be in light of the plaintiff\u2019s financial situation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 868, fn. 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">Here, we have the unusual case in which a FEHA action is found to be frivolous as to one defendant but not the other, the latter of whom incurred, was liable for, and paid all the fees. Exxon says the issue to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>decided is whether an individual defendant in a FEHA suit may obtain attorney fees as the prevailing party, even when the employer has defended the individual and the individual has not personally incurred or paid any attorney fees. Exxon points out that, in other statutory and contractual contexts, there are many circumstances in which courts have found that a prevailing party need not actually incur or pay attorney fees in order to be entitled to an award. We do not quarrel with that principle, but that is not the pertinent question in this case. The question is whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to award fees to a defendant who did not incur or pay them, when the fee award would redound to the benefit of another defendant which is <em>not </em>entitled to an award of fees. To this question, our answer, in this case, is \u201cno.\u201d In other words, while a trial court should ordinarily award attorney fees to a prevailing defendant in a FEHA action when the court finds the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, the court has the discretion not to do so if the actual beneficiary of the attorney fee award is a defendant to which an award could not otherwise be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">Our conclusion is consonant with the principles described in <em>Rosenman </em>for fee awards in FEHA cases, and does not conflict in any way with the cases under other statutes that permit attorney fee awards to prevailing parties who have not paid or incurred fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">First, <em>Rosenman </em>and its predecessor cases tell us the standard by which to measure the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion in awarding attorney fees to a prevailing defendant in a FEHA case: namely, only in the \u201crare case\u201d in which the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation. (Ro<em>senman, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 864.) But <em>Rosenman </em>does <em>not </em>tell us that the trial court <em>must </em>award fees to a prevailing defendant on a frivolous FEHA claim, no matter what the circumstances, and we decline to read <em>Rosenman </em>and the other cases as depriving the court of its discretion once it finds the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous or groundless. (Cf. <em>Christiansburg, supra, </em>434 U.S. at p. 421, italics added [\u201ca district court may <em>in its discretion </em>award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case upon a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\u201d].) <em>Rosenman </em>itself suggests circumstances in which the court could appropriately reduce or deny a prevailing defendant fees in a frivolous case, when it tells us that the trial court must consider the plaintiff\u2019s ability to pay attorney fees, and that an award should not subject the plaintiff to financial ruin. <em>(Rosenman, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at pp. 868-869, fn. 42.) And, just as there are circumstances in which a prevailing plaintiff, who ordinarily should recover attorney fees, may not recover them\u2014when special circumstances make an award unjust\u2014the same is true of a prevailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>defendant in a frivolous case. This is just such a case: where the fee award to the prevailing defendant would redound to the benefit of another defendant who is not entitled to recover fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">Second, as Exxon points out, there are many cases in which the courts have awarded attorney fees to prevailing parties who, like Lopez, are not actually liable for or have not incurred or paid fees. But in all those cases, the attorney fee award actually benefits the prevailing party or an entity which has provided the services and would otherwise not be compensated for them. (See, e.g., <em>Lolley v. Campbell </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 367, 370-371 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 571, 48 P.3d 1128] [award under Lab. Code provisions to indigent employee represented without charge by the Labor Commissioner]; <em>PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1088 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511] [award under Civ. Code, \u00a7 1717 to entity represented by in-house counsel]; <em>Folsom v. Butte County Assn. of Governments </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 668, 681, 683-684 [186 Cal.Rptr. 589, 652 P.2d 437] [award under Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5 to plaintiffs who incurred no personal liability for services of attorneys employed by publicly funded agencies].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In this case, by contrast, an attorney fee award to Lopez, who did not incur or pay fees, would benefit only Exxon, which, under the statute and case law, was not entitled to fees on its own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">Third, there was no evidence that Exxon incurred fees on Lopez\u2019s behalf that it would not have incurred had Lopez not been named as a defendant. While the trial court found the amount of fees \u201cclaimed to be attributable to the defense of Ms. Lopez\u201d\u2014one quarter of the total\u2014was \u201creasonable in amount,\u201d it appears from the supporting documentation that those fees, for the most part, would have been incurred by Exxon whether or not Lopez (who was in any event a key actor in Young\u2019s lawsuit) was named as a defendant. Counsel\u2019s summary of 10 \u201ckey activities undertaken on Angela Lopez\u2019s behalf\u2019 in defending Young\u2019s claims contains only one item that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>even arguably particular to Lopez as a defendant: \u201cResearch and consideration regarding whether Lopez was a proper individual defendant or a sham defendant and whether the case might be removed to federal court.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Exxon neither identified nor estimated fees that were solely attributable to Lopez\u2019s presence in the case as a defendant, and it appears that any such fees were, at most, de minimis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Fourth, <em>Rosenman </em>instructs that trial courts should \u201cmake findings as to the plaintiff\u2019s ability to pay attorney fees, and how large the award should be in light of the plaintiff\u2019s financial situation.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>(Rosenman, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 868, fn. 42.) The trial court declined to award fees except (at defense counsel\u2019s request) in the nominal amount of $1, and there was no reason to make any findings on Young\u2019s ability to pay. We note, however, that a February 20, 2006 declaration from Young showed she was a student who lived with her mother; owned no real property; earned $5,000 from her employment in 2005; had a $2,000 balance on her credit card; and would have to file for bankruptcy if required to pay $18,750 in attorney fees. These circumstances lend further support to the court\u2019s observation that it was \u201cnot moved to exercise its discretion in that way,\u201d that is, when the award to Lopez would actually be an award to Exxon \u201c[rjather than \u2018leveling the playing field\u2019 in frivolous FEHA cases\u201d such as the one against Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">In short, despite its finding that Young\u2019s case against Lopez was frivolous and vexatious, the trial court had the discretion to deny attorney fees to Lopez. Because the award would benefit only Exxon, a defendant which was not otherwise entitled to an award and which did not show it incurred any significant fees on Lopez\u2019s behalf that it would not have incurred in any event, we see no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">The judgment, modified to reflect costs of $7,248.93 rather than $25,998.93, is affirmed.

A warning on September 11, 2004, involved a customer complaint that Young was unwilling to help the customer when she put money in the carwash and received no wash; the customer said Young was \u201crude and very disrespectful,\u201d and told Lopez she had \u201cnever experience^] such treatment from a cashier . ...\u201d A warning dated September 13, 2004, stated that Young yelled at the assistant manager (Najera), rudely and in front of another sales associate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1363-7\"> Labor Code section 1102.5, subdivision (c), provides that an employer \u201cmay not retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1363-8\"> According to Young, she has a \u201clearning disability\u201d with \u201cno name,\u201d which she described this way: \u201cI understand things; I comprehend things perfectly.
