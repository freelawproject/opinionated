The narrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>question on appeal is whether the court correctly interpreted the term, \"building,\u201d in the mechanics\u2019 lien law, Md. Real Prop. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-102 (a) and \u00a7 9-103 (c) (2). We find that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The facts as set forth in appellant\u2019s Amended Petition to Establish and Enforce Mechanic\u2019s Lien, and exhibits attached thereto, are as follows: The appellees, V &amp; M of Virginia, Inc. and Vincent Arosemena, are tenants for years of approximately 4,100 square feet of basement area in the Bethesda Square Shopping Mall. Appellant, Gary Hurst, contracted with the appellees to furnish labor and materials \"to build and construct a restaurant-disco, and to furnish and install all mechanical components for the operation of the restaurant-disco, including but not limited to, electrical, plumbing, heating, air-conditioning and ventilation components.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Work commenced on or about September 19, 1979 and continued until about March 24, 1980. It was alleged that the appellant improved the appellees\u2019 property to the extent of $160,323.03 of which $48,823.03 was due and owing. A lien was sought against the appellees\u2019 property, improvements and fixtures.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The appellees demurred and argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the appellant\u2019s petition failed to state that he had improved the (entire) <em>building </em>to the extent of 25 percent of its value within the meaning of \u00a7 9-102 (a) of the Real Property Article but merely alleged that the <em>appellees\u2019 property </em>(within the building) was improved to the extent of 25 percent of its value. When the matter came on for a hearing in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, it was conceded by appellant\u2019s counsel that \"[w]e cannot make any allegations that it is more than 25 percent of the value of the Bethesda Square Shopping Mall.\u201d In sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\"My conclusion is that to establish a lien on this property you have got to establish that the <em>building </em>wherein the work was done was subject to improvement to the extent of 25 percent of the value of the <em>entire building. </em>That has not been done and for that reason, I will sustain the demurrer in this case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The sole issue, in our view, is whether the word \"building\u201d as used in the Real Property Article, \u00a7 9-102 (a) and \u00a7 9-103 (c) (2) means the entire building, or may also encompass a leased portion of a building, as in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Maryland Real Property Code Ann. \u00a7 9-102 (a) (1980 Cum.Supp.) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\"\u00a7 9-102. Property subject to lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">(a) Buildings. \u2014 Every <em>building </em>erected and every <em>building </em>repaired, rebuilt, or improved to the extent of 25 percent of its value <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is subject to establishment of a lien in accordance with this subtitle for the payment of all debts, without regard to the amount, contracted for work done for or about the building and for materials furnished for or about the building, including the drilling and installation of wells to supply water, the construction or installation of any swimming pool, the sodding, seeding or planting in or about the premises of any shrubs, trees, plants, flowers or nursery products, and the grading, filling, landscaping, and paving of the premises.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Section 9-103 (c) (2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">\"If a <em>building </em>is erected, or repaired, rebuilt or improved to the extent of 25 percent of its value, by a tenant for life or years or by a person employed by the tenant, any lien established in accordance with this subtitle applies only to the extent of the tenant\u2019s interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We note, initially, that the mechanics\u2019 lien law is remedial and is to be construed in the most liberal and comprehensive manner in favor of mechanics and materialmen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Freeform Pools, Inc. v. Strawbridge Home For Boys, Inc., </em>228 Md. 297, 301, 179 A.2d 683, 684 (1962); <em>Reisterstown Lumber Co. v. Reeder, </em>224 Md. 499, 507, 168 A.2d 385, 389 (1961). However, courts have no power to extend it to cases beyond the obvious designs and plain requirements of the statute, and a mechanic\u2019s lien is obtainable only if the requirements of the statute are complied with. <em>Freeform Pools, supra </em>at 301, 179 A.2d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">There is no definition of \"building\u201d in the lien law and that term has been discussed in only one prior Maryland case on the subject. In <em>Freeform Pools, supra, </em>a swimming pool was held not to constitute a \"building\u201d and, therefore, a mechanic\u2019s lien could not be obtained for the costs of its construction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court there quoted dictionary definitions of \"building,\u201d not here apposite, and went on to state that, \"the word 'building\u2019 can not be said to include every type of structure on land\u201d and further observed that the mechanics\u2019 lien law in Maryland \"[had] been repeatedly amended to include specific lienable structures\u201d and that the Legislature \"never intended that the law be stretched to include within its scope structures which were not clearly within the defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>nition of the items included\u201d such as swimming pools. <em>Id. </em>at 301-02, 179 A.2d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">No Maryland case has heretofore addressed the question whether the word \"building\u201d includes a leased <em>portion </em>of a building or, as in this case, a unit in a shopping mall.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The appellant argues that the 25 percent requirement can also refer to a portion of a building and that their leased premises constitutes a \"building\u201d under \u00a7 9-102 (a) and \u00a7 9-103 (c) (2). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The word \"building\u201d in \u00a7 9-102 (a) and \u00a7 9-103 (c) (2) is nowhere qualified by appropriate language so as to include a part of a building, <em>e.g., </em>a store in a shopping mall or one or more floors in an office building.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this respect, we find instructive the following observation by the Court of Appeals in <em>Board of Zoning Appeals v. McKinney, </em>174 Md. 551, 199 A. 540 (1938):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\"[W]hen one speaks of a <em>building, </em>ordinarily he means the <em>entire building </em>and <em>if he means to refer to but a part of it he indicates by some qualifying words that he refers to less than the whole. </em>* * * And yet if 'building\u2019 means anything less than a whole building, there is no standard to guide the Board in determining how much or how little must be so used as to bring it within the scope of the ordinance.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 567, 199 A. at 547, <em>cited in </em>12 C.J.S. <em>Building </em>at 722, n.54 (1980). <em>See Akers v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>179 Md. 448, 451-52, 20 A.2d 181, 183 (1941); <em>cf. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Ambrose &amp; Co. v. Hutchison, </em>356 S.W.2d 215 (Tex.Civ.App. 1962) (pier was a \"building\u201d within mechanics\u2019 lien statute). If the General Assembly intended to include a part of a building in the lien law, the words, \"building or any part thereof,\u201d could have been employed. They were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Nor can we read into \u00a7 9-103 (c) (2) an interpretation of the word \"building\u201d which is at variance with its plain and common usage in \u00a7 9-102 (a). Although \u00a7 9-103 (c) (2) states that, \"any lien established in accordance with this subtitle applies only to the extent of the <em>tenant\u2019s interest\u201d </em>(emphasis added), the application of that section is subject to a condition precedent (also found in \u00a7 9-102 (a)), <em>viz., </em>that a <em>building </em>be repaired, rebuilt or improved to the extent of 25 percent of <em>its </em>value.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The order of Judge Cahoon sustaining appellees\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend was proper. We find no error in his interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">\n<em>Order affirmed; costs to be paid by-appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\">. <em>E.G., </em>Shacks v.

Culbreth, 86 Md. 656, 39 A. 321 (1898) (plaintiff not entitled to mechanic\u2019s lien because it was not shown that repair of a hotel\u2019s steam-heating apparatus amounted to one-fourth of the hotel\u2019s value).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">.

That case did make it abundantly clear, however, that a lien can attach only to whatever interest or estate is held by the person liable for the costs of construction or improvement and that a lien against a tenant\u2019s interest does not reach the reversionary interest of the lessor-owner. <em>See </em>Caplan Bros. v.
