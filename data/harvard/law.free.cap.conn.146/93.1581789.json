No past or present employee of the plaintiff took any part in the picketing of the plaintiff\u2019s place of business or went on strike. The picketing was peaceful and was enjoined on the ground that it was for an unlawful purpose. Peaceful picketing as such was not enjoined, but only that having the specific purpose carefully set out in the judgment file. See <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>v. <em>Hanke, </em>339 U.S. 470, 480, 70 S. Ct. 773, 94 L. Ed. 995; <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>v. <em>Vogt, Inc., </em>354 U.S. 284, 294, 77 S. Ct. 1166, 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 1347; <em>Youngdahl </em>v. <em>Rainfair, Inc., </em>355 U.S. 131, 136, 78 S. Ct. 206, 2 L. Ed. 2d 151. The plaintiff operated a small restaurant, consisting of a bar and grill, in Bridgeport. It had three full-time employees, one of whom, the permittee under the state liquor control law, supervised the sale of liquor and any activities of the other employees in connection therewith. Early in 1954, the defendant union decided to secure written union shop contracts from the various establishments in which its members were employed. Such a contract was prepared in April, 1956, and submitted to the plaintiff. It was first shown to William Schlacter, an employee of the plaintiff and a member of the union. He read it over and stated that it was a good contract. He was requested to have the other two employees, also union members, read it and then to turn it over to the plaintiff. Hugh Neary, the president, treasurer and general manager of the plaintiff, read over the contract with the three employees and told them he would provide for any benefit mentioned in the contract which they did not then have or would do even better. The plaintiff did not sign the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Thereafter, in the spring of 1956, two of the three employees withdrew from the union and turned in their union books. A union placard which had been on the premises was removed. After the withdrawal of the two employees from the union, it filed charges of unfair labor practices with the state labor relations board. Parenthetically, it may be observed that it does not appear that there was then any thought or claim that the plaintiff\u2019s business had an interstate character which would preclude state jurisdiction. At about the same time, in May, 1956, the union commenced picketing. After a meeting between representatives of the plaintiff, the union and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the state labor relations board, the union withdrew its unfair labor practice charges and also its pickets. Further negotiations were then contemplated. In November, 1956, the union submitted the proposed union shop contract which is actually involved in this case. It is slightly different from, but basically the same as, the original contract. The new contract includes provisions requiring that all employees \u201cremain in good standing at all times with the Union as a condition of employment\u201d and that the employer recognize the union \u201cas the sole bargaining agent for all [its] employees coming under the jurisdiction of the union.\u201d None of the plaintiff\u2019s employees was consulted about this contract or any negotiations regarding it. In April, 1957, the union itself dropped from its membership the third employee of the plaintiff because he had failed to pay dues for over a year. While all three employees were members of the union prior to May, 1956, the union at no time was appointed or recognized as their bargaining representative, nor has there ever been a contract between the plaintiff and the union. For some time prior to May 15, 1957, the date when the picketing involved in this case commenced, none of the plaintiff\u2019s employees had been a member of the union. A temporary injunction stopped the picketing on June 3, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The defendants attack the findings as to union membership mainly on the claim that since all three employees had been members of the union prior to the spring of 1956, they necessarily would have remained members but for intimidation or coercion on the part of Neary. There was neither direct nor circumstantial evidence of intimidation or coercion on his part, and the court was fully justified in finding, as in effect it did, that the employees themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>did not wish the plaintiff\u2019s restaurant to become a union shop, even though they had been willing to belong to the union before it attempted to force the plaintiff to enter into a union shop contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u201c[E]ven peaceful picketing may be unlawful if it is for an unlawful purpose.\u201d <em>Kenmike Theatre, Inc. </em>v. <em>Moving Picture Operators, </em>139 Conn. 95, 98, 90 A.2d 881. If the object of picketing is to compel the employer to violate the provisions of subdivision (10) of \u00a7 7392 of the General Statutes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then the object or purpose of the picketing is unlawful. Ibid. Section 7391<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permits employees to decide for themselves whether they should join a labor organization, except where a closed or union shop agreement has been made between the employer and a union under \u00a7 7392 (5) and the union is a labor organization which is the representative of employees as provided in what is now \u00a7 3033d of the 1955 Cumulative Supplement. Id., 99. The defendants claim that the <em>KenmiJce </em>decision, supra, was based on the fact that in that case none of the employees had ever been members of the union. There is nothing in the opinion justifying such a construction. The defendants also claim that the interpretation which that decision placed upon the provisions of \u00a7 7391 was not only erroneous but pure dictum. In the first place, any foundation for the claim that the construction was dictum is removed by a reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>of the concurring opinion and also by the interpretation placed on the <em>Kenmike </em>decision in <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>142 Conn. 497, 504, 115 A.2d 671. Secondly, the construction which the <em>Kenmike </em>opinion placed on \u00a7 7391 has been independently reached by courts in other jurisdictions in construing generally similar statutes, and there is no justification for changing it. See, for instance, <em>Pappas </em>v. <em>Stacey, </em>151 Me. 36, 116 A.2d 497, and a collection of cases cited in note, 32 A.L.R.2d 1026, 1043-1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">There was no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that picketing for the purpose prohibited in the injunction was unlawful. The vice in the picketing was the unlawfulness of its purpose, not any unlawfulness in the manner in which it. was conducted. Therefore the injunction, which, as already pointed out, carefully limited its prohibition to picketing for the stated unlawful purpose, provided the minimum restriction which would effectuate, and protect against violation, the law and policy of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The claim that the picketing was permissible as an exercise of the right of free speech is of no avail in the face of the unlawfulness of its purpose and the limited scope of the injunction. <em>Kenmike Theatre, Inc. </em>v. <em>Moving Picture Operators, </em>139 Conn. 95, 101, 90 A.2d 881; <em>International Brotherhood </em>v. <em>Vogt, Inc., </em>354 U.S. 284, 293, 77 S. Ct. 1166, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">A further basic claim of the defendants is that since the plaintiff\u2019s business affeeted interstate commerce, no arm of the state, judicial or otherwise, had jurisdiction to act in the matter. See <em>Devine Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood, </em>145 Conn. 77, 82, 139 A.2d 60. The court found that the plaintiff\u2019s business was local in character and that the plaintiff was not engaged in activities affecting interstate commerce within the meaning of the Labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Management Relations Act, 1947. 61 Stat. 136, 161, 138, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141 (b), 142 (1), 151, and particularly 152 (6), (7). The plaintiff had annual gross receipts of about $78,000. Its annual purchases of food and supplies amounted to about $42,000 and were all made from Connecticut wholesalers. Less than 1 per cent of its patrons were from outside Connecticut. There is no claim that the picketing as such affected interstate commerce. The only possible basis for the defendants\u2019 claim of lack of jurisdiction is that the picketing affected a business which in turn affected interstate commerce under the so-called indirect interstate import rule, in that the plaintiff estimated, and the court found, that about 95 per cent of the products purchased from wholesalers had their origin \u2014 that is, were either produced or manufactured \u2014 outside Connecticut. There is nothing to indicate that the plaintiff\u2019s restaurant was in any way unique, nor that this percentage would not have been substantially the same in the case of any other similar establishment located in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The defendants correctly claim that since this controversy involves only peaceful picketing, if it is within the jurisdiction of the national labor relations board under \u00a7 10 (a) of the federal act; 61 Stat. 146, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (a); because it involves an unfair labor practice; 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158; and affects interstate commerce within the definition of the federal act; 61 Stat. 138, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (7); then state action is precluded. <em>Garner </em>v. <em>Teamsters Union, </em>346 U.S. 485, 490, 74 S. Ct. 161, 98 L. Ed. 228; <em>Youngdahl </em>v. <em>Rainfair, Inc., </em>355 U.S. 131, 139, 78 S. Ct. 206, 2 L. Ed. 2d 151 <em>&amp; </em>note, 1630. The sole method of transferring jurisdiction to state authorities in such a situation is by action by the national labor relations board in ceding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>jurisdiction to the state under the provisions of \u00a7 10 (a) of the federal act. That action was not taken here. This rule of law applies even though the board itself refuses to act or to take jurisdiction, thereby leaving a \u201cno man\u2019s land,\u201d subject to regulation by no agency or court. <em>Guss </em>v. <em>Utah Labor Relations Board, </em>353 U.S. 1, 10, 77 S. Ct. 598, 1 L. Ed. 2d 601; <em>Amalgamated Meat Cutters </em>v. <em>Fairlawn Meats, Inc., </em>353 U.S. 20, 23, 77 S. Ct. 604, 1 L. Ed. 2d 613; <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>353 U.S. 26, 28, 77 S. Ct. 607, 1 L. Ed. 2d 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">The court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff\u2019s business did not affect interstate commerce cannot, however, be successfully challenged. In both the <em>Guss </em>and <em>San Diego </em>cases, supra, it was uncontroverted that the business affected interstate commerce within the meaning of the federal act. In the <em>Fairlawn </em>case, supra, while the sales in the retail meat markets involved were all intrastate, out of a total of annual purchases from wholesalers of about $900,000, slightly more than $100,000 worth came directly from without the state, and as much or more comprised indirect interstate imports. In <em>Youngdahl </em>v. <em>Rainfair, Inc., </em>supra, 137, it was undisputed that the clothing factory involved was engaged in interstate commerce. Not every business so affects interstate commerce that it is under the jurisdiction of the national labor relations board. But that board does have jurisdiction in the case of any business, large or small, which, even though intrastate in basic character, \u201caffects commerce\u201d within the definition of the federal act. <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Fainblatt, </em>306 U.S. 601, 604, 59 S. Ct. 668, 83 L. Ed. 1014; <em>Garner </em>v. <em>Teamsters Union, </em>supra, 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In accordance with the alternative claim of the defendants, we may assume, without in any way decid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ing, that the picketing here was an unfair labor practice under the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947. 61 Stat. 140, 141, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (a) (1), (3), (b) (2). In cases of this type, it becomes necessary for a state court to determine whether the business so affects interstate commerce as to preclude state action. <em>Devine Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood, </em>145 Conn. 77, 82, 139 A.2d 60. This is a question of fact which may be relatively simple or relatively difficult, and of course is always subject to review in the United States Supreme Court. Here the question is factually clear. In <em>International Brotherhood </em>v. <em>Vogt, Inc., </em>354 U.S. 284, 293, 77 S. Ct. 1166, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1347, for instance, the opinion indicates no attempt to claim that the operation of the gravel pit was a business affecting interstate commerce. In <em>Pappas </em>v. <em>Stacey, </em>151 Me. 36, 116 A.2d 497, a restaurant in Portland was picketed for the sole purpose of compelling the employer to put pressure on his employees to join the union in violation of the declared policy of Maine. The restaurant had an average of twenty-five regular employees and five other sporadic employees. It is hardly conceivable that such a large restaurant, in Portland, Maine, could have had less indirect interstate imports than the plaintiff\u2019s little restaurant in Bridgeport. Yet neither the Supreme Court of Maine nor the Supreme Court of the United States, in the extended discussion of this case in the <em>Vogt </em>opinion, supra, even suggested that the business of the Portland restaurant was, or might be, of an interstate character such as to preclude state action. The court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff\u2019s restaurant business in Bridgeport did not affect interstate commerce within the controlling definition in the federal act was not only fully supported by the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>but was the only conclusion which could have been reasonably reached under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">While the defendants made many claims in their very extended brief, we have discussed only the three which were properly raised in the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 154. We have, however, considered their other claims, in which they attack the power of the court to issue the injunction under the limitations of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7411 and 7412, part of our \u201cLittle Norris-LaGuardia Act,\u201d and find none of them well taken. <em>Kenmike Theatre, Inc. </em>v. <em>Moving Picture Operators, </em>139 Conn. 95, 97, 90 A.2d 881; <em>Devine Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood, </em>supra. In one of these claims the defendants contend that money damages constituted an adequate remedy. In fact, no damages were awarded. See <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>353 U.S. 26, 29, 77 S. Ct. 607, 1 L. Ed. 2d 618. It is true that a suit for the recovery of damages for a tort actionable under state law may be maintained even though the tort constitutes, or might be held to constitute, an unfair labor practice under the federal act and even though that act is applicable because the tort occured during a labor dispute of a character affecting interstate commerce. <em>International Union </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>356 U.S. 634, 635, 78 S. Ct. 932, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1030; <em>United Construction Workers </em>v. <em>Laburnum Construction Corporation, </em>347 U.S. 656, 657, 74 S. Ct. 833, 98 L. Ed. 1025. Substantially the same rule also applies to at least some suits which sound in contract. <em>International Assn. </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>356 U.S. 617, 620, 78 S. Ct. 923, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1018. The recovery of damages, however, could properly be found, as it was here, an inadequate remedy, in the light of the subordinate findings that truck drivers refused to cross the picket line to make deliveries to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>tiff, thus preventing it from obtaining the merchandise necessary to keep its restaurant in operation, and that customers refused to enter the restaurant because of the picketing. We find nothing improper or unreasonable in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that no adequate remedy other than injunctive relief was available in the premises. See <em>Mattis </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>138 Conn. 51, 56, 82 A.2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The plaintiff, in a purported appeal, filed an assignment of error attacking the court\u2019s finding that there was a labor dispute. This appeal was wholly improper and must be dismissed. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Ad</em>ministrator, 142 Conn. 497, 509, 115 A.2d 671. If we consider the assignment of error, apart from the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, it still is unnecessary to review the court\u2019s finding, since in this opinion we have assumed, without in any way deciding, that the court correctly held that a labor dispute existed within the broad definition in our Labor Relations Act. General Statutes \u00a7 7408 (c); <em>Kenmike Theatre, Inc. </em>v. <em>Moving Picture Operators, </em>supra, 98; <em>Devine Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood, </em>supra, 80; <em>Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Alliance, </em>127 Conn. 415, 421, 17 A.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">There is no error on the defendants\u2019 appeal; the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-6\"> \u201cSee. 7392. unfair labor practices.
