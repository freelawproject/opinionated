The pertinent paragraphs of the will are quoted in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paragraph 4 gave all the rest, residue and remainder to the testator\u2019s children, share and share alike, except that in the case of children over twenty-five at the date of the testator\u2019s death the gifts were outright, whereas in the case of children under twenty-five their shares were to be held in trust and paid over as each attained that age. The other paragraphs of the will were not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">When the will was executed, the testator was forty-eight years old. About two years later he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>married to the plaintiff, a woman whom he had not yet met at the time of the execution of the will. No children were born of this marriage. The Old Saybrook property referred to in paragraph 3 of the will has an approximate value of but $11,500; the approximate value of the entire estate is $250,000. It is the claim of the plaintiff that by the testator\u2019s marriage to her the will was revoked under the provisions of what is now \u00a7 45-162 of the 1958 Revision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With the provisions as to express revocation we obviously have no concern. Only the portion of the statute regarding implied revocation upon subsequent marriage is involved in this case. The provision as to implied revocation by marriage had its origin in chapter 84 of the Public Acts of 1875 and appeared in the revision of probate laws in 1885. Public Acts 1885, c. 110, \u00a7 135; Rev. 1888, \u00a7 542. Its immediate effect was to abrogate the common-law rule that marriage alone was not sufficient to revoke an antecedent will, but only marriage coupled with the birth of a child. <em>Goodsell\u2019s Appeal, </em>55 Conn. 171, 180, 10 A. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The portion of the statute providing for implied revocation upon the subsequent birth of a child has been before this court in a number of cases. It has been held that an actual gift to the after-born child is not required in order to save a will from implied revocation and that it is sufficient if the will itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>without resort to extrinsic evidence, shows a prevision on the part of the testator of the contingency of his having another child. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co., </em>95 Conn. 194, 197, 110 A. 833; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>106 Conn. 76, 79, 137 A. 17; <em>Fulton Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>126 Conn. 369, 371, 11 A.2d 393. It is obvious from the quoted provisions of the will that the testator envisioned the contingency not only of his remarriage but of his thereafter having children. Indeed, there was not mere prevision of, but actual provision for, both contingencies. The real claim of the plaintiff is that the prevision required by the statute, as applied to implied revocation by subsequent marriage, must be prevision of the possibility of marriage to the particular person married as distinguished from prevision of the possibility of marriage to some then unknown person.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Statutes generally similar to ours in their provisions for implied revocation, although differing in wording, exist in many states, and the cases construing them in respect to subsequent marriage of the testator are collected in an annotation in 127 A.L.R. 750 at page 768. As pointed out in <em>Fulton Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>supra, 373, \u201c[m]uch of the conflict in the authorities can be explained by the differing phraseology of the statutes.\u201d The obvious purpose of our statute is to ensure that the contingency of marriage will not be overlooked in the drafting of a will. The purpose is not to ensure that adequate provision for a spouse will be made. Another statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> gives a surviving spouse protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>from a grossly inadequate testamentary provision as far as such protection is given at all. Section 45-162 does not require that a testator evaluate the merits, as an object of his bounty, of a particular person, whether spouse or after-born child. This would be impossible in the case of an after-born child or, as here, in the case of a spouse unknown to the testator at the date of the execution of the will. The court correctly held that the will was not revoked by the subsequent marriage to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-10\"> \u201c1.
