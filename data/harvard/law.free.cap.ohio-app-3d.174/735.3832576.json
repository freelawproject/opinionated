Rocco, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiffs-appellants Diane Coleman, personally and on behalf of her minor son Brandon Coleman, and Enoch Al-Amin (collectively, \u201cColeman\u201d) appeal from the trial court order that granted summary judgment to defendantappellee, the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (\u201cRTA\u201d), on their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-16\">{\u00b6 2} Coleman argues in her two assignments of error that summary judgment in RTA\u2019s favor was unwarranted on the record before the trial court. This court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>agrees. Consequently, Coleman\u2019s assignments of error are sustained. The trial court\u2019s order is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">{\u00b6 3} According to the record, on the night of September 12, 2005, Coleman left her work at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Cleveland, and, as was her habit, boarded the route number 6 RTA bus for home. Although the bus was crowded, she found a seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 4} A female co-worker, whom Coleman recognized but whose name she at that time did not know, also boarded. Coleman knew the woman lived near her, because she often took the same bus and exited at the same stop as Coleman. The woman found a seat directly across the aisle from Coleman. Coleman subsequently discovered that the co-worker\u2019s name was Frances Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 5} Spencer sat next to a man, later identified as Peter Farquharson, who occupied the window seat. Coleman had seen Spencer sit with Farquharson on previous occasions and had assumed the two knew each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 6} After a period of time, some of the other passengers alighted. Spencer and Farquharson took the opportunity to move into seats a few rows closer to the front of the bus. They otherwise retained their original seating arrangement. Coleman decided to do likewise. However, when she took a seat near the two, Spencer began to accuse her of stepping on Farquharson\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">{\u00b6 7} Coleman argued to the contrary, since Farquharson was sitting by the window. Her protests seemed merely to enrage Spencer; Spencer stood up and launched into a verbal attack of a personal nature. Farquharson, apparently emboldened by Spencer\u2019s tirade, joined in by cursing, calling Coleman \u201cnames, and threatening that he was going to do bodily harm\u201d to her. He \u201clunged\u201d from his seat toward her, \u201csaying that he was going to cut\u201d Coleman, but Spencer\u2019s position prevented Farquharson from actually reaching Coleman.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">{\u00b6 8} Spencer at that point stated to Coleman, \u201cI\u2019m going to cut you up and down.\u201d While pushing him back into his seat, Spencer told Farquharson, \u201cWe are going to get her when we get off. * * * We are going to cut her up and down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">{\u00b6 9} Coleman, frightened by their behavior, attempted to use her cellular telephone, only to find that it wouldn\u2019t work. She then loudly called out to the bus driver, \u201cHey, they are back here threatening to cut me up. Call the police, or call 911, because they are threatening to cut me. He threatened to slit my throat.\u201d Spencer still stood, although the bus compartment no longer was crowded.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">{\u00b6 10} According to Coleman, the bus driver stopped the bus to let a passenger alight. He simply looked at her in his mirror; otherwise, he gave no response. He continued driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Spencer eventually returned to her seat, still holding Farquharson back, and still making menacing comments. When the bus finally came to their stop in East Cleveland, the two exited. Coleman stood up and reiterated her plea to the driver to call the police. Although she made eye contact with him in the bus mirror, she received no acknowledgment. Instead, \u201ceverybody\u201d on the bus sat \u201cin silence. Nobody [was] saying anything, not even him. He\u2019s just got the door open waiting for me to get off the bus.\u201d Spencer and Farquharson stood outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 12} From the driver\u2019s refusal to respond, Coleman believed she had no choice but to leave. She knew that her boyfriend, Al-Amin, and her 11-year-old son were waiting for her; she could see them approaching. When she alighted, she heard Spencer continue to curse at her; at the same time, Coleman saw Spencer pass a knife to Farquharson. The bus pulled away.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 13} Farquharson lunged toward Coleman with the knife. Coleman\u2019s son reacted by \u201crunning up, and * * * pushing] him away * * Farquharson grabbed the boy\u2019s shirt front and sliced at his face, opening the skin near his eye. Al-Amin stepped in to defend the boy, and received stab wounds to both his chest area and one of his fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 14} Seeing that Coleman was not alone, Spencer fled the fight. Similarly, in the face of Al-Amin\u2019s resistance to the attack, Farquharson soon followed. Coleman began \u201cflagging down\u201d passing motorists for help. One stopped and agreed to take Coleman\u2019s son and Al-Amin to a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">{\u00b6 15} Coleman subsequently filed the instant action against RTA and the unknown bus driver.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Coleman alleged that while acting within the scope of bis employment for a \u201ccommon carrier,\u201d RTA\u2019s bus driver, despite notice of a danger of injury to a passenger, \u201cnegligently, recklessly, maliciously, and with wanton disregard, failed to protect\u201d his passenger, and this failure was the proximate cause of both emotional injury to Coleman and physical injuries to her son and boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">{\u00b6 16} RTA\u2019s answer denied the pertinent allegations of the complaint and set forth several affirmative defenses. Following discovery, RTA filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to Coleman\u2019s claims. RTA argued that, pursuant to the \u201cpublic duty doctrine,\u201d it had \u201cno duty to provide police protection\u201d to a passenger since no statute created such a duty. RTA further argued that it was immune from liability pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">{\u00b6 17} RTA attached evidentiary material to its motion. These documents included a copy of Coleman\u2019s deposition testimony, along with two affidavits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>According to its acting systems security supervisor, on the night of the incident, \u201cTransit Police received no calls * * * or reports of incidents involving any No. 6 bus * * Similarly, RTA\u2019s assistant manager of service quality indicated that the relevant database reflected \u201cno radio communications from any operators on the No. 6 bus line reporting any passenger disturbances * * * threatened assaults, overt alarms, or covert alarms on September 12, 2005 from 7:30 p.m. to Midnight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">{\u00b6 18} Coleman filed a brief in opposition to RTA\u2019s motion. She argued that the common carrier\u2019s duty to provide protection for its passengers fell under common law rather than statute. Additionally, she argued that the facts of this case indicated the existence of genuine issues with respect to RTA\u2019s entitlement to immunity from liability on her claims under R.C. 2744.01 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">{\u00b6 19} Coleman supported her position with, inter alia, a copy of the relevant portion of the bus-operator handbook, which RTA provided to its drivers. According to section D, paragraph 8, \u201cIn the event that a passenger disturbance impacts on the safety of other customers, the operator will stop the coach, evacuate the customers if necessary, and notify Service Quality for assistance or summon an available police officer or supervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">{\u00b620} Coleman also supplied the trial court with a copy of the deposition testimony of Alan Erenrich, RTA\u2019s director of service management, who authored its bus-operator handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">{\u00b6 21} Erenrich stated that each coach was equipped with two emergency call buttons ready at hand to the bus operator. If the driver pushed the \u201covert button,\u201d the call would \u201cshow up on the * * * transit police dispatcher\u2019s screen,\u201d alerting the dispatcher to radio the driver. If the driver pushed the \u201ccovert button,\u201d the alert not only displayed on the transit police dispatcher\u2019s screen, but it opened a microphone inside the bus \u201cso that the * * * dispatcher can hear whatever\u2019s going on in the bus,\u201d thus enabling the dispatcher to locate the bus position via a global-positioning system and to assess the situation without using the bus radio. The driver could push either button without detection.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">{\u00b6 22} Erenrich additionally opined that if a bus driver became aware of threats to a passenger from another passenger, the driver should use \u201chis judgment\u201d to contact the transit police. Similarly, if the passenger being threatened made that specific assertion, the driver \u201cshould call the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">{\u00b6 23} Coleman further provided the trial court with the affidavit of East Cleveland detective Jay Hodge. Hodge stated that if his police department had been notified on September 12, 2005, of a threatened assault involving a weapon upon an RTA passenger, a unit would have been able to respond to the bus stop within two minutes. Such a timely notification of the threat before the bus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>reached the stop \u201cmore likely than not\u201d would have \u201cprevented the attempted assault on Diane Coleman and the actual assault upon Brandon Coleman and Enoch Al-Amin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">{\u00b6 24} After RTA filed a brief in reply to Coleman\u2019s arguments, the trial court issued a journal entry that granted RTA\u2019s motion for summary judgment without particularizing the basis for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">{\u00b6 25} Coleman presents two interrelated assignments of error for this court\u2019s review. In them, she argues that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment to RTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">{\u00b6 26} On a motion for summary judgment, the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. Thus, the moving party must inform the court of the basis of the motion and identify evidence in the record that affirmatively shows that the nonmoving party cannot support her claims. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264. The nonmoving party is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in her favor. Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">{\u00b6 27} RTA provided the trial court with two bases for its motion. First, it asserted that the \u201cpublic duty\u201d doctrine applied to bar Coleman\u2019s claim of negligence against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">{\u00b6 28} As articulated in <em>Sawicki v. Ottawa Hills </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 222, 525 N.E.2d 468, paragraph two of the syllabus, the doctrine provides a limitation on the existence of a public entity\u2019s duty toward its private citizens. Thus, when a statute imposes a duty upon a public entity which is intended for the public good, the failure to adequately perform the duty does not permit a private right of redress for injuries caused by that failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">{\u00b6 29} The \u201cpublic duty\u201d doctrine was created in response to the judicial abrogation of common-law principles of sovereign immunity. Id. at 225, 525 N.E.2d 468. This court, however, has determined that the doctrine, as it applies to political subdivisions, \u201chas been superseded by the enactment of the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, codified at R.C. Chapter 2744, et seq.\u201d <em>Sudnik v. Crimi </em>(1997), 117 Ohio App.3d 394, 397, 690 N.E.2d 925. This act is the reinstatement, in statutory form, of the common-law doctrine of \u201csovereign immunity.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">{\u00b6 30} The Ohio Supreme Court has indicated a lack of intent to overturn the foregoing determination. <em>Wallace v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of State Fire Marshal, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 266, 2002-Ohio-4210, 773 N.E.2d 1018, fn. 13. Therefore, RTA\u2019s first basis for a grant of summary judgment in its favor lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>{\u00b6 31} RTA\u2019s second basis for its motion was an assertion of sovereign immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). That statute classifies the functions of political subdivisions as either \u201cgovernmental\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d and states that <em>\u201c[ejxcept as provided in subdivision (B) </em>of this section, a political subdivision is <em>not </em>liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death or loss to person or property allegedly caused by <em>any act or omission of </em>* * * <em>an employee </em>of the political subdivision in connection with\u201d those functions. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">{\u00b6 32} Since R.C. 2744.01(G)(2)(e) specifies that the operation of a transit company is classified as a \u201cproprietary\u201d function, the statutes have \u201cbeen held to be applicable to regional transit authorities.\u201d <em>Martin v. Cent. Ohio Transit Auth. </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 83, 91, 590 N.E.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">{\u00b6 33} Thus, RTA was immune from liability in this case unless the evidence demonstrated a fact question with regard to the existence of an exception to immunity under R.C. 2744.02(B). That subsection provides, \u201csubject to\u201d R.C. 2744.03, that the political subdivision \u201cis liable,\u201d if, inter alia, the injury is \u201ccaused by the negligent performance of acts by [its] employees with respect to proprietary functions * * *.\u201d R.C. 2744.03 provides \u201cdefenses\u201d if an exception to immunity, as set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B), exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">{\u00b6 34} For instance, pursuant to subsection R.C. 2744.03(A)(3), immunity remains if the \u201cfailure to act by the employee involved * * * was within the discretion of the employee with respect to * * * enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and responsibilities of the * * * position * * *.\u201d Similarly, immunity remains if the injury \u201cresulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in determining * * * how to use * * * resources unless the judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d R.C. 2744.03(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">{\u00b6 35} In order to defeat a motion for summary judgment in a negligence action, the plaintiff must identify a duty owed to her by the defendant. <em>Peterson v. Greater Cleveland RTA </em>(Jan. 26, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 67603, 1995 WL 32867, citing <em>Keister v. Park Centre Lanes </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 19, 3 OBR 20, 443 N.E.2d 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">{\u00b6 36} RTA did not dispute that the bus driver was acting within the scope of his employment on the night of the incident. Cf. <em>Martin v. Cent. Ohio Transit Auth., </em>70 Ohio App.3d 83, 590 N.E.2d 411. At common law, a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d owed \u201cthe highest duty of care for the safety of [its] passengers.\u201d Id., citing <em>Jones v. Youngstown Mun. Ry. Co. </em>(1937), 133 Ohio St. 118, 10 O.O. 125, 12 N.E.2d 279. Furthermore, \u201cit has been held that a driver of a common carrier has an affirmative duty to protect his passengers.\u201d Id. at 93, 590 N.E.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>{\u00b6 37} Coleman\u2019s evidence, as expressed by Erenrich\u2019s testimony in conjunction with the relevant portion of the bus-operators\u2019 handbook, indicated that RTA expected its drivers to understand and to fulfill this \u201caffirmative duty.\u201d Erenrich admitted that alerting the transit dispatcher to a potentially dangerous situation was a simple matter of pushing a button, an act that placed the driver himself in no jeopardy. Coleman\u2019s deposition testimony left no doubt that she made the driver aware of the situation; Spencer stood in the aisle over her as she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">{\u00b6 38} Indeed, RTA\u2019s own evidence, provided in support of its motion, supported Coleman\u2019s claim of negligence. RTA established the fact that on the night of the incident, the transit security dispatcher received no alerts from a No. 6 bus. The evidence, therefore, indicated that the driver made not even a minimal effort to fulfill his duty of care toward his passenger Coleman. <em>Peterson v. Greater Cleveland RTA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">{\u00b6 39} The operator simply drove, ignoring the situation, and ignoring Coleman\u2019s request for help. Coleman testified that Spencer and Farquharson menaced her for over \u201cten minutes\u201d while the bus proceeded on its route. Finally, after refusing her request for help one last time, thus ensuring that Coleman got off the bus at the same stop as the people who were threatening her with bodily harm, the bus operator drove away. <em>Estate of Ridley v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, </em>150 Ohio App.3d 383, 2002-Ohio-6344, 781 N.E.2d 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">{\u00b6 40} Hodge averred that a simple alert directed to the East Cleveland police department while the situation was in progress would have ensured police presence at the bus stop upon Coleman\u2019s arrival there. This would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d have prevented the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">{\u00b6 41} It is clear that the evidence, when construed most strongly in Coleman\u2019s favor, failed to demonstrate that RTA was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Coleman\u2019s claim. <em>Peterson v. Greater Cleveland RTA; </em>cf. <em>Ward v. Greater Cleveland RTA </em>(May 26, 1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 53754, 1988 WL 86424.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">{\u00b6 42} Rather, genuine issues of material fact remained with respect to whether RTA established its immunity from liability, whether Coleman proved the existence of an exception to that immunity, whether the evidence demonstrated that RTA could establish a defense if an exception existed, and whether, ultimately, Coleman\u2019s injuries proximately were caused by either \u201cnegligent\u201d or wantonly \u201creckless\u201d behavior on the driver\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">{\u00b6 43} Based upon the foregoing, Coleman\u2019s assignments of error are sustained. The trial court\u2019s order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Gallagher, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b777-5\">Stewart, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-11\">.
