He was sentenced to an indefinite term of 15 years to life on the underlying conviction, consecutive to a three-year term on the firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted along with his cousin, Edward Dubose. The two were to have separate trials. The state\u2019s position was that appellant and Edward purposely shot and killed Marcus Bradley during the early morning hours of November 12, 2001. Evidence showed that appellant was present with the victim at the scene of the murder and that appellant was later seen with blood on his clothes. Appellant denied any involvement in the murder and in fact presented evidence that he had spent the night at his girlfriend\u2019s apartment at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">{\u00b6 3} On appeal, appellant argues that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant also argues that he was denied his right to a public trial in violation of the Sixth Amendment and that he was denied his right to a speedy trial. For the following reasons, we conclude that the trial court committed structural error in closing the courtroom in this case, and therefore, appellant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">{\u00b6 4} For ease of understanding, we address appellant\u2019s assigned errors out of sequence. His second and third assignments of error concern the sufficiency and weight of the evidence, and we will deal with them collectively:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe state of Ohio failed to introduce sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant-appellant Ceyanie Dubose purposely or knowingly aided and abetted the principal in the killing of Marcus Bradley, thereby violating Mr. Dubose\u2019s due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe jury verdict finding defendant-appellant Ceyanie Dubose guilty of complicity to murder is against the manifest weight of the evidence in violation of Article IV, \u00a7 3(B)(3) of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">{\u00b6 7} When a defendant claims that his conviction is supported by insufficient evidence, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found that all the elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Eley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 169, 10 O.O.3d 340, 383 N.E.2d 132; <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 23, 514 N.E.2d 394. Whether the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>presented sufficient evidence is a question of law. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 8} The weight of the evidence, on the other hand, concerns the greater amount of credible evidence offered at trial. When reviewing a claim that a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the reviewing court must weigh the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses to determine whether the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717; <em>Thompkins, </em>supra. For a court of appeals to reverse on grounds of manifest weight of the evidence, it must unanimously disagree with the jury\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant was found guilty of complicity to murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), which states, \u201cNo person shall purposely cause the death of another</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cPurposely\u201d is defined in R.C. 2901.22(A):</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cA person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2923.03, forbidding complicity, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(A) No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(2) Aid or abet another in committing the offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(3) Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of section 2923.01 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">{\u00b6 17} A defendant\u2019s \u201c \u2018[participation in criminal intent may be inferred from presence, companionship and conduct before and after the offense is committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Johnson </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 245, 754 N.E.2d 796, quoting <em>State v. Pruett </em>(1971), 28 Ohio App.2d 29, 34, 57 O.O.2d 38, 273 N.E.2d 884. However, mere presence at the scene of a murder is not enough to establish complicity. <em>State v. Mootispaw </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 566, 570, 674 N.E.2d 1222. A defendant must have had some level of participation by way of providing assistance or encouragement. <em>State v. Nievas </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 451, 456, 700 N.E.2d 339; <em>State v. Sims </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 56, 58, 10 OBR 65, 460 N.E.2d 672. Aiding and abetting includes such things as supporting, assisting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>encouraging, cooperating with, advising, or inciting another to commit the underlying offense. <em>Johnson, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant argues that the evidence at his trial was insufficient to establish that he aided or conspired with Edward Dubose to purposely cause the death of Marcus Bradley. Appellant claims that his convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">{\u00b6 19} On appeal, we review the evidence and consider appellant\u2019s presence and conduct before and after Bradley\u2019s death to determine whether the record reflects that he supported, assisted, encouraged, cooperated with, or advised the principal in Bradley\u2019s murder. <em>Johnson, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 245, 754 N.E.2d 796. We conclude that the evidence supporting conviction was far from overwhelming. Nevertheless, based on the law and the record before us, we must conclude that it was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">{\u00b6 20} The state\u2019s first witness at trial was Shirley Sheeler. On the night of November 11, 2001, Shirley and her husband were watching television in their home on Hoffman Street in Youngstown, Ohio. They heard a noise and looked out the window. Shirley saw a white car that had struck the curb or rail. She also noticed two males walking and laughing alongside the car. One was wearing a blue and gray coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 21} Irvin Sheeler also testified. He recalled hearing a loud noise that night. He looked outside and saw a white Cadillac at the curb. Irvin identified State\u2019s Exhibit 18, a photograph of the white Cadillac he saw that night. He then noticed the car slowly roll down the hill. Sometime thereafter he heard gunshots. It was about 1:00 a.m. The Sheelers did not call the police, because they frequently heard gunshots in their neighborhood. Later that same morning, the police knocked on their door investigating a murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">{\u00b6 22} Youngstown Police Department Officer Kirt Hileman testified that he found the body of a black male face down on the side of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">{\u00b623} Dr. Jesse Giles, the Mahoning County deputy coroner at the time, testified at trial. Giles had performed the autopsy of the victim, Marcus Bradley, a.k.a. Marcus Moore. The victim tested positive for alcohol and marijuana. Giles concluded that Bradley\u2019s cause of death was homicide as a result of three gunshot wounds to the left side of his head. Two of the shots were fired with the gun placed against the victim\u2019s skull. He also had an abrasion to his forehead. He was wearing a blue and gray coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">{\u00b6 24} The state\u2019s next witness, Wilson Taylor, initially failed to appear to testify and was eventually arrested in order to secure his testimony. Taylor was in jail on cocaine-trafficking charges in 2003, when he was contacted by the police and first provided information in this case. The prosecutor\u2019s office agreed not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>oppose his judicial release in exchange for Taylor\u2019s testimony, and he admits that he agreed to testify against Edward and Ceyanie Dubose in exchange for his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 25} Taylor testified that he was with appellant on the night in question and that he and Edward were also friends at the time. Edward picked Taylor up in his Cadillac to drive around and smoke marijuana on the night of November 11, 2001. The two later pulled into a Dubose relative\u2019s driveway and fell asleep in the car. Taylor woke up to the sounds of appellant and Marcus Bradley knocking on Edward\u2019s car. Taylor identified State\u2019s exhibits 18 and 19 as photographs of Edward\u2019s Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">{\u00b626} Taylor said that appellant and Bradley got into the back seat of Edward\u2019s car and all four drove off to buy marijuana. About two hours later, they did obtain more marijuana. Taylor was now driving Edward\u2019s car, and all four were smoking marijuana. Taylor pulled over to the side of the road so that appellant could urinate in the woods, but he left the car in gear. When Taylor heard a knocking sound on the trunk, Bradley exited the back seat of the car. (Tr. 320, 322, 323, 328.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">{\u00b6 27} Minutes later, Taylor saw Bradley pointing a gun into the passenger side of the car where Edward was sitting. When Edward grabbed for the gun, Taylor testified, he got out of the car and ran. He said he heard Edward exclaim words to the effect of \u201cNot me. Not me,\u201d as the car rolled down the street. (Tr. 328-329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">{\u00b6 28} Taylor said he did not see or hear a gun actually fire that night, but he believed that Edward had been killed. (Tr. 352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">{\u00b6 29} Taylor claims that later that same morning he called a friend and said, \u201cI think they just killed [Eddie].\u201d (Tr. 331.) To Taylor\u2019s surprise, this same friend appeared at Taylor\u2019s house with Edward later that morning. The three drove to a house where some Dubose relatives lived on the north side of Youngstown. Appellant was there. Taylor stated that appellant had specks of blood on his t-shirt and that another relative was cleaning appellant\u2019s jacket. (Tr. 334-336.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">{\u00b6 30} Bradley was not there, and Taylor did not hear any discussion as to his whereabouts. Taylor claimed that people at the Dubose residence were teasing him because he ran from Edward\u2019s car the previous night. (Tr. 337, 338, 340.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">{\u00b6 31} The following exchange occurred during Taylor\u2019s direct testimony. It included a statement critical to appellant\u2019s conviction. The statement was made in direct response to a leading question.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cQ They were \u2014 you\u2019re at the house. Were they laughing about how you ran away the way you did?</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>{\u00b6 33} \u201cA Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cQ And did they indicate to you whether or not you were in any danger at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA No they didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ They didn\u2019t say anything to you about it wasn\u2019t you?</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA Yeah, they just said that ain\u2019t\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: Objection, Your Honor, only because we don\u2019t know who\u2019s talking here. This is clearly an out-of-court statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cTHE COURT: Clarify who\u2019s they.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cQ Did Ceyanie say to you it wasn\u2019t you; we wanted that other dude?</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\u201d (Tr. 340.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">{\u00b6 42} The state\u2019s next witness was Bobby Kelly. Kelly was incarcerated at the Mahoning County jail at the time of his testimony. He had been charged with murder, but the charge was reduced to involuntary manslaughter once he agreed to testify. (Tr. 360.) A plea agreement was apparently reached whereby Kelly was to receive seven years in prison on the reduced charge in exchange for his testimony. (Tr. 361-362.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">{\u00b6 43} The record reflects that the courtroom was completely cleared of spectators for Kelly\u2019s testimony. He began his testimony by acknowledging that he talked to detectives only after learning that Edward had already discussed Kelly\u2019s involvement in this matter with the police. Kelly stated that he was angry with Edward for \u201crat[ting]\u201d on him. (Tr. 375.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-15\">{\u00b6 44} Kelly said that during the early morning of November 12, 2001, Edward showed up at Kelly\u2019s home. The two were good friends at the time. Edward showed Kelly blood on the bottom of his car door. The two drove to a carwash, where Edward washed the car. Kelly advised Edward that he should not be driving the car. (Tr. 363, 366, 370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-16\">{\u00b6 45} Detective Sergeant Daryl Martin of the Youngstown Police Department also testified for the state. In investigating Bradley\u2019s death, he spoke with the Sheelers and examined the curb and sidewalk area of Hoffman and Fairview. There were fresh scratch marks on the curb, apparently from the undercarriage of a car. Martin said he received a tip that the Duboses were involved in the murder. Thereafter, he saw a car matching Mr. Sheeler\u2019s description in front of a Dubose family residence. The man driving the Cadillac gave Martin permission to inspect the car. (Tr. 382, 385, 386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>{\u00b6 46} Martin described the interior of the car as clean, and he saw no blood or casings inside. An exterior search revealed fresh scratches on the undercarriage. This search occurred on December 3, 2001. (Tr. 387, 389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 47} Martin stated that a .22-caliber pistol was found on the decedent. It appeared to be fully loaded but not recently fired. A spent .380-caliber shell casing was found at the scene near the body. (Tr. 395-396, 399.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 48} Martin indicated at trial that he had not determined a motive for Bradley\u2019s killing. On cross-examination, however, he said that he spoke with a friend of the victim, Tammy Harris, during his investigation. Harris told Martin that Bradley was known to carry two guns, a .22-caliber and a 9 mm, which was confirmed by another witness. (Tr. 416-417.) Harris also told Martin that on the night of his death, Bradley stated that someone owed him money and that he had both guns on his person. Harris suspected that Bradley was dealing drugs. (Tr. 419.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">{\u00b6 49} On redirect, Martin testified that he heard that Kelly had sold Edward a .380 weapon about a month before Bradley\u2019s death but that Edward planned to sell the gun. (Tr. 430, 433.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">{\u00b6 50} After the state rested, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant presented witnesses to buttress his claim that he was not with the victim on the night of the shooting, but was with his girlfriend, instead. His first witness was Angelique McKinney. She confirmed that she was the mother of appellant\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">{\u00b6 52} McKinney testified that on the night of November 11, 2001, she called appellant and asked him to bring their son medicine. Appellant arrived at her apartment between 9:30 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. and spent the night there. (Tr. 442-443.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">{\u00b6 53} McKinney was awakened the next morning by the Liberty Police knocking on her door. They were looking for appellant. She lied and told them he was not there. Upon learning that the police were at McKinney\u2019s residence, appellant went outside to talk with them. They wanted to talk with him about Edward. The police were evidently called to the complex because Edward had been sitting in the parking lot in a gray Oldsmobile. The police determined that they had an existing warrant for Edward\u2019s arrest, so they took him into custody and towed the car. (Tr. 446.) This arrest was unrelated to the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">{\u00b6 54} McKinney testified that Edward was sitting in her parking lot that morning to drive appellant to work at Valley Foods. (Tr. 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>{\u00b6 55} Officer Jim Smith of the Liberty Police Department confirmed that he arrested Edward Dubose on the morning of November 12, 2001, in the apartment complex parking lot. He stated that at approximately 6:00 a.m., appellant was also there. (Tr. 468-469.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 56} The state presented the rebuttal testimony of Debbie Leonard, the office manager and administrator of personnel records at Valley Foods. Contrary to McKinney\u2019s testimony, she testified that appellant did not work at Valley Foods in 2001. (Tr. 474-476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 57} The evidence in appellant\u2019s case was limited. Following trial, many unanswered questions remain in this case. Because we have no evidence as to who actually shot Bradley, there is no real motive for the killing and we are left with several outstanding theories as to how and why Bradley was shot. While we have testimony that appellant was generally at the scene of the murder, it is also unclear exactly where he was at the scene when the actual killing took place, since the testimony indicated that he had gone into a wooded area to relieve himself. Despite these unanswered questions, sufficient evidence was introduced to support appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 58} In <em>State v. Johnson </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 754 N.E.2d 796, the defendant was convicted of complicity to aggravated murder, among other charges. In <em>Johnson, </em>an innocent bystander was shot and killed as a result of the search for revenge on a rival gang member. On appeal, the conviction was reversed on sufficiency grounds. The Supreme Court, however, held that sufficient evidence to sustain the convictions was apparent in the record even though the record did not contain one clear, definitive act establishing the defendant\u2019s intention to join the plan to kill a rival gang member. The Supreme Court held that Johnson aided and abetted the killing based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the actual death, including the gang\u2019s collective plan to find and kill another intended victim and the facts that the defendant drove around in a three-car caravan for an hour searching for their intended victim, that he was in the car with the shooter who subsequently shot and killed the young girl instead of the intended victim, and that he ultimately went into hiding with the others involved in the plan. Id. at 245-246, 754 N.E.2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b6 59} By contrast, in <em>State v. Ratkovich, </em>7th Dist. No. 02-JE-16, 2003-Ohio-7286, 2003 WL 23167300, we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of complicity to commit theft. The jury found the defendant not guilty of theft but guilty of complicity. The defendant had driven her son to Circuit City and waited for him in the parking lot with the car running. Her son later ran out of the store after stealing two game systems. He testified that his mother did not know of his plan to steal the merchandise. Instead, he jumped in her car after the fact and told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>her to quickly drive him away, which she did, nearly striking the store manager with her car. As she drove, he told her about the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 60} On appeal, we concluded that although Ratkovich\u2019s actions showed terrible judgment, they did not demonstrate that she supported, assisted, encouraged, cooperated with, advised, or incited her son in the commission of the theft. Id. at \u00b6 26. The theft was complete when her son exited the store. Thus, Ratkovich could have been convicted of obstruction of justice, but her complicity to theft was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 61} Turning to the matter before us, Dr. Giles testified that Bradley was murdered by three gunshot wounds to the head. Two of the shots were fired at close range. Wilson Taylor placed appellant at the scene on the night of Bradley\u2019s death. Appellant was part of a group riding around and using drugs. Later that same morning, Taylor saw specks of blood on appellant\u2019s shirt and watched appellant\u2019s cousins clean his jacket. Appellant argues that Taylor\u2019s testimony was fabricated in part because he did not mention seeing specks of blood in any of his prior statements and he did not remember what part of the shirt the blood was on or how large it was. However, when asked, Taylor described the specks of blood as large enough to see. (Tr. 347.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 62} Taylor also confirmed without objection in response to leading questioning that appellant told him, essentially, that he was not the target of the killing, saying, \u201c[W]e wanted that other dude.\u201d Appellant takes issue with the leading nature of this testimony, which was critical to his conviction. However, his counsel did not lodge an objection to this question at trial. Instead, the question was asked following appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s prior objection, and the question was evidently presented in this leading manner to develop Taylor\u2019s testimony. Evid.R. 611(C). Thus, the failure to object to this question and answer waives this argument on appeal. <em>State v. Timperio </em>(1987), 38 Ohio App.3d 156, 158, 528 N.E.2d 594; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">{\u00b6 63} Finally, Bobby Kelly testified that he saw blood on Edward\u2019s car later that same morning. Appellant argues that Kelly initially testified to the contrary and then adjusted his testimony to please the prosecutor. However, a review of his testimony reveals that Kelly did not see the blood on Edward\u2019s car until Edward showed it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">{\u00b6 64} Based on the foregoing, we find that a jury could have concluded that appellant purposely aided and abetted in Bradley\u2019s murder. If believed, there was evidence that appellant had been part of a group including the victim for some time prior to the murder and was at the scene of the killing, that the victim was last seen pointing a gun at Edward, that appellant was seen later that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>morning with blood on his shirt, and that appellant told Kelly something to the effect that \u201cwe wanted that other dude,\u201d i.e., Bradley \u2014 the only other person present. Accordingly, and bearing in mind that cooperation with the underlying crime is part of the definition, we hold that the limited evidence in this case was sufficient to establish appellant\u2019s guilt on the charge of complicity to murder and the attendant firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 65} We also hold that appellant\u2019s convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant takes issue with the credibility of Kelly and Taylor\u2019s testimony based on the fact that they testified in exchange for leniency in their own criminal cases. However, the jury was fully advised of their agreements in their respective criminal cases and still evidently believed the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 66} The jury, however, evidently did not believe appellant\u2019s alibi witness, his girlfriend, McKinney. She admitted in her own testimony that she lied to the Liberty Police about appellant\u2019s whereabouts on the morning following the killing. McKinney was also mistaken or lying when she testified that appellant was to be picked up from her apartment on the morning of November 12, 2001, to go to his job at Valley Foods. He was not employed at Valley Foods at that time. Accordingly, we cannot find that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 67} Therefore, appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error lack merit and are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 68} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is addressed next. It alleges,</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cThe trial court denied defendant-appellant Ceyanie Dubose his right to a public trial, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 10 and \u00a7 16 of the Ohio Constitution, when it closed the courtroom during Bobby Kelly\u2019s testimony. (Tr. at 358.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\"> {\u00b6 70} \u201cThe right to a public trial is a fundamental constitutional guarantee under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. * * * This guarantee is a \u2018cornerstone of our democracy which should not be circumvented unless there are extreme overriding circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 49, quoting <em>State v. Lane </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 112, 119, 14 O.O.3d 342, 397 N.E.2d 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">{\u00b6 71} Further, the denial of the right to a public trial is a structural error, which affects the framework of trial. Thus, any error is prejudicial to the defendant; the harmless-error analysis is inapplicable. <em>Drummond, </em>supra, 111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038. at \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>{\u00b6 72} That said, certain interests essential to the administration of justice still may warrant closure of a courtroom. Although the decision to close a courtroom is within the judge\u2019s discretion, a trial may be closed only when deemed absolutely necessary, \u201cand any closure must be narrowly drawn and applied sparingly.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 73} To determine whether courtroom closure is proper, the Sixth Amendment requires application of a four-part test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Waller v. Georgia </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 39, 49-50, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31. <em>Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, at \u00b6 52-54; <em>State v. Rector, </em>7th Dist. No. 01 AP 758, 2003-Ohio-5438, 2003 WL 22331979. First, \u201c \u2018the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, [second,] the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, [third,] the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and [fourth] it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, at \u00b6 52, quoting <em>Waller </em>at 48, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 74} However, in cases involving only the partial closure of the courtroom, the Supreme Court in <em>Drummond </em>has recently indicated that only a \u201csubstantial reason,\u201d and not an overriding interest, must be present to justify the closure. Id. at \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 75} With this slight adjustment, the Supreme Court in <em>Drummond </em>found that the <em>Waller </em>criteria had been satisfied. There, the Supreme Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s substantial reason or interest in closing the courtroom was based on security issues, since a physical altercation had occurred the previous day and certain witnesses feared gang retaliation should they testify. <em>Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, at \u00b6 54. <em>Drummond </em>also noted a federal case in which concerns for an undercover officer\u2019s safety constituted a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d to close the courtroom. Id. Thus, in <em>Drummond </em>the first <em>Waller </em>prong was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">{\u00b6 76} As to the second prong, <em>Drummond </em>concluded that the closure of the courtroom during the testimony of three state witnesses was no broader than necessary. Of import, however, was the fact that the courtroom was not entirely closed to all spectators. The court found it important that the media was allowed to remain in the courtroom, holding that its presence \u201chelped safeguard [the defendant\u2019s] right to a public trial.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">{\u00b6 77} As to the third prong, the trial court in <em>Drummond </em>did not consider on the record alternatives to closing the courtroom. However, the court held that this could not be seen as error, since the closure was only during three witnesses\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>testimony and was narrower than closing the entire trial. Ill Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-0hio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, at \u00b6 57. Again, we note that the closure was also partial in the sense that not all spectators were removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">{\u00b6 78} Lastly, the Supreme Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s findings that there had been an altercation between spectators and the courtroom deputies in addition to the witnesses\u2019 expressed fears were adequate in light of the limited closure of the court. It noted, though, that \u201cthe trial court should have made additional findings to clarify the reasons for closing the court.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">{\u00b6 79} In <em>Drummond, </em>the trial court judge made the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">{\u00b6 80} \u201c \u2018The Court: It\u2019s come to the attention of the Court that some of the jurors \u2014 or witnesses feel threatened by some of the spectators in the court. The Court\u2019s making the decision that until we get through the next couple of witnesses I\u2019m going to clear the courtroom. That includes the victim\u2019s family, the defendant\u2019s family and all other spectators. The Court had two incidents yesterday involving one of the spectators showed total disrespect to the Court in chambers and gave the deputies a very hard time. I didn\u2019t hold him in contempt of court, but just after that then another individual \u2014 -there was a physical altercation between that individual who also came to watch the trial. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">{\u00b6 81} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cThe Court: Who ultimately got charged with assault on a peace officer. So over the objection of the defendant I\u2019m clearing the courtroom just for today only. * * * \u201d 111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, at \u00b6 32-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">{\u00b6 83} Bearing the above in mind, we now turn to the record in the present case and review the matter applying the <em>Waller </em>factors. Unlike the courtroom in <em>Drummond, </em>the courtroom was completely cleared during one witness\u2019s testimony. Thus, while the entire trial was not closed, and closure was limited to one witness (as opposed to three witnesses, as in <em>Drummond), </em>everyone was removed from the courtroom. It appears from the record that no one was allowed to remain. Hence, the courtroom was completely emptied of all spectators during part of the trial, which would have been abundantly apparent to the jurors. While we stop short of calling this the \u201ccomplete closure\u201d that requires the state to establish an overriding reason to close the courtroom, this matter comes perilously close, based on the facts as presented. Thus, the \u201csubstantial reason\u201d for this closure must be readily apparent and supported in the record. It is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">{\u00b6 84} Immediately following the court\u2019s swearing-in of state\u2019s witness, Bobby Kelly, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cTHE COURT: Have a seat. It\u2019s been brought to the court\u2019s attention that you have some concerns over family members of the defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>{\u00b6 86} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cTHE COURT: Your concerns are what, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cTHE WITNESS: That, you know, just being in the courtroom, maybe just \u2014 any appearance. I don\u2019t feel right when they\u2019re in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cTHE COURT: Are you concerned about harm to yourself or what?</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cTHE WITNESS: My family. Myself and my family.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. That\u2019s sufficient enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">{\u00b6 93} \u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, may we put something on the record? We certainly object.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">{\u00b6 94} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cTHE COURT: I haven\u2019t made even [sic] a ruling yet.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">{\u00b6 96} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">{\u00b6 97} \u201c[Prosecutor:] Your Honor, I would request that the court be cleared of family members of Ceyanie Dubose. We\u2019re not asking the court to clear the press or anybody else and any other interested parties. We\u2019ve already had one witness who did not appear here yesterday as required and who had to be arrested last night as a material witness. This man has expressed fear of that [Dubose] family. I noticed there were probably anywhere from a dozen to 15 or 18 of them, and I think the sole purpose here is intimidation. This witness has expressed fear for himself and has expressed fear for his family. It\u2019s in the court\u2019s discretion to bar certain members or certain individuals and I\u2019m requesting the court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-16\">{\u00b6 98} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b685-17\">{\u00b6 99} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Your objection is noted. It remains discretionary with the court and the court will allow the courtroom to be emptied until such time as this man\u2019s testimony is completed. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b685-18\">{\u00b6 100} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b685-19\">{\u00b6 101} \u201cTHE COURT: Supplementing the request of the prosecutor, the court has observed some staring and glaring of people in attendance both at the defendant and witnesses testifying in support of the reason to clear the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-20\">{\u00b6 102} (Tr. 355-359.) Thereafter, the trial court judge closed the courtroom of \u201call spectators\u201d during Kelly\u2019s testimony only. It was also mentioned by the prosecutor earlier on the record that another state\u2019s witness, Wilson Taylor, might have been fearful and that this might have been the reason that he initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>failed to appear to testify. (Tr. 268.) Taylor testified only after being arrested for his initial failure to appear in this case. However, this was mere speculation, and the courtroom was not closed during his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">{\u00b6 103} As in <em>Drummond, </em>the stated reason for the courtroom closure in this case was a concern for a witness\u2019s safety and possible intimidation. Kelly appears to indicate that he was afraid of the defendant\u2019s family. Thereafter, the prosecutor stressed that appellant had at least 12 to 18 family members in attendance and that Taylor might not have initially appeared based on this same fear. However, as earlier stated, the dialogue as to Taylor is pure speculation, since absolutely no evidence exists on the record to support the claim. Also, the testimony of Kelly, as we can see from the record, is not at all clear on this issue. Kelly said he did not \u201cfeel right\u201d having appellant\u2019s family members in the courtroom. This is a far stretch from a claim that he was intimidated or threatened. In fact, it was the judge who said that Kelly was \u201cconcerned about\u201d possible harm. Kelly never stated this directly. Thus, the record does not reflect a substantial reason for closure based on these vague facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">{\u00b6 104} Second, although the courtroom was closed for Kelly\u2019s testimony only, the state had sought the exclusion only of appellant\u2019s family members. The court responded by excluding all spectators, including the media. Thus, the closure in this case was far broader than necessary to protect any concerns as to Kelly\u2019s safety and was not appropriately limited. Therefore, the second <em>Waller </em>prong was not satisfied here, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">{\u00b6 105} Third, it does not appear as though the trial court considered alternatives to the closing of the courtroom. The trial court could have identified the problem spectators and excluded only them from the courtroom. The trial court could also have allowed the media to stay, as in <em>Drummond. </em>It did not. Thus, the third <em>Waller </em>factor was also not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">{\u00b6 106} Finally, we must assess whether the trial court made findings adequate to support the closure in this case. Again, the court in peremptory fashion noted Kelly\u2019s \u201cconcerns\u201d and responded with a closure of the courtroom. As earlier discussed, there is no explanation of the witness\u2019s claimed fear. In fact, the word \u201cfear\u201d was never uttered by the witness. Instead, Kelly expressed concerns about harm to himself and his family only after prompting by the trial court. The judge then summarily deemed this sufficient with no further questioning about the witness\u2019s actual or alleged fears and closed the court to all spectators. Thus, the fourth <em>Waller </em>factor was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">{\u00b6 107} Based on the foregoing, the record here does not establish that the <em>Waller </em>factors were sufficiently satisfied and that the closure was narrowly drawn to preserve the administration of justice. The closure likely bolstered Kelly\u2019s testimony in the jury\u2019s eyes and could only have shed negative light on appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>and his family. In light of the barely sufficient evidence supporting appellant\u2019s convictions, as earlier discussed, the error was particularly telling. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">{\u00b6 108} Appellant\u2019s fourth and final assignment of error alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">{\u00b6 109} \u201cThe trial court erred when it denied defendant-appellant Ceyanie Dubose\u2019s motion to dismiss based upon speedy trial in violation of the rights guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 10 of the Ohio Constitution. (App. at a-7.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">{\u00b6 110} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that an \u201caccused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\u201d Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides a criminal defendant the right to a speedy public trial by an impartial jury. Appellant claims that he was denied his right to a speedy trial and that the trial court should have dismissed the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">{\u00b6 111} Ohio\u2019s speedy-trial statute must be strictly construed against the state. <em>State v. Singer </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 103, 109, 4 O.O.3d 237, 362 N.E.2d 1216. Further, a defendant establishes a prima facie case for dismissal once the statutory time limit has expired. <em>State v. Butcher </em>(1986), 27 Ohio St.3d 28, 30-31, 27 OBR 445, 500 N.E.2d 1368. At that point, the state has the burden to demonstrate any extension of the time limit. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">{\u00b6 112} R.C. 2945.73(B) codifies a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial and states: \u201cUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">{\u00b6 113} A defendant charged with a felony must be brought to trial within 270 days of his or her arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). However, \u201ceach day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charge shall be counted as three days.\u201d R.C. 2945.71(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">{\u00b6 114} In order to review a speedy-trial case, we must count the number of days that have passed while determining which party is responsible for any delay. <em>State v. DePue </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745. R.C. 2945.72 provides extensions of speedy-trial time for hearings, and subsection (H) specifically extends an accused\u2019s speedy-trial time by \u201c[t]he period of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">{\u00b6 115} It is possible that appellant\u2019s speedy-trial time expired before he was brought to trial. However, he did not file his motion for discharge until after his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>trial counsel specifically waived his speedy-trial rights. Thus, this assigned error lacks merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">{\u00b6 116} Without analyzing each motion filed on the trial court\u2019s docket, we note that appellant\u2019s counsel submitted a limited waiver of appellant\u2019s speedy-trial rights on March 30, 2004. The trial court judge signed and initialed the limited nature of the waiver, which stated, \u201cLimited \u2014 time tolled until next trial date of May 10, [2004].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">{\u00b6 117} On May 6, 2004, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion for continuance of appellant\u2019s May 10 trial date and filed a time waiver, which stated, \u201cDefendant further wishes to waive his right to a speedy trial pursuant to O.R.C. Sec. 2945.71 et. seq. in conjunction with this motion.\u201d This time waiver was not limited in any fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">{\u00b6 118} On May 28, 2004, the same counsel, on appellant\u2019s behalf, filed a motion to dismiss based on a violation of appellant\u2019s speedy-trial rights. Counsel never attempted to withdraw the earlier speedy-trial waiver. The trial court overruled the motion, finding that appellant\u2019s counsel waived his speedy-trial rights as of May 6, 2004, and that this unlimited waiver was valid notwithstanding appellant\u2019s apparent failure to consent to the time waiver himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">{\u00b6 119} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201ca defendant\u2019s right to be brought to trial within the time limits expressed in R.C. 2945.71 may be waived by his counsel for reasons of trial preparation and the defendant is bound by the waiver even though the waiver is executed without his consent.\u201d <em>State v. McBreen </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 315, 320, 8 O.O.3d 302, 376 N.E.2d 593; <em>State v. Taylor, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 27, 2002-Ohio-7017, 781 N.E.2d 72, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">{\u00b6 120} Based on the foregoing, counsel\u2019s waiver of appellant\u2019s rights was valid, and the trial court did not err in overruling his motion for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">{\u00b6 121} Appellant\u2019s jury trial began on July 18, 2005. During appellant\u2019s trial, his newly appointed counsel also sought dismissal on speedy-trial grounds. However, appellant never attempted to withdraw the waiver of speedy-trial time filed before the commencement of his trial. Thus, appellant\u2019s speedy-trial rights were not violated, since his prior counsel had effectively waived those rights before any potential error was brought to the trial court\u2019s attention. R.C. 2945.73(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">{\u00b6 122} Accordingly, this assignment of error lacks merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">{\u00b6 123} In conclusion, we find that appellant\u2019s convictions were supported by sufficient evidence and were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. We also hold that his right to a speedy trial was not violated. However, we have no choice but to find that appellant is entitled to a new trial. The trial court\u2019s decision to close the courtroom during a crucial defense witness\u2019s testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>not established on the record. The court failed to satisfy any of the <em>Waller </em>factors, and therefore we reverse the judgment and remand this matter. On remand, the trial court must require specific evidence or testimony on the record establishing the substantial reason for closure. It must also consider less drastic means than the removal of all spectators from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b689-5\">Donofrio, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b689-6\">Vukovich, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b689-7\">Vukovich, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A0d\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">{\u00b6 124} I dissent from the decision to remand for a new trial. I do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the trial closed to spectators for the testimony of Bobby Kelly. See <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 58 (using abuse-of-discretion standard of review in such a case).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">{\u00b6 125} The right to a public trial is important; however, it is not absolute. Id. at \u00b6 51. At times, it must yield to interests that are essential to justice and to the practicality that a trial court has the discretion to impose certain controls over its courtroom. Id. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s closure decision, we must view all of the facts and circumstances existing in the record of the case. In doing so, I would conclude that the four <em>Waller </em>factors have been sufficiently met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">{\u00b6 126} First, the state possessed and voiced a substantial interest that was likely to be prejudiced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record establishes that Kelly asked a deputy to call the prosecutor out of the courtroom in order to express his fear of testifying. An off-the-record discussion was then held with the court. It can easily be discerned that the witness expressed concerns over appellant\u2019s family members and that he was concerned about harm to himself and to his family. (Tr. 355-356.) When returning to the record, the witness answered affirmatively to the court\u2019s questions on these topics and added that he did not feel right when appellant\u2019s family was in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">{\u00b6 127} Contrary to the implications of the majority opinion, whether the trial court\u2019s questioning was leading is irrelevant. The court was permitted to facilitate its investigation in that manner so as to expeditiously delve into the matters previously disclosed in the off-the-record discussion. In fact, the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>articulating his fear on the record is not even a requirement in these situations, let alone eloquently expressing his fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">(\u00b6 128} The state requested clearing the courtroom of appellant\u2019s family in order to ensure Kelly\u2019s cooperation and to appease his fears of appellant\u2019s family. As background and context, it must be remembered that appellant\u2019s cousin is a murder codefendant with a severed trial and that testimony established that appellant\u2019s other family members sheltered him after the murder and even assisted him in cleaning blood from his clothes after the murder. The state opined that between 12 and 18 family members appeared to be present for the sole purpose of witness intimidation. (Tr. 357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">{\u00b6 129} The state also noted that the prior witness, William Taylor, had to be detained as a material witness due to his similar fear of appellant\u2019s family. (Tr. 356-357.) In fact, the court had been informed earlier in the trial that a material-witness warrant had been filed regarding Taylor, he failed to appear to testify against appellant due to his fear, and he contacted the task force to express that fear. (Tr. 267-268.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">{\u00b6 130} Considering all of these circumstances, the state advanced a substantial interest likely to be prejudiced by allowing appellant\u2019s family to remain in court. That is, the state has a substantial interest in ensuring honest, unfettered testimony from witnesses who should not have to fear a defendant\u2019s free family members who are attempting to intimidate witnesses and their families during the witnesses\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">{\u00b6 131} Here, the court itself had even noticed staring and glaring by the family members at witnesses. (Tr. 358-359.) See <em>United States v. Brazel </em>(C.A.11, 1997), 102 F.3d 1120 (addressing \u201cfixed stares\u201d as an attempt to influence testimony). The Supreme Court has acknowledged that fear of retaliation expressed by a witness and the need to protect witnesses against gang violence are important considerations. <em>Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038 at \u00b6 54. And there is a substantial interest in maintaining courtroom security, order, and decorum. Id. at \u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">{\u00b6 132} As for part two of the test, I conclude that the court\u2019s closure here could be considered no broader than necessary to protect the state\u2019s interests. That is, the courtroom was closed for the testimony of only one witness, Kelly. This witness\u2019s testimony occupies less than 20 pages in the transcript. (Tr. 359-377.) Furthermore, Kelly\u2019s testimony incriminated appellant\u2019s cousin (as Kelly was present while the cousin washed blood from the outside of his car door), but his testimony did not directly incriminate appellant. Cf. id. at \u00b6 282 (where the <em>Drummond </em>dissent lamented that the closure was not as limited as the <em>Drummond </em>majority suggested because key prosecution testimony was presented while the courtroom was closed).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>{\u00b6 133} The majority notes that the court closed the courtroom to all spectators when the state sought exclusion only of appellant\u2019s family. In further support of the courtroom-security consideration, the trial court noted that some spectators had been staring and glaring at appellant as well. Thus, tension appears to have been building on both sides of the courtroom, and the brief exclusion of spectators from more than just appellant\u2019s family can be considered more warranted than in a case without those facts. Additionally, under the totality of the circumstances existing herein, the court could have reasonably feared that the practice of excluding only appellant\u2019s family would have prejudiced the defendant even more in the eyes of the jury than the order excluding everyone. That is, the jury could have drawn prejudicial conclusions from exclusion of <em>only </em>appellant\u2019s family, who had been so prevalent in the courtroom. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s assumption, I do not believe that this closure \u201clikely bolstered Kelly\u2019s testimony in the jury\u2019s eyes and could only have shed negative light on appellant and his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">{\u00b6 134} This ties into the third part of the test: whether the court considered reasonable alternatives. The court heard concerns off the record, held a recorded hearing on the matter, listened to the arguments of the prosecution and the defense, and questioned the witness. Since the state requested that only appellant\u2019s family be excluded and specifically stated that other people and the media could remain, it is clear that the court in fact considered and rejected these alternatives.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">{\u00b6 135} Finally, I conclude that the trial court made findings adequate to support the closure of trial during only the brief testimony of this one witness, whose testimony did not directly incriminate appellant. The trial court questioned the witness on the record, which is not even a requirement under <em>Waller, </em>but which provides further support for the trial court\u2019s decision. The trial court found that the witness expressed a sufficient fear of testifying in front of appellant\u2019s family. (Tr. 356.) It is the trial court\u2019s province to judge this witness\u2019s demeanor, voice inflection, and gestures and to determine the credibility of the witness\u2019s state of fear for himself and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">{\u00b6 136} Moreover, the trial court agreed with the prosecutor\u2019s intimidation arguments and supplemented those averments by revealing its observation of courtroom spectators staring and glaring at the defendant and at the witnesses testifying. (Tr. 358-359.) The trial court also occupied the best position to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>evaluate whether intimidation pervaded the atmosphere of the courtroom as it viewed the spectator\u2019s demeanor and facial expressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 137} Although the trial court could have gone into more detail, I find that the four <em>Waller </em>factors weigh in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s decision to close the courtroom for the testimony of this one witness. See id. at \u00b6 58 (employing a balancing analysis). See also <em>State v. Scott, </em>7th Dist. No. 05MA215, 2007-Ohio-6258, 2007 WL 4166246, \u00b6 28-29 (upholding a closure even where record did not demonstrate that the trial court considered alternatives to closing the courtroom and even where the trial court could have made more detailed findings). Consequently, I dissent from the decision to grant a new trial, and I would affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 138} Lastly, on a different note, I must voice certain other disagreements with the majority opinion. Although prejudice need not be evaluated due to the majority\u2019s finding a violation of the right to a public trial (which would be a structural error), the majority still opines that the evidence against appellant was not overwhelming. On this matter, I dissent from the majority\u2019s statement at \u00b6 107 that the verdict was barely supported by sufficient evidence. Taylor\u2019s testimony combined with the corroborating evidence regarding the vehicle\u2019s damage matching the curb\u2019s damages and added to the neighbors\u2019 observations including the order of events provided more than \u201cbarely\u201d sufficient evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-12\">. Appellant's reply brief concedes the applicability of the substantial interest test here rather than the overriding-interest test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\">. As for the media, their presence or lack thereof seems unclear from the record. However, in the absence of a prosecution's attempt to correct or supplement the record under App.R. 9, I am constrained to presume the media was absent, since the court ordered the courtroom \"emptied\u201d and the court reporter thereafter typed that \"all spectators were excused from the courtroom.\u201d (Tr. 358-359.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
