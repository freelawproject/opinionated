Sweeney, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Angel Torres, appeals the decision of the trial court. Having reviewed the arguments of the parties and the pertinent law, we hereby reverse and remand this case to the lower court for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted on August 26, 2003, on four counts of aggravated murder, with specifications for mass murder and felony murder, four counts of aggravated robbery, and four counts of aggravated burglary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant entered a plea of not guilty, and the matter proceeded to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">{\u00b6 3} Counsel was appointed and later filed a motion to dismiss counts three and four based on defects in the indictment. The trial court denied the motion on December 9, 2004. Trial counsel then filed a writ of prohibition in the court of appeals. Appellant\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings was denied by the trial court. On December 11, 2004, when the trial court attempted to continue with the trial, defense counsel refused to participate in the case. Both counsel were removed by the judge, and new counsel was appointed. On January 10, 2005, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>appeal was dismissed by this court because the denial of the motion was not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">{\u00b6 4} On February 3, 2005, original counsel filed a motion to appear as pro bono counsel, which was granted. Newly appointed counsel withdrew. Counsel noted at the time of appearance that they had already exceeded the cap for their assigned-counsel fees. Counsel then litigated the case pro bono for five weeks and did not file an application for extraordinary fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">{\u00b6 5} A jury trial began on April 4, 2005. Appellant waived a jury for the theft-related counts, 13,14, and 15, and was found guilty on all three theft counts. On May 10, 2005, the jury found appellant guilty of counts one and three, aggravated murder, as charged. The jury also found appellant guilty of count two, aggravated murder, but not guilty of the felony-murder specifications. However, appellant was found guilty of the multiple-killing specification. The jury also found appellant guilty of the lesser included offense of murder in count four. The jury found appellant not guilty of two counts of aggravated robbery, counts six and eight, but guilty of the remaining counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">{\u00b6 6} A penalty-phase hearing was conducted for counts one through three. The jury recommended a sentence of life without parole for the merged counts one through four. The court also sentenced appellant to serve five years for counts five, seven, and nine through 12, all first-degree felonies. A one-year sentence was imposed for the theft offenses. All the nonhomicide sentences are being served concurrently with each other and the homicide offenses. The clerk of court docketed the journal entry on May 16, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">{\u00b6 7} Cleveland police officer Eric Tammisaar found the bodies of Zaida Rosa, appellant\u2019s mother, and her sister-in-law, Angelica Nieves, in Zaida\u2019s home, victims of an apparent homicide. Both women had been stabbed repeatedly. The officer noted the locked doors and the lack of any evidence of a forced entry. The rooms in the house were intact, except Zaida\u2019s room, where the officer observed that the deadbolt lock had been forced open. A box of Zaida\u2019s personal checks was on the floor between the bed and dresser. Otherwise, the remaining items were in place; however, a photograph of Zaida\u2019s husband and appellant\u2019s father was face down on the entertainment center.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">{\u00b6 8} After investigating further and speaking with other family members, the officer learned that appellant\u2019s father had committed suicide after he had been charged with raping his 11-year-old granddaughter and after the accusation from his daughter, Maribel Torres, that he had raped her when she was a child. The officer was told that appellant had resided with his mother until June 4, 2003, and that he had stolen her checks and written fraudulent checks to Wilson Bastita, totaling $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Maribel informed the police that appellant had been calling her asking for money and that she last saw him on August 7, 2003. The last communication with Zaida was initiated by her son on August 10. Her body was found on August 13, 2003. Maribel told the police that appellant was angry with his mother and that he was very violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant was arrested, taken to the police station, and Mirandized. Ultimately, Detective Kovach interviewed him about the murders. He denied the murders and surmised that someone had broken into the house and killed the victims for money. The detective responded that no one would believe that a burglar would break into a house and then lock the doors upon leaving. Appellant than confessed to the detective, and his statement was reduced to writing. However, after the detective typed the statement, appellant refused to sign it until he communicated with his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant then appealed to this court in <em>State v. Torres, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 86530, 2006-Ohio-3696, 2006 WL 2023578 <em>(Torres I), </em>arguing eight assignments of error. This court affirmed the lower court\u2019s conviction and remanded the case to the trial court for sentencing. This case is now on appeal a second time. This appeal involves alleged errors by the trial court in the payment and nonpayment of various expert expenses and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">{\u00b6 12} First assignment of error: \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to authorize payment of expenses incurred by the appellant after authorizing employment of experts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">{\u00b6 13} Second assignment of error: \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by failing to hold a hearing to determine if fees and expenses were reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">{\u00b6 14} Because of the disposition of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, we will address it first. Appellant argues in this assignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to hold a hearing to determine whether the fees and expenses approved by the trial court were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">{\u00b6 15} Abuse of discretion is the standard for reviewing the decision of the trial court in granting, setting, or denying a defendant\u2019s motion for funds to employ an expert witness. <em>State v. Peeples </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 34, 640 N.E.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 2929.024 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>If the court determines that the defendant is indigent and that investigation services, experts, or other services are reasonably necessary for the proper representation of a defendant charged with aggravated murder at trial or at the sentencing hearing, <em>the court shall authorize the defendant\u2019s counsel to obtain the necessary services for the defendant, and shall order that payment of the fees and expenses for the necessary services be made in the same manner that payment for appointed counsel is made </em>pursuant to Chapter 120. of the Revised Code. If the court determines that the necessary services had to be obtained prior to court authorization for payment of the fees and expenses for the necessary services, the court may, after the services have been obtained, authorize the defendant\u2019s counsel to obtain the necessary services and order that payment of the fees and expenses for the necessary services be made as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 17} In the case at bar, the lower court summarily denied over $30,000 in fees to eight professionals. Following the trial, the lower court paid some expenses in full, paid a portion of other expenses, and denied payment of others. For example, the trial court allowed payment in the amount of only $5,000 on a $13,600 fee submitted by mitigation expert Lisa Roth. The trial court also reduced a $13,891.86 bill submitted by James John Karpawich, Ph.D., to $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 18} In another example, Robert C. Bux, M.D., submitted a bill for $4,827.11, and his bill was denied in its entirety, even though the trial judge had previously informed trial counsel that she would make the appointment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the judge made the appointment, she neglected to sign a journal entry appointing Dr. Bux. However, the judge did sign a general docket entry assigning various experts, including Dr. Bux.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 19} When the trial judge denied Dr. Bux\u2019s fees on June 6, 2005, the journal entry simply stated the following: \u201cFees for Robert C. Bux, M.D., in the amount of ($4,827.11) are hereby denied, as defense attorneys filed a notice of appearance pro bono on 2/3/05.\u201d However, the evidence demonstrates that Dr. Bux was engaged in preparation for this trial well in advance of February 3, 2005, and the trial judge had already approved Dr. Bux as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">{\u00b6 20} Also on June 6, 2005, the trial judge denied a witness\u2019s hotel expenses. The June 6 journal entry states the following: \u201cHotel expense for the amount of ($71.05) for a witness for the defense is hereby denied, as attorney[s] filed a notice of appearance of pro bono <em>on February 3, 2005.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">{\u00b6 21} The fact that the defense attorneys in this case filed a pro bono notice of appearance on February 3, 2005, does not, by extension, mean that all trial experts are also required to work pro bono from that day forward. It appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>that the lower court used February 3, 2005, as a separation point for many of the fees submitted, paying experts for services prior to this date and denying payment after this date.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 22} In addition to denying fees to Dr. Bux, the trial judge also reduced interpreter fees. On November 23, 2004, defense counsel filed a motion for the appointment of an interpreter, which was granted by the trial judge on December 1, 2004. In the motion, defense counsel requested that \u201cthe interpreter be paid at the rate of $50.00 per hour, which is less than the normal charges for an interpreter of $100.00 per hour.\u201d Accordingly, the lower court was aware of the interpreter\u2019s hourly rate when it approved it on December 1, 2004. To unilaterally reduce the interpreter\u2019s bill without explanation, as was done in the trial court\u2019s journal entry, is arbitrary and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">{\u00b6 23} In addition to the reduction of interpreter fees, the trial judge also reduced the $13,891.86 bill submitted by Richard J. Ofshe, Ph.D., to $8,000. Moreover, Dennis Murphy, whom the trial judge assigned as the replacement investigator, was paid nothing, because the judge never signed a journal entry appointing him. Appellant\u2019s counsel states that the appointment was made in front of defense counsel and that investigator Murphy is owed $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 24} The law does not look favorably upon uncompensated indigent counsel having to pay, from their own resources, the costs and expense of litigation. In fact, payment of expenses is specifically prohibited by DR 5-103(b), since the client is indigent. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Shane </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 494, 692 N.E.2d 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>State v. Whitfield, </em>167 Ohio App.3d 211, 2006-Ohio-3044, 854 N.E.2d 562, \u00b6 21, the court held that it was an abuse of discretion to limit fees and fail to hold a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">{\u00b6 26} <em>Whitfield </em>stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">As <em>previously mentioned, the trial court did not conduct a hearing to evaluate whether Emmons\u2019s services as billed were reasonable and necessary. </em>More important, the trial court\u2019s rationale for reducing Emmons\u2019s fees by half is not supported in the record. The record is devoid of any hourly rate or cap of $7,500.00 on Emmons\u2019s fees. In its decision reducing Emmons\u2019s fees, the trial court states that \u2018the previously approved amount of seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) is reasonable and appropriate compensation for the professional services provided in this case.\u2019 However, as stated there is no evidence in the record which demonstrates that the parties agreed that Emmons\u2019s fees were to be fixed at $7500.00. That amount cannot be found in the local rule, nor was it journalized at the time Emmons was appointed to Whitfield\u2019s case. Simply put, the record does not support the finding made by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>In light of the foregoing, we hold that the trial court erred when it arbitrarily reduced the amount of compensation Emmons requested from $15,497.67 to $7,500. While the trial court has broad discretion in determining the amount owed to Emmons for his services, <em>it was error for the court to make that determination without a hearing. Thus, this matter is remanded to the trial court for a hearing to be conducted on Emmons\u2019s motion for payment of professional services. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">{\u00b6 27} The reduction of expert fee amounts was arbitrary and unreasonable. The lower court\u2019s decision to limit and deny certain expert expenses and attorney fees without a hearing was improper. Accordingly, we find that the lower court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">{\u00b6 28} The judgment is hereby reversed, and the cause is remanded to the lower court. A full hearing to determine reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the court shall be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">{\u00b6 30} Based on the disposition of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, we find appellant\u2019s first assignment of error to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">{\u00b6 31} It is ordered that appellant recover from appellee costs herein taxed. {\u00b6 32} The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b208-11\">Kilbane and Blackmon, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-15\">. The grand jury also indicted appellant on one count each of theft, forgery, and uttering. However, because these counts arose out of appellant's theft and subsequent forgery of Zaida Rosa\u2019s checks approximately one month prior to the murders, they were severed and tried to the bench after the trial concluded. The trial court found appellant guilty on these remaining counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-10\">. Appellant's brief, 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
