Rocco, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">{\u00b6 1} This case is before the court on a delayed appeal from appellant Christopher Priesand\u2019s convictions on one count of receiving stolen property and six counts of forgery, following a jury trial. Appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his forgery convictions, or alternatively, that his convictions contravened the manifest weight of the evidence. We reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-16\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b724-17\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant and his co-defendant, Karen Rybka,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were charged in a seven-count indictment filed April 3, 2006. They were charged with one count of receiving stolen property, three counts of forgery in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(2), and three counts of forgery in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(3). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>jury found appellant guilty of all charges. The court sentenced him to 11 months of imprisonment on each charge, to be served concurrently with one another but consecutively to the sentence imposed in another case. In addition, the court imposed three years of postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">{\u00b6 3} At trial, the jury heard the testimony of the victim, Thomas O\u2019Connor; Check Smart store manager, Mary Beth Morgan; Money Mart store manager, Kimberly Mulhall; Express Payroll Advance store manager, Jillian McCreight; and Patrolman David Packard and Detective William Lambert of the Brook Park Police Department. O\u2019Connor testified that he had both a personal checking account and a home equity account. He kept the checkbook for his home equity account in the nightstand in his bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">{\u00b6 4} O\u2019Connor recalled having one guest at his home in November 2005, co-defendant Karen Rybka. She was alone in his bedroom for a time while he went to the bathroom. Later that month, he received three notices from the bank that checks written on that account had bounced. He then looked for the checkbook but could not find it, so he notified his bank that it had been stolen. He later saw copies of the checks and observed that he did not know the payee, Christopher Priesand. The checks were not written or signed in his handwriting. He completed affidavits of forgery and prepared a police report. He identified the three checks from his home equity account, each of which was made payable to Christopher R. Priesand, in the amounts of $95, $90, and $100 respectively. He confirmed that none of these checks was prepared in his handwriting or signed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">{\u00b6 5} Ms. Morgan testified that she is the store manager of Check Smart, a check-cashing business located at West 130th and Snow Road in Brook Park. Customers who wish to cash checks at Check Smart must complete a form containing basic information such as their name, address, telephone number, place of employment, and references. A photograph is also taken on the premises and is mandatory. Morgan identified the \u201ccustomer information report\u201d maintained in Check Smart\u2019s computer system for Chris R. Priesand and identified Check Smart\u2019s stamp on O\u2019Connor\u2019s check number 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">{\u00b6 6} Ms. Mulhall testified that she is the store manager at Money Mart, a check-cashing business located at 13895 Brookpark Road in Brook Park. Like Check Smart, Money Mart maintains a computer file on each customer, including identifying information and references. The customer must show identification the first time they come in. Mulhall said she had seen check number 1009 on O\u2019Connor\u2019s account, made payable to Priesand, as part of her employment, and identified a copy of that check. She also identified Money Mart\u2019s customer registration sheet containing information about Priesand, and a copy of Prie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>sand\u2019s signature and a photograph of Priesand maintained in Money Mart\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 7} Ms. McCreight testified that she is the store manager at Express Payroll Advance, a check-cashing business located at 6895 West 130th Street in Parma Heights, Ohio. She testified that each new customer at this business completes an application and must show a driver\u2019s license. She said that Express Payroll Advance attempts to verify the check through the maker by a telephone book listing, and to verify through the bank that funds are available. She identified the form prepared by Priesand, identified the defendant as the person who had completed that form, and identified check number 1014 on O\u2019Connor\u2019s account, made payable to Priesand, as the check Priesand presented for payment at Express Payroll Advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">{\u00b6 8} Patrolman Packard testified that he took a statement from O\u2019Connor regarding fraudulent checks that had been written on his home equity account. Detective Lambert investigated Packard\u2019s report. He obtained copies of the three checks involved from the bank, collected information from the check-cashing businesses about the person who had cashed the check, Priesand, and then met with Priesand in person. He also spoke with O\u2019Connor, and O\u2019Connor identified a photograph of Karen Rybka as the woman who had been at his house. O\u2019Connor signed a sheet designating the photo he recognized. Lambert compared this signature to the signatures on the checks and testified that they did not appear to be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">{\u00b6 9} Detective Lambert testified that he also interviewed Priesand after having given him a <em>Miranda </em>warning. Priesand signed a written waiver of his rights and gave the following written statement to the police, dated December 21, 2005:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">I, Christopher R. Priesand do hereby make the following statement of my own free will and accord concerning bad check which occurred on/at Money Mart, Check Smart and Payday Express on the 22 day of Nov.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">Karen wrote me a check out in O\u2019Connor name to me to cash and I gave her the money. There were four checks she wrote to me. I cashed one a Money Mart on brookpark and one at Check Smart on Snow Rd., one at Payday Express at pearl Road in parma Hts. Also cash a check at Check Smart in Karen Rybka at Snow Rd. I gave her all the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">/s/ Christopher R. Priesand</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">{\u00b6 10} Detective Lambert further stated that through his interview with Priesand, he learned that Priesand was present when Rybka wrote and signed the checks, and Priesand knew that Rybka was not O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>{\u00b6 11} At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, appellant moved for a judgment of acquittal. The court denied the motion. The defense then rested and renewed the motion, which the court again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant contends that the court erred by overruling his motion for acquittal because there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions for forgery. He claims that there was no evidence that he knew the checks were stolen or forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">{If 13} Appellant was charged with three counts of forgery in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(2) and three counts of forgery in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(3), which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">(A) No person, with purpose to defraud, or knowing that the person is facilitating a fraud, shall do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">(2) Forge any writing so that it purports to be genuine when it actually is spurious * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">(3) Utter, or possess with purpose to utter, any writing that the person knows to have been forged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">The terms \u201cforge\u201d and \u201cutter\u201d are defined by R.C. 2913.01 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-12\">(G) \u201cForge\u201d means to fabricate or create, in whole or in part and by any means, any spurious writing, or to make, execute, alter, complete, reproduce, or otherwise purport to authenticate any writing, when the writing in fact is not authenticated by that conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-13\">(H) \u201cUtter\u201d means to issue, publish, transfer, use, put or send into circulation, deliver, or display.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-14\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant told Detective Lambert that he saw Rybka write out the checks to him on O\u2019Connor\u2019s account. Appellant obviously knew that Rybka (a female) was not Thomas O\u2019Connor (a male). Thus, there was evidence that appellant knew that the checks were forged. Appellant then took the checks and presented them for payment at Check Smart, Money Mart, and Express Payroll Advance, thus transferring them. This evidence was sufficient evidence to support guilty verdicts on the charges of forgery in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-15\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant himself did not fabricate the checks, nor was there evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant aided and abetted Rybka in the commission of that offense. Appellant was merely present when Rybka wrote the checks; there is no evidence that he did anything to assist her in doing so. Cf. <em>State v. Jackson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>(Nov. 8, 1995), Medina App. No. 2434-M, 1995 WL 655931 (defendant properly-convicted of aiding and abetting a forgery where there was evidence that he put Superglue on the forgerer\u2019s fingers so that she would not leave fingerprints on the checks). Accordingly, we find insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict on the charges of forgery in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(2). The first assignment of error is therefore sustained in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">{\u00b6 16} In his second assignment of error, appellant complains that his forgery convictions contravened the manifest weight of the evidence. Our ruling on appellant\u2019s first assignment of error renders the second moot to the extent that it challenges appellant\u2019s convictions for forgery in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(2). To the extent that it challenges his convictions for violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(3), we disagree. Regardless of whether appellant endorsed any of the checks, there was ample evidence that he presented them for payment knowing that they had been forged. This is all that is necessary to prove the charge of forgery in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(3). Consequently, we overrule the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">{\u00b6 17} The common pleas court\u2019s judgment is reversed with respect to the three convictions of forgery in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(2). The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b728-8\">Gallagher, P.J., and Calabrese Jr., J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-18\">. The co-defendant\u2019s name appears variously in the record as Karen \u201cRybka\u201d and Karen \"Rypka.\u201d For consistency, we refer to her throughout this opinion as Karen Rybka.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
