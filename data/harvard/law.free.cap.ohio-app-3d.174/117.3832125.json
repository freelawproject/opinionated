Todd, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion for attorney fees. For the following reasons, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">{\u00b6 2} On November 2, 2006, petitioner-appellee, Nancy A. Donaldson, petitioned the trial court for a civil-protection stalking order. In her petition, Donaldson averred that Todd drove by her residence on three occasions, twice stopping and waving at her children. Donaldson also stated that Todd followed her home from a doctor\u2019s appointment and that he damaged her vehicle twice. Based upon these facts, the trial court granted Donaldson an ex parte order of protection and set the matter for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">{\u00b6 3} At Todd\u2019s request, the trial court continued the hearing until January 8, 2007. When Donaldson failed to appear on that date, the trial court issued an order requiring Donaldson to show cause why it should not dismiss her case for lack of prosecution. Donaldson did not respond, so the trial court dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">{\u00b6 4} On February 6, 2007, Todd filed a motion requesting that the trial court award him attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11. In support of this motion, Todd submitted an affidavit in which he disputed all of the facts that Donaldson had asserted in her petition. Specifically, Todd stated that (1) he had never been to Donaldson\u2019s house, (2) he did not know how to drive and did not have access to a vehicle, (3) he saw Donaldson\u2019s children only at the courthouse and never waved at them, (4) he had never vandalized Donaldson\u2019s vehicle, and (5) he was incarcerated in the Franklin County Jail on September 30, 2006, one of the dates on which Donaldson alleged that he had damaged her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">{\u00b6 5} Without holding a hearing, the trial court denied Todd\u2019s motion. In its March 28, 2007 decision and entry, the trial court found that Donaldson had not engaged in the frivolous conduct necessary to justify an award of attorney fees under R.C. 2323.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 6} Todd now appeals from the decision and entry and assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">1. The trial court erred when it overruled defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, for plaintiffs\u2019 [sic] frivolous filing of a petition for civil protection order, without holding a hearing to determine whether there was any merit to plaintiffs petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">2. The trial court erred when it purported to conduct it\u2019s [sic] own research, sua sponte, and arbitrarily took judicial notice of erroneous facts, but failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>take notice of public records submitted by appellant, in its decision and entry overruling defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 7} By his first assignment of error, Todd argues that the trial court erred in not holding a hearing on his motion for attorney fees. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 8} Todd sought attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11. According to R.C. 2323.51(B)(1), a court may award attorney fees to any party to a civil action who is adversely affected by frivolous conduct. \u201cFrivolous conduct\u201d includes making \u201callegations or other factual contentions that [either] have no evidentiary support\u201d or \u201care not warranted by the evidence.\u201d R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(iii) and (iv).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A court may also award attorney fees if a party willfully contravenes the purposes behind Civ.R. 11. That rule requires attorneys or pro se parties to sign all pleadings, motions, or other documents to certify that \u201cthe attorney or party has read the document; that to the best of the attorney\u2019s or party\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay.\u201d Thus, Civ.R. 11 authorizes a trial court to award attorney fees if a pro se party willfully signs a document which the party knows is not supported by good ground. <em>Neubauer v. Ohio Remcon, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-946, 2006-Ohio-1481, 2006 WL 772020, at \u00b6 29; <em>Kane v. Kane, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-933, 2003-Ohio-4021, 2003 WL 21744091, at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 9} Neither R.C. 2323.51 nor Civ.R. 11 require a trial court to conduct a hearing before denying a motion for attorney fees. <em>Capps v. Milhem, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-251, 2003-Ohio-5212, 2003 WL 22233402, at \u00b6 7 (discussing the lack of a hearing requirement under Civ.R. 11); <em>Ohio Dept. of Adm. Sews. v. Robert P. Madison Internatl., Inc. </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 388, 399, 741 N.E.2d 551 (discussing the lack of a hearing requirement under R.C. 2323.51); <em>Woodworth v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(Dec. 7, 1995), Franklin App. No. 95APE02-219, 1995 WL 723664 (discussing the lack of a hearing requirement under both R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11). Rather, a trial court \u201c \u2018must schedule a hearing only on those motions which demonstrate arguable merit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robert P. Madison Internatl., Inc., </em>138 Ohio App.3d at 399, 741 N.E.2d 551, quoting <em>Tosi v. Jones </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 396, 401, 685 N.E.2d 580. See also <em>Capps, </em>at \u00b6 7; <em>Woodworth. </em>If a trial court determines that there is no basis for an award of attorney fees, it may deny the motion without a hearing. Id. See also <em>Cortext Ltd. v. Pride </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>Media Ltd., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-1284, 2003-Ohio-5760, 2003 WL 22434592, at \u00b6 13 (\u201cThe key to this court\u2019s analysis of the hearing requirement pursuant to R.C. 2323.51 is that the trial court may deny an oral hearing only to those motions which \u2018on their face reveal the lack of a triable issue\u2019 \u201d); <em>Victoria\u2019s Garden v. Sheehy </em>(July 27, 1993), Franklin App. No. 93AP-404, 1993 WL 302835 (stating the same rule of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">{\u00b6 10} In the case at bar, Todd\u2019s motion demonstrated arguable merit. Todd testified that he did not commit any of the acts that Donaldson set forth in her petition. In addition to his own denials, Todd presented records related to his imprisonment and home arrest that showed that he was imprisoned in the Franklin County Jail on September 30, 2006, one of the days on which Donaldson contends that he damaged her vehicle. Together, this evidence calls into question whether Donaldson had any evidentiary support or \u201cgood ground\u201d for her petition. Thus, Todd\u2019s motion presented an arguable basis for an award of attorney fees under either R.C. 2323.51 or Civ.R. 11, and the trial court erred in failing to hold a hearing on the motion. Accordingly, we sustain Todd\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 11} Due to our resolution of Todd\u2019s first assignment of error, we must reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this matter to the trial court for a hearing. Accordingly, Todd\u2019s second assignment of error, which attacks the validity of the trial court\u2019s judgment, is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 12} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain Todd\u2019s first assignment of error. This disposition renders moot his second assignment of error. Additionally, we reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, and we remand this cause to that court for further proceedings in accordance with law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-9\">Brown and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\">. In its decision and entry, the trial court stated that it \"is generally loathe to award sanctions in this case * * * absent clear evidence that the petition was merely meant to harass or maliciously injure Respondent.\u201d Although conduct that \u201cserves merely to harass or maliciously injure another party\u201d is \u201cfrivolous conduct,\u201d other types of conduct \u2014 including the conduct described in R.C. 2323.51 (A)(2)(a)(iii) and (iv) \u2014 also constitute \"frivolous conduct.\u201d R.C. 2323.51 (A)(2)(a)(i) through (iv). Thus, we caution the trial court to consider the entirety of R.C. 2323.51(A)(2) when considering whether to grant attorney fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
