Christley, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Mary Ann Chlysta, DDS, appeals from a judgment entry of the Portage County Common Pleas Court under R.C. 119. That court upheld the decision of the Ohio State Dental Board (\u201cthe board\u201d) denying Chlysta\u2019s application for reinstatement of her license to practice dentistry in Ohio. For the reasons indicated herein, we affirm the judgment entry of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 2} The record shows that in 1974, Chlysta underwent extensive surgeries for temporomandibular joint (\u201cTMJ\u201d) problems. Severe complications have caused her chronic pain, for which she has been treated by numerous physicians. Her treatment has included controlled-substance medications. There is no issue of illegal or illicit usage or of bogus symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 3} Chlysta was licensed as a dentist in Ohio and engaged in the active practice of dentistry during the years 1976 through 1998. In 1985, the issue of drug dependency came to the attention of the board, and Chlysta agreed that she was chemically dependent. She further agreed that she would be supervised and drug-screened by Shepard Hill Hospital in order to recover from her chemical dependency. To that end, she entered into a consent agreement and received treatment for chemical dependency between 1985 and 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">{\u00b6 4} In 1997, Chlysta again agreed that she was dependent on narcotics. She was issued a notice regarding her dependency, and in 1998, a board hearing was commenced to adjudicate her fitness to practice dentistry. During the pendency of that hearing, she entered into a Voluntary Retirement Agreement (\u201cVRA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">{\u00b6 5} In lieu of a possible disciplinary decision to revoke her license, she and the board agreed in the VRA that she would surrender her license unless and until she could demonstrate that she was not drug dependent, that she was not using drugs to excess, and that she could practice dentistry according to the standards of her profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">{\u00b6 6} In 2004, Chlysta applied to the board for reinstatement of her license. The board denied her application for reinstatement and notified her of her right to a hearing on the matter. Chlysta requested a hearing, which commenced before a hearing examiner on February 1, 2005. The hearing examiner recommended that her application for reinstatement be denied. The board accepted the recommendation of the hearing examiner on the basis that she did not comply with the VRA nor with the provisions of R.C. 4715.30(A)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>{\u00b6 7} R.C. 4715.30(A)(8) provides that a person who holds a license under Chapter 47 of the Ohio Revised Code, including a dental license, is subject to disciplinary action for \u201c[^natality to practice under accepted standards of the profession because of physical or mental disability, dependence on alcohol or other drugs, or excessive use of alcohol or other drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 8} Notwithstanding the board\u2019s reference to R.C. 4715.30(A)(8), the proceeding before the board in February 2005 was not a disciplinary hearing, inasmuch as no disciplinary charges had been brought against her at that time. Rather, it was an application for reinstatement based upon her alleged compliance with the VRA. Accordingly, our analysis will disregard the board\u2019s statement that the provisions of R.C. 4715.30(A)(8) were relevant to the board\u2019s adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 9} It was agreed by the board and the parties in that hearing, and it follows, that in order to have her license reinstated, the only issue to be adjudicated was whether Chlysta had satisfied the requirements of the 1998 VRA. The hearing examiner stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[T]he Board intends to confine its evidence, arguments and rationale at the hearing to whether [Chlysta] has met the terms of reinstatement of her license contained in paragraph (B) of the Voluntary Retirement Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 11} Paragraph (B) of the VRA recited as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cDr. Chlysta shall ensure that a written report is provided to the Board by a treating practitioner, acceptable to the Board, indicating that Dr. Chlysta is no longer drug dependent and is able to practice dentistry in accordance with the accepted standards of the profession, and/or that Dr. Chlysta is not excessively using drugs and is able to practice dentistry in accordance with the accepted standards of the profession. This evaluation shall be in writing and shall state with particularity the basis for such determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">{\u00b6 13} At that time, Chlysta did not object to the scope of the hearing as defined by the hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">{\u00b6 14} Chlysta subsequently appealed the adverse decision of the board to the Portage County Common Pleas Court. A magistrate reviewed the matter based upon the record of the board, additional evidence in written form, as permitted by the magistrate, and the briefs of the parties. A combined magistrate\u2019s decision and journal entry was issued, in which the magistrate found that \u201cthe Board\u2019s decision is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.\u201d The magistrate\u2019s decision and journal entry stated that she would not be reversing the decision of the board and that the parties could file objections to her decision. Chlysta filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and journal entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>{\u00b6 15} The trial court\u2019s judgment entry overruled the objections of Chlysta, adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision as its own, and affirmed the board\u2019s decision to deny reinstatement of Chlysta\u2019s license to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 16} Chlysta has timely appealed this matter to this court and has raised the following seven assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[1.] The trial court erred in affirming the Dental Board Order, given that the Board failed to define key terms in the VRA and given that the overwhelming evidence at the Board hearing demonstrated that: 1) Dr. Chlysta is neither \u2018drug dependent\u2019 nor \u2018excessively using drugs,\u2019 when reasonable definition [sic] are applied to those terms; and 2) Dr. Chlysta is able to practice dentistry in accordance with accepted standards of the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[2.] The trial court erred in affirming the Board Order, given that the Board disregarded the favorable results of the evaluation directly contemplated by the terms of the VRA to assess Dr. Chlysta\u2019s physical limitations and drug regimen.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[3.] The trial court erred in affirming the Board Order, given that the Board disregarded endorsements by experts of its choosing regarding the favorable results of the evaluation directly contemplated by the VRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[4.] The trial court erred in affirming the Board Order, given that the Board relied upon the duplicative and flawed testimony of its experts instead of honoring the terms of the VRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[5.] The trial court erred in affirming the Board Order, given that it was a violation of Dr. Chlysta\u2019s due process rights for the Board to make findings of fact/conelusions of law that were outside the scope of the hearing (as both outlined in the Notice of Opportunity for Hearing and confirmed in the Hearing Examiner\u2019s pre-hearing decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c[6.] The trial court erred in affirming the Board Order, given that the Board\u2019s failure to grant Dr. Chlysta\u2019s Motion to strike the \u2018State\u2019s Memorandum Regarding Dr. Chlysta\u2019s Objections to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s Report\u2019, filed October 12, 2005, tainted the Hearing Record and allowed the state an unfair advantage in the hearing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">{\u00b623} \u201c[7.] Assuming arguendo that the Board viewed Dr. Chlysta as a recovering drug addict in 1985, 1998 or 2005, the trial court erred in affirming the Board order given that the Board\u2019s Order violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">{\u00b6 24} We accept the board\u2019s argument that the issue of the applicability of the Americans with Disabilities Act has been waived because it was not raised at the board hearing or in the trial court and the express terms of that act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>do not apply to Chlysta\u2019s circumstances. This dispenses with the seventh assignment of error. We therefore conclude that the seventh assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 25} The other six assignments of error challenge the board\u2019s consideration of evidentiary matters presented to the board at the hearing that commenced on February 1, 2005. These assignments of error will be considered together, because they all touch on the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the board\u2019s order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 26} As a general proposition, the procedure for an administrative appeal of a decision of a state agency or board is governed by R.C. 119.12. That statute expressly states that the common pleas court should affirm the board\u2019s ruling if the court\u2019s review of the evidence shows that the decision was \u201csupported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and [was] in accordance with law.\u201d Under the foregoing standard, a common pleas court must engage in a hybrid form of review. That is, while the common pleas court is obligated to weigh the evidence and consider the credibility of the witnesses, it still must show due deference to the board\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d determination. See <em>Selekman v. Bd. of Mahoning Cty. Commrs. </em>(Mar. 5, 1996), 7th Dist. No. 95 C.A. 107, 1996 WL 99816, *1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 27} In turn, an appellate court reviews the decision of the common pleas court for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lomaz v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of State Fire Marshal, </em>11th Dist. Nos. 2004-P-0071 and 2004-P-0072, 2005-Ohio-7052, 2005 WL 3610440, at \u00b6 20. Under this standard of review, we cannot reverse the common pleas court\u2019s decision if it contains a mere error in judgment; instead, a reversal can occur only when the lower court\u2019s ruling was based upon a \u201cperversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency.\u201d <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 28} At this point in our analysis, it will be helpful to frame the questions that were before the board\u2019s hearing examiner for consideration. The questions are two: (1) as of the date of the hearing (February 1, 2005), did Chlysta demonstrate that she was not drug dependent and excessively using drugs and (2) was she able to practice dentistry within the standards of the profession? These questions are based upon the scope of the hearing as defined by the hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 29} The bulk of the February 2005 hearing focused on the phrases \u201cdrug dependent\u201d and \u201cexcessively using drugs.\u201d A lesser portion of the hearing focused on whether she was able to practice dentistry in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">{\u00b6 30} Our review of the record concludes that Chlysta\u2019s strategy at the board hearing was to pierce the veil of paragraph (B) of the VRA, having to do with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>drug dependency and excessive use of drugs. If that could be done, Chlysta apparently felt that there would be an affirmative answer to the second question posed above, that she was able to practice dentistry in 2005. In essence, Chlysta sought to parse the phrases \u201cdrug dependent\u201d and \u201cexcessive use of drugs\u201d at the board hearing in such a way that the board would be moved to distinguish between \u201cphysical dependency\u201d and \u201cchemical dependency.\u201d The strategy presumed that if the board were to agree with Chlysta\u2019s approach to the meaning of those terms, the board would construe the evidence presented to find that she was not \u201cdrug dependent\u201d or \u201cexcessively using drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">{\u00b6 31} Her strategy did not work, because the board found that the word \u201cdependency\u201d was to be given its common, generic meaning. Chlysta argues in this court that the hearing examiner and board incorrectly ruled on this point. We disagree. While the word \u201cdependent\u201d can be modified to reflect a specific kind of dependency, in the VRA the parties chose <em>not </em>to modify it. Unmodified, it has a common and broad-based definition. That alone does not make it ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 32} By her own admission, Chlysta was physically dependent on her drug regimen in the same way that asthmatics, diabetics, and coffee drinkers are physically dependent on their drugs. She argues, however, that testimony and evidence presented in her case-in-chief at the board hearing required the conclusion that she was not chemically dependent and that she could practice dentistry in accordance with the standards of her profession. On the contrary, the board argues, she consumed an \u201cextraordinary and remarkable dose\u201d of drugs on a daily basis and is \u201clikely chemically dependent on her medications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 33} The problem Chlysta had with her strategy to pierce the veil of the VRA was summed up by Dr. Beckwith, a member of the board, who stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cI understand the reasoning why there\u2019s an attempt to slice thinner and thinner and thinner the notion of dependency to modify it with words like chemical, physical, what else, emotional, anything you want. <em>But the word dependency always persists. </em>And so the [report and recommendation of the hearing examiner] says that you are indeed dependent, and we looked at the evidence and agreed that that\u2019s true, <em>that is a true statement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 35} Our review of the record as a whole indicates that if the question of whether Chlysta was able to practice dentistry were considered in isolation, apart from the VRA, there was some evidence that she was able to practice dentistry. This is borne out by the letters from the following experts: Dr. Karaffa (Oct. 17, 2001 letter), Dr. Bowermaster (Oct. 17, 2001 letter), Dr. Hedberg (Nov. 9, 2001 and April 25, 2003 letters), and Dr. Whitney (Sept. 23, 2002 letter); as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>testimony of Dr. Jones, Ms. Judith Evans, and Dr. Chevlen (as well as his letter dated Jan. 10, 2005). Further, the board\u2019s experts (Dr. Pratt and Dr. Parran) presented no evidence that Chlysta suffered from cognitive or motor deficits that would impair her ability to practice dentistry. However, as stated above, in order to arrive at this second question, Chlysta was required to pierce the veil of the 1998 VRA, and this she failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"> {\u00b6 86} As was noted above, in reviewing the evidence presented to a state board, the common pleas court must show due deference to the board\u2019s resolution of any evidentiary conflict. <em>Selekman, </em>1996 WL 99816, *1-2. Such deference is considered necessary because the board is in the best position to observe the demeanor of all witnesses and assess their credibility. See <em>Sutton v. Ohio State Bd. of Pharmacy </em>(Apr. 30, 2002), 11th Dist. Nos. 2001-T-0030, 2001-T-0031, and 2001-T-0032, 2002 WL 819059, *5. Applying this principle to the instant matter, this court concludes that the record of the board proceeding contained sufficient, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s decision to uphold the board\u2019s finding as to whether Chlysta was drug dependent or excessively using drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 37} Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the board\u2019s decision was based upon reliable, probative, and substantive evidence and was in accordance with the law. Accordingly, in light of our limited standard of review, we will not disturb the judgment of the trial court. See <em>Lomaz v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of State Fire Marshal, </em>2005-Ohio-7052, 2005 WL 3610440, at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 38} We conclude that assignments of error one through six are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 39} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-10\">Trapp and Donofrio, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b506-11\">Donofrio, J., of the Seventh Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
