Halatek, under a Business Auto Policy issued by it to Gutter King. The central issues of this case are whether (1) the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>properly considered deposition testimony taken in another case, (2) defendant was an owner of the corporate named insured, and (3) defendant was an insured under the Business Auto Policy issued to the corporate named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 2} In November 2002, defendant, Tracy R. Halatek, rented a car for her brother, Brian Skinner, from Clerac, Inc., d.b.a. Enterprise Rental Car (\u201cEnterprise\u201d). On January 1, 2003, Skinner was driving the car with John R. Giannini as his passenger when he crashed. Skinner was killed and Giannini was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 3} Because Halatek was the one who had rented the car for Skinner, Giannini sued her in Mahoning County Common Pleas Court for the injuries he received in the crash. <em>Giannini v. Halatek, </em>Mahoning C.P. No. 04-CV-2451. During the course of that litigation, Halatek\u2019s deposition was taken on July 14, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">{\u00b6 4} Halatek had been married to Robert Halatek, who owned Gutter King, Inc. Gutter King had a Business Auto Policy (\u201cBAP\u201d) with plaintiff-appellant, Hastings Mutual Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">{\u00b6 5} The Hastings policy provided coverage for \u201call sums an \u2018insured\u2019 legally must pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies, caused by an \u2018accident\u2019 and resulting from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a covered \u2018auto.\u2019 \u201d The declarations indicate that there is $300,000 of liability coverage for \u201cSymbol 1\u201d covered autos. Symbol 1 describes a covered auto as \u201cany\u201d auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cWho is an insured\u201d is defined as \u201c[ajnyone else while using with your permission a covered \u2018auto\u2019 you own, hire or borrow.\u201d The policy defines \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d as the \u201cNamed Insured shown in the Declarations.\u201d The declarations for the policy period May 16, 2002 to May 16, 2003 (the time period covering the accident) lists Gutter King as the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">{\u00b6 7} On March 29, 2005, Hastings filed a declaratory judgment action and an amended complaint on April 20, 2005, which is the subject of the present appeal. Named as defendants were the following: Tracy R. Halatek; John R. Giannini; Stella Skinner, in her capacity as Administrator of the Estate of Brian Skinner, deceased; Erie Insurance Company (\u201cErie\u201d); Progressive Preferred Insurance and Progressive Insurance Company (collectively, \u201cProgressive\u201d); and Clerac, Inc. Hastings sought a declaration that it did not owe Halatek a duty to defend or indemnify her against Giannini\u2019s claims in <em>Giannini v. Halatek, </em>Mahoning C.P. No. 04-CV-2451.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>{\u00b6 8} On December 6, 2005, Hastings filed a motion for summary judgment. Hastings argued that its policy did not cover Oianninfs claims because Halatek was not an employee of its insured, Gutter King. Erie, Progressive, and Giannini each filed cross-motions for summary judgment and opposed Hastings\u2019s motion. Relying on Tracy Halatek\u2019s deposition in <em>Giannini v. Halatek, </em>Mahoning C.P. No. 04-CV-2451, they argued that Tracy Halatek was a co-owner of Gutter King and, therefore, covered under its BAP policy with Hastings.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">{\u00b6 9} Hastings filed a reply memorandum in support of its summary judgment motion and in opposition to Erie, Progressive, and Giannini\u2019s cross-motions for summary judgment, advancing three principal arguments. First, Hastings argued that the trial court could not rely on Tracy Halatek\u2019s deposition because it was not a party to that litigation and was not represented at the deposition. Second, even considering the deposition, Hastings argued that it established that she was not a co-owner at the time of the January 1, 2003 accident. Third, Hastings argued that Skinner was not an employee of Gutter King acting within the course and scope of employment and that coverage was therefore precluded under <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 10} On June 8, 2006, the trial court overruled Hastings\u2019s motion and granted the motions for summary judgment filed by Erie, Progressive, and Giannini. The trial court also made the following findings: (1) Tracy Halatek was \u201cpart owner\u201d of Gutter King at the time of the accident, (2) the car driven by Skinner at the time of the accident was driven with Halatek\u2019s permission, (3) Halatek was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the BAP at the time of the accident, and (4) Halatek\u2019s deposition was correctly considered by the court in its determination of the summary judgment motions. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">PROPRIETY OF HALATEK\u2019S DEPOSITION TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">{\u00b6 11} Hastings raises two assignments of error. Hastings\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred in considering evidence not properly before the court under Civ.R. 56(C).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">{\u00b6 13} Under this assignment of error, Hastings presents one issue for review. It states:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201cWhether the trial court erred as a matter of law in considering as evidence a deposition transcript taken in another case in which the moving party had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">{\u00b6 15} A trial court has discretion when considering which evidence is appropriate under Civ.R. 56 when making a summary judgment determination. See <em>Bell v. Holden Surveying, Inc., </em>7th Dist. No. 01 AP 0766, 2002-Ohio-5018, 2002 WL 31115653, at \u00b6 16. \u201c \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 means unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Cranford v. Cleveland, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 196, 2004-Ohio-4884, 814 N.E.2d 1218, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 16} Tracy Halatek\u2019s July 14, 2005 deposition was taken in <em>Giannini v. Halatek, </em>Mahoning C.P. No. 04-CV-2451. However, it appears that the deposition was inadvertently given the caption for this case (i.e., Hastings\u2019s declaratory judgment <em>action) </em>\u2014 Hastings <em>v. Halatek, </em>Mahoning C.P. No. 05 CV 1134 \u2014 and filed accordingly on March 15, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 17} Hastings argues that it was improper for the trial court to consider the deposition in determining the summary judgment motions mainly because it was not represented at the deposition and given the opportunity to cross-examine Halatek. Hastings cites Civ.R. 32, which deals with the use of depositions in court proceedings. Specifically, it cites Civ.R. 32(A), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cAt the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying, <em>may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 19} Civ.R. 56(C) details permissible summary judgment evidence. Specifically, it states that the trial court can consider \u201cpleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 20} Citing <em>Dillon v. Med. Ctr. Hosp. </em>(1993), 98 Ohio App.3d 510, 648 N.E.2d 1375, Hastings argues that a deposition taken in another case does not fall within the type of evidence permitted by Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Dillon, </em>the plaintiff sued the defendant hospital alleging negligence on the part of its nurses for failing to conduct proper checks of the plaintiff. The trial court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant hospital with regard to the alleged negligence of its nurses. The plaintiff appealed. Apparently, the plaintiff had sued the attending physicians in a separate action in which depositions were taken. Just prior to getting into the factual history of the case, the Fourth District Court of Appeals noted in a footnote that although the trial court had considered the depositions filed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>previous action between the plaintiff and the physicians, the parties did not file those depositions in the action between the plaintiff and the defendant hospital. <em>Dillon, </em>98 Ohio App.3d at 511, 648 N.E.2d 1375, fn. 1. The court also noted that the depositions filed in the previous case did not fall into any of the Civ.R. 56(C) categories. Id. The court observed, however, that the parties had not objected to the fact that the depositions were not filed in the subject case and that such failure to object constituted waiver of any error on appeal. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">{\u00b6 22} Erie, Progressive, and Giannini cite <em>Gerken v. Mir </em>(Nov. 30, 1995), 3d Dist. No. 10-95-7, 1995 WL 723157, in support of their assertion that Halatek\u2019s deposition was properly considered in the summary judgment proceedings below. In <em>Gerken, </em>defendant physician was not a party to the case when an expert opined in a deposition that he was negligent in his treatment of the plaintiff. Following that revelation, defendant physician was added as a party. The trial court refused to consider the deposition in summary judgment proceedings and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant physician based on his uncontroverted affidavit regarding his treatment of the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 23} The Third District Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred in excluding the deposition. While acknowledging Civ.R. 32(A), the court held that \u201cwhen the issue is merely determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the deposition should be allowed for that purpose only, regardless of whether it would later be inadmissible against the party at trial.\u201d Citing <em>Napier v. Brown </em>(1985), 24 Ohio App.3d 12, 14, 24 OBR 33, 492 N.E.2d 847. The court in <em>Napier </em>also reasoned that such \u201ca deposition is at least as good as an affidavit\u201d which is allowed by Civ.R. 56 and, \u201ctherefore, should be employed whenever an affidavit would be permissible.\u201d Id. at 15, 24 OBR 33, 492 N.E.2d 847. The Third District agreed with <em>Napier\u2019s </em>conclusion that \u201csuch a deposition may be considered as an affidavit to determine if a genuine issue of material fact exists for trial so long as the testimony is based upon the deponent\u2019s personal knowledge and the deponent is presently available to testify at trial where the admissibility, credibility, and weight of the testimony will be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 24} Hastings\u2019s reliance on <em>Dillon </em>is misplaced for three reasons. First, <em>Dillon </em>only suggested that a deposition not <em>filed </em>in the appropriate case may be excluded from consideration at summary judgment if objected to. In this case, Halatek\u2019s deposition was filed in the present action on March 15, 2006, albeit inadvertently. Second, the <em>Dillon </em>court offered no case law in support of that proposition. Third, the proposition appeared in a footnote and footnotes are generally regarded only as dicta. See <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., 104 </em>Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, at \u00b6 16; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 391, 399, 618 N.E.2d 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">{\u00b625} The reasoning contained in <em>Gerken </em>and <em>Napier </em>is more persuasive. Here, Halatek\u2019s deposition should be considered just as good as an affidavit, which is permissible under Civ.R. 56(C). A review of Halatek\u2019s deposition reveals that it was based on her personal knowledge. Also, there has been no suggestion that Halatek is not presently available to testify at trial where the admissibility, credibility, and weight of her testimony could be considered. Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when considering Halatek\u2019s deposition for the purpose of summary judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, Hastings\u2019 first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">{\u00b6 27} Hastings\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">{\u00b628} \u201cThe trial court erred in overruling Hastings\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">{\u00b6 29} A declaratory judgment action allows a court of record to declare the rights, status, and other legal relations of the parties. Civ.R. 57 and R.C. 2721.01 et seq. Such an action is an appropriate mechanism for establishing the obligations of an insurer in a controversy between it and its insured as to the fact or extent of liability under a policy. <em>Lessak v. Metro. Cas. Ins. Co. of N.Y. </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 153, 155, 5 O.O.2d 442, 151 N.E.2d 730. When a declaratory judgment action is disposed of by summary judgment, our review of the trial court\u2019s resolution of legal issues is de novo. <em>King v. W. Res. Group </em>(1997), 125 Ohio App.3d 1, 5, 707 N.E.2d 947. Hence, summary judgment is proper when \u201c(1) [n]o genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d <em>Welco Industries, Inc. v. Applied Cos. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 344, 346, 617 N.E.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">\n<em>Halatek\u2019s Status with Gutter King</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">{\u00b6 30} Under this assignment of error, Hastings presents two issues for review. The first issue presented for review states:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cWhether the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that Tracy Halatek was part owner of Gutter King at the time of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Hastings argues that Halatek had no property interest in Gutter King and, therefore, was not covered under its policy with Hastings since the only \u201cnamed insured\u201d on the policy is Gutter King. In support of its assertion that Halatek did not have an interest in Gutter King, Hastings states that Halatek testified that she did not own any stock in the company. Hastings also points out that Halatek never received any compensation for her interest in the business upon her divorce from Robert Halatek. Last, Hastings argues that after the Halateks began having marital problems, Tracy Halatek quit working at Gutter King and stopped receiving paychecks, which was approximately two years prior to their divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 33} Erie, Progressive, and Giannini argue that Tracy Halatek\u2019s deposition establishes that she was a named insured under the policy and was an owner, the vice president, and an employee of Gutter King at the time of the January 1, 2003 accident. Specifically, Erie responds to each of Hastings\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 34} First, Erie argues that whether or not Tracy Halatek had stock certificates for Gutter King is not dispositive of ownership. Erie cites the Official Comment on the definition of shareholder found in R.C. 1701.01(F), which states that \u201ca person can be a subscriber to shares even though his name does not appear on the books of the corporation as such.\u201d 1955 Committee Comment to R.C. 1701.01. Erie also cites <em>Marriott v. Columbus, S. &amp; H.R. Co. </em>(1907), 76 Ohio St. 599, 81 N.E. 1190, and <em>Simmons Hardware Co. v. Stokes, </em>16 OCC 145, 1898 WL 1366, for a similar proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 35} Second, Erie argues that Tracy Halatek did receive compensation for divesting her interest in Gutter King in the final divorce decree. Concerning the disposition of Robert and Tracy Halatek\u2019s marital assets, Erie refers to Tracy Halatek\u2019s testimony where she stated, \u201cHe got the business and I got the house.\u201d Erie posits that this testimony establishes that Robert Halatek surrendered his half-interest in the marital residence for Tracy Halatek\u2019s half-interest in Gutter King.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 36} Third, Erie argues that Tracy Halatek was employed by Gutter King and received compensation from there until the divorce in July 2003. Erie cites the portion of her testimony where she stated that she was still going to work at Gutter King on and off depending on how their relationship was at the time. Erie also refers to her testimony that although she had stopped receiving paychecks, Robert Halatek was keeping those paychecks and paying for the house (even though he was not living there).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">{\u00b6 37} Even after viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of Hastings, the evidence demonstrates that reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion\u2014 that Tracy Halatek had an ownership interest in Gutter King at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Tracy Halatek and her husband started the Gutter King business together in 1984. They were the sole owners and the business was not incorporated until some time thereafter. He was president of the company and she was vice president. Her duties included working around the office (e.g., answering the phone), going with Robert to put together estimates, cleaning gutters with Robert, and taking materials to job sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">(\u00b6 39} In 1998, Robert bought Tracy a Dodge Caravan in Gutter King\u2019s name and placed the vehicle under its insurance. It was the only vehicle and insurance that Tracy had then, including at the time of the accident. She used the vehicle for both Gutter King business and for her personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 40} Hastings\u2019s argument concerning the lack of stock certificates is inconsequential. As indicated, the business was not initially incorporated. There is no evidence to establish whether there were any stock certificates issued after it was incorporated or to whom they may have been issued if they were. Despite the absence of stock certificates, Tracy Halatek\u2019s testimony established that she had a viable interest in Gutter King. She testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ All right. And you received paychecks from Gutter King. You worked there until the time that you discussed previously; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">^42}\u201cA Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ Did you get a paycheck or a payment regardless of how many hours you put in? Was it always the same, or did they do hourly?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA No, I was \u2014 I was part owner. The secretary wasn\u2019t going to sit down and mark down my hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cQ So you were paid because you were an owner, as opposed to the work you did there?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cA Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">{\u00b6 47} It was approximately three to four years prior to their divorce that Robert and Tracy began experiencing marital difficulties. Concerning her involvement with Gutter King at that time, Tracy testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cA I was still going over [to Gutter King] on and off. It\u2019s hard to explain, because, see, he would come home for a couple days, and he\u2019d leave for a couple days. And then he\u2019d make everything seem like it was okay, so I\u2019d go over to the office and help him. Then it would start all up again, so I just left. And that\u2019s when I got a job over at the fairground and started working over there and just stayed away from the business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-15\">{\u00b6 49} Concerning the financial remuneration her ownership interest in Gutter King yielded at that time, she added:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>{\u00b6 50} \u201cA I didn\u2019t get paychecks from him. At the end he kept them. He was making the house payment with them. He was taking my check and his check and paying the house, and he wasn\u2019t living there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 51} Therefore, it appears that Tracy received compensation from Gutter King up until the divorce. Even if she had not received any compensation from Gutter King in the time period leading up to their divorce, that does not mean that she did not still retain an ownership interest in that business.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 52} Robert and Tracy divorced in July 2003, approximately six months after the accident. Tracy received the marital residence and its attendant equity and Robert received the Gutter King business. This further tends to establish that Tracy retained an ownership in Gutter King until the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 53} In sum, even after viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of Hastings, the evidence demonstrates that reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion \u2014 that Tracy Halatek had an ownership interest in Gutter King at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\n<em>Halatek\u2019s Status as an Insured under the Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">{\u00b6 54} Hastings\u2019s second issue presented for review under this assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cWhether the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that Tracy Halatek was an \u2018insured\u2019 at the time of the accident pursuant to Hastings\u2019 policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">{\u00b6 56} The declarations page of the Business Auto Policy in this case lists Gutter King as the named insured. Therefore, Gutter King is the \u201cyou\u201d in the policy. Hastings acknowledges that under <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, the \u201cyou\u201d in a policy where the named insured is a corporation means the employees of that corporation acting within the course and scope of employment. However, Hastings maintains that coverage does not extend to this case because Tracy Halatek was not acting within the course and scope of employment with Gutter King. Hastings points out that she rented the car for her brother and was, by that time, totally removed from her former duties at Gutter King.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">{\u00b6 57} As we indicated under Hastings\u2019s first issue present for review, Tracy Halatek was part-owner of Gutter King at the time of the .accident. Therefore, as the trial court correctly determined, Tracy Halatek was an insured. She rented a car and expressly granted permission to Skinner to drive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">{\u00b6 58} Hastings\u2019s reliance on <em>Galatis </em>is misplaced. <em>Galatis </em>held that \u201c[a]bsent specific language to the contrary, a policy of insurance that names a corporation as an <em>insured for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage </em>covers a loss sustained by an employee of the corporation only if the loss occurs within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>course and scope of employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at paragraph two of the syllabus. Hastings\u2019s policy is distinguishable from the policy before the Supreme Court in <em>Galatis. </em>Unlike the policy language the Supreme Court considered in <em>Galatis, </em>the Hastings policy designation of a corporate \u201cyou\u201d as an insured does not relate to UM/UIM coverage. As the Tenth District observed in <em>Chickey v. Watts, </em>10th Dist. Nos. 04AP-818 and 04AP-1269, 2005-Ohio-4974, 2005 WL 2303745, at \u00b6 57-58:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cRather, it relates to <em>liability </em>coverage arising out of the use of a hired or non-owned auto. Under UM/UIM coverage provisions, insurers generally agree to pay sums the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury the insured sustained in an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of an uninsured or underinsured automobile. The ambiguity in a UM/UIM policy\u2019s designation of the insured solely as a corporation arises from the fact that a corporation cannot occupy or operate an automobile and cannot suffer bodily injury or death. <em>[Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 664, 710 N.E.2d 1116.] No such ambiguity exists in the context of <em>liability </em>coverage. The * * * policy\u2019s liability coverage does not require that the insured suffer bodily injury or death to qualify for coverage. It simply requires that, as a result of situations covered by the policy, the insured become legally obligated to pay damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cAlthough a corporation cannot occupy or operate an automobile or suffer bodily injury or death, a corporation can be held liable for damages. Thus, unlike in the context of UM/UIM coverage, the basis for finding ambiguity in the designation of a corporate \u2018you\u2019 as an insured does not exist in the context of liability coverage. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">{\u00b6 61} Last, we address an argument advanced by defendant-appellee, John R. Giannini, that Tracy Halatek\u2019s status as insured can be established simply by looking within the four corners of the BAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 62} In the BAP, \u201cWho is an insured\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]nyone else while using with your permission a covered \u2018auto\u2019 you own, hire or borrow[.]\u201d The policy defines \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d as the \u201cNamed Insured shown in the Declarations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 63} The declaration for the policy period May 16, 2002 to May 16, 2003 (the time period covering the accident) lists Gutter King, Inc. as the named insured. The declaration also lists an additional \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d coverage called \u201cdrive other car\u201d coverage. This is typically referred to and recognized as a broadened-coverage endorsement. <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 53. It specifically names Robert and Tracy Halatek. \u201cA broadened-coverage endorsement extends a commercial motor vehicle insurance policy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>coverage to a list of specific individuals when those individuals or their spouses use vehicles not otherwise covered under the policy.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">{\u00b6 64} Since Tracy Halatek\u2019s name appears in the declaration, Giannini concludes that this alone qualifies her as a named insured, citing this court\u2019s decision in <em>Am. Mfr. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kurtz, </em>7th Dist. No. 04 MA 53, 2005-Ohio-6452, 2005 WL 3293813. <em>Kurtz </em>involved a BAP that also contained a \u201cdrive other car,\u201d broadened-coverage endorsement which named specific individuals. The appellee in <em>Kurtz </em>attempted to advance a <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>ambiguity argument in order to establish underinsured motorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) coverage for himself under a BAP issued to his employer. This court examined the \u201cdrive other car,\u201d broadened-coverage endorsement similar to the one in this case. We stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cNormally when a policy is alleged to contain a <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>ambiguity, but then names specific individuals within the definition of named insureds, the ambiguity is resolved because the word \u2018you\u2019 may refer to those specific individuals. <em>Treadway v. Jevcak, </em>[158 Ohio App.3d 767, 2004-Ohio-5588, 822 N.E.2d 423], \u00b6 10, In fact, <em>Galatis </em>itself concluded that when specific individuals are listed on a \u2018Drive Other Car Coverage \u2014 Broadened Coverage for Named Individuals\u2019 endorsement, the ambiguity discussed in <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>is removed. <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 53-54. Thus, it does not appear that appellee may rely in any way on the <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>analysis as to the policy at issue in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cAppellee\u2019s argument disregards the fact that the \u2018named insured\u2019 is not simply a corporate entity, but includes seven individuals (Lee Schwebel, Joseph Schwebel, Alyson Winick, Joseph Winick, Barry Solomon, Frances Solomon, and Paul Schwebel; see Drive Other Car Coverage endorsement, CA 99 10, p. 1). Appellee\u2019s argument appears to be solely founded on the premise that the BAP\u2019s definition as to who is insured is ambiguous, when it not only clearly explains the circumstances required for coverage, but specifically names non-corporate entities as insureds. Thus, under no circumstance may we reach the argument that this language is so ambiguous that Appellee can possibly be entitled under any theory to UIM coverage as a matter of law under the principles set forth in <em>Scott-Pontzer.\u201d </em>Id. at \u00b6 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">{\u00b6 67} Giannini\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>Kurtz </em>is misplaced. First, we decline to extend <em>Kurtz </em>to the facts of this case for the same reason we rejected Hastings\u2019s course-and-scope-of-employment argument above. Here, the BAP relates to coverage as it arises out of the underlying liability policy, not uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. Second, in <em>Galatis, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court acknowledged that listing specific individuals in the broadened-coverage endorsement was reflective of the parties\u2019 intent not to extend uninsured motorist coverage to every employee and employee\u2019s family member. However, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>stopped short of holding that including individuals on a broadened-coverage endorsement prevents \u201cyou\u201d from being ambiguous. The court reasoned, \u201c[t]hat ruling would require that paying an additional premium actually reduces the coverage available under the policy. This is neither a just result nor a logical consistency.\u201d <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">{\u00b6 68} Here, the language of Hastings\u2019s liability policy is not ambiguous and does not concern UM/UIM coverage. \u201cYou\u201d (i.e., Tracy Halatek) gave Skinner \u201cpermission\u201d to drive \u201ca covered \u2018auto\u2019 you own, hire or borrow.\u201d Therefore, Hastings must provide coverage under the liability section of its policy for Skinner\u2019s alleged negligent or tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 69} Accordingly, Hastings\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 70} The judgment of the trial court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-8\">Vukovich and Waite, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-11\">. Clerac, Inc. also sued Tracy Halatek in Mahoning County Common Pleas Court for breach of contract based on monies due under the rental car agreement with Enterprise. <em>Clerac, Inc. v. Halatek, </em>Mahoning C.P. No. 04-CV-4480. In its declaratory judgment action, Hastings also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>sought a declaration that it did not owe Halatek a duty to defend or indemnify her in that litigation. However, that litigation was later settled and dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
