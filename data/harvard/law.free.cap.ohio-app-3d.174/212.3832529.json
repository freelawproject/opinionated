Because of the addition of an endorsement entitled \u201cDrive Other Car Coverage \u2014 Broadened Coverage for Named Individuals\u201d to the Hartford policy and because Hans\u2019s mother was listed as a named insured, we are constrained to hold that Hans was an insured under the policy. For this and other reasons, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 3} In June 1997, Hans was a passenger in a car owned by Stephen Hall, when Hall fell asleep while driving and crashed the car. As a result, Hans was permanently injured. At the time of the accident, (1) Hans lived with his mother, Judy Huber; (2) Huber had a personal automobile liability policy with Progressive Insurance Company; (3) Hall, the tortfeasor, also was insured by Progressive; (4) Huber\u2019s employer, LabCorp, had a commercial automobile liability policy with limits of $1,000,000 per accident with Hartford; and (5) Huber had been issued a company car for her business and personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 4} In April 1998, Hans settled with Hall and Progressive for $15,000, Hall\u2019s automobile policy\u2019s limits, and released Hall from further liability for the accident. That same day, Hans also recovered $40,000 in underinsured-motorist and medical-payment coverage from Progressive under his mother\u2019s policy, which exhausted the limits of that coverage. In 1999, the Ohio Supreme Court decided <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Ezawa v. Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. of Am.,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>holding that when a corporation is listed as the named insured in a commercial automobile liability policy, coverage under that policy may extend to the corporation\u2019s employees and the employee\u2019s family members. Thus, in July 2000, Hans requested a copy of the Hartford policy to determine whether he was entitled to uninsured/underinsured-motorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) coverage from Hartford. Ultimately, Hans filed a declaratory-judgment action against Hartford, seeking UIM coverage in October 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Hartford eventually moved for summary judgment. The trial court entered judgment in favor of Hartford, determining that LabCorp was a self-insurer and that its policy with Hartford was not subject to the UIM requirements of former R.C. 3937.18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court affirmed that judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the Ohio Supreme Court reversed our decision after it changed the law regarding the applicability of former R.C. 3937.18 to practical self-insurers, explaining that \u201c[t]he judgment of the court of appeals is reversed on the authority of <em>Gilchrist v. Gonsor, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 599, 2004-Ohio-7103, 821 N.E.2d 154, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with <em>Gilchrist v. Gonsor, Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, or <em>Hopkins v. Dyer, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 461, 2004-Ohio-6769, 820 N.E.2d 329.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 6} On remand, Hartford again moved for summary judgment, arguing that (1) LabCorp had validly rejected Ohio UIM coverage, (2) Hans was not an insured under the policy, (3) Hans was not legally entitled to recover damages from the tortfeasor, and (4) Hans had violated the notice and subrogation-related provisions of the Hartford policy to Hartford\u2019s prejudice. The trial court entered judgment in favor of Hartford, although UIM coverage had arisen by operation of law due to an invalid rejection of that coverage, because Hans was not an insured under the policy, and he was not legally entitled to recover damages from the tortfeasor. (We note that the trial court also determined that because there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Hartford had been prejudiced by Hans\u2019s violation of the notice and subrogation-related provisions of the policy, this was not a proper basis to grant summary judgment.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 7} Hans now contends, in a single assignment of error, that the trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of Hartford. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 8} We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriately granted when there exists no genuine issue of material fact, the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the evidence, when viewed in favor of the nonmoving party, permits only one reasonable conclusion that is adverse to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 9} We begin by agreeing with the trial court\u2019s determination that UIM coverage had arisen by operation of law in this case. Former R.C. 3937.18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>required that UIM coverage be made available under automobile liability insurance policies. If the insured did not expressly reject UIM coverage, the coverage arose by operation of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For there to have been a valid rejection or waiver of UIM coverage, it had to be demonstrated that the insurer had informed the insured of the availability of UIM coverage, set forth the premiums, described the coverage, and expressly stated the coverage limits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, LabCorp attempted to reject UIM coverage; however, the Supplemental Auto Application, which offered the UIM coverage, did not set forth the premiums for the rejected coverage, and, consequently, LabCorp\u2019s rejection was invalid.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> UIM coverage then arose by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">{\u00b6 10} To support his assignment of error, Hans argues that he was an insured for purposes of Hartford\u2019s UIM coverage under an endorsement entitled \u201cDRIVE OTHER CAR COVERAGE \u2014 BROADENED COVERAGE FOR NAMED INDIVIDUALS\u201d (\u201cthe DOC endorsement\u201d) that had been added to the Hartford policy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">{\u00b6 11} The DOC endorsement provided UIM coverage to the named insured. The DOC endorsement listed the named insured as \u201cEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR OTHER EMPLOYEES FURNISHED A COMPANY AUTO.\u201d Here, Hans\u2019s mother was an employee who had been furnished with a company auto. Thus, she was a named insured. Section C of the DOC endorsement stated, \u201cCHANGES IN AUTO MEDICAL PAYMENTS AND UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGES[:] The following is added to WHO IS AN INSURED: An individual named in the Schedule and his or her \u2018family members\u2019 are \u2018insured\u2019 while \u2018occupying\u2019 or while a pedestrian when being struck by any \u2018auto\u2019 you don\u2019t own.\u201d On its face, the DOC endorsement provided that an \u201cinsured\u201d included \u201cfamily members\u201d of the named insured, which, in this case, was Hans\u2019s mother. Section E of the DOC endorsement then defined \u201cfamily members\u201d to include \u201ca person related to the individual named in the Schedule by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of the individual\u2019s household, including a ward or foster child.\u201d Here, it is undisputed that Hans lived with his mother at the time of his accident. Accordingly, he was a \u201cfamily member.\u201d Based on the plain language of the DOC endorsement, which specifically stated that it was providing \u201cbroadened\u201d coverage, we hold that Hans was an insured for purposes of the UIM coverage that had arisen by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>{\u00b6 12} We note that this holding is in line with <em>Miller v. </em>Watkins,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in which this court considered the same DOC endorsement in another multistate policy where UIM coverage had arisen by operation of law. There we determined that if UIM coverage had been effective in Ohio, then the son of the named insured, Miller, would have been an \u201cinsured for purposes of uninsured-motorist benefits.\u201d We then considered whether to look to the terms of the uninsured-motorist coverage contained in that automobile liability policy to determine what terms and conditions applied to the uninsured-motorist coverage that had arisen by operation of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 13} We held the following: \u201c[T]he terms and conditions of the uninsured-motorist coverage in the [automobile liability] policy that were in effect for states in which uninsured-motorist coverage could not be rejected were applicable to the uninsured-motorist coverage that arose by operation of law in Ohio. The parties contracted for uninsured-motorist coverage in certain states. The terms set forth in the [automobile liability] policy were the terms for which the parties to the contract bargained. Clearly, the parties intended the terms and conditions of the uninsured-motorist coverage set forth in the policy to apply in states where [the corporate named insured\u2019s] motorist coverage was effective. We hold that the same terms and conditions arose by operation of law in Ohio pursuant to former R.C. 3937.18.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, because Hartford intended for the DOC endorsement to apply in those states where UIM coverage was effective, the terms and conditions applied to the Ohio UIM coverage that had arisen by operation of law in this case. Therefore, the trial court erred in determining that Hans was not an insured under the Hartford policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 15} As an aside, we are aware that LabCorp had intended to reject UIM coverage for Ohio. Unfortunately, that rejection was invalid. What we are left with is a multistate automobile policy that provided UIM coverage to family members of employees who had been provided with a company car. The Ohio Supreme Court has specifically held that where a policy of insurance designates a corporation as a named insured, insurance coverage extends to a family member of an employee of the corporation, if and only if that employee is also a named insured. And these are the facts here. The DOC endorsement listed Hans\u2019s mother as a named insured. We are bound by this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 16} Hans next argues that the trial court erred in determining that Hans was not \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from Hall, the tortfeasor, and was thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ineligible to receive UIM benefits. The pre-H.B. No. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18(A)(1), applicable here, specifically provided that \u201ca person is legally entitled to recover damages if he is able to prove the elements of his claim that are necessary to recover damages from the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And the Ohio Supreme Court has provided guidance in this area by concluding that when a claimant settles with the tortfeasor for the tortfeasor\u2019s liability-insurance limits, the claimant\u2019s \u201cability to prove the elements of his claim and recover damages from the * * * tortfeasor is not at issue \u2014 he has already received [the policy limits] in settlement with the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 17} Here, Hans settled with Hall and Progressive for Hall\u2019s liability limits. Clearly, Hans was legally entitled to recover damages from Hall and did so. But Hartford urges us to rely on <em>Laibson v. CNA Ins. Cos.,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where we held that an insured was not entitled to pursue an uninsured-motorist claim against his insurer, when the insured had failed to file suit against or settle with the tortfeasor within the applicable statute-of-limitations period. But the facts in this case are distinguishable from <em>Laibson. </em>Hans did not sit on his rights as the insured did in <em>Laibson. </em>Hans settled with the tortfeasor within seven months from the date of the accident, well within the statute-of-limitations period. Further, there was no requirement in the Hartford policy that Hans file a lawsuit against the tortfeasor before he could pursue a claim for UIM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 18} Based on the foregoing, we hold that Hans was legally entitled to recover damages form the tortfeasor and, thus, that he was entitled to pursue an uninsured- or underinsured-motorist claim under the Hartford policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 19} The single assignment of error is sustained. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for further proceedings, including an assessment of whether any breach of the prompt-notice and subrogation-related provisions of the Hartford policy was prejudicial to Hartford.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b251-9\">Painter, P.J., and Hendon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\">.
