Grendell, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Dawn Holin, appeals her conviction and sentence in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, following the entry of a guilty plea to four counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">{\u00b6 2} On June 16, 2006, Holin was indicted on two counts of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, felonies of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2923.32(A)(1), four counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder, felonies of the first degree in violation of R.C.2923.01(A)(1), four counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated arson, felonies of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2923.01(A)(1), and four counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated arson, felonies of the third degree in violation of R.C. 2923.01(A)(1). The indictments arose out of Holin\u2019s involvement in a plot to Mil then North Perry Village Mayor Thomas Williams, North Perry Police Chief Denise Mercsak, North Perry Solicitor and Police Prosecutor Joseph M. Gurley, and Painesville Municipal Court Judge Michael A. Cicconetti, using pipe bombs. See <em>State v. Holin, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-L-170, 2007-Ohio-34, 2007 WL 37794, at \u00b6 2-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">{\u00b6 3} On December 4, 2006, Holin entered a negotiated plea agreement whereby she pleaded guilty to the four counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder. The trial court entered a nolle prosequi on the remaining counts of the indictment. By stipulation pursuant to R.C. 2923.01(F), the parties agreed that the conspiracy convictions would merge and Holin would be sentenced for only one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">{\u00b6 4} At the change-of-plea hearing, the trial judge asked Holin, \u201cAlthough this may be your attorneys\u2019 recommendation for you to plead guilty to these four charges, is this your own decision and voluntary act to do so?\u201d Holin answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>affirmatively. The judge also asked Holin, \u201cAre you completely satisfied with the representation provided by your attorneys Terry Gilbert and Andrea Whitaker?\u201d Holin answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">{\u00b6 5} The prosecutor detailed the evidence demonstrating Holin\u2019s involvement in the plot to kill the North Perry officials and her voluntary statements to law-enforcement officers admitting her awareness of and complicity in the conspiracy to commit the murders. Specifically, the prosecutor stated that the evidence would show that Holin solicited, purchased, and paid for the gunpowder for the pipe bombs, that Holin assisted in acquiring the pipe and end caps, that Holin searched for and eventually located the appropriate wicks to make the bombs, and that Holin obtained the addresses of three of the intended victims. The trial judge then asked Holin whether the state\u2019s recitation of the evidence was true. Holin answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">{\u00b6 6} On December 14, Holin filed a motion pro se for withdrawal of plea. Holin advised the court that she had dismissed Terry Gilbert as counsel and sought to withdraw her plea entered on December 4, 2006. Holin alleged that she had been misled and lied to about her case and that she and attorney Gilbert had had and continued to have \u201cmajor differences and opinions concerning this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">{\u00b6 7} On January 4, 2007, a sentencing hearing was held, at which time Holin\u2019s motion for withdrawal of plea was addressed. Holin explained before the court that a \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d existed between her and trial counsel regarding whether she should enter a plea or take the case to trial. Holin wanted to take the case to trial because she was not guilty. Holin stated that she had entered the plea on December 4, 2006, because she was \u201cpressured\u201d by her attorney to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">{\u00b6 8} Holin then advised the court that she had dismissed her attorneys. The court construed Holin\u2019s statement as a request to dismiss counsel and thereupon denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court sentenced Holin to a ten-year term of imprisonment for each count, the terms to be served concurrently with each other, and ordered Holin to pay costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">{\u00b6 10} This appeal timely follows. Holin raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">{\u00b6 11} (1) \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant by denying her presentence motion to withdraw her plea in violation of her due process rights as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>{\u00b6 12} (2) \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it denied her the right to dismiss her attorneys contrary to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">{\u00b6 13} (3) \u201cThe trial court erred by sentencing the defendant-appellant to the maximum term of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">{\u00b6 14} In the first assignment of error, Holin challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of her presentence motion to withdraw her guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">{\u00b6 15} The general rule in Ohio is that \u201c[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed.\u201d Crim.R. 32.1. \u201cA defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea prior to sentencing. A trial court must conduct a hearing to determine whether there is a reasonable and legitimate basis for the withdrawal of the plea.\u201d <em>State v. Xie </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 584 N.E.2d 715, at paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cThe decision to grant or deny a presentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d Id., at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">{\u00b6 16} This court has often applied the four-factor test set forth in <em>State v. Peterseim </em>(1980), 68 Ohio App.2d 211, 22 O.O.3d 341, 428 N.E.2d 863, to determine whether a trial court has abused its discretion in denying a motion to withdraw a plea. <em>State v. Story, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-A-0085, 2007-Ohio-4959, 2007 WL 2759496, at \u00b6 16; <em>State v. Haney, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-L-253, 2007-Ohio-3712, 2007 WL 2080291, at \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Bailey, </em>2004-P-0086, 2005-Ohio-6900, 2005 WL 3528900, at \u00b6 26. Following <em>Peterseim, </em>a trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to withdraw a plea \u201c(1) where the accused is represented by highly competent counsel, (2) where the accused was afforded a full hearing, pursuant to Crim. R. 11, before he entered the plea, (3) when, after the motion to withdraw is filed, the accused is given a complete and impartial hearing on the motion, and (4) where the record reveals that the court gave full and fair consideration to the plea withdrawal request.\u201d 68 Ohio App.2d 211, 22 O.O.3d 341, 428 N.E.2d 863, at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">{\u00b6 17} Holin\u2019s argument is that \u201cwhere there is a good reason to support the motion to withdraw, the failure to allow the motion must be deemed unreasonable.\u201d As good reasons for the withdrawal of her plea, Holin cites the facts that she filed her motion to withdraw ten days after entering the plea, she was pressured by her attorneys to plead guilty, she has consistently maintained her innocence, she has a complete defense to the charges, and the state would not be prejudiced by the withdrawal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>(\u00b6 18} Although the allegation that a defendant has entered a guilty plea under pressure from their attorneys may be grounds for granting a motion to withdraw a plea, the allegation, without more, does not compel that result. In the present case, the trial court thoroughly questioned Holin regarding the circumstances of the entry of her plea and concluded that her justification for withdrawing her plea was essentially a \u201cchange of heart.\u201d Contrary to Holin\u2019s allegations, her attorneys did not lie to her or mislead her. Rather, Holin conceded that a \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d existed whether to enter a plea or take the case to trial. Holin stated that her attorneys told her that if she did not take the plea, her state trial would probably be postponed until after she was sentenced in federal court and the Lake County judge would probably order her sentence to be served consecutively with her federal sentence. Such advice from one\u2019s trial counsel does not constitute undue influence over a defendant so as to provide justification for withdrawing a valid guilty plea. <em>Story, </em>2007-Ohio-4959, 2007 WL 2759496, at \u00b6 38 (\u201ca change of heart is not sufficient to serve as the basis for a motion to withdraw a plea\u201d), citing <em>Haney, </em>2007-Ohio-3712, 2007 WL 2080291, at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">{\u00b6 19} Furthermore, the trial court noted that a full month passed from the time Holin advised the court that she intended to plead guilty until the change-of-plea hearing. Thus, Holin maintained her intention to plead guilty for a significant amount of time. This period of time allowed Holin to reflect on her decision and demonstrates that the decision to enter a plea was a considered decision, and not the result of sudden impulse or undue pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">{\u00b6 20} Likewise, Holin\u2019s claim of innocence does not provide a reasonable basis for withdrawing the plea. Although she assisted in locating and purchasing the materials necessary to make pipe bombs, such as the powder, the pipes, and the end caps, and obtained the home addresses of some of the intended victims, Holin asserts that she was unaware of Sands\u2019s intentions. This assertion is contradicted by Holin\u2019s confession, in which she admitted that Sands informed her of his intention to make pipe bombs and kill certain public officials. Holin confirmed the validity of this evidence at her change-of-plea hearing. <em>United States v. Barker </em>(C.A.D.C.1975), 514 F.2d 208, 221 (\u201cWere mere assertion of legal innocence always a sufficient condition for withdrawal, withdrawal would effectively be an automatic right\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">{\u00b6 21} On appeal, it was suggested that Holin\u2019s will was overborne because of her borderline IQ of 73 and a history of abusive relationships with men. These arguments, which were not presented to the trial court, do not render the court\u2019s decision an abuse of discretion. Prior to entering her guilty plea, Holin was evaluated to determine her competency to stand trial. The psychologist evaluating Holin administered the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test 2, which yielded an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>IQ composite score of 73. Nevertheless, the psychologist concluded \u201cwith reasonable psychological certainty\u201d that Holin \u201cwas able to discuss her case, legal consequences, and possible outcomes\u201d and that \u201cthere is no reason for her not to have these abilities. That is, <em>she has no identifiable </em>serious mental illness or <em>mental defect.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The psychologist further determined that Holin is capable of assisting in her defense and trusts her attorneys. \u201cShe has discussed legal strategy, and considers what her attorneys advise. She knows that she is the one who decides all decisions in her case, however.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">{\u00b6 22} Finally, under the four <em>Peterseim </em>factors, no basis exists for reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of Holin\u2019s motion to withdraw her plea. It is not contended that the trial court failed to conduct a proper change-of-plea hearing in accordance with Crim.R. 11, that Holin\u2019s trial attorneys were less than competent, that the trial court conducted a hearing on the motion and allowed Holin to raise the arguments she wished to raise, or that the trial court failed to give careful consideration to Holin\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">{\u00b6 23} For the foregoing reasons, Holin\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">{\u00b6 24} Under the second assignment of error, Holin argues that the trial court erred by not allowing her to dismiss her trial attorneys. Although Holin advised the court that she had \u201cfired\u201d her attorneys in her motion for withdrawal plea, Holin\u2019s counsel filed a sentencing memorandum on her behalf on December 22, 2004. The court ordered Holin\u2019s attorneys to continue their representation during the remainder of the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">{\u00b6 25} Whether a trial court errs by refusing to allow a defendant to discharge their counsel or seek substitute counsel has been reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. E.g. <em>State v. McNeill </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 452, 700 N.E.2d 596 (\u201cIt was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to decline to replace appointed counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">{\u00b6 26} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that before a defendant is entitled to discharge appointed counsel, \u201cthe defendant must show \u2018a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship of such magnitude as to jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 286, 292, 525 N.E.2d 792, quoting <em>People v. Robles </em>(1970), 2 Cal.3d 205, 215, 85 Cal.Rptr. 166, 466 P.2d 710. \u201cFactors to consider in deciding whether a trial court erred in denying a defendant\u2019s motion to substitute counsel include \u2018the timeliness of the motion; the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry into the defendant\u2019s complaint; and whether the conflict between the attorney and client was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>fense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 335, 342, 744 N.E.2d 1163, quoting <em>United States v. Jennings </em>(C.A.6 1996), 83 F.3d 145, 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">{\u00b6 27} In the present case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by-denying Holin\u2019s request to dismiss her counsel in the course of a hearing. Holin\u2019s dissatisfaction with counsel stemmed from their \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d regarding the plea bargain, rather than counsels\u2019 presentation of a defense in mitigation for sentencing. There is no evidence that Holin\u2019s relationship with her attorneys had broken down to the point that her right to the effective assistance of counsel was jeopardized. Finally, Gilbert and Whitaker\u2019s \u201cforced\u201d representation of Holin lasted only for a few minutes until the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, at which point Holin was appointed appellant counsel. In these circumstances, no valid reason existed to delay a sentencing hearing already begun solely for the purpose of allowing Holin to retain new counsel or proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">{\u00b6 28} The second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">(\u00b6 29} Under the third assignment of error, Holin argues that the trial court erred in imposing sentence, because it failed to give appropriate consideration to the following mitigating factors: Holin\u2019s genuine remorse, her ignorance of Sands\u2019 intention to cause harm, her low IQ, and the fact that she has been controlled and dominated throughout her life by abusive and/or alcoholic men.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">{\u00b6 30} The overriding purposes of felony sentencing in Ohio \u201care to protect the public from future crime by the offender * * * and to punish the offender.\u201d R.C. 2929.11(A). A sentencing court \u201chas discretion to determine the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing.\u201d R.C. 2929.12(A). \u201cIn exercising that discretion, the court shall consider the factors set forth in divisions (B) and (C) of this section relating to the seriousness of the conduct and the factors provided in divisions (D) and (E) of this section relating to the likelihood of the offender\u2019s recidivism and, in addition, may consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving those purposes and principles of sentencing.\u201d R.C. 2929.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">{\u00b6 31} It is well established that R.C. 2929.12(A) does not require a sentencing court to make specific findings regarding the seriousness and recidivism factors. Ohio\u2019s felony sentencing law requires the trial court only to \u201cconsider\u201d the mitigating circumstances in the exercise of its discretion. <em>State v. Glenn, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-L-022, 2004-Ohio-2917, 2004 WL 1238346, at \u00b6 47 (\u201cA trial court is only required to <em>consider </em>mitigating factors\u201d [emphasis sic]). Thus, the Ohio Supreme Court has characterized the mandate of R.C. 2929.12(A) as a \u201cgeneral judicial guide for every sentencing * * * granting] the sentencing judge discretion \u2018to determine the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>845 N.E.2d 470, at \u00b6 36-37, quoting the statute. \u201cIt is important to note that there is no mandate for judicial fact-finding in the general guidance statutes. The court is merely to \u2018consider\u2019 the statutory factors.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">{\u00b6 32} In the present case, the court stated it was exercising its discretion \u201cto determine the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing\u201d and had \u201cconsidered all relevant factors\u201d including those set forth in R.C. 2929.12. The court noted that although there was one conspiracy, there were four intended victims and they suffered serious psychological harm. Although the progress of the conspiracy may have been directed by Sands, Holin willingly complied with his directions and thus her culpability is the same. The court observed that Holin\u2019s criminal record is more extensive than Sands\u2019s record. Finally, the court dwelt upon the significance of targeting public officials for murder. \u201cIf public officials are targeted for the proper execution of their duties, then the intimidation or retaliation will have a chilling effect on the performance of that duty.\u201d In particular, \u201cjudges have to be free from inappropriate influences of fear, coercion and intimidation * * * and this is critical and fundamental to the existence of an independent judiciary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">{\u00b6 33} The trial judge imposed a ten-year prison sentence for each count, the maximum sentence for a first degree felony. R.C. 2929.14(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">{\u00b6 34} We find no error in the sentence imposed. Contrary to Holin\u2019s position, the trial court is not obligated, in the exercise of its discretion, to give any particular weight or consideration to any sentencing factor. Provided that the sentencing court duly considers the appropriate sentencing factors, it has full discretion to impose a sentence within the statutory range. <em>State v. Anderson, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-L-274, 2007-Ohio-5224, 2007 WL 2822760, at \u00b6 11; <em>Haney, </em>2007-Ohio-3712, 2007 WL 2080291, at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">{\u00b6 35} The third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">{\u00b6 36} Holin\u2019s assignments of error are without merit. The judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, denying Holin\u2019s motions to withdraw her guilty plea and dismiss counsel and imposing sentence, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b43-11\">Trapp, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b43-12\">O\u2019Toole, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b43-13\">Colleen Mary O\u2019Toole, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ax\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">{\u00b6 37} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>{\u00b6 38} With respect to appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, the trial judge in this instance navigated this mentally impaired defendant through a colloquy based upon his understanding of the case law. Appellant may have received a good benefit of the bargain and may not have experienced fraud perpetrated upon her by her attorneys. She may not have \u201clied\u201d to the court. The trial judge was quite able to navigate and lead her to believe that she had no other choice but to plead and led her directly into the necessary admission that she had a change of heart after the fact, which as a lone factor is an inadequate basis for granting a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. <em>State v. Ready, </em>11th Dist. No. 2001-L-150, 2002-Ohio-7138, 2002 WL 31862201, at \u00b6 28. Howevei\", I stress that appellant had an IQ of 73. Being mentally retarded or having a mental illness is not, in itself, enough to support a claim of incompetence. <em>In re J.J., </em>9th Dist. No. 21386, 2004-Ohio-1429, 2004 WL 574135, at \u00b6 31. In fact, in the instant matter, appellant was found to be competent. However, her IQ placed her within the mental-retardation range.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cAn appellate court will review the trial court\u2019s determination of the Crim.R. 32.1 motion for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Desellems </em>(Feb. 12, 1999), 11th Dist. No. 98-L-053, 1999 WL 753996, at 8, citing <em>State v. Blatnik </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 201, 202, 17 OBR 391, 478 N.E.2d 1016. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Desellems, </em>supra, at 8, citing <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 413, 575 N.E.2d 167. Regarding this standard, I recall that the term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d is one of art, essentially connoting judgment exercised by a court that comports neither with reason nor the record. <em>State v. Ferranto </em>(1925), 112 Ohio St. 667, 676-678, 148 N.E. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">{\u00b6 40} The withdrawal of a guilty plea is about withdrawing an admission to the crimes of which one has been accused and reasserting one\u2019s constitutional right to a trial and to make the state prove its burden of proof as to each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. There is a compelling argument that this appellant may not have the requisite intelligence to participate knowingly in a conspiracy. A withdrawal of plea before sentencing is to be freely allowed. <em>Xie, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 527, 584 N.E.2d 715. The pressure she felt to admit the crime and plead guilty, preadmission, not postadmission, may have been due to the fact that she was claiming innocence or that she wanted a trial or wanted to proceed pro se, all of which are legitimate bases to withdraw a plea. These were never inquired into by the trial judge. All of the professionals present knew of her limited intelligence, and although not dispositive in itself, it goes to the issue of a voluntary and knowledgeable plea. From the record it appears as if a trial in this matter may not have been in appellant\u2019s best interest. This, however, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>not our concern, as the court is not her guardian. A request to withdraw a presentence plea seven days after it is taken, with the understanding that appellant\u2019s trial would not occur until after her federal charges were concluded, is not unreasonable, nor would it place any undue burden on the trial court or the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">{\u00b6 41} Based on the record, I believe that appellant was represented by highly competent attorneys, she was afforded a full hearing pursuant to Crim.R. 11, and she was given an opportunity to answer the questions asked by the trial court for the basis of the Crim.R. 32.1 motion. However, this is not relevant to a timely request to withdraw a plea. I do not believe that the trial court gave the necessary consideration to appellant\u2019s motion, due to her low IQ and the fact that she felt she was pressured by her attorneys to plead guilty preplea not postplea. Thus, all of the <em>Peterseim </em>factors were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">{\u00b6 42} In addition, the trial court accepted appellant\u2019s guilty plea on December 7, 2006. On December 14, 2006, appellant filed a pro se motion to withdraw her guilty plea, stating that she felt that her counsel had misrepresented her. Given the circumstances here, a seven-day time span between the entry of the guilty plea and the filing of the motion to withdraw it is not unreasonable. See <em>State v. Arden </em>(May 21, 1993), 4th Dist. No. 543, 1993 WL 183496, (holding that 28 days between the appellant\u2019s plea and his motion to withdraw was not an unreasonable length of time).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">{\u00b6 43} Based on the foregoing, this writer believes that the trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 32.1 motion. I believe that the trial court abused its discretion and I fail to see, given the circumstances in this case, that the majority would ever find in this case a withdrawal of a plea as being an abuse of discretion when the trial court\u2019s denial does not comport with reason or the record. It is clearly an abuse of discretion. Thus, I believe that appellant\u2019s first assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">{\u00b6 44} Regarding appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, this writer concludes that there is sufficient information in the record that does not substantiate a knowing waiver. The trial court erred by failing to dismiss counsel at sentencing; however, that error would be harmless given this dissent\u2019s disposition of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. Thus, I believe, as does the majority, that appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">{\u00b6 45} With respect to her third assignment of error, based on the foregoing disposition of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, I believe it should be rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">{\u00b6 46} Thus, I believe that appellant\u2019s first assignment of error has merit, her second assignment of error is not well taken, and her third assignment of error is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>moot. I believe the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas should be affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause should be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
