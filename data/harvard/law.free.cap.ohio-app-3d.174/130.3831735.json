All three counts carried firearm specifications. The trial court sentenced Johnson to nine years in prison for the aggravated robbery and to three years for each of the robbery convictions. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences for the three counts but merged the firearm specifications into one three-year term of incarceration. The court added one more consecutive year of incarceration for a postrelease-control violation in another case. The court imposed an aggregate sentence of 19 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">{\u00b6 2} The conviction was appealed to this court. On appeal, we rejected the argument that the aggravated-robbery count should have merged with the robbery counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But we agreed that the trial court should have merged the two robbery counts as allied offenses of similar import.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the remainder of the sentence was vacated by this court pursuant to <em>State v. </em>Foster,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">{\u00b6 3} On remand, Johnson asked for the same sentence, minus the three years for the merged robbery charge. The state argued, as it had at the original sentencing hearing, for maximum, consecutive sentences. The state noted that while the trial court could consider only one robbery, the one robbery involved two individuals who were threatened. The state contended that this was a factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>that the trial court could not have considered when it had originally sentenced Johnson, because each robbery involved a single individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 4} After hearing from counsel and giving Johnson the opportunity to speak, the trial court again sentenced Johnson to nine years in prison for the aggravated robbery. The trial court merged the second robbery count with the first and sentenced Johnson to six years in prison for that offense. The trial court again ordered Johnson to serve three years in prison for the gun specifications. He was again ordered to serve all of these sentences consecutively. When combined with the one-year sentence for the postrelease-control violation from the other case, Johnson\u2019s total sentence was again 19 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 5} In two assignments of error, Johnson now argues that the sentence was vindictive and excessive. In a third assignment of error, he again argues that the aggravated robbery and robbery convictions involved allied offenses. For the following reasons, we find no error below.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\"><em>Resentencing Pursuant to </em>Foster <em>that Does Not Result in an Aggregate Sentence Increase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">{\u00b6 6} In his first assignment of error, Johnson argues that the increase of the sentence for robbery from three years to six years was vindictive and violated his right to due process as recognized by <em>North Carolina v. Pearce</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">{\u00b6 7} <em>Pearce </em>held that a presumption of vindictiveness arises when the same court imposes a harsher sentence following a successful appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But trial courts are not precluded from imposing increased sentences on remand.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When doing so, however, they must demonstrate that the increase is not motivated by vindictiveness toward the defendant for exercising his rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">{\u00b6 8} At the resentencing hearing in this case, the trial court addressed the argument that Johnson\u2019s sentence was being increased and that the increase was improper. The trial court explained that \u201c[a]t the time of the original sentencing \u2014 obviously this Court sat through the jury trial on that matter, heard a lot of the facts that were involved in this particular case \u2014 I gave the matter a great deal of thought at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cObviously I was constrained by the felony sentencing guidelines that were in place at the t\u00edme. I felt that the total sentence imposed was appropriate under the circumstances, and I still feel that to this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIn both instances, I\u2019ve given the matter a great deal of thought. I\u2019ve not increased the sentence, as the prosecution had requested. Again, I felt that the 19 years total with the post-release control violation and based on the offenses that he\u2019s committed that this is the appropriate resolution for this case</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">{\u00b6 11} We note that not only had the robbery portion of the original sentence been reversed, but the remainder of the sentence had also been reversed pursuant to <em>Foster. </em>In <em>Foster, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201c[ujnder R.C. 2929.19 as it stands without (B)(2), the defendants are entitled to a new sentencing hearing * * *. Courts shall consider those portions of the sentencing code that are unaffected by today\u2019s decision and impose any sentence within the appropriate felony range. * * *. While the defendants may argue for reductions in their sentences, nothing prevents the state from seeking greater penalties.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">{\u00b6 12} Some courts have read this language to mean that <em>Pearce </em>does not apply to a resentencing conducted pursuant to <em>Foster. </em>As the Third Appellate District has noted, \u201cin view of the <em>Foster </em>and <em>State v. Mathis </em>[109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1] decisions, we are reluctant to endorse the imposition of additional required findings upon the trial courts of the district in re-sentencings under <em>Foster </em>\u2014 particularly where it is either apparent or can be readily presumed that the original sentence was the result of constraint imposed by a sentencing factor which the Supreme Court of Ohio subsequently determined to be void; or where the trial court appears to have re-evaluated the record or considered additional factors at the re-sentencing.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">{\u00b6 13} The Sixth Appellate District has adopted a similar view.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It concluded that \u201cthe <em>Pearce </em>\u2018presumption\u2019 does not apply with equal force with regard to resentencings conducted in accordance with <em>Foster. </em>Review of the propriety of an increased sentence must be done on a case-by-case basis.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The state argues in this case that <em>Pearce </em>does not apply because the total sentence did not increase. In fact, some courts have held that \u201cwhen one or more counts of a multi-count conviction are vacated and remanded, a court does not violate the principles of <em>Pearce </em>as long as the aggregate length of the new sentence does not exceed the total length of the original sentence.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But that line of cases is based on the \u201csentence packaging\u201d doctrine that has subsequently been rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 15} While we cannot agree with the state\u2019s position in this case, we conclude that any presumption of vindictiveness has been rebutted. The trial court indicated that it had been \u201cconstrained by the felony sentencing guidelines that were in place at the time.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Additionally, the state sought an increase in the sentence,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> basing its argument on factors that the trial court could not have considered at the time of the original sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough the trial court did not specifically reference the state\u2019s arguments when it imposed the additional * * * imprisonment, we cannot say, after careful review of the facts of this case, that appellant has demonstrated that the sentence was vindictive in nature * * <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These considerations, coupled with the inescapable fact that Johnson\u2019s total sentence did not increase, are sufficient to establish that the sentence was not motivated by vindictiveness toward Johnson for exercising his rights. For these reasons, we overrule Johnson\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\n<em>The Sentence Was Not an Abuse of Discretion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">{\u00b6 16} In his second assignment of error, Johnson argues that the trial court\u2019s sentence was excessive. Under <em>Foster, </em>\u201c[t]rial courts have full discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range and are no longer required to make findings or give their reasons for imposing maximum, consecutive, or more than the minimum sentences.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In this case, Johnson received less than the maximum sentence for aggravated robbery and robbery. Other than noting that the total sentence exceeded the maximum sentence for the most serious offense, Johnson fails to point out how the sentence in this case was \u201cerroneous and excessive.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion and overrule his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\n<em>Res Judicata</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">{\u00b6 18} In his final assignment of error, Johnson argues that the aggravated-robbery and robbery convictions involved allied offenses of similar import. We rejected this argument in Johnson\u2019s first appeal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because this issue has already been determined, it is res judicata.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">{\u00b6 19} Having overruled Johnson\u2019s three assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-9\">Painter, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-13\">.
