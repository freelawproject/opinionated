Hartman, appeals the judgment of the Van Wert County Municipal Court convicting him of assault. On appeal, Hartman asserts that the trial judge erred by continuing to participate in the case proceedings after disqualifying himself, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and that the trial court erred by failing to sua sponte order a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>competency evaluation of him prior to accepting his plea. Based on the following, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">{\u00b6 2} On January 8, 2007, Van Wert police officers arrested Hartman, and, contemporaneously, the state filed a complaint against him alleging one count of domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.23(A), a misdemeanor of the first degree. The same day, the trial court appointed counsel for Hartman and held an arraignment hearing, where the following statements were made by the trial court judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">THE COURT: Philip Hartman? Mr. Hartman, you are a[t] Thomas Edison <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> full time; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">[HARTMAN]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">THE COURT: All right. * * * [T]he Court has previously disclosed with Mr. Hartman that my stepdaughter lives just down the road from [him]. In order to avoid any appearance of impropriety, I won\u2019t be hearing (trying) this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">Hi * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">THE COURT: * * * Is there a representative here from Thomas Edison here [sic] as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">REPRESENTATIVE OF THOMAS EDISON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">THE COURT: The Court\u2019s going to take a short recess, we will reconvene in about five minutes, to give you an opportunity to exchange some information before I commend [sic] to proceed with scheduling. I will not be hearing this case, but we deem [sic] to work things out in terms of scheduling and procedure regarding bail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-14\">[CITY LAW DIRECTOR]: * * * I do think that there\u2019s to be a scheduled evaluation at St. Rita\u2019s, and I believe Philip Hartman is returning home with his father Kip Hartman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-15\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-16\">THE COURT: * ......And the Court\u2019s also going to require a release to be signed for information to the Court regarding any evaluation or scheduling, so that release needs to be signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-18\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>THE COURT: So the Court can get the reports of your evaluation, all right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">THE COURT: All right. The record is clear that the Court will not be, if this case goes to an actual trial, the Court will not hear it, someone else will actually hear the trial, but in terms of scheduling and keeping this matter under control, it\u2019s still under my direction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Thereafter, Hartman entered a plea of not guilty to the count of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">{\u00b6 3} In February 2007, the trial court conducted a change of plea and sentencing hearing. At the hearing, the state requested permission to amend the domestic-violence count of the complaint to one count of assault in violation of R.C. 2903.13(A), a misdemeanor of the first degree, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to convict Hartman of domestic violence. The trial court accepted the amendment;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thereafter, Hartman entered a plea of no contest to the amended complaint, and the following dialogue ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">THE COURT: You understand a plea of no contest is not an admission of guilt, but it is an admission of the facts; do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">[HARTMAN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">THE COURT: Do you understand you are giving up your right to trial, and your right to trial by jury; do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">[HARTMAN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">THE COURT: Have there been \u2014 Do you understand you are giving up your right to remain silent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">[HARTMAN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-14\">THE COURT: Have there been any promises made to you to cause you to enter a no contest plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-15\">[HARTMAN]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-16\">THE COURT: And have you had an adequate time to talk to your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-17\">[HARTMAN]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-18\">THE COURT: Do you need to talk to your attorney? Would you like to talk to your attorney some more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-19\">[HARTMAN]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-20\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-21\">[HARTMAN]: Yeah, yeah. What\u2019s going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>THE COURT: Okay. [Hartman\u2019s counsel], further representation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">[HARTMAN\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, to please the Court, I have talked in some length with Mr. Hartman. I feel he does understand the charge. We would enter a no contest plea and waive the possession of the amended documents and the reading thereof, and enter a stipulation of the underlying facts and the finding of guilty, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">THE COURT: All right. Based upon the stipulation, therefore, it [sic] finds the defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">* 4: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">THE COURT: Is there any scheduled requirements [sic] regarding his medication or his counseling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">[THE STATE]: [Hartman] is at the Westwood Center. We have [Victim\u2019s Assistance], I\u2019m not sure if she can add any insight to that or not, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">[VICTIM\u2019S ASSISTANCE]: My understanding and [sic] [Hartman] probably could, the only thing he is doing at Westwood right now is seeing [a doctor] once a month to have his medications monitored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">{\u00b6 4} Subsequently, the trial court sentenced Hartman to a 30-day jail term and ordered him to pay a $50 fine. The trial court suspended the jail term and imposed one year of probation on Hartman.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">{\u00b6 5} In March 2007, Hartman filed a motion requesting that the trial court vacate his conviction and sentence because there was no determination of his competency to stand trial pursuant to R.C. 2945.371 or a mental-retardation evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">{\u00b6 6} It is from his February 2007 conviction and sentence that Hartman appeals, presenting the following assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">The trial judge committed error by continuing to participate in the proceedings in this case after disqualifying himself on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">Appellant was denied the right to effective assistance of counsel and he was prejudiced as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. HI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-18\">The trial court committed plain error by failing to sua sponte order a competency evaluation of appellant prior to accepting the no-contest plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Due to the nature of Hartman\u2019s assignments of error, we elect to address his second and third assignments of error in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">{\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, Hartman argues that the trial court judge committed error by continuing to participate in the proceedings in the case after disqualifying himself on the record. Specifically, Hartman contends that the judge stated three times that he would not be hearing the case, that by these statements the judge disqualified himself on the record, that there was no remittal of the disqualification on the record, and that, consequently, the judge erred by being involved in the pretrial negotiations, taking Hartman\u2019s no-contest plea, and sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">{\u00b6 9} Canon 3(E) of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires that a judge \u201c[disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Additionally, it is axiomatic that a court speaks only through its journal entries, and not through mere oral pronouncements. <em>State ex. rel. Indus. Comm. v. Day </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 477, 17 O.O. 86, 26 N.E.2d 1014, paragraph one of the syllabus. See also <em>State v. Hatfield, </em>2d Dist. No. 2006 CA 16, 2006-Ohio-7090, 2006 WL 3849074.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">{\u00b6 10} Here, the judge disclosed at the commencement of the arraignment hearing that his stepdaughter lived near Hartman. Additionally, he made three statements regarding his participation in the case: \u201cIn order to avoid any appearance of impropriety, I won\u2019t be trying this case;\u201d \u201cI will not be hearing this case, but we deem [sic] to work things out in terms of scheduling and procedure regarding bail;\u201d and, \u201c[t]he record is clear that the Court will not be, if this case goes to an actual trial, the Court will not hear it, someone else will actually hear the trial, but in terms of scheduling and keeping this matter under control, it\u2019s still under my direction.\u201d It is clear from the judge\u2019s statements that he was disclosing a possible appearance of impropriety; however, he never formally disqualified himself from the proceedings by journal entry, nor did Hartman\u2019s counsel move to disqualify the judge. Therefore, Hartman\u2019s contention that the judge disqualified himself is not well taken. Further, the record does not disclose any facts that would lead this court to believe that recusal was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">{\u00b6 11} Accordingly, we overrule Hartman\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">{\u00b6 12} In his third assignment of error, Hartman argues that the trial court committed plain error by not ordering a competency evaluation of him prior to accepting his no-contest plea. Specifically, Hartman contends that the trial court had a duty to sua sponte order a competency evaluation because it was disclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>on the record that he was a full-time charge of Thomas Edison, because it was clear that another person completed the forms in the record on his behalf, because Hartman\u2019s signature on all documents in the record was printed and childlike, and because the court had prior knowledge of Hartman, leading him to disclose the conflict on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c \u2018Fundamental principles of due process require that a criminal defendant who is legally incompetent shall not be subjected to trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 323, 329, 731 N.E.2d 645, quoting <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 359, 650 N.E.2d 433. In determining whether a criminal defendant is incompetent, the United States Supreme Court has stated that the \u201ctest must be whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Dusky v. United States </em>(1960), 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824. Additionally, \u201c[t]he right to a hearing on the issue of competency rises to the level of a constitutional guarantee where the record contains \u2018sufficient indicia of incompetence,\u2019 such that an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competency is necessary to ensure the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 359, 650 N.E.2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 14} A defendant is presumed competent for trial purposes. R.C. 2945.37(G). Additionally, R.C. 2945.37(F) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">The court shall not find a defendant incompetent to stand trial solely because the defendant is receiving or has received treatment as a voluntary or involuntary mentally ill patient under Chapter 5122. or a voluntary or involuntary mentally retarded resident under Chapter 5123. of the Revised Code or because the defendant is receiving or has received psychotropic drugs or other medication, even if the defendant might become incompetent to stand trial without the drugs or medication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2945.37(B), governing competency hearings, requires a hearing to be held if requested by counsel prior to trial. However, once trial has commenced, the trial court has discretion whether to hold such a hearing and must only do so sua sponte for good cause shown or on the court\u2019s own motion. <em>Smith, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 329, 731 N.E.2d 645; R.C. 2945.37(B); <em>State v. Rahman </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 156, 23 OBR 315, 492 N.E.2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">{\u00b6 16} In determining whether sua sponte granting of a hearing is merited, the following factors should be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">(1) doubts expressed by counsel as to the defendant\u2019s competence, (2) evidence of irrational behavior, (3) the defendant\u2019s demeanor at trial, and (4) prior medical opinion relating to competence to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>State v. Rubenstein </em>(1987), 40 Ohio App.3d 57, 60-61, 531 N.E.2d 732, citing <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">{\u00b6 17} Here, it was disclosed on the record that Hartman was a full-time charge of a facility for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities, that a representative of the facility was present at Hartman\u2019s arraignment, that an evaluation of Hartman had been scheduled at a hospital,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Hartman stated \u201cwhat\u2019s going on\u201d during the Crim.R. 11 colloquy, and that Hartman stated that he had not had adequate time to speak to his attorney and requested additional time, which he did not receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 18} Although any of these individual factors alone may not constitute significant indicia of incompetence warranting a competency hearing, when combined, we find that there were sufficient indicia of Hartman\u2019s incompetence that the trial court should have sua sponte ordered a competency evaluation. Significantly, Hartman\u2019s statements that he wanted more time to speak to his attorney and inquiry as to \u201cwhat\u2019s going on\u201d indicate that he did not understand the proceedings and was not able to reasonably consult with his attorney. His full-time status at a facility for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities, and the discussion on the record of his scheduled evaluation and medication monitoring, further indicate that an inquiry should have been made into his competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 19} Accordingly, we sustain Hartman\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">{\u00b6 20} In his second assignment of error, Hartman asserts that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and was prejudiced as a result. Our disposition of Hartman\u2019s third assignment of error renders his second assignment of error moot, and we decline to address it. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">{\u00b6 21} Having found error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued in his third assignment of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-12\">Preston and Willamowski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-19\">. Thomas Edison is a center for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-20\">. We note that the January 2007 hearing transcript states that the judge \"won't be hearing this case,\u201d however, the judge filed a certificate in April 2007 stating that the transcript was not true and was incomplete. Additionally, the judge amended the transcript by crossing out the word \"hearing,\u201d handwriting the word \"trying\u201d above it, and initialing the change.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-22\">. We note that the original complaint reading, \"This is in violation of section 2919.25(A) of the Ohio Revised Code being Domestic Violence, a misdemeanor of the first degree\u201d was amended to strike through the section number \"2919.25(A)\u201d and insert the section number \"2903.13(A);\u201d however, the phrase \"Domestic Violence\u201d was not crossed out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-13\">.
