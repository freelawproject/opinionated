The Roarks and Jones (\u201cthe homeowners\u201d), claiming to have been the victims of an elaborate \u201cproperty flipping\u201d scheme, filed third-party actions against several individuals and companies, including Ashore Funding, Inc., Clifford Rydell, Airline Union\u2019s Mortgage Company (\u201cAUM\u201d), and Airline Union\u2019s Mortgage Co., Ltd. (\u201cAUMLTD\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 2} Ashore and Rydell now appeal the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of the homeowners, and the homeowners have cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\n<em>Rydell and Ashore</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">{\u00b6 3} Clifford Rydell was the sole owner and president of Ashore, a mortgage lender that sold its loans on a secondary market. Rydell was also the sole owner of AUM, a licensed second-mortgage lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">{\u00b6 4} Rydell had acquired AUM in 1995. At that time, Rydell testified, the value of a second-mortgage license was that its holder was exempt from Ohio\u2019s requirement for a separate mortgage-broker\u2019s license. In other words, the holder of a second-mortgage license could broker original loans without a broker\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">{\u00b6 5} Between 1995 and 2001, AUM originated second mortgages and brokered first mortgages. During that period, AUM earned far more from its brokered mortgages than from its second-mortgage accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">{\u00b6 6} In August 2001, Rydell met Jay Sullivan and Troy Clements. Sullivan told Rydell that Clements was \u201ca big investor that he was starting to get some business from\u201d and that Clements was going to lend him some money to acquire office space.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">{\u00b6 7} After Rydell had hired Sullivan as a loan officer for AUM, Sullivan \u201cbrought in a lot of business.\u201d Between August and December 2001, Sullivan brokered 415 loans, which generated $1.6 million in fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">{\u00b6 8} On August 29, 2001, Rydell and Sullivan entered into an agreement that would become effective on January 1, 2002. Under the agreement, Rydell established an AUM branch office on Kemper Road in Cincinnati and named Sullivan as the operations manager of the new office. Sullivan agreed to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Rydell $8,000 per month to operate the office. The agreement purported to give Sullivan the right to any profits derived from AUM transactions, as well as the authority \u201cto obligate [AUM] in any way he [deemed] it necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 9} According to Rydell, Sullivan lacked the requisite experience to be eligible for a mortgage broker\u2019s license. Instead, Sullivan operated under AUM\u2019s second-mortgage license, which allowed him to take advantage of the then existing broker exemption. Sullivan needed AUM\u2019s second-mortgage license to broker loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">{\u00b6 10} Shortly after Rydell and Sullivan had entered into the agreement, they learned that Ohio was going to revise its Mortgage Broker Act to remove the broker exemption for second-mortgage license holders. The change, effective in May 2002, required that mortgage brokers obtain a separate mortgage broker\u2019s license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So Sullivan needed his own license to continue to broker mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 11} Sullivan still wanted to use the Airline Union\u2019s Mortgage name, so in January 2002, Rydell and Sullivan incorporated a new entity, AUMLTD. Rydell formally consented to AUMLTD\u2019s use of a business name similar to AUM\u2019s. In that way, Sullivan could use his newly acquired mortgage broker\u2019s license and continue to operate under the Airline Union\u2019s Mortgage name. Rydell testified that he had expected AUMLTD to funnel business to Ashore.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">{\u00b6 12} Rydell acted as AUMLTD\u2019s statutory agent. Rydell named his son, Benjamin, as a partner and 95 percent owner of AUMLTD. Sullivan was listed as its president and as a 5 percent owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">{\u00b6 13} Rydell\u2019s son never worked at the AUMLTD office. AUMLTD operated from AUM\u2019s Kemper Road office.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">{\u00b6 14} Rydell met with Sullivan and Clements at the Kemper Road office several times during 2002 and 2003. After one such meeting in the summer of 2002, the AUM loan officers were instructed to steer their business to Ashore.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">{\u00b6 15} AUMLTD began referring loans to Ashore in September 2002. From that time until August 2003, AUMLTD referred 122 loans to Ashore, most of which involved Clements as the seller of the property. The AUMLTD loans were worth $17,367,920, which represented about 20 percent of Ashore\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">{\u00b6 16} In July 2003, Rydell learned that approximately ten AUMLTD loan applications to Ashore had been submitted with fraudulently inflated appraisals, but he took no steps to notify authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">{\u00b6 17} In the summer of 2003, the Kemper Road office was raided by the FBI. In an ensuing federal prosecution, Clements pleaded guilty to conspiracy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>commit fraud and to money laundering. Clements admitted that he and the AUM loan officers had created false documents to support loan applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>Troy\u2019s Deals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 18} Gary Swain worked as a loan officer for AUM from January 2000 until 2003. According to Swain, Sullivan and Clements had hired him and were his supervisors. Swain did not know that AUM and AUMLTD were separate entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">{\u00b6 19} Sullivan and Clements instructed Swain and the other loan officers to use a procedure known as \u201cTroy\u2019s Deals.\u201d In such a deal, Swain would advertise a house for rent. When a customer responded, Swain would obtain the customer\u2019s credit report. Then a realtor working with AUM would try to find a house for the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">{\u00b6 20} Once the customer had selected a house, Clements would purchase it. Sullivan or Clements would tell Swain a value that the home should be appraised for so that there would be an 80 percent loan-to-value ratio when AUM processed a refinanced loan on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">{\u00b6 21} Swain would have the home appraised and would suggest the inflated value to the appraiser, which the appraiser would adopt. The home would be appraised for the inflated value.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">{\u00b6 22} The customer would execute a mortgage to Clements for an amount that was $5,000 more than Clements had just paid for the home. And then AUM would process a refinanced loan on the property through a lender. The refinanced-loan application would show the house to be owned by the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">{\u00b6 23} At some point, Swain testified, after a meeting between Sullivan, Clements, and Rydell, AUM\u2019s loan officers were instructed to begin sending all their loan applications to Ashore because they had been cut off by other lenders. Swain testified that AUM\u2019s contact at Ashore was Rydell.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">{\u00b6 24} Swain met the Roarks through a rental advertisement. After the Roarks had decided to buy a home on Windswept Lane, Clements bought the home for $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">{\u00b6 25} Swain had the Roarks execute a note and mortgage in favor of Clements for $85,000. Swain also prepared a loan application for $104,000 to refinance the property. He admitted that he gave Cynthia Roark some of his own money to deposit into her bank account. Swain instructed Roark to obtain a Verification of Deposit (\u201cVOD\u201d) and then to withdraw the same sum immediately and give it to him. Swain said that he had learned this VOD technique from Sullivan and Clements.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>{\u00b6 26} In June 2003, Swain referred Cynthia Roark\u2019s processed loan submission to Ashore for refinancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\n<em>Cynthia and Steven Roark</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 27} Cynthia Roark testified that she and her husband, Steven, had been through a bankruptcy and had never owned a home. In the fall of 2002, Roark and her husband responded to a newspaper advertisement for a rental property. Roark spoke with Swain, who told her that the rental home was no longer available. Swain asked Roark whether she had ever considered purchasing a home.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 28} Swain obtained the Roarks\u2019 credit report and called them to say that he could help them buy a home with no down payment. Swain introduced the Roarks to Brian Withers, a real estate agent who worked with AUM.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">{\u00b6 29} In April or May of 2003, Withers showed the Roarks the house on Windswept Lane. Withers said that the house had been appraised at $130,000, and that with the way that their loan worked, the Roarks could either get an appraisal or an inspection. Withers told them to get the appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">{\u00b6 30} The Roarks continued to look for other houses. When they found other houses that they were interested in, they would call Withers. But, Roark testified, they were \u201cconstantly being put off that nothing ever fit our loan.\u201d After a few days, Withers called them and told them that someone else was interested in the Windswept property and that they would have to make a decision immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">{\u00b6 31} The Roarks chose to purchase the property. They made an offer on the property \u201cin the 80s, 85, 89, something like that.\u201d They were told that their loan would be for about $104,000 to cover their outstanding debts, the brokerage fees, and the purchase price. Roark testified that they were comfortable obtaining the loan because, throughout the process, Swain and Withers had told them that the house was worth $130,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">{\u00b6 32} In late May, Swain told the Roarks that they could pick up the keys and move into the house. The Roarks \u201csigned a paper that we thought we were acknowledging that we were accepting keys to the home with the intent to purchase at a later date.\u201d Swain told them that he would contact them with a closing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">{\u00b6 33} Unbeknownst to the Roarks, a deed, a settlement statement, and a mortgage, each dated May 22, 2003, indicated that Clements had sold the property to the Roarks for $85,000. The Roarks made no payments to Clements.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">{\u00b6 34} An appraisal dated May 26, 2003, indicated that the property was valued at $130,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>{\u00b6 35} In late June 2003, at what Roark testified was their \u201cofficial closing,\u201d Swain and another man were present. The unidentified man repeatedly complained that he was short on time and that he was late for another meeting. The man flipped through documents and told the Roarks to sign them. The man told the Roarks that he would send them copies later because he did not have time for them to go through the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 36} The Roarks did not realize that the paperwork that they had signed at that meeting indicated that they were the current owners of the Windswept Lane property. The Roarks executed a note and mortgage, dated June 26, 2003, in favor of Ashore Funding for $104,000. Ashore Funding immediately assigned the note and mortgage to Washington Mutual, which then sold it to the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFNMA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 37} The Roarks made no payments on their loan. In February 2004, FNMA instituted a foreclosure action against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 38} In March 2004, FNMA sent a request to Washington Mutual that it repurchase the Roark loan. FNMA noted that the appraisal was unacceptable and that the property value was not supported. In turn, Washington Mutual requested that Ashore repurchase the Roark loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">{\u00b6 39} Rydell contacted the Roarks to tell them that he needed them to write a statement describing how they had obtained their loan. Rydell said that he was working with the FBI and that the FBI needed this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">{\u00b6 40} Rydell told the Roarks that he owned their loan and that he wanted to refinance it. Rydell told them that the foreclosure \u201chad already been gone through, that there was no way [they] could keep the house, that at best [they] should sell it for 70,000 either to Seth [Rydell\u2019s investor] or they had a friend, Mark Yalask, and they wanted [the Roarks] to go ahead and turn the house over for $70,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">{\u00b6 41} Roark said that Rydell and Valask Realty called the Roarks repeatedly. Rydell sent them numerous letters. Employees of Ashore Funding began to leave notes on the Roarks\u2019 car. Ashore employees contacted friends of the Roarks, trying to get the friends to persuade the Roarks to call Ashore so that Ashore could help the Roarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">{\u00b6 42} The Roarks became upset. Because Rydell had told them he was working with the FBI, Cynthia Roark called the FBI. An FBI agent told her not to have any contact with anyone at Ashore and that Rydell was not working with the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\n<em>Danyel Jones</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 43} Danyel Jones testified that a bankruptcy action against her had been dismissed in 2000 and that she had never owned a home. In the fall of 2002, Jones contacted Fritz Glaser, a loan officer at AUM.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 44} After checking Jones\u2019s credit report, Glaser told her that she could look for a house in the $95,000 price range. Jones found a house, which Glaser told her had been appraised for $129,000. Glaser told her that Airline Union had negotiated with the owners, \u201cthe Love family,\u201d for a purchase price of $92,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 45} In late February 2003, Glaser had Jones come to the office to fill out loan applications and \u201csign papers.\u201d He said that the Loves had moved out and that he would give her the house keys. Jones did not realize that she had purchased the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">{\u00b6 46} A settlement statement, a deed, and a mortgage executed February 25, 2003, indicated that Jones had bought the property from Clements for $92,750.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">{\u00b6 47} An appraisal report prepared for AUM, dated February 28, 2003, indicated that the property was worth $129,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">{\u00b6 48} Jones went to what she believed was the closing in March and had been told that the Loves would be there. But when she arrived, Jones was told that the Loves had had a prior engagement and that they had already been there. Glaser and Clements were present at the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">{\u00b6 49} Jones executed a note and mortgage dated March 17, 2003, in favor of Ashore for $103,200. Jones stopped making payments on the loan in October 2003. FNMA instituted a foreclosure action against Jones in March 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">{\u00b6 50} The court ultimately awarded Washington Mutual a judgment and decree in foreclosure on the Jones property. Upon confirmation, Washington Mutual asserted that the sale had not extinguished its claim and that a deficiency judgment remained against Jones. The court entered a deficiency judgment against Jones in the amount of $39,192.03. A month later, the court vacated the deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">{\u00b6 51} Following a bench trial before a magistrate, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the homeowners on their claims against Rydell, Ashore, and AUM for violations of the Mortgage Broker Act and for civil conspiracy. The court dismissed Ashore\u2019s counterclaims against the homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">\n<em>Ashore &amp; Rydell\u2019s Assignments of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">{\u00b6 52} In three assignments of error, Ashore and Rydell argue that the trial court erred (1) by failing to find the homeowners liable to Ashore for breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>contract and for fraud, (2) by finding Ashore and Rydell liable for violations of the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act and for civil conspiracy, and (3) in its assessment of damages. We address the second assignment of error first.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\n<em>Civil Conspiracy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 53} In their second assignment of error, Ashore and Rydell argue that the trial court\u2019s judgment against them on the homeowners\u2019 claims for civil conspiracy and for violations of the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 54} Our review of the trial court\u2019s factual determinations is highly deferential.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We will not reverse a judgment on the manifest weight of the evidence if there is some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 55} Ohio defines civil conspiracy as \u201ca malicious combination of two or more persons to injure another in person or property, in a way not competent for one alone, resulting in actual damages.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A civil conspiracy claim cannot succeed without an underlying unlawful act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, the claimed unlawful act was the violation of the Mortgage Broker Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">{\u00b6 56} The trial court determined that the defendants had violated several provisions of the Mortgage Broker Act, including R.C. 1322.07(B), (C), and (E). These sections provide the following: \u201cNo mortgage broker, registrant, licensee, or applicant for a certificate of registration or license under sections 1322.01 to 1322.12 of the Revised Code shall do any of the following: * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(B) Make false or misleading statements of a material fact, omissions of statements required by state law, or false promises regarding a material fact, through advertising or other means, or engage in a continued course of misrepresentations;</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c(C) Engage in conduct that constitutes improper, fraudulent, or dishonest dealings; * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>{\u00b6 59} \u201c(E) Knowingly make, propose, or solicit fraudulent, false, or misleading statements on any mortgage document or on any document related to a mortgage, including a mortgage application, real estate appraisal, or real estate settlement or closing document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 60} The trial court determined that Sullivan, Clements, Swain, AUM, and AUMLTD had violated the Mortgage Broker Act and had participated in a conspiracy to defraud various lenders by knowingly submitting false documentation to the lenders in support of mortgage loan applications. The court found that the homeowners had suffered damages directly related to the defendants\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 61} Ashore and Rydell have not challenged the findings of unlawful conduct on appeal. Instead, they argue that the court erred by finding that they were participants in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">{\u00b6 62} In finding that Rydell and Ashore had participated in the conspiracy, the trial court determined that AUMLTD had been created by Rydell and Sullivan to be nothing more than a shell corporation. As a result, the court disregarded AUM\u2019s corporate form and held that its sole shareholder, Rydell, was personally liable. The court further determined that Ashore had overlooked obvious problems with the homeowners\u2019 loan applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">{\u00b6 63} The court noted that the homeowners\u2019 loans listed Rydell\u2019s company, AUM, and not AUMLTD, as the mortgage broker. The appraisals for the homeowners\u2019 properties indicated that they had been conducted for AUM. The settlement statements for both properties reflected that broker fees and processing fees had been paid to AUM. And both statements indicated that yield-spread premiums had been paid directly by Ashore to AUM, outside of closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">{\u00b6 64} The court noted that AUMLTD did not operate as a legal entity apart from AUM, and that the two operated from the same office. Moreover, Sullivan served as the operations manager and president of AUMLTD while working as an employee of AUM.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">{\u00b6 65} Furthermore, the homeowners presented evidence that Rydell had used his control over AUM and its shell, AUMLTD, in such a manner as to defraud buyers and other lenders to their detriment. Rydell had set up AUMLTD to benefit personally both through his AUM agreement with Sullivan and through AUMLTD\u2019s active steering of business toward his other wholly owned entity, Ashore. Rydell protected his personal interests by naming his son as a dummy majority owner and partner of AUMLTD, by naming his AUM employee, Sullivan, as a minority owner and officer of AUMLTD, and by naming himself as AUMLTD\u2019s statutory agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>{\u00b6 66} Rydell testified that he had listed his son as a majority owner \u201cbecause [they] were going through a time where [Rydell] said to Jay that that $8,000, even though [Jay] may not be operating the company any more, [they] have a contract. And he said okay. It was all part of negotiations.\u201d Rydell\u2019s inability to explain the reason for the arrangement was further proof of his fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 67} By Rydell\u2019s design, AUM and AUMLTD were essentially the same entity operating from the same office. Swain, an AUM employee, did not even know that the two existed separately. Even though AUM did not have a broker\u2019s license, it was listed as the broker on both the Roark and Jones loan applications. As a result, the homeowners and other lenders were led to believe that AUM held a broker\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 68} The homeowners introduced sufficient evidence to disregard AUM\u2019s corporate form to reach Rydell individually.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 69} With respect to Ashore, its sole shareholder ensured that his other wholly owned entity, AUM, and its shell routed business to Ashore. This occurred despite obvious problems with most of the applications, including Clements\u2019s involvement as a prior purchaser, numerous bogus appraisals, and borrowers\u2019 low funds on deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">{\u00b6 70} For instance, Rydell testified that on a refinanced-loan application, a borrower would have to prove by way of a VOD that he had enough money in reserve to cover three months\u2019 worth of loan payments, but the homeowners\u2019 applications showed funds on deposit that fell far short of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">{\u00b6 71} Moreover, the appraisals on the homeowners\u2019 properties were obviously inflated. The Roark application was supported by an appraisal indicating a value of $130,000, even though the property had just been sold four days earlier for $85,000. The Jones appraisal indicated a value of $129,000, despite the property\u2019s sale three days earlier for only $92,750.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">{\u00b6 72} In both cases, the prior purchaser was Clements, who had met with Rydell and Sullivan to steer loan applications to Ashore. The relationship generated about 20 percent of Ashore\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">{\u00b6 73} The homeowners presented sufficient evidence that Ashore was knowingly utilized in the scheme to defraud the homeowners and other lenders. Because the trial court\u2019s judgment against Rydell and Ashore was supported by competent, credible evidence, we overrule the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\n<em>Admissibility of Deposition Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">{\u00b6 74} Ashore and Rydell argue that the trial court erred by relying upon Rydell\u2019s deposition testimony for substantive evidence to support its factual findings, when Rydell had actually testified at trial. They argue that, at most, the court should have considered the deposition testimony for purposes of impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 75} The record shows that the homeowners moved the deposition into evidence at trial without any objection from Ashore or Rydell. Moreover, under Civ.R. 32(A), a party\u2019s deposition may be used by an adverse party for any purpose, including as substantive evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> So the trial court did not err by considering Rydell\u2019s deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\n<em>Trial Court\u2019s Consideration of Federal Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 76} Before the magistrate rendered his decision in this case, Ashore filed a request that he take judicial notice of certain documents from the federal criminal proceedings against Clements, including his indictment and his plea agreement. Then, in his decision, the magistrate adopted a statement of facts contained within Clements\u2019s written plea agreement. The magistrate found that the facts described in the statement coincided with the evidence presented at trial and accurately described the events that had transpired in the homeowners\u2019 purchases of their properties through Clements.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">{\u00b6 77} Ashore and Rydell now argue that the trial court failed to also consider the \u201cfederal investigation and federal conclusions of law concerning Troy Clements, so as to weigh them with all of the other relevant evidence.\u201d Although Ashore had been listed in Clements\u2019s indictment as one of the many victims of his property-flipping scheme, the submitted documentation contained no \u201cconclusions of law\u201d by the federal court with respect to Ashore. Moreover, the trial court was concerned with whether Ashore\u2019s and Rydell\u2019s conduct constituted civil conspiracy under state law. Any failure on the part of the trial court to consider portions of the federal proceedings was inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\n<em>Fraud and Breach-of-Contract Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">{\u00b6 78} In their first assignment of error, Ashore and Rydell argue that the trial court erred by entering judgment in favor of the homeowners on Ashore\u2019s claims for breach of contract and for fraud. Ashore and Rydell contend that the court\u2019s judgment was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>{\u00b6 79} The elements of fraud are (1) a representation, (2) material to the transaction, (3) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such reckless disregard for whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred, (4) with the intention of misleading another into relying upon it, (5) that causes the other party injury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">{\u00b6 80} Ashore acknowledges that the homeowners were initially enticed into the property-flipping scheme by Clements and Sullivan at AUM. And Rydell testified that the homeowners \u201creally had no clue as to what was going on, because not only were they unsophisticated buyers, but they were first-time home buyers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 81} Given Rydell\u2019s admission that the homeowners lacked the requisite intent to defraud Ashore, as well as the homeowners\u2019 testimony to the same effect, we hold that the record fails to demonstrate that the homeowners had engaged in fraud. Because the trial court\u2019s determination was supported by the evidence, we will not overturn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 82} Ashore also argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment on its breach-of-contract claims was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Because Ashore did not plead claims for breach of contract against the homeowners and has made no showing that the issues had been tried by the implied consent of the parties, pursuant to Civ.R. 15(B), we will not consider the contract claims on appeal. Consequently, we overrule the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\n<em>Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">{\u00b6 83} In their third assignment of error, Rydell and Ashore argue that the trial court erred in its assessment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">{\u00b6 84} A buyer injured by a violation under R.C. 1322.07 may bring an action for recovery of damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The damages awarded shall not be less than all compensation paid directly and indirectly to a mortgage broker from any source.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And the buyer may be awarded punitive damages.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">{\u00b6 85} In this case, the trial court awarded the Roarks $3,800 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages. The court awarded Jones $25,000 in punitive damages and $42,192.03 in compensatory damages, $39,192.03 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of which represented the deficiency judgment that had been entered against Jones in the foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">{\u00b6 86} The Roarks paid $3,800 in mortgage-broker fees, while Jones paid $3,000 in mortgage-broker fees. So to the extent that the compensatory-damage awards represented these losses, we sustain the trial court\u2019s award. But as Rydell and Ashore point out, the deficiency judgment against Jones was later vacated in an amended order. So we remand this case for the trial court to modify Jones\u2019s compensatory-damage award by subtracting $39,192.03 from the total set forth in the judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">{\u00b6 87} \u201c[Generally, the amount of punitive damages to be awarded rests largely within the determination of the trier of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In assessing punitive damages, the court should consider the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct, as well as the disparity between the harm suffered by the plaintiff and the amount of the punitive-damages award.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 88} In this case, given the long-standing, premeditated nature of the misconduct, which included the defendants\u2019 bilking of innocent buyers, as well as the limited amount of the punitive-damages award, we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s judgment with respect to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\n<em>The Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">{\u00b6 89} In their cross-appeal, the homeowners argue in a single assignment of error that the trial court erred by failing to find AUMLTD liable for violations of the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act and for civil conspiracy. In essence, the homeowners argue that the trial court erred by denying their motions for default judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">{\u00b6 90} The homeowners perfected service of their third-party complaints upon AUMLTD. Prior to trial, the homeowners moved for default judgments against AUMLTD because it had failed to answer or to otherwise plead in either action.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">{\u00b6 91} In his decision, the magistrate made no finding regarding AUMLTD\u2019s liability, and the homeowners lodged objections with the trial court. The trial court overruled all objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, affirmed the decision, and denied all pending motions, including the homeowners\u2019 motions for default judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>{\u00b6 92} A default judgment may be awarded when a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or to otherwise defend in an action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThis rule applies to original claims as well as to counterclaims * * * and is logically consistent with the general rule of pleading contained in Civ.R. 8(D), which reads in part that \u2018[ajverments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required * * * are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">{\u00b6 93} In this case, where AUMLTD failed to answer the allegations in the homeowners\u2019 complaints, the trial court, under Civ.R. 8(D), should have construed those allegations as admitted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Consequently, the trial court erred by denying the homeowners\u2019 motions for default judgments without considering whether the admitted allegations constituted violations of the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act and civil conspiracy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 94} Therefore, we sustain the homeowners\u2019 assignment of error. We reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of the default judgments and remand this cause for a determination whether the admitted allegations constituted violations of the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act or civil conspiracy, and if so, for a determination of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 95} Consequently, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment with respect to the amount of compensatory damages to Jones. We reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of default judgment to the homeowners on their claims against AUMLTD. We remand this cause to the trial court to correct its judgment in accordance with this decision. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-10\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Dinkelacker, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-14\">.
