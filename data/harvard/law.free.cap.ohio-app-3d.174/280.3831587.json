In October 1997, Sanden was finishing his shift when he saw Officers Daniel Pope and Ronald Jeter. Sanden handed them an arrest warrant for a suspect named Davenport, whom he had been unable to locate earlier that day. Sanden told Pope and Jeter that Davenport would likely be at his apartment that night. Sanden then went to the Kroger grocery store in the Correyville section of Cincinnati, where he was working in his off-duty hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">{\u00b6 3} Later that night, as Sanden was walking through the breezeway towards the Walgreen\u2019s side of the Kroger store, he heard a radio call about an off-duty police officer who was chasing a suspect. Sanden came across the suspect in time to see him commit suicide. Shortly thereafter, Sanden learned that the suspect was Davenport, the man whom he had tried to serve the arrest warrant on earlier that day, and that Davenport had shot and killed Officers Pope and Jeter prior to killing himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">{\u00b6 4} In September 2000, Sanden and his partner were responding to an assistance call for Officer Kevin Crayon at the corner of North Bend Road and Colerain Avenue when they were diverted to the residence of a 12-year-old suspect, whom police suspected of harming Officer Crayon. Sanden accompanied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the juvenile suspect, who had suffered a gunshot wound, to Children\u2019s Hospital where he later died. While Sanden was en route to the hospital, he learned that Officer Crayon had died as a result of his altercation with the juvenile suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">{\u00b6 5} On October 24, 2001, Sanden resigned from his position with the city. Immediately thereafter, he began employment as a police officer with the city of Norwood. In November 2003, Sanden was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">{\u00b6 6} On December 9, 2004, Sanden filed an application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of his involvement in the events surrounding the 1997 deaths of Officers Pope and Jeter and the 2000 death of Officer Crayon. A district hearing officer allowed Sanden\u2019s claim on the basis of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bailey v. Republic Engineered Steels, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The allowance of the claim, however, was vacated by a staff hearing officer, who determined that Sanden\u2019s claim was not compensable under <em>Bailey </em>because he had not been on duty at the time of Pope and Jeter\u2019s deaths and because he had not witnessed any of the injuries to Officers Pope, Jeter, and Crayon. The Industrial Commission refused further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">{\u00b6 7} On November 4, 2005, Sanden appealed to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. Shortly thereafter, both the city and Sanden moved for summary judgment. The sole issue before the trial court was whether Sanden\u2019s job-related psychological injuries were compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation system. The trial court overruled the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Sanden\u2019s motion without an opinion or explanation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">{\u00b6 8} In its sole assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred in overruling its motion for summary judgment and in granting Sanden\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">{\u00b6 9} When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment, this court employs the same standard used by the trial court. That is, we independently review the record to determine whether summary judgment was appropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is proper when \u201c(1) [n]o genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, the conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Sanden\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim for posttraumatic stress disorder was based solely on the analysis employed by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Bailey. </em>In <em>Bailey, </em>the court interpreted R.C. 4123.01(C) to allow coverage under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes to an employee suffering from a psychiatric condition as a result of an injury to a co-worker.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that case, Bailey had been operating a tow motor when he accidentally ran over a co-worker and killed him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bailey suffered no physical injuries from the incident, but he did suffer from severe depression.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bailey subsequently filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for depression, which was denied administratively.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">{\u00b6 11} The Ohio Supreme Court, however, held that Bailey was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation coverage, despite his lack of physical injury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court interpreted R.C. 4123.01 as requiring only that a compensable injury occur.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court then reasoned that because the statute failed to specify who must be injured, a co-worker\u2019s injury could serve as a compensable injury under the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the court stated that \u201cwhere an employee witnesses or accidentally causes a coworker\u2019s injury and develops a psychiatric condition as a result, the injury is sustained within the scope of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a result, the court held that Bailey\u2019s purely psychological injury, which had resulted from his coworker\u2019s compensable injury, was also compensable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 12} In its first issue for review, the city argues that it was entitled to summary judgment on Sanden\u2019s claim because the current version of R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) expressly provides that to qualify as a compensable injury (1) an employee\u2019s psychiatric condition must involve a contemporaneous physical injury or occupational disease or (2) it must have arisen from \u201csexual conduct in which the [employee] was forced by threat of physical harm to engage or participate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>{\u00b6 13} While we agree that Sanderis psychiatric condition would no longer qualify as a compensable injury under the current version of R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) absent a contemporaneous physical injury, this version of the statute did not become effective until June 30, 2006, almost three years after Sanden was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and two years after he had applied for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Because the General Assembly did not intend for the current version of the statute to apply retroactively, we must agree with Sanden that the current statute did not bar his claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, the city was not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">{\u00b6 14} The city next argues that it was entitled to summary judgment because Sanden\u2019s claim was factually distinguishable from the employee\u2019s claim in <em>Bailey, </em>given that Sanden neither caused nor witnessed the deaths of Officers Pope, Jeter, and Crayon. The city further argues that while the Ohio Supreme Court has not expressly overruled its prior decision in <em>Bailey, </em>it has openly questioned <em>Bailey\u2019s </em>interpretation of R.C. 4123.01(C). Thus, the city argues that it is now questionable whether <em>Bailey </em>is still good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>McCrone v. Bank One Corp., </em>the Ohio Supreme Court addressed a bank teller\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a purely psychological injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, following two separate bank robberies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court held that \u201cpsychological or psychiatric conditions that do not arise from a compensable physical injury or occupational disease are excluded from the definition of \u2018injury\u2019 under R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) and from workers\u2019 compensation coverage,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) does not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 16} In its analysis, the court criticized its earlier decision in <em>Bailey, </em>characterizing its interpretation of R.C. 4123.01(C) as \u201catypical.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The <em>McCrone </em>court stated that \u201c[w]hen the entire definition of \u2018injury\u2019 in R.C. 4123.01(C) is examined, it is clear that workers\u2019 compensation covers physical injuries and psychiatric injuries that arise directly out of physical injuries or occupational disease <em>to the </em>claimant.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the court stated that <em>Bailey, </em>by allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation for a mental condition arising from a third party\u2019s injury, had \u201ccreated an aberration.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The <em>McCrone </em>court, however, did not explicitly overrule <em>Bailey, </em>concluding instead that even if <em>Bailey </em>were applicable to McCrone\u2019s claim, a physical injury (albeit to a third party) would still have been required before McCrone\u2019s psychiatric injury would have been compensable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 17} We agree with the city that it is questionable whether <em>Bailey </em>is still good law after the decision in <em>McCrone. </em>But even if we were to apply the <em>Bailey </em>court\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 4123.01(C), as Sanden urges, the city would still be entitled to summary judgment on his workers\u2019 compensation claim for posttraumatic stress disorder. Sanden, unlike the employee in <em>Bailey, </em>neither witnessed nor caused the deaths of Officers Pope, Jeter, and Crayon. We, therefore, sustain the city\u2019s sole assignment of error, reverse the judgment of the court below, and enter final judgment for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-7\">Cunningham, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b319-8\">Hildebrandt, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\">.

Second, Officers Pope, Jeter, and Crayon all suffered work-related injuries \u2014 death. And, third, the parties agreed that Sanden\u2019s PTSD was a result of the work-related injuries suffered by the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">{\u00b6 20} But a staff hearing, under the alleged authority of <em>Bailey, </em>denied Officer Sanden\u2019s claim because he had not witnessed the officers\u2019 deaths. But I do not think that <em>Bailey </em>requires us to bar Officer Sanden\u2019s recovery in this case unless he saw Davenport shoot Officers Pope and Jeter, and saw the juvenile suspect, who had been driving a car, drag Officer Crayon to his death. Instead, I believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>that <em>Bailey </em>authorizes recovery for a psychological injury that is <em>sufficiently connected </em>to the third party\u2019s work-related injury. This interpretation is more in line with the holding in <em>Bailey, </em>which took into consideration that courts, under R.C. 4123.95, are directed to liberally construe workers\u2019 compensation laws in favor of employees and concluded that the \u201clegislature\u2019s intent [under the laws of workers\u2019 compensation] was to allow compensation in cases where an employee suffers a mental injury caused by a coworker\u2019s physical injury.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, I would hold that Officer Sanden\u2019s claim was compensable because his injury \u2014 PTSD\u2014was sufficiently connected with Officers Pope, Jeter, and Crayon\u2019s work-related injuries. Although Officer Sanden certainly did not cause the deaths of Officers Pope and Jeter, it is apparent from the record that he felt somehow responsible for them. He testified in his deposition that this was the first time that he had directly handed another officer an arrest warrant that he had not been able to serve. (Apparently, an officer would return an arrest warrant that he was unable to serve during a shift, to a \u201cbin\u201d for the next officers on shift.) And then only hours later, in a tragic twist of fate, Officer Sanden saw Davenport commit suicide, after he had just shot and killed Officers Pope and Jeter as they were trying to serve him with the arrest warrant. Although police officers, as part of their employment, inevitably witness tragic events, I think it is safe to say that the particular circumstances here did not amount to a normal occurrence for a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 22} Then, three years later, Officer Sanden had to escort a juvenile suspect to the hospital after the suspect had been involved in the death of Officer Crayon. During the ride to the hospital, Officer Sanden learned that Crayon had died and later that night, the juvenile suspect died. Ironically, this situation is similar to the facts involving the deaths of Pope and Jeter: Officer Sanden was with the suspect who had killed the other officer, and then the suspect died. The only difference in this instance was that Officer Sanden did not have any physical interaction with Officer Crayon prior to his death. But he had been the first officer to respond to Officer Crayon\u2019s dispatch for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 23} Based on the foregoing circumstances, I would hold that Officer Sanden\u2019s psychological injury, which indisputably arose from the work-related injuries of three officers, was compensable under Ohio\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation system. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b320-8\">.
