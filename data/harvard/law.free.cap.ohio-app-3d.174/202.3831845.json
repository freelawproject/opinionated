Because the common pleas court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the board, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>{\u00b6 2} As the result of an investigation that its Internal Affairs Department (\u201cIAD\u201d) conducted, the sheriff issued an order on December 15, 2003, removing appellant from his employment as a deputy sheriff based on R.C. 124.34 disciplinary offenses. The removal order set forth the following infractions as grounds for appellant\u2019s removal: (1) using excessive force on an inmate on or about June 22, 2003, (2) negligence in failing to submit a complete, accurate \u201cuse of force\u201d report regarding his use of force against the inmate, (3) withholding information by failing to notify supervision of the force used against the inmate and the potential for injury to the inmate, (4) insubordination for violating a direct order that IAD had given to him not to discuss the investigation, (5) dishonesty in writing a vague and misleading entry into a logbook regarding his use of force against the inmate, (6) withholding information by failing to inform supervision of an injury to his hand that had allegedly occurred during the June 22, 2003 excessive-force incident, (7) dishonesty in falsely reporting to his supervisors how he fractured his hand, and (8) failing to notify his supervisors of his use of force against another inmate on June 15, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant appealed the sheriffs removal order to the board. He stipulated that he committed the first five infractions, he did not challenge the eighth infraction, and, as he did in his interview with IAD, he denied he committed the sixth and seventh infractions. A full evidentiary hearing was held before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) on October 24 and 25, 2004. On March 30, 2005, the ALJ issued a 23-page report and recommendation detailing her findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 4} The ALJ found that the sheriff had established by a preponderance of the evidence, as appellant confirmed in his IAD interview, that appellant committed infractions one through five and eight. The ALJ, however, found that the sheriff did not prove the sixth and seventh infractions. Both were grounded on the sheriffs belief that appellant had broken his hand during the excessive-force incident on June 22, 2003, and had then lied about his injury to his supervisors and to IAD to falsely conceal his use of force against the inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 5} The ALJ noted that other deputies involved in the June 22, 2003 excessive force incident, as well as other unrelated incidents, received suspensions ranging from one to four days. While appellant\u2019s actions reflected the intent to conceal his use of excessive force, the ALJ observed that appellant had been forthright in his IAD interview and did not attempt to influence another deputy\u2019s testimony when appellant contacted him in violation of a direct IAD order not to discuss the IAD investigation. The ALJ stated, \u201cIn weighing the appropriateness of the discipline imposed upon Appellant, this Board will consider the seriousness of Appellant\u2019s infraction, Appellant\u2019s prior work record and/or disciplinary history, Appellant\u2019s employment tenure, and any evidence of mitigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ing circumstances or disparate treatment of similarly situated employees presented by Appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">{\u00b6 6} In determining whether the discipline the sheriff imposed was appropriate in this case, the ALJ concluded, the \u201c[tjestimony and evidence presented at [appellant\u2019s] hearing indicated that the primary reason for the severity of Appellant\u2019s discipline was Appellee\u2019s perception that Appellant lied about the time and manner in which he injured his hand. Appellee failed to prove this allegation.\u201d After the ALJ considered \u201cthe totality of the circumstances and following a thorough review of all of the information contained in the record,\u201d she found \u201cthat removal of Appellant from employment is too harsh a discipline in the instant matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 7} The sheriff filed objections to the ALJ\u2019s report and recommendation. In a split decision issued July 7, 2005, the board adopted the ALJ\u2019s factual findings but modified the ALJ\u2019s recommendation, stating its belief that \u201ca ninety-day suspension and mandatory anger management counseling at Appellant\u2019s expense better reflect the violations that Appellee has proven for the record.\u201d The board ordered appellant to be reinstated as a deputy sheriff effective March 15, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 8} The sheriff appealed the board\u2019s decision to the court of common pleas, arguing that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence do not support the board\u2019s order. After setting forth the substantive facts and procedural history of the case, the common pleas court, in accordance with the ALJ and the board, determined that the sheriff had presented a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence to prove grounds one through five and ground eight set forth in the removal order. Acknowledging the board\u2019s \u201cgreat latitude\u201d and power \u201cto modify a removal order into a suspension following the consideration of any relevant mitigating factors,\u201d the common pleas court defined the determinative issue before it to be \u201cwhether the ALJ and the State Personnel Board of Review based their decisions (to modify the Sheriffs removal order to a mere suspension) on mitigating circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 9} The court decided that \u201cneither the ALJ nor the Board found that there were circumstances or factors that mitigated against the Sheriffs removal order. To the contrary, the ALJ simply engaged in speculation as to the \u2018primary\u2019 reason for the Sheriffs decision to remove Mr. Frazier, and the Personnel Board thereafter acted solely upon its \u2018belief that a suspension was a more appropriate punishment than removal.\u201d Id. at 9. The court concluded that \u201c[a]bsent a finding of mitigating circumstances or factors, the ALJ and the Personnel Board were without authority to modify the Sheriffs removal order.\u201d Id. Further concluding that the sheriff had sufficient cause to remove appellant from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>employment as a deputy sheriff, the court reversed the board\u2019s order and reinstated the sheriffs December 15, 2003 removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant appeals, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">I. The Court of Common Pleas Abused its Discretion Because It Ignored Mitigating Factors the Administrative Law Judge Used to Modify the Termination Sheriff Jim Karnes Issued Against Joe Frazier to a 30 Day Suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">II. The Court Abused Its Discretion Because It Required the Administrative Law Judge to Specifically Label Mitigating Factors Used to Modify Discipline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">{\u00b6 11} Because the assignments of error are related, we will discuss them together. In them, appellant first asserts that the common pleas court abused its discretion by substituting its judgment for that of the board when the court reversed the board\u2019s decision reducing appellant\u2019s punishment to a suspension and then reinstated the sheriffs removal order. Appellant next contends that the common pleas court abused its discretion because the court completely disregarded record evidence of mitigating factors, included in the ALJ\u2019s report and recommendation, which supports the decisions of the ALJ and the board to reduce appellant\u2019s discipline from removal to a suspension. Lastly, appellant contends that the common pleas court further abused its discretion by requiring the ALJ and the board to specifically identify and label evidence as a \u201cmitigating circumstance or factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">{\u00b6 12} The General Assembly granted adjudicatory power to the board pursuant to R.C. 124.03 and 124.34. Pursuant to those statutes, the board is authorized to hear an employee\u2019s appeal from an appointing authority\u2019s removal order and to \u201caffirm, disaffirm, or modify\u201d the order. In enacting the statutes, the General Assembly granted the board broad powers to review an appointing authority\u2019s decision and to disaffirm an employee\u2019s discharge not only when the appointing authority acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unlawfully, but also when the board finds in an independent review that the decision regarding discharge is improper or unnecessary. <em>State ex rel.

According to R.C. 119.12, the common pleas court may affirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the board\u2019s decision if, upon its consideration of the entire record and any additional evidence the court admits, the court finds not only that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s decision, but that the decision is in accordance with law.

In reviewing the common pleas court\u2019s determination that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence does not support the board\u2019s order, the appellate court\u2019s role is limited to determining whether the common pleas court abused its discretion. Id.; <em>Gallagher, </em>2007-Ohio-847, 2007 WL 611377, at \u00b6 15, citing <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 261, 533 N.E.2d 264. On the question of whether the board\u2019s order is in accordance with the law, the appellate court\u2019s review is plenary. Id. If the common pleas court abused its discretion or committed legal error, the appellate court may reverse, vacate, or modify the judgment of the common pleas court. R.C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 18} Thus, the issue before this court is whether the common pleas court abused its discretion and improperly substituted its judgment for that of the board when the court reversed the board\u2019s order modifying appellant\u2019s removal to a suspension and reinstated the sheriffs removal order. The common pleas court concluded that the ALJ had merely \u201cspeculated,\u201d without supporting evidence, that the \u201cprimary reason for the severity of appellant\u2019s discipline was [the sheriffs] perception that appellant lied about the time and manner in which he injured his hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 19} Patrick Garrity, the Director of Management Services for the sheriff, testified at the evidentiary hearing before the ALJ that he was involved in the discipline of the sheriffs personnel, including appellant. He stated that he had reviewed the IAD investigation report regarding appellant and had forwarded it to the sheriff with his recommendations as to charges to be filed and the discipline to be imposed on appellant. According to Garrity, the sheriff and appellant reached a potential settlement agreement of the instant disciplinary matter pursuant to which appellant would receive a 30-day suspension, but the sheriff refused to proceed with the settlement agreement when he became aware of allegations that appellant had lied to IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>(\u00b6 20} In discussing penalties for rule violations generally, Garrity testified that lying to IAD automatically results in the severest penalty, removal from service, and that \u201cuse of force\u201d is generally not a ground for removal in itself. Sergeant Carl Hickey, who conducted the IAD investigation of appellant, confirmed that lying to an IAD investigator will automatically result in the severest penalty: removal from service.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">{\u00b6 21} Specifically addressing the reasons for appellant\u2019s removal, Garrity testified that the primary driving factors in the sheriffs removal decision were the allegations based on appellant\u2019s lying to IAD and his deception regarding the injury to his hand. Garrity acknowledged that appellant was charged with lying to IAD because Garrity did not believe that appellant had broken his hand while making rounds at the jail, as appellant told Sergeant Hickey in his IAD interview. Garrity and Sergeant Hickey both testified that they believed appellant had broken his hand during the June 22, 2003 excessive-force incident and then tried to falsely conceal how and when he sustained his injury. Garrity confirmed that the sixth and seventh grounds of the removal order, which the ALJ subsequently found unproven, were predicated on the \u201cbelief\u2019 that appellant had lied to IAD about how and when he injured his hand. According to Sergeant Hickey, appellant admitted all the other conduct to IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 22} Contrary to the conclusion the common pleas court reached, the noted record evidence amply supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that \u201cthe primary reason for the severity of Appellant\u2019s discipline was [the sheriffs] perception that Appellant lied about the time and manner in which he injured his hand.\u201d Specifically, Garrity\u2019s testimony indicates that the sixth and seventh grounds for appellant\u2019s removal were based on a belief that appellant had lied to IAD about his hand injury. The board, through the ALJ, concluded that the sheriff did not prove those grounds, and the common pleas court did not conclude otherwise. Although the evidence was clear that the unproven grounds would have resulted automatically in a penalty of removal had they been proven, no evidence indicates that the other proven grounds carry such a harsh penalty. Similarly, no evidence suggests that the sheriff would have removed appellant from employment based on the proven grounds alone. To the contrary, the evidence suggests that the sheriff would have agreed to a 30-day suspension of appellant but for the additional allegations that appellant had lied to IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 23} The common pleas court further concluded that the ALJ and the board were without authority to modify the sheriffs removal order because they did not identify the \u201cmitigating circumstances and factors\u201d supporting then-decisions. Nothing requires the ALJ and board do so, although such identification facilitates a court\u2019s review of their decision. Instead, when reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the record supports the board\u2019s order modifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the punishment an appointing authority imposes, the common pleas court may not substitute its judgment for that of the board. See <em>Traub, </em>supra; <em>Steinbacher, </em>36 Ohio App.3d at 71, 520 N.E.2d 1381. The board has the authority to modify an appointing authority\u2019s punishment of a classified employee if it considers the punishment to be unduly harsh in light of mitigating circumstances present in the case. <em>Traub, </em>114 Ohio App.3d at 491, 683 N.E.2d 411; <em>Maiden v. Fayette Cty. Bd. of Retardation </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 196, 199-200, 16 OBR 211, 475 N.E.2d 135; <em>Steinbacher, </em>36 Ohio App.3d at 70, 520 N.E.2d 1381; <em>Kyle, </em>2006-Ohio-5517, 2006 WL 3008463, at \u00b6 24. The board\u2019s power to modify the decision of an appointing authority includes the power to modify a removal order to a suspension order. <em>Maiden; Steinbacher, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 24} Here, the sheriffs failure to prove the two most serious charges against appellant is a mitigating factor apparent on the record, and it supports the board\u2019s decision to modify appellant\u2019s penalty from removal to suspension. Additionally, other factors the ALJ discussed, though not specifically identified as \u201cmitigating factors,\u201d support the decision of the ALJ and the board to modify the penalty of removal, deemed \u201ctoo harsh\u201d in this matter: (1) appellant\u2019s cooperation during the IAD investigation, (2) appellant\u2019s forthrightness and honesty in his IAD interviews in admitting his culpable conduct on which the established rule violations were based, and (3) the relatively minor penalties imposed on other deputies in analogous situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 25} Because evidence in the record supports the decision of the board to reduce appellant\u2019s punishment from removal to suspension, the trial court abused its discretion when it substituted its judgment for that of the board concerning appellant\u2019s punishment. Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s assignments of error. The judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the common pleas court with instructions to affirm the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-8\">French and McGrath, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
