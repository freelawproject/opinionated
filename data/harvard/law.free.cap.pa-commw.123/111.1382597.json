By letter dated May 2, 1986 the planning commission informed Tohickon that the commission had disapproved the final plan. The commission included in the letter the specific reasons why the commission had denied Tohickon\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The trial court held that the township\u2019s ordinance does not validly designate the township planning commission as the final authority to deny a subdivision application, and that therefore, the failure of the governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>body to render a timely decision on Tohickon\u2019s application resulted in a \u201cdeemed approval\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The question for review is whether the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits a township ordinance to delegate to a planning commission a <em>limited </em>authority to act upon subdivision applications, where the ordinance provides that a decision of the planning commission to <em>deny </em>a subdivision application is final, but the governing body retains the power of final approval if the planning commission acts favorably upon the subdivision application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Because we conclude that the MPC allows a limited delegation of subdivision approval power to a planning commission, as provided in the township\u2019s ordinance, we must reverse the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The MPC clearly allows municipalities to delegate subdivision approval power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">Section 501. Grant of Power.\u2014The governing body of each municipality may regulate subdivisions and land development within the municipality by enacting a subdivision and land development ordinance. The ordinance <em>may require that all plats </em>of land lying within the municipality <em>shall be submitted for approval to the governing body or in lieu thereof to a planning agency designated in the ordinance for this purpose. </em>All powers granted herein to the governing body or the planning agency shall be exercised in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the provisions of the subdivision and land development ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">53 P.S. \u00a710501 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The MPC provision which provides for the approval of plats, and also mandates a deemed approval when action is tardy, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">Section 508. Approval of Plats.\u2014All applications for approval of a plat (other than those governed by Article VII), whether preliminary or final, shall be acted upon by <em>the governing body or the planning agency </em>within such time limits as may be fixed in the subdivision and land development ordinance but <em>the governing body or the planning agency </em>shall render its decision and communicate it to the applicant not later than ninety days following the. date of the regular meeting of <em>the governing body or the planning agency </em>(whichever first receives the application) next following the date the application is filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">(3) Failure of <em>the governing body or planning agency </em>to render a decision and communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner required herein shall be deemed an approval of the application. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">53 P.S. \u00a710508 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The pertinent section of the township ordinance regarding the application procedure states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">\n<em>Section 409 Procedure</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">e. <em>The Planning Commission shall:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-12\">1. Review all applicable reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-13\">2. Re-evaluate the applicant\u2019s submission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-14\">3. Determine whether the final plan meets the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>requirements of the Subdivision and .Land Development Regulations and other ordinances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">4. Recommend plan revision so that the plan will conform to Regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">5. <em>Approve </em>or <em>disapprove the final plan.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">6. Render its decision in writing, and this shall be communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him \u00e1t his last known address not later than fifteen (15) days following the decision. A <em>copy of the decision shall be sent to the governing body. </em>When the application is not approved in terms as filed, the decision shall specify the defects found in the application and describe requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite to the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">f. <em>If the Planning commission approves the final </em>plan, <em>the plan shall be forwarded to the governing body for its final action. ... </em>[Wjithin ninety (90) days following the starting date of the review process as set forth in Section 401 (b) and (d), the governing body shall render a decision. ... When the application is not approved in terms as filed, the decision shall specify the defects found and describe the requirements which have not been met and shall in each case cite the provisions of the ordinance that have been filed [sic] upon. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Thus, the township ordinance prescribes a process in which the planning commission acts first when a developer submits a subdivision plan application. If the planning commission approves the subdivision application, the commission\u2019s decision is merely advisory and subject to the governing body\u2019s final action. If the planning commission denies the application, the ordinance clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>makes the planning commission\u2019s decision final because the ordinance does not contemplate the governing body taking any further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Tohickon argues that we should construe MPC \u00a7501 to mean that a township must designate only one municipal body\u2014either the governing body or the planning commission\u2014as the final decision maker for plan review purposes. Tohickon contends that section 501 of the MPC does not allow the governing body and the planning agency to share such decision-making authority because section 501 uses the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d between \u201cgoverning body\u201d and \u201cplanning agency\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Tohickon cites Ryan\u2019s treatise, <em>Pennsylvania Zoning Law and </em>Practice,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to support the interpretation of section 501 that Tohickon urges. We certainly agree with Mr. Ryan\u2019s statement that the governing body is <em>empowered </em>to delegate the \u201centire\u201d approval function, but that comment does not purport to be exhaustive; the question of limited delegation, now before us, is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Tohickon also quotes Ryan\u2019s statement that \u201c[w]here the approval function has been delegated, the governing body simply \u2018drops out\u2019 of the application process\u201d, to suggest that a governing body becomes an irrelevant entity in the approval process once an ordinance makes any delegation to a planning agency. However, that statement also does not purport to cover all alternative approaches. Moreover, it literally discusses only a delegation of <em>approval </em>power. Here there is a delegation of <em>dismissal </em>power, with the ultimate approval power expressly reserved to the governing body.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The language of sections 501 and 508 of the MPC does not specifically preclude a partial delegation of approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>power. The relevant portions of those sections provide that the power of approval may be delegated (\u00a7501), that the designated authority must exercise the power delegated \u201cin accordance with the provisions of the subdivision and land development ordinance\u201d (\u00a7501), and that the governing body or planning agency must act on subdivision applications within a ninety day time period (\u00a7508), and communicate the decision to the applicant within that time, or the application will be \u201cdeemed approved\u201d (\u00a7508(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Tohickon argues that because ordinance section 409(e)(6) requires the planning commission to send a copy of the denial decision to the governing body, that body, by implication, must make the decision on the application even with respect to a denial. We disagree. There is certainly good reason why the planning commission, after denying an application, should keep the governing body informed by forwarding a copy of the commission\u2019s decision to the governing body. Here, the ordinance simply does not require the governing body to review the planning commission\u2019s denial and then make a final rejection decision. According to the rules of statutory construction<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we will not imply something that the ordinance does not require. <em>Patton v. Republic Steel </em>Corp., 342 Pa. Superior Ct. 101, 492 A.2d 411 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The trial court found that interpreting the ordinance to allow a distribution of denial and approval functions would violate MPC section 508(3). The trial court apparently reasoned that, because section 409(e)(6) of the ordinance is silent as to a time period in which the planning commission must issue a decision, the commission could take ninety days to render a decision, and, if the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>sion approved an application, ordinance section 409(f) would purport to allow an additional ninety days for the governing body\u2019s final decision. However, a straightforward reading of the ordinance establishes that section 409 complies with section 508(3) of the MPC by requiring both the planning commission, in cases where the commission denies the application, and the supervisors, as the governing body with final approval power in cases where the commission gives an advisory approval of the application, to issue a final decision and communicate the decision to the applicant within a <em>single </em>ninety-day time period as required by the MPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The planning commission necessarily must comply with the MPC directive that the planning commission should render a final decision within ninety days when the commission denies an application. The language of ordinance section 409(f), quoted above, reinforces the mandate of section 508(f) of the MPC by expressly requiring the governing body to issue a final decision within ninety days of the <em>initiation </em>of the application process \u201cas set forth in Section 401(b) and (d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Section 401(b) tracks the time mandates of MPC \u00a7508 by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">b. The review process for the plans required by the municipality shall include no more than ninety (90) days following the date of the regular meeting of the planning commission next following the date the application is filed, provided that should said next regular meeting occur more than thirty (30) days following the filing of the application, the said ninety day period shall be measured from the thirtieth day following the day the application has been filed. The applicant may agree to waive the time requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">We note that this subsection describes the limits on the review process by the \u201cmunicipality,\u201d thus clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>embracing both the planning commission and governing body functions and requiring that the functions of both shall be completed within the MPC\u2019s time limit. Section 401(d) of the ordinance contains a second sentence which reiterates exactly the same language, applying it to revised plans. Thus, even when the governing body considers a final approval decision after the planning commission\u2019s tentative approval, the ordinance provides that the entire process must be completed within <em>one </em>defined ninety-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Hence, the delegation of authority allowed by section 501 of the MPC and effected by section 409 of the ordinance in this case allows the planning commission to act \u201cin lieu\u201d of the governing body with respect only to a denial of a plan application. Because there is nothing in the MPC negating that limited delegation, the ordinance has properly delegated the disapproval function to the township\u2019s planning commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In this case, the planning commission has complied with the MPC and the township ordinance provisions for subdivisions and land developments by issuing and communicating to Tohickon the commission\u2019s denial of Tohickon\u2019s subdivision application within the statutory time period. Because we find that Tohickon\u2019s plan is not entitled to a deemed approval, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting Tohickon a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">NOW, January 25, 1989, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, at 87-03748, dated March 18, 1988 is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\"> Act of July 31, 1968, P.
