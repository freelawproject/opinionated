Y. <em>Court of </em>Appeals,</court>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-12\">In Hecox <em>v. </em>Citizen\u2019s Ins. Co. of St. Louis (2 <em>Fed. Rep. </em>535), it appeared that an insurance agent, by requirement of the company for which he was acting, gave a bond for the faithful performance of his duties, and an accounting of moneys received. At the time of giving such bond he was delinquent to said company on account of past transactions. Such agent afterwards made remittances to the company, directing that they be applied upon past transactions. A judgment at law having been recovered against the sureties on the bond, a bill was filed by them to restrain its enforcement, claiming that the remittances made were from current business, after the bond was given, and should be applied upon such account. <em>Held, </em>that to entitle complainants to the relief prayed, it must appear that the moneys remitted were in fact from current business, and that the company had knowledge of that fact when it received and applied the money on account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>of former transactions, as directed; and that proof not sufficiently showing this, the bill should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In Girvin v. Hickman (21 <em>Hun, </em>319), the condition of the bond in suit required the guardian, among other things, to \u2018\u2018render a just and true account of all money and property received by him, and of the application thereof,\u201d &amp;c. And again, \u201c to faithfully apply said legacy . . . . and account for the same when thereunto required,\u201d &amp;c. <em>Held, </em>that it was sufficient to show either an accounting and non-payment, or a refusal to account, or a wrongful conversion of the fund or part of it; and if such conversion were shown it was unnecessary to show an accounting.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b165-9\">In United States v. Ambrose (U. S. Circuit Ct., S. D. Ohio, May, 1880, 2 <em>Fed. Rep. </em>552), it was held that the condition in a bond given by a clerk of a United States court, that he would faithfully account for all moneys coming into his possession as such clerk, did not enlarge the obligation of the bond required by statute. The accounting for moneys in his hands as clerk was one of the duties for the faithful performance of which he was required by statute to give bond, and the specification of one of the details covered by the general obligation does not affect the validity of the bond he was required to execute.</p>\n\n\n\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"A7G\">September, 1880.</p><p id=\"b164-8\">[Reversing 45 <em>Super.

Thomson, as receiver, &amp;c., successor of Charles B,, Biker, sued Charles MacGregor, the surety-on the receiver\u2019s bond given by Biker, to recover the balance of funds found to be in the hands of the receiver, Biker, on his final accounting, and not paid over to his successor, the plaintiff, as directed by the court.</p><p id=\"b166-6\">The defendant interposed two defenses : 'l, that no breach had occurred since the execution of the bond; <em>2, </em>that the receiver Biker had faithfully performed his duties since his appointment, and that the defendant was not a party to the accounting and not bound by it.</p><p id=\"b166-7\">Plaintiff proved the principal\u2019s failure to obey an order to pay over money, made by the court some time after the date of the bond, upon an accounting of which defendant had no notice ; and the trial court excluded all evidence offered by defendant to show that this accounting covered transactions during a considerable period antecedent to the date of the bond, and that the liability ascertained by the order arose during that period.</p><p id=\"b166-8\"><em>The Superior Qourt, </em>at general term, held that the neglect of the receiver to pay according to the order of the court, which was competently made, and binding on him, was a failure to faithfully discharge his duty, and evidence of a breach of the bond for which the defendant was liable,\u2014citing Douglass <em>v. </em>Howland, 24 <em>Wend. </em>35; Jackson <em>v. </em>Griswold, 4 <em>Hill, </em>531; Willey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>v. </em>Paulk, 6 <em>Conn. </em>72 (Reported in 45 <em>Super Ct.
