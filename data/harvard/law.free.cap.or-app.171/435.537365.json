The vast majority of Garlington\u2019s clients have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Others have bipolar disorder or organic brain disease. Some patients were referred by the Psychiatric Security Review Board (PSRB). Garlington\u2019s psychiatric staff was responsible for the prescription and administration of medications, mostly anti-psychotics, to Garlington\u2019s clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Claimants are seven former employees of Garlington who resigned from their positions in February and March 1998. They sought unemployment compensation, and the Employment Department (the Department) denied their claims, concluding that they had voluntarily quit without good cause. After hearings, the hearings officer awarded benefits. Garlington appealed to the Employment Appeals Board (EAB), which reversed the hearings officer\u2019s orders and denied benefits to each claimant. The matters have been consolidated in these petitions for judicial review. We hold that EAB erred as a matter of law in failing to consider, in its determination of good cause, evidence of circumstances after claimants submitted their letters of resignation and until their separations from employment. We therefore reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Each claimant left employment with Garlington during a time when the organization was experiencing extreme financial difficulty and significant conflict between its executive director, Phyllis Paulson, and upper and mid-level management. Briefly stated, claimants quit because they believed that Paulson\u2019s management style and decisions placed the needs of clients at risk and compromised the organization\u2019s ability to provide appropriate care, and they did not believe they could ethically continue to work under her. EAB disagreed that Paulson\u2019s decisions had created a situation so grave that a reasonable person had no reasonable alternative to quitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Our analysis of the case begins with the pertinent statute. ORS 657.176(2)(c) provides that an individual who has voluntarily left work without \u201cgood cause\u201d is disqualified from the receipt of unemployment benefits. The term \u201cgood cause\u201d is one of delegation, <em>see Springfield Education Assn. v. School Dist., </em>290 Or 217, 228-30, 621 P2d 547 (1980), pursuant to which the agency must \u201ccomplete] a value judgment that the legislature itself has only indicated.\u201d <em>McPherson v. Employment Division, </em>285 Or 541, 550, 591 P2d 1381 (1979). The agency has exercised its discretion and interpreted ORS 657.176(2)(c) through the promulgation of OAR 471-030-0038(4), which provides that to establish \u201cgood cause,\u201d a claimant must show that his or her reasons for voluntarily terminating employment were \u201cof such gravity\u201d that he or she \u201cha[d] no reasonable alternative but to leave work.\u201d The facts concerning what took place here are undisputed. The question on judicial review is whether EAB\u2019s findings are sufficient, as a matter of law, to support its conclusion that claimants did not have good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We first summarize the uncontroverted facts that apply to all claimants:</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">During most of 1997, Garlington\u2019s medical staff included two full-time psychiatrists, Drs. Drakos and Bishoff. In May or June 1997, Garlington began to experience financial difficulties. In October 1997, Paulson, who had been Garlington\u2019s executive director for over four years, advised Garlington\u2019s Board of Directors of a serious budget deficit and asked the different department directors for ideas on how to reduce expenses. In December 1997, Paulson hired Pragmatix Corporation as a consultant to develop a plan for reorganization and downsizing. Only executive level employees were aware of the decision to hire Pragmatix. In January 1998, Bischoff quit, leaving his caseload of 150 clients to be divided between Drakos and claimant Foulke, a nurse practitioner. Foulke testified that after this transition, he had approximately 250 patients and felt stretched to the limits of his ability to practice competently.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In January 1998, Drakos and Hanson, a licensed professional counselor working under Drakos, prepared a reorganization plan and submitted it to Paulson. Paulson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>rejected the plan and told Hanson and Drakos that in submitting a plan for reorganization they were out of line and insubordinate. Also in January 1998, on Pragmatix\u2019s recommendation, Paulson announced that there would be a substantial reorganization and layoff of staff. Those changes were objectionable to many of the staff, who made known their concerns that the planned reorganization would disrupt client treatment and compromise client safety. Mid-level managers wrote to Paulson setting forth their concerns and asking for a meeting. On January 26, on the recommendation of Pragmatix, Garlington gave 26 employees two weeks\u2019 notice of layoff, to be effective February 6,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">On January 29, Paulson agreed to meet with 11 mid-level managers to discuss their concerns, which were critical of Paulson and were not well received. The managers expressed their views that they should have been included in downsizing discussions at an earlier stage, that Garlington should have used in-house skills to resolve the organization\u2019s problems instead of hiring Pragmatix, and that upper management felt thwarted by Paulson\u2019s autocratic, derogatory, and humiliating style of micro-management.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On February 2, 1998, supervisors were told that Paulson was enacting a retroactive pay cut, which claimants believed was in retaliation for their criticism at the meeting of January 29, but which apparently was never implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">On February 3,1998,15 managers signed and delivered a letter to the chair of Garlington\u2019s Board of Directors, expressing concern about the organization\u2019s continued survival and its ability to care for clients and attributing primary responsibility for the organization\u2019s problems to Paulson\u2019s poor management and her failure to include them in planning. They expressed the concern that in planning the reorganization, Paulson had neglected the needs of clients and had become alienated from the majority of clinical programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">On the afternoon of February 4, 1998, Paulson advised Drakos, the agency\u2019s medical director and the only remaining physician in the adult program, that he was being terminated as of February 20, that in the interim he would be on paid leave of absence, and that he was not to return to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>clinic without notifying Paulson. Paulson explained to Drakos that he was being terminated because of his failure to comply with her instructions, his lack of support and participation during the reorganization, his statement that he did not want to perform management duties, and his sabotaging of her executive decision about additional psychiatric coverage. Drakos\u2019 dismissal left Garlington without a physician in its adult program of over 400 clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">In a February 5, 1998, memorandum, Paulson advised management that Drakos would no longer work at Garlington and that she was in the process of making arrangements to find a replacement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cNick Drakos will no longer be working at Garlington Center. His last day was yesterday. I will not go into anymore detail about the reasons for Nick\u2019s departure. If you want to talk to him about his departure, please contact him directly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cI may have someone available on a full-time basis. If not, we may have to cover his position with a number of part-time individuals. In any case, we will get by. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Drakos was scheduled to see 14 patients on February 5. Additionally, approximately 12 to 14 patients were scheduled to receive their monthly or biweekly medication injections on that date. Paulson believed that Drakos\u2019 medical orders were effective until February 20, his termination date. However, on the morning of February 5, 1998, Drakos telephoned claimant Hanna, the medical coordinator/nurse supervisor, and rescinded all his medical orders, thereby creating uncertainty as to whether providers at different facilities could administer medications. Specifically, personnel whose professional licenses did not permit them to prescribe medication were concerned that if they dispensed medication without a physician\u2019s orders, they would be in violation of their licenses\u2019 restrictions. Both Hanna and Foulke were told by Paulson\u2019s assistant that business was to run \u201cas usual\u201d at the clinic despite the absence of a doctor. Nonetheless, they refused to administer medication to patients without a physician\u2019s order, and the result was described by claimants as \u201cdisastrous,\u201d \u201cinexcusable,\u201d \u201cdangerous,\u201d and \u201crisky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Patients who had appointments with Drakos on February 5 were upset when they learned he was no longer there. Clients became confused, anxious and agitated while in the medical clinic lobby when nurses could not tell them when a physician would be available. Hanson testified that the waiting room was full of people who needed medication and did not know how to get it. Neither Hanna nor Foulke had been told by Paulson when there would be physician coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">On February 5,15 employees submitted a memorandum to the Board demanding that Paulson be removed and that Drakos be restored as medical director, asserting that \u201csound and safe clinical care cannot be provided with the present direction and leadership of * * * Paulson.\u201d Also on February 5, claimants Bardossi, Foulke, Hanna, Hanson, and Hochtritt separately submitted their resignations. Two other claimants, Bader and Ponder, gave their notices on February 6 and 9, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">To make matters worse, on February 6, the earlier announced layoff of 26 employees took effect. Beginning February 6, Dr. Bazell, a psychiatrist with Garlington\u2019s childrens\u2019 program, came to assist in the adult psychiatric program, which claimant Ponder said left the childrens\u2019 program without a psychiatrist. On that date, one client who was scheduled to receive new medication \u201cdecompensated\u201d and hit a staff member and another client. Paulson stated her expectation that Drakos\u2019 orders be honored until February 20 and that staff make no referrals outside of the clinic. During the week of February 9 to February 13, contract doctors were on the premises for six to seven hours per day, but they were not familiar with the clients\u2019 cases and were not able to see all clients who needed to be seen. Hanna never received a schedule of when a psychiatrist would be on the premises and continued to refer patients to other clinics.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">On February 9, 1998, the Board of Directors met with six managers, who presented their demand that Paulson be terminated or they would resign. On February 10, the Board announced that it gave Paulson its unanimous vote of confidence and would retain Pragmatix to aid in a resolution of the agency\u2019s crises. The Board invited staff to stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>on. On February 11,1998, in response to complaints from clients, staff, and families, representatives of the Multnomah County Behavioral Health Division visited Garlington to determine whether Garlington was complying with its contract to deliver mental health services. The county concluded that Garlington was in compliance with administrative rules governing the provision of mental health services. Bader, Foulke, Hanna, Hanson, and Hochtritt left work on February 13. Bardossi and Ponder left work on March 6,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">We now summarize the facts that pertain to each claimant:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Bader was an employee of Garlington from February 12, 1996 to February 13,1998. She last worked as the housing coordinator, a management position under the supervision of the community support services director. On February 5, Bader learned that clients were not receiving medication as a result of providers\u2019 reluctance to dispense without a physician\u2019s orders. Bader attempted to remedy the situation by calling Hanna, the medical coordinator/nurse supervisor, and asking her to call providers. Bader then filed a protective service report with Multnomah County for alleged violations of clients\u2019 rights and lack of appropriate care and services and for the alleged violation of an administrative rule requiring the presence of a signed physician\u2019s order before dispensing medication. Bader tendered her resignation in early February, citing her disagreement with Paulson\u2019s management decisions and her concern that Paulson\u2019s decisions threatened the existence of the organization. She also expressed concern for her own health, the safety of staff and clients, and client care.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Bardossi worked for Garlington from March 22, 1996 to March 6, 1998, last serving as clinical supervisor of the residential team. Bardossi quit work because she thought that Paulson had created a hostile work environment and because she thought that, as a result of Drakos\u2019 termination, Garlington could not provide safe and sound clinical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Foulke worked at Garlington from October 1993 until February 13, 1998, as a psychiatric nurse practitioner under Drakos. He was authorized to prescribe medications. On the February 5, Paulson asked Foulke to cover for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Drakos. Foulke, who was already managing a caseload of 250 patients, refused, because it would involve taking on another 250 clients without a physician\u2019s back-up, which he felt would jeopardize clients\u2019 safe care and his professional standing. Foulke quit work because he considered the work environment to be unsafe for himself and others in providing inadequate medical care, he believed his license to be at risk, and he considered the clinical environment to have been dangerously compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Hanna worked for Garlington from February 1992 until February 13, 1998, as a medical coordinator/nurse supervisor under the direction of Drakos. In the absence of a physician, Hanna considered herself unable to practice without risking violation of her licensing board\u2019s standards of practice. She did not dispense any medication on February 5 or thereafter without a doctor\u2019s order. She was largely responsible for dealing with clients who came to see Drakos on February 5. Paulson stated her expectation that Hanna and Garlington\u2019s nursing staff treat Drakos\u2019 orders as in effect until February 20, and she expected the nurses to abide by the orders. Hanna advised Paulson that she and the nurses would not do so, because they did not consider the rescinded orders as in effect and considered the dispensing of medication without a doctor\u2019s order to be a violation of nursing codes and standards of practice. Paulson told Hanna that she was insubordinate. Hanna continued to refer clients elsewhere for their medications. Hanna quit because she disagreed with Paulson\u2019s management style and decisions, because she believed that after the firing of Drakos the environment at Garlington was unsafe for herself and for the clients, that clinic care was compromised, and that her professional license was in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Hanson worked at Garlington from September 1987 until February 13,1998, in his final position as a team leader on the intensive care management team, supervising eight or nine case managers, whose clients were the most disabled and had the highest potential for relapse and rehospitalization. He is a licensed professional counselor and worked directly under Drakos. Hanson quit because he believed that Paulson\u2019s firing of Drakos placed him in an ethical dilemma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>over the organization\u2019s ability to care for clients. He also was motivated by concerns for his personal safety, his disagreement with Paulson\u2019s management, and his personal health.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Hochtritt worked for Garlington from March 1997 until February 13, 1998, as a registered psychiatric nurse, under the supervision of Hanna, the medical coordinator/ nurse supervisor, who in turn worked for Drakos. Hochtritt quit because she was being asked to dispense medication and believed that, as a licensed nurse, she could not follow Drakos\u2019 rescinded orders. In her notice of resignation, she stated that she was ethically unable to continue working under the direction of Paulson, because Paulson had placed the agency, clients and the community in jeopardy through her management style and by the firing of Drakos. After Drakos rescinded his orders on February 5, someone told Hochtritt that she should continue to dispense medication as usual. Hochtritt received information from the Board of Nursing that if she dispensed medication on rescinded orders, she faced potential legal liability. Hanna, her supervisor, also told her that she could not dispense medication without a valid order.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Ponder is a licensed clinical social worker who worked for Garlington from December 1993 until March 6, 1998, as the director of child and family services, under the supervision of Paulson. Ponder quit because she thought Paulson had created an intolerable work environment and because of concerns for her health and the care of clients due to Paulson\u2019s decision to fire Drakos.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">EAB rejected each claimant\u2019s claim, reasoning that each asserted basis was insufficient to constitute good cause. EAB wrote a separate opinion for each claimant, but EAB\u2019s explanations are generally consistent from one order to the next.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u2022 Paulson\u2019s management style and decisions: Every claimant claimed to be motivated to quit in part because of Paulson\u2019s management style, most specifically her decision to fire Drakos without a back-up physician in place. EAB\u2019s general response to the complaint of poor management was that a reasonable and prudent person would have</p>\n<p id=\"A7E\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>recognized that people manage in different ways and that one cannot reasonably expect to agree with the style or decisions of upper management. EAB said that claimants\u2019 evidence was too general and lacked sufficient details of poor management to establish that Paulson\u2019s management had personally adversely effected them. EAB determined that the specific examples that some claimants provided of improper management were not sufficiently grave to justify quitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u2022 Hostile work environment: Several claimants (Bader, Bardossi, Ponder) asserted that Paulson\u2019s management style had created a hostile or intolerable working environment. EAB\u2019s opinion describes claimant\u2019s concerns as general complaints of management style, that Paulson was autocratic, inflexible and inefficient, that her interactions with staff were generally disapproving and controlling, and that she had a tendency to micro-manage and second-guess employees and to label all who had differences of opinion as disloyal. Again, EAB found that the described circumstances were not sufficiently personal to each claimants to show that Paulson had created a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u2022 Personal safety: Several claimants, specifically those who worked directly with clients (Hochtritt, Hanson, Hanna, Foulke, Bardossi, Bader), testified that they believed their personal safety or that of the clients to be at risk without a doctor on the premises who could prescribe medication to potentially violent clients. Although EAB noted two or three situations where clients became threatening as a result of the lack of a physician, it found that the evidence was not persuasive that claimants or clients were at risk of serious bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u2022 Personal health symptoms: Most claimants (Bader, Foulke, Hanna, Hanson, Hochtritt, Ponder) said that they were motivated to quit in part because of adverse health symptoms (insomnia, abdominal problems, sadness) caused by Paulson\u2019s management at Garlington. For many and varied reasons, EAB rejected claimants\u2019 health concerns as a ground for quitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u2022 Risk of professional discipline: All claimants testified that they could not ethically continue to work under Paulson, because her management demonstrated a lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>concern for clients and left Garlington unable to provide adequate client care. Two claimants who were members of the nursing staff, Hanna and Hochtritt, believed they could not administer medication on February 5, 1998, and that if they complied with Paulson\u2019s requirement that they continue to do so, they would be in violation of their professional licenses. Further, claimants testified that Paulson\u2019s management decisions, most specifically the firing of Drakos, had so compromised client care that it would be unethical for them to continue to work for Garlington. EAB found that the brief period of confusion on February 5 was not sufficient to cause a reasonable person to quit and that Garlington took steps the next day to provide medical coverage for clients or to refer them elsewhere. EAB said in the order in Bader\u2019s case that \u201cwhile the employer might have made a smoother transition in medical coverage, claimant failed to persuade us that its failure to do so created such a grave situation she could not have continued to work.\u201d Furthermore, EAB found that, because nursing staff had refused to comply with Paulson\u2019s order, they had not, in fact, been forced to commit unethical acts and that they had not suffered adverse consequences as a result of their refusal to administer medication. EAB concluded that, given Multnomah County\u2019s determination on February 11 that Garlington was in compliance with laws and administrative rules governing the provision of mental health services, the level of care was not so deficient that a reasonable and prudent person would have quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Claimants raise multiple assignments or error. In their seventh and eighth assignments, they challenge EAB\u2019s failure to consider, in evaluating \u201cgood cause,\u201d the circumstances at Garlington after claimants submitted their letters of resignation up to their dates of separation from employment. Because we conclude that those assignments are dis-positive and require reversal, we do not address the remaining assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">With regard to claimants Bardossi and Hanson, EAB explicitly said in its orders that it considered the reasonableness of claimants\u2019 decision to quit in response to Paulson\u2019s management only in light of the events that took place on or before February 5, the date on which they submitted their notices of resignations, and declined to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>events that occurred after claimants submitted their notices, because those events \u201ccould not have formed the basis for claimant\u2019s decision to quit work.\u201d Furthermore, with regard to all claimants, the Department concedes in its brief that EAB determined that \u201cthe relevant working conditions were those in place when petitioners decided to resign.\u201d That was clearly error. The Department\u2019s administrative rule, OAR, 471-030-0038(l)(a), provides that a person is at \u201cwork\u201d so long as there is an employer-employee relationship and until the separation from employment. OAR 471-030-0038(l)(a) expressly applies to the term \u201cwork\u201d as it is used in all subsections of OAR 471-030-0038. Accordingly, for purposes of determining \u201cgood cause\u201d for voluntarily leaving work under OAR 471-030-0038(4), the circumstances that existed up to the time of claimants\u2019 voluntary separation from employment are relevant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Here, because Garlington was willing to allow claimants to continue to work after the period stated in their notices of termination,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claimants voluntarily left work on their last day of work, and the circumstances that existed from the time between the notices of termination and the last day of work were relevant to the good cause inquiry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, EAB should not have refus\u00e9d to consider events and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>circumstances after the dates of claimants\u2019 letters of resignations but before their actual voluntary separations from employment.
