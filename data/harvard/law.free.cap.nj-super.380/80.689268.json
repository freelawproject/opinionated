The grand jurors for Mercer County returned an indictment charging defendant and co-defendants Corey Jones and Arthur Simms as accomplices in eighteen counts alleging crimes committed when four men entered a residence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Lakeside Boulevard in Hamilton Township. The fourth participant, C.K., was charged as a juvenile. The charges against defendant were tried to a jury. C.K. and Simms plead guilty and testified on behalf of the State at defendant\u2019s trial. The State was unable to locate Jones. Defendant did not testify at trial, but statements he made to a detective investigating the crimes were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The case requires us to consider whether defendant\u2019s self-incriminating statements were voluntary or induced by an officer\u2019s promise to allow him to speak \u201coff-the-record.\u201d Defendant made the self-incriminating statements after he came to police headquarters upon an officer\u2019s promise that he could make an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement. At the station, a second officer presented defendant with a form that included the warnings required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) and a waiver of the rights the warnings are designed to protect. The officers did not retract the promise or explain the conflict between defendant\u2019s waiver and an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement. Relying on <em>State v. Pillar, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 272-73, 820 A.2d 1 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>572, 832 A.2d 322 (2003), we conclude that defendant\u2019s statements were induced by the promise and not freely and voluntarily given.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">[At the court\u2019s direction, its recitation of the procedural history has been abbreviated.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The jury convicted defendant of burglary while armed with a deadly weapon, a crime of the second degree, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2a-b(2) (count one); three counts of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon, a crime of the first degree, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a-b (counts two, three and four); three counts of aggravated assault by pointing a firearm under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life, a crime of the fourth degree, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(4) (counts five, six and seven); simple assault, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1a(1) (as a lesser offense included in aggravated assault, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(1) (count eight)); three counts of terroristic threats in the third degree, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3b (counts twelve, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>thirteen and fourteen); possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose in the second degree, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4a (count fifteen). The judge sentenced defendant to a term of imprisonment for an aggregate of eleven years, eighty-five percent of the term must be served without possibility of parole and the term is to be followed by a five-year term of parole supervision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">On May 4, 2002, Simms, Jones, C.K. and defendant entered Daniel Zapico\u2019s house on Lakeside Boulevard through the unlocked front door. Kobert King and Adriene Bush were visiting Zapico.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Zapico, King and Bush gave similar but not wholly consistent accounts of the events. According to Zapico, Simms had a shotgun, told him to sit down and asked for money. When Zapico said he did not have any money, Simms swung the shotgun at his face. Zapico turned to avoid the blow and was struck in the back of the head. Next, Simms directed Zapico to call Montervino and tell him to come to the house. He warned Zapico that if he let Montervino know that defendants were there, \u201cthey would kill everyone.\u201d Simms took between <em>$10 </em>and $60 and drugs that <em>were </em>on the table. As Jones left the living room to look around the house, he handed his gun to defendant. Jones took cigarettes and about $400 from a back bedroom. When he returned, defendant handed him his gun. Zapico described defendant as the \u201cleast vocal\u201d of the men and staying \u201cpretty stationary\u201d in the living room during the entire incident. Zapico recognized defendant from prior contacts with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">According to King, the men ordered everyone to get on the floor, started looking around the house and were switching guns back and forth. He claimed that Jones put the gun to Zapico\u2019s head and took the \u201cstuff\u2019 from the table. He did not see defendant take anything. He described defendant and Jones as friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Bush said she really could not see and was not sure what was taken. She did not see if defendant was holding a gun, but she remembers him asking for Montervino.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Danielle King arrived while the defendants were in the home. She saw defendant and two other men; one of them had a gun. The defendants left the house when Danielle King arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Simms testified on behalf of the State, and he told the jurors that Jones came up with the plan to rob Montervino. Defendant was there when Jones told Simms about the plan, and they were all together when they picked up the guns. Defendant did not have a gun but could see that Simms had one. Simms went through the door first; defendant was \u201csecond or third\u201d behind him.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">C.K. also testified on behalf of the State. He said that Jones told him about his plans for Montervino and told them to pick up their guns when they got to Lakeside Boulevard. Defendant was right there when Jones gave the command. When they got to the house, defendant said the guns would go first. Simms went in first with the shotgun; C.K. had his gun in his sweatpants; and defendant came in last.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Defendant did not testify. Detective Braconi of the Hamilton Township Police Department led the investigation. One evening shortly after the crimes, Braconi had received a phone call from Detective KalinowsM, who works for the same police department. Kalinowski told him that defendant was coming in to make a statement. Defendant\u2019s girlfriend drove him to headquarters. Braconi took notes on the statements defendant made, but defendant refused to make a formal statement. According to Braconi, defendant told him that he went to the house to get money and that two of the men he was with took out guns after they were inside. Defendant told the detective that he never held one of the guns and did not know that the others had them.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Defendant raises four issues on appeal. He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>I. [DEFENDANT\u2019S] CONVICTIONS ON COUNTS I-VII AND COUNT XV MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE JURY CHARGE WAS IN ERROR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">II. THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTIONS ON COUNTS I-VII AND XV MUST BE REVERSED SINCE ELEMENTS OF THOSE CRIMES WERE NOT PROVEN.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">III. THE COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING DEFENDANT\u2019S STATEMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">TV. THE COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO SET ASIDE THE VERDICT ON DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO GRANT A NEW TRIAL WAS IN ERROR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">We reject the claims raised in point II as lacking sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written decision. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2). We conclude that the evidence discussed above is adequate to defeat a motion for judgment <em>of </em>acquittal and support the convictions. A reasonable jury could find defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt after considering all of the State\u2019s evidence and giving the State the benefit of all favorable evidence and inferences. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 <em>U.S. </em>307, 318-19, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2781, 2788-89, 61 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>560, 573 (1979); <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 458-59, 236 A.2d 385 (1967). For that reason, any inconsistency in the verdicts is immaterial. <em>State v. Banko, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>44, 861 A.2d 110 (2004). Because we find that error in the jury instruction on accomplice liability requires reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions, we do not consider the trial court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. We also conclude that defendant\u2019s statements were not made freely and voluntarily and may not be admitted into evidence at defendant\u2019s second trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-10\">[At the court\u2019s direction, the discussion of the jury instruction on accomplice liability has been omitted from this published decision.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">Because the matter is remanded for a new trial, it is necessary to consider defendant\u2019s objections to the admission of his self-incriminating statements. The question about defendant\u2019s statements arose during trial. After the first day of testimony, Detective Kalinowski disclosed that he had convinced defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>talk to Detective Braconi on the promise that defendant\u2019s statements would not be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The relevant facts are as follows. The night after the first day of trial, Detective Kalinowski reached both the prosecutor and defense attorney by telephone and told them about conversations he had with defendant and Detective Braconi on the night that defendant gave Braconi a statement about the Lakeside Boulevard incident. Before trial commenced the following day, defendant\u2019s attorney told the judge about the call, and the prosecutor reported his similar conversation with Kalinowski. Defendant\u2019s attorney (not appellate counsel) explained why the issue had not arisen before:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">Judge, maybe I can explain this without violating my attorney-client privilege. Information that I had before trial was consistent, to some extent, with the information I received from Kalinowski, However, my opinion was that it did not rise to the level of a meritorious challenge to the statement on grounds of voluntariness. My opinion was that there was frequently and commonly an exchange between law enforcement and suspects at this stage, maybe you cooperate, we can help you, and there can be some benefit here, which I typically get, and I sort of saw this more in that category.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">In light of these disclosures, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s application to take Kalinowski\u2019s testimony outside the presence of the jury and in accordance with <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">Kalinowski testified that defendant\u2019s brother Michael brought defendant to Kalinowski\u2019s home on an evening after the burglary and robbery. The visit was unannounced. Michael had played baseball on a team coached by the detective years earlier. Michael kept in touch with Kalinowski. He visited Kalinowski at his home and even helped him do work around the house. Defendant too had played on a team Kalinowski coached, but Kalinowski had not seen him for years. He knew that defendant had been in some trouble in the past. Kalinowski also knew the brothers\u2019 father.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Michael told the detective that he thought his brother was in some kind of trouble and that he and his brother wanted to know if Kalinowski had heard that defendant was wanted or that there was a warrant for his arrest. The source of defendant\u2019s concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>was not disclosed immediately. Eventually, there was a vague reference to Lakeside, and Kalinowski, who had heard about the burglary and robbery, asked defendant if he was talking about the Lakeside Boulevard incident. Defendant acknowledged that he was but said nothing else, and Kalinowski did not yet understand that defendant was directly involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Kalinowski placed a phone call to Braconi, who was investigating the incident, and Braconi told him that defendant\u2019s name had come up in his investigation. At that point, Kalinowski understood the serious nature of defendant\u2019s trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">As Kalinowski put it, from that point on he \u201cwas trying to wear two hats\u201d \u2014 a friend of the family and a police officer. Kalinowski called defendant\u2019s father, who told him to treat the matter as he would if defendant were his son. Kalinowski urged the father to hire an attorney for defendant, and defendant\u2019s father said he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">As a police officer, Kalinowski was concerned about locating the guns and finding out more about the others involved in the crimes. He urged defendant to help the police in these endeavors. Defendant was not \u201creal cooperative.\u201d He did not say anything specific. Kalinowski told defendant that he was a suspect and would be arrested, if not that night, the following day. He explained that there would be a prison sentence because guns were involved. He emphasized law enforcement\u2019s need to find the guns and told defendant that his father had said he would hire a lawyer to defend him.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">After two hours of discussion and persuasion, defendant agreed to have his girlfriend drive him to headquarters. Kalinowski then called Braconi to let him know that defendant was coming in. He followed defendant and his girlfriend to headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Kalinowski gave a synopsis of the discussion leading up to defendant\u2019s ultimate decision to talk to Braconi. He told defendant that anything he said would be \u201coff-the-record.\u201d By \u201coff-the-record,\u201d Kalinowski meant that no matter what defendant said, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>would not be used against him. Kalinowski reported that he told defendant that the police just needed information. He promised, \u201cIf you come in and help us off-the-record, it\u2019s a feather in your cap, it will help you. It is good for you to cooperate, not just for yourself, but to get these other people and guns, period.\u201d He repeated that what defendant said would be \u201coff-the-record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Kalinowski explained that at the time he believed that there was enough evidence in the case to make anything defendant said unnecessary for prosecution. He also reported that his departs ment had allowed defendants to make \u201coff-the-record\u201d statements under similar circumstances in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">When Kalinowski got to headquarters he told Braconi that defendant was willing to talk to him but only if it was strictly \u201coff-the-record.\u201d Braconi listened. He did not say he disagreed with Kalinowski\u2019s condition, and he did not say he agreed. Believing that Braconi \u201cunderstood where [he] was [ ] with this,\u201d Kalinowski went with Braconi to the interview room where defendant was waiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">After brief introductions, Braconi gave defendant a written form which included <em>Miranda </em>warnings and a waiver of the rights explained by the warnings. Defendant read it, signed it, and, according to Braconi, said he understood it. Both officers witnessed his signature. There was no discussion of Kalinowski\u2019s promise of an \u201coff-the-record\u201d conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">At that point, it \u201cstarted to dawn\u201d on Kalinowski that Braconi was not going along with his plan for an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement. He and Braconi left the interview room and had a discussion that was sufficiently \u201cheated\u201d to get the attention of the Sergeant, who took both detectives into his office. Kalinowski told them that they should be' treating defendant as if he had an attorney because defendant\u2019s father was retaining one. Defendant never asked to wait for the lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The defense, prosecution and trial court agreed that the question posed \u201cwas whether, under the totality of the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>stances, defendant\u2019s [incriminating] statements were freely and voluntarily given.\u201d <em>State v. Knight, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>449, 461, 874 A.2d 546 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even where effective <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given, the \u201cstate must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary and was not made because the defendant\u2019s will was overborne.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 874 A.2d 546. Factors considered in evaluating whether a defendant\u2019s statement was induced or voluntary under the totality of the circumstances include the following: the \u201csuspect\u2019s age, education and intelligence, advice concerning constitutional rights <em>[Miranda </em>warnings], length of detention, [and] whether the questioning was repeated and prolonged____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462-63, 874 A.2d 546 (quoting <em>State v. Galloway, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 654, 628 A.2d 735 (1993)). Promises made by law enforcement are also relevant: where a promise is likely to \u201cstrip[ ] defendant of his \u2018capacity for self-determination\u2019 \u201d and actually induce the incriminating statement, it is not voluntary. <em>Pillar, supra, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 272-73, 820 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The trial judge concluded that defendant\u2019s statements were voluntarily and freely given. He made the following findings. Defense counsel did not raise the issue until he received the call from Kalinowski, which meant that his client had not provided adequate information earlier. Defendant was a twenty-two year old high school graduate, apparently of \u201cabove average intelligence\u201d who went to Kalinowski, with whom he and his brother had a prior relationship, \u201cfor help \u2014 guidance, assistance and aid.\u201d During the course of an \u201cover two-hour, rambling, rolling discussion\u201d Kalinowski \u201cmade the off-the-record comment ... once, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>perhaps twice, perhaps three times.\u201d Kalinowski made the comment about an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement \u201cnot to induce an incriminating statement but rather to find out about the guns and the other participants resulting in a \u2018pseudo contract.\u2019\u201d There was a \u201ctwenty-minute separation\u201d between the conversation and defendant\u2019s arrival at the police station. Kalinowski told Braconi \u201cthat he promised [defendant] off-the-record comments.\u201d Braconi \u201cneither agree[d] nor disagreefd].\u201d He proceeded to conduct the interview. These findings are supported by the record, and we accept them. <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>425, 430, 864 A.2d 1177 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The judge\u2019s conclusion that Kalinowski\u2019s promise did not induce the statement is premised on findings that do not take significant evidence into account, and we cannot defer to that conclusion. <em>Id. </em>The judge found that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and defendant\u2019s subsequent waiver of rights demonstrated a knowing abandonment of the <em>promise </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201csomething that presented defendant] with the fact that he [was] going to be asked questions ... and before [which] ... he must be advised on his rights.\u201d He reasoned that if defendant had been relying on the promise of making off-the-record statements, he would have made a comment or asked a question when \u201ca brand new officer presented]\u201d <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Our difficulty with that conclusion in light of the evidence is that neither the circumstances nor the officer were new. Defendant knew that he was coming to headquarters to talk to a detective other than Kalinowski, and Kalinowski\u2019s presence in the interview room must have provided defendant with assurance that things were going as planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The trial court also based the conclusion that defendant understood that he was waiving his right against self-incrimination on defendant\u2019s \u201cguilefulf ] and eagy[ ]\u201d responses to Braconi\u2019s questions. Here, the court referred to defendant\u2019s failure to identify his co-defendants or the location of the guns and his refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>make a formal statement after responding to Braconi\u2019s initial questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The evidence was otherwise. Braconi testified that defendant was cooperative. Testimony about defendant\u2019s reluctance to speak was given by Kalinowski when he described defendant\u2019s attitude before he made the decision to give an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement. Moreover, defendant implicated himself in the burglary during the informal statement. Viewed in the context of that admission, defendant\u2019s failure to identify his co-defendants or the location of the guns (assuming he even knew where the guns were) does not suggest caginess based upon a belief that the statement would be used against him. The refusal to make a formal statement after Braconi\u2019s informal questioning is more consistent with defendant\u2019s holding of a belief that the informal conversation was \u201coff-the-record,\u201d as promised, but a formal statement would become part of the record that could be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Finally, the judge concluded that defendant had an obligation to inquire when presented with a waiver of rights \u201cif he believed that his comments were going to be off-the-record.\u201d However, we conclude that under <em>Pillar, supra, </em>Braconi had the obligation to explain the conflict between the promise and the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In <em>Pillar, </em>this court examined an incriminating statement made by a \u201cdefendant ... in specific and immediate response to the officer\u2019s assurance that defendant could speak off-the-record.\u201d <em>Pillar, supra, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 272, 820 A.2d 1. Despite the fact that assurance of an \u201coff-the-record\u201d conversation came after defendant was given <em>Miranda, </em>warnings, the court concluded that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s subsequent statements were made freely and voluntarily after a \u201cvoluntary\u201d waiver of rights. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 820 A.2d 1. The court reasoned that defendant could reasonably believe that the promise of an \u201coff-the-record conversation\u201d \u201cmeant that the statement would not be used against him.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>On that basis, the court concluded that such a promise \u201chad the likelihood of stripping defendant of his \u2018capacity for sell-determination\u2019 \u201d and actual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ly induced the incriminating statement. <em>Id. </em>at 272-73, 820 A.2d 1. We explained, \u201c[a] promise that statements made will not be used against the defendant purports to remove the specter of proving one\u2019s own guilt by making a statement. Such a promise is a truly powerful one, going to the heart of a declarant\u2019s reservations about giving a statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 820 A.2d 1. We relied upon <em>Streetman v. Lynaugh, </em>which held that a \u201cpromise that any statement will not be used against the accused\u201d is so \u201cattractive that [it renders] a resulting confession involuntary.\u201d <em>Pillar, supra, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 273, 820 A.2d 1 (quoting <em>Streetman v. Lynaugh, </em>812 <em>F.</em>2d 950, 957 (5th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In <em>Pillar </em>the court cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">A police officer cannot directly contradict, out of one side of his mouth, the <em>Miranda, </em>warnings just given out of the other. An acquiescence to hear an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement from a suspect, which the officer ought to know cannot be \u201coff-the-record,\u201d totally undermines and eviscerates the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, at least with respect to a statement made, as here, in immediate and direct response to the misleading assurance. As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said, \u201c[m]isleading statements and promises by the police choke off the legal process at the very moment which <em>Miranda </em>was designed to protect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 268, 820 A.2d 1 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Although the order of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the promise of \u201coff-the-record\u201d statements was different in this case, the rationale of <em>Pillar </em>requires the same result. Braconi knew about the promise Kalinowski had made. Kalinowski, an experienced detective, believed that Braconi intended to honor the promise. Kalinowski attended the interview, which must have led defendant to believe that things were going as planned. Knowing all this, Braconi simply presented a written form that included <em>Miranda </em>warnings and a written waiver of the rights <em>Miranda </em>is designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Braconi knew that he did not intend to honor Kalinowski\u2019s promise. However, \u201c[w]hether a statement ... amounts to a promise must be viewed from the defendant\u2019s, not the [interrogator]^ perspective----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272, 820 A.2d 1 (quoting <em>State v. Watford, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>151, 163, 618 A.2d 358 (App.Div.1992) (Havey, J.A.D., concurring)). Defendant could well have conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>ed that the waiver was subject, or even irrelevant, to the prior promise. Braconi did not highlight or clarify the conflict. Rather, he allowed the promise to stand without an explicit retraction and without an explanation of the inconsistency with defendant\u2019s waiver of rights. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 820 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We cannot distinguish the efficacy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in this case from the inefficacy of the warnings given in <em>Pillar. </em>The <em>Miranda </em>warnings Braconi gave \u201cdirectly contradicted\u201d the \u201coff-the-record\u201d offer given by Kalinowski and with that contradiction came the obligation to explain that the waiver of the right to remain silent would effectively override the prior promise. The officer in <em>Pillar </em>had a duty to explain that a promise to permit the \u201coff-the-record\u201d statements does not override a waiver of the right against self-incrimination and so did Braconi. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the officers together (Braconi knowingly and Kalinowski unwittingly) gave conflicting messages. In <em>Pillar, </em>the conflicting messages came from the \u201cmouth\u201d of one officer. <em>Ibid. </em>The impact is the same. A \u201c[misleading statement and promise by the police choked off the legal process at the very moment which <em>Miranda </em>was designed to protect.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Accepting the trial judge\u2019s findings that are supported by and not inconsistent with the record, <em>Smith, supra, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 430, 864 A.2d 1177, we cannot conclude that the State established beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were not induced by Kalinowski\u2019s compelling promise of an opportunity to speak without consequence other than a favorable outcome in his case. <em>Pillar, supra, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 270, 273, 820 A.2d 1. Defendant\u2019s statements may not be admitted at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\"> Because the issue was not addressed below, we do not consider whether ineffective <em>Miranda </em>warnings provide an independent basis for exclusion of the statement. We consider the <em>Miranda </em>warnings as one factor relevant to the question whether the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right against self-incrimination and right to counsel and his making of the statements were voluntary or induced by Kalinowski's promise. <em>See id. </em>at 462-63, 874 A.2d 546; <em>State v.
