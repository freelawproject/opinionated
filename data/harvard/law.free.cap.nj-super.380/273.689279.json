Fireworks by Girone, Inc., </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>138, 861 A.2d 843 (2004). It arises from interrelated disputes regarding (1) the proper source of payment for a judgment against a municipality and in favor of a child injured after a fireworks display, and (2) the viability of a pretrial settlement between the injured child and the fireworks exhibitor and its insurer. We now reverse an order vacating the settlement, and we hold that the exhibitor\u2019s insurer is also responsible, in its role as a statutory surety, for the judgment against the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">In May 1995, defendant Fireworks by Girone, Inc. (\u201cGirone\u201d) conducted a fireworks display under contract with defendant Township of Deptford. One week later, plaintiff Brenden Wasniewski, a minor, found an unexploded firework in the park where the display took place. He took it home, lit it several weeks later, and was seriously injured. Plaintiff Karen Smith, individually and as guardian ad litem for her son, Brenden, sued Girone, Deptford, and Girone\u2019s insurer, Lexington Insurance Company. Deptford\u2019s own insurer, Harleysville Insurance Company of New Jersey, intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The underlying facts and procedural history are set forth in <em>Smith v. Fireworks by Girone, Inc., </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>199, 850 A.2d 456 (2004) (reversing our unpublished decision in Nos. A-3312-01T2 and A-3929-01T2 (App.Div. June 2, 2003)). Following is a summary of the facts, as well as the detailed procedural history relevant to the issues now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">On January 27, 1995, Deptford and Girone signed a written agreement for the 1995 celebration of \u201cDeptford Day,\u201d to be held in a municipal park on Saturday, May 20, 1995. Girone had staged a yearly fireworks display for Deptford\u2019s May celebration every year for the previous twenty years. Pursuant to their contract, Girone agreed that it would furnish a licensed pyroteehnician, fireworks, and all personnel and equipment necessary to execute the fireworks display, and that it would also \u201cfurnish PUBLIC LIABILITY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE INSURANCE in accordance with the limits set forth by the governing body having jurisdiction naming [Deptford] as additional insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Deptford also agreed to obtain the necessary permits required under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-3 for a fireworks display; to provide protection and a location for the display that met or exceeded the requirements of the National Fire Protection Agency Code for Fireworks Display; and to \u201cbe RESPONSIBLE for all POST DISPLAY CLEAN-UP with respect to removal of debris and POLICING of area AT FIRST LIGHT following the exhibition.\u201d Along with the contract was an eleven-page \u201cprogram,\u201d which was \u201c[e]opyright[ed]\u201d by Girone. On page nine of its program, Girone stated that it would provide: \u201cInsurance In the Sum of $2,000,000.00 Naming \u2018DEPTFORD FUN DAY\u2019 as additional insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Lexington issued policy number 5632414 to Girone, providing commercial general liability and \u201cDisplay of Special Effects liability\u201d coverage, with a limit of $2 million in the aggregate and $1 million for each occurrence. The policy ran from May 31, 1994 to May 31,1995; it was renewed for the period May 31,1995 to May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>31, 1996. A Certificate of Insurance was issued to Deptford, naming it as an additional insured for the fireworks display at the park on May 20,1995.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">On the evening of May 20, 1995, Girone proceeded with the fireworks display. Immediately following the display, Girone employees and Deptford\u2019s Fire Marshal conducted a post-display search. Six potentially live shells and various spent shells were found and turned over to Girone.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The following morning, the Fire Marshal returned to the park to search for additional fireworks. He explained that he \u201cwalked up and down the field [searching] while pushing my 2 year old daughter in a baby carriage.\u201d He found \u201cempty tubes\u201d and other spent fireworks debris, but no live shells.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">One week after the display, ten-year-old plaintiff Brenden Wasniewski was riding his bike in the park with his father. He picked up one live firework shell and some spent fireworks debris both on and near the launch site. He disposed of the debris, but hid the live shell at home. On July 3,1995, Brenden tried to light the live shell; it exploded in his dominant left hand, causing severe and permanent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">In March 1997, plaintiffs filed a twenty-one count complaint in the Law Division against Girone, Deptford, and other, later dismissed defendants. In an amended complaint, plaintiffs added Lexington, Girone\u2019s insurer, as an additional defendant. The counts of the amended complaint relevant to this appeal were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">Counts One to Three against Girone for negligence, breach of contract, and strict liability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">Counts Four- to Six against Deptford for negligence, breach of contract, and strict liability; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Count Twenty-three against Lexington for strict liability as surety, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5, for personal injuries arising out of the fireworks display.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Deptford and Lexington filed cross-claims for contribution and indemnification against all codefendants. Deptford filed an amended answer and cross-claim seeking defense and indemnification from Girone, alleging that Girone was contractually obligated to provide $2 million insurance for Deptford, as well as defense and indemnification. In November 1999, plaintiffs moved to allow proofs at trial against Lexington as a direct defendant on the grounds that Lexington\u2019s liability arose from its role as a surety under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5. The motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Thereafter, Deptford moved for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on several grounds. The motion judge dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Deptford alleging strict liability and seeking punitive damages, but denied summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 negligence and breach of contract claims. The judge held that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the combination of fireworks and the park could constitute a dangerous condition that would not entitle Deptford to immunity under the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:4-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Plaintiffs reached a settlement with Girone and Lexington. The nature and terms of the settlement were placed on the record in \u201cfriendly\u201d proceedings, conducted pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:44-3, on two separate dates prior to the trial against Deptford. On September 4, 2001, in the presence of counsel for plaintiffs, for Girone, for Lexington, and for Deptford, the Law Division judge was advised that plaintiffs had agreed (subject to court approval of a settlement on behalf of a minor) to settle their claims against Girone and Lexington, but retained the right to a jury trial against Deptford.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Counsel for Lexington told the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">I\u2019ve agreed with the plaintiffs [sic] attorney that the terms that are set forth are the only terms that are acceptable to him, the only terms on which this ease can settle to the extent that it\u2019s being settled today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The plaintiffs have indicated that the only other alternative available to Lexington to settle this case is a trial of all issues as to all parties. And that option is not acceptable to Lexington because it leaves their insured exposed to claims against their personal assets so this settlement has been arrived at by the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Significantly, Lexington\u2019s counsel had written to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, noting that the alternative of letting plaintiffs go to trial against Girone and Deptford was \u201cunacceptable to Lexington, since it exposes <em>both the Township of Deptford </em>and Fireworks by Girone to the possibility of a verdict in excess of all available limits.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Deptford\u2019s counsel was present at that hearing, but merely noted that it was not a party to the agreement. Deptford\u2019s counsel told the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">Your Honor, if I may add one thing. Mr. Hopkin [counsel for Lexington] said that the [sic] agreed to by all the parties. I just want to make it clear that Deptford Township was not made party to any of these agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">THE COURT: Okay. That is so noted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Under the settlement agreement, Lexington would pay out $977,300,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>the sum remaining on the $1 million per occurrence policy covering Girone, and plaintiffs would release Lexington and Girone, while capping their claims against Deptford so that they could \u201cnever recover more against Deptford Township than their available insurance policy limits.\u201d Counsel for Lexington represented to the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">The plaintiffs will cap their claim against the Township of Deptford at available limits of the Township of Deptford which have been represented as being a million dollars primary policy and a $4 million umbrella policy.131 And the plaintiffs will not reach the personal or private assets of Deptford Township but only recover from available coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">The parties appeared again before the judge on September 10, 2001 to present the final terms of the settlement, including a structure for the major portion of the net settlement for Brenden\u2019s benefit (after deduction of attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>outstanding medical bills). That sum was to be $647,430.91, with $600,000 to be used to purchase the structured payout through two insurance companies. After all the details of the proposal were placed before the court, counsel for Deptford asked to add one \u201ccomment.\u201d Deptford\u2019s counsel neither objected nor agreed to the substantive terms of the settlement, but stated that he had \u201c[n]o objection to the form\u201d of the settlement. He expressly noted that there was an issue as to the amount of coverage provided by Lexington. The following colloquy occurred as to coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">MR. HICKEN [counsel for Deptford]: I have no questions just one quick comment if I may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">There was a representation made with respect to the limits of coverage. We don\u2019t necessarily agree with that, but that\u2019s for a different\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">THE COURT: There is an issue between insurance carriers whether there are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">MR. HICKEN: How much coverage is actually there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">THE COURT: Yes, there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">MR. HICKEN: I just didn\u2019t want my silence to be construed as somehow agreeing to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">THE COURT: Okay. I understand you have a different \u2014 potentially different point of view because of the surety bond between the primary company and Deptford which is an interrelated matter between you and the company; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">MR. HICKEN: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">The judge approved the settlement, finding it \u201creasonable\u201d after noting that he had been discussing the matter with counsel and with the expected trial judge, \u201cthat for settlement purposes, that a number, approximately 1-5,1-6, somewhere in that area has been placed on the file,\u201d and that \u201cone remaining defendant\u201d was involved. An order approving the settlement and the structured payment contract was entered the same day.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">The next day, Deptford filed a motion, purportedly pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9\u20142(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to determine \u201cwhether or not [Girone\u2019s] secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>rity bond serves as a deduction or credit for any verdict rendered against Deptford.\u201d Deptford argued that Lexington\u2019s insurance policy acted as a surety bond for the Township under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5. Plaintiff opposed the motion, and the judge reserved decision until after the anticipated trial against Deptford, which was scheduled for early October.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Three days later, on September 14, 2001, Harleysville (Dept-ford\u2019s general liability carrier) moved to intervene to assert a cross-claim for coverage against Lexington. Harleysville argued that it was improper for Lexington to settle plaintiffs\u2019 claims without including Deptford, both because Lexington had a duty to defend and indemnify Deptford as an additional insured on the Lexington policy, and because Lexington had a statutory obligation to provide a surety bond to Deptford pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Oral argument on Harleysville\u2019s motion was heard by the trial judge on October 1, 2001. The motion hearing involved discussion about who ultimately would pay plaintiffs for any recovery against Deptford. Lexington argued that it had paid its policy limits for the settlement and had no further obligations to plaintiffs on behalf of Deptford. Harleysville disagreed, citing the surety statute. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel expressed a lack of concern about who would pay, as long as plaintiffs received the agreed settlement on behalf of Girone and Lexington, plus any verdict they might recover against Deptford. The judge granted Harleysville\u2019s motion to intervene but severed its coverage claims against Lexington from plaintiffs\u2019 negligence action and reserved decision on the Harleysville and Deptford motions on coverage until after the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 case was tried in early October 2001. Deptford was the only participating defendant. At the end of plaintiffs case-inehief, the judge granted Deptford\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 contract claims, but denied Deptford\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The jury answered special interrogatories, finding that: (1) after the fireworks display, the unexploded firework created a dangerous condition at Fasola Park; (2) the dangerous condition was a proximate cause of Brenden\u2019s accident; (3) the dangerous condition created a foreseeable risk of injury; (4) Deptford\u2019s action or inaction was palpably unreasonable; (5) Girone was negligent; (6) Girone\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of Brenden\u2019s injuries; (7) Brenden was negligent; and (8) Brenden\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of his own injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The jury awarded total damages of $1.6 million, assessing comparative responsibility at <em>56% </em>against Deptford, <em>33% </em>against Girone (the non-participating defendant), and 11% as Brenden\u2019s contributory negligence. The judge molded the damages award and entered judgment of $896,000 against Deptford and $528,000 against Girone.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Harleysville then filed a motion for summary judgment on its cross-claim against Lexington for coverage. Harleysville argued that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5, as interpreted in <em>Cruz-Mendez v. ISU/Insurance Services of San Francisco, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>556, 722 A.2d 515 (1999), required Lexington to pay up to the limits of the surety bond to plaintiffs on behalf of Deptford before satisfying any claim or settlement as to Girone.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">After extensive argument, the trial judge vacated the $977,300 settlement between plaintiffs, Girone, and Lexington on the ground that the settlement was entered into under a mistake of fact. The judge held that the $952,300 paid to plaintiffs by Lexington under the voided settlement was actually paid first on behalf of Deptford, and that Deptford was entitled to satisfaction of the $896,000 verdict entered against it. Deptford therefore owed plaintiffs nothing more. Finally, the judge entered judgment against Girone for $609,043.65, pursuant to the jury verdict. The judge reasoned that posting the Lexington liability insurance policy issued to Girone in lieu of a bond satisfied the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 and did not affect the coverage owed to Girone under the same insurance policy, that is, that the Lexington policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>was actually two policies. Finally, the judge directed Lexington to reimburse Harleysville for 50% of the reasonable costs and fees incurred in defense of Deptford at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to consolidate the several appeals arising out of the Law Division orders. In an unpublished decision, we held that it was error to set aside the settlement. We also affirmed the judge\u2019s ruling that Lexington was liable for half of Deptford\u2019s defense fees and costs up to the date of the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The majority of the panel reversed the judgment against Dept-ford, holding that it was immune under the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-4. The dissent, however, would have rejected Dept-ford\u2019s claim of immunity and ordered entry of judgment on the jury verdict against Deptford. The dissent also addressed the surety and coverage questions, which were not reached by the majority in light of its reversal of the judgment against Deptford.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The Supreme Court reversed on the Tort Claims Act immunity. <em>Smith v. Fireworks by Girone, Inc., supra, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>at 203, 850 A.2d 456. In a five-to-two ruling, the Court reinstated the verdict against Deptford, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">[W]hen a public entity creates or suffers a dangerous condition on public property that leads ineluctably and foreseeably to injury, it is not insulated from liability under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:4-2, even if the ultimate injury takes place off the public site at a point at which the public premises is no longer dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">[Id at 217, 850 A.2d 456.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">The Court thereafter remanded the surety and coverage issues for our consideration. 182 <em>N.J. </em>138, 861 A.2d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">Lexington argues that the trial judge erred (1) \u201cin ruling that the pre-trial payment of $952,300 to [Brenden] was paid on behalf of ... Deptford;\u201d (2) in entering \u201cjudgment against Girone in the amount of $609,043.65;\u201d (3) \u201cin ruling that Lexington breached its duty of good faith to protect ... Deptford;\u201d (4) in holding that the Lexington policy was \u201cby operation of law converted into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>separate bond with an additional limit of liability ..., thereby increasing the limits from $1 million to $2 million;\u201d and (5) in failing to acknowledge that \u201cthe single satisfaction doctrine bars any further claims against Lexington, either as an insurer or as a surety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Girone argues that the trial judge erred (1) in vacating the settlement; (2) in crediting Lexington\u2019s payment under the settlement to Deptford; and (3) in entering judgment against Girone for the damages awarded by the jury in the trial against Deptford. Girone emphasizes that while it had notice <em>of </em>Deptford\u2019s post-trial motion to determine credit, \u201cit had no notice that the trial court would act <em>sua sponte </em>to void the settlement ... under mistake in fact theory.\u201d Lexington agrees that the Girone commercial liability policy must be deemed a surety bond, but nevertheless argues that creating a surety bond out of the policy cannot add an additional $1 million limit of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Consistent with their pre-trial argument on the coverage motions, plaintiffs argue (1) that they are entitled to retain the settlement paid by Lexington on behalf of Girone; (2) that they are also entitled to payment on the judgment against Deptford, reflecting the jury\u2019s verdict; and (3) that the question of who pays the judgment is not plaintiffs\u2019 concern.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs contend in their cross-appeal that the judge erred by vacating the settlement and by triggering the surety provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They argue that the statutory surety and the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Cruz-Mendez, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 556, 722 A.2d 515, are inapplicable when direct liability is assessed against a public entity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>for its own negligent acts, rather than vicarious liability for the acts of the fireworks exhibitor. Plaintiffs argue that the surety was not triggered because their injuries did not arise from the acts of Girone, its agents, employees, or subcontractors. Not surprisingly, Lexington supports these arguments in its reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Deptford argues in response to Lexington\u2019s appeal (1) that the Law Division judge properly ruled that the money Lexington paid in settlement of plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Girone was required first to satisfy the surety obligation to Deptford; (2) that Deptford is therefore entitled to a credit for the full limit of its policy; (3) that Lexington breached its duty of good faith by obtaining a release of its direct liability as surety without obtaining a release for Dept-ford; and (4) that Lexington\u2019s obligation to Deptford is independent of any obligation to plaintiffs resulting from their settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Harleysville\u2019s argument largely mirrors Deptford\u2019s, with the additional argument that the Lexington surety obligation imposed by <em>Cruz-Mendez, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 574, 722 A.2d 515, and by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 for \u201call damages ... caused ... by reason of the display ... and arising from any acts of the licensee\u201d includes Deptford\u2019s liability for its own negligence as well as its vicarious liability for Girone\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">We first address the question whether the trial court erred in concluding that because the surety required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 (as a condition of obtaining the required license to perform a fireworks display) was fulfilled by the Lexington policy issued to Girone, Lexington\u2019s payment to plaintiffs in exchange for a release in favor of Girone and Lexington must be applied first as a credit against Deptford\u2019s liability on plaintiffs\u2019 judgment. We conclude that the judge correctly determined that the Lexington policy constituted the statutory surety, and that as surety, Lexington\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>first duty was to protect Deptford from liability on the judgment in favor of plaintiffs, thereby protecting plaintiffs as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In reaching this decision, we have considered the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 as well as relevant case law. We begin with the statute itself, last amended in 1946:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">The governing body of the municipality shall require surety which may be cash, government bonds, personal bond, or other form of insurance in a sum of not less than twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500.00),[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] conditioned for the payment of all damages, which may be caused either to a person or persons or to property, by reason of the display so as aforesaid licensed, and arising from any acts of the licensee, his agents, employees or subcontractors. Such surety shall run to the municipality in which the license is granted, and shall be for the use and benefit of any person, persons, or the owner or owners of any property so damaged, who is or are authorized to maintain an action thereon, or his or their heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The law respecting fireworks displays was first enacted in 1930, when the Legislature declared that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful to manufacture, sell, transport or use dangerous fireworks within the state.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:2-6. However, because of the large number of fireworks accidents that continued even after enactment of the prohibition, the Director of the State Department of Health in 1936 called for a more comprehensive state plan governing fireworks. J. Lynn Mahaffey, M.D., \u201cState-Wide Ban on Fireworks,\u201d <em>N.J. Municipalities, </em>Oct. 1936, at 14-15. The Director suggested two courses of action: regulating the use of fireworks and prohibiting the use of fireworks \u201cexcept in the hands of experts and by special permission of some local government agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">In 1937, as part of a comprehensive enactment, the Legislature declared that \u201c[t]he sale, exposure for sale, use, distribution or possession of fireworks or pyrotechnics [is] against the public health, safety and welfare of the people of the [S]tate of New Jersey,\u201d and is illegal. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-1, -2. The Legislature created an exception for public displays of fireworks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The governing body of any municipality, other than a county, notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter to the contrary, may, upon application in writing, <em>upon the posting of a suitable bond, </em>grant a permit for the purchase, possession and public display of fireworks by municipalities, religious, fraternal or civic organizations, fair associations, amusement parks, or other organizations or groups of individuals, approved by the governing body of such municipality to whom the application is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-3 (emphasis added.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">When originally enacted in 1937, the requirements of \u201ca suitable bond\u201d were described in <em>L. </em>1937, c. 51, \u00a7 5 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5) as follows: \u201c[t]he governing body of the municipality shall require a bond deemed adequate by the municipality from the licensee in a sum not less than twenty-five hundred dollars conditioned for the payment of all damages----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 was amended by <em>L. </em>1946, c. 81, \u00a7 1 to its present form. The legislative history of the 1946 amendment provides that \u201c[t]he purpose of this act is to regulate the posting of bonds or other collateral with municipalities, wherein public fireworks displays are held.\u201d Senate Bill No. 42 (N.J. Jan. 21,1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Two reported cases in New Jersey have addressed the fireworks surety requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5. In <em>McBride v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>128 <em>N.J.L. </em>64, 65, 23 A.2d 596 (E. &amp; A.1942), the Court of Errors and Appeals addressed the 1937 version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5. The Court affirmed the trial judge\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff, who was injured when a rocket exploded at a public fireworks display, \u201cwas under no obligation to prove negligence or fault on the part of [the exhibitor] to entitle her to recover from the Maryland Casualty Company which executed the bond in question.\u201d 128 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 66, 23 A.2d 596. The Court interpreted the bond as authorizing a direct action against the surety regardless of fault and without first obtaining a judgment against the fireworks exhibitor for negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 67-68, 23 A.2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Our decision with respect to Lexington\u2019s obligation as surety is informed by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion\u2019in <em>Cruz-Mendez, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 570-74, 722 A.2d 515. In that case, the Court addressed the current version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5, which allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\u201ccash, government bonds, personal bond, or other form of insurance\u201d to satisfy the bond requirement, and ruled that a fireworks contractor may use its general liability insurance policy to satisfy its obligation to post a surety bond as a condition of obtaining a license for the display, required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5. <em>Cruz-Mendez, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 570-73, 722 A.2d 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In <em>Cruz-Mendez, </em>the adult plaintiff was a golf club groundskeeper. He was injured when he lit an unspent firework that he found in a golf cart on the grounds, five days after a display that Girone had conducted for the club. <em>Id. </em>at 562, 722 A.2d 515. Girone was the fireworks exhibitor that had contracted with the golf club to undertake the display. <em>Ibid. </em>In accordance with their contract, Girone obtained a general liability insurance policy with limits of $2 million in the aggregate and $1 million for each occurrence. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 722 A.2d 515. The policy named the golf club and the township as additional insureds, in part to meet the condition of obtaining a license permitting the display. <em>Ibid. </em>The policy was a \u201cstandard policy issued to members of the American Pyrotechnic Association!:,]\u201d including Girone. <em>Ibid. </em>Like the Lexington policy involved here, the policy language described its coverage as general liability insurance; it was not labeled as a surety bond. <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The plaintiff in <em>Cruz-Mendez </em>filed a negligence complaint against the golf club and Girone, and then filed a second complaint alleging strict liability directly against the insurer on the insurance policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 156 <em>N.J. </em>at 565, 722 A.2d 515. The Court reaffirmed the holding of <em>McBride </em>that an injured party can maintain a direct action against the insurer of a fireworks exhibitor (whose policy served as surety) without proof of the exhibitor\u2019s fault. <em>Id. </em>at 567-68, 722 A.2d 515. The Court expressly noted that \u201c[f)or over half a century, fireworks exhibitors and their insurers have known that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 and its predecessor have authorized an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>injured party to maintain a direct action against the insurer of a fireworks exhibitor without proof of the exhibitor\u2019s fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 722 A.2d 515.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Particularly relevant to the issue before us is Justice Pollock\u2019s explanation in <em>Cruz-Mendez </em>that by replacing the word \u201cbond\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 with the phrase \u201csurety which may be cash, government bonds, personal bond, or other form of insurance,\u201d the Legislature \u201cexpand[ed] the permissible forms of surety instruments beyond bonds.\u201d 156 <em>N.J. </em>at 568, 722 A.2d 515. The Court addressed the fact that a traditional surety instrument protects a party to the instrument itself, whereas the statutory surety under the fireworks law protects the municipality that issues the license as well as members of the public who may be injured as a result of the display. <em>Id. </em>at 569-70, 722 A.2d 515.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">In one respect, the surety instrument mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 differs from a traditional surety contract. Traditional suretyship expressly recognizes that the obligee may maintain a direct action under the contract against the surety. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5, by comparison, the injured party is not a party to the surety contract. The statute, however, fills the gap by expanding the class of obligees to include persons injured by the fireworks exhibit. Specifically, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 provides that the surety <em>\u201cshall run to the municipality in which the license is granted, and shall be for the use and benefit of any person ... so damaged.\u201d </em>The statute, however, does not otherwise alter the suretyship contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\"><em>[Ibid </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Thereafter, the Court, declaring that \u201can insurance policy issued to satisfy a statutory requirement for a suretyship should be liberally construed to effectuate the statutory purpose,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 572, 722 A.2d 515, determined that Girone\u2019s \u201cpolicy should be construed to provide the required protection of the public against injury or damage from a fireworks display that the Legislature has deemed a threat to the public\u2019s health, safety and welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 722 A.2d 515. The Court\u2019s reasoning was that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>legislative recognition of the dangers of fireworks, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-1, led to the imposition of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">the surety requirement as part of an overall regulatory scheme to protect the public from a highly dangerous activity____A fireworks exhibitor \u201cis charged with knowledge that if injury ensues he will have acted at his peril.\u201d [N.J.S.A. 21:3-5] requires exhibitors to obtain insurance policies under which their insurers are strictly liable for injuries caused by fireworks displays. <em>The cost of the risk of a fireworks display is thus borne not by the public, but by the exhibitors and their insurers.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 573-74, 722 A.2d 515 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">In other words, even the cost of insuring against damage is to be borne by the commercial enterprise that stands to profit from the dangerous fireworks business, not by the municipality. That rationale is relevant to the decision we reach, because to require Lexington to cover the judgment against Deptford as surety, without resort to Deptford\u2019s own liability policy, protects the municipality against increased costs of, and perhaps reduced ability to obtain, liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">We next address the settlement between plaintiffs, Girone, and Lexington. The issue that we confront here, the effect of the implied-in-law surety contract upon the insurer\u2019s obligation to its named insured and to plaintiff (under a settlement which did not include the municipality) did not arise in <em>Cruz-Mendez. </em>After the jury verdict here, the Law Division judge vacated the pre-trial settlement on the ground that there had been a mutual mistake of fact. We are satisfied that there was no mistake or other circumstance that justified the court in vacating the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">It is well established that the public policy of this State favors settlement of litigation. <em>Herrera v. Tp. of South Orange Village, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>417, 424, 637 A.2d 526 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>28, 641 A.2d 1039 (1994). A court may <em>vacate a </em>settlement agreement only upon a showing of fraud or compelling circumstances by clear and convincing proof. <em>Nolan by Nolan v. Lee Ho, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>465, 472, 577 A.2d 143 (1990). Compelling circumstances include \u201cmutual mistake, undue haste, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>pressure or unseemly conduct in settlement negotiations.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Corp. v. Tp. of Morris, </em>19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>319, 322 (2000). <em>See Lampley v. Davis Mach. Corp., </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 549, 530 A.2d 1254 (App.Div.1987) (a settlement is voidable by the disadvantaged party when there has been a mutual mistake \u201cas to a basic assumption on which the contract was made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The basic rule is that where an insurance company has settled a claim based upon a mistake of fact, even a unilateral mistake, it is entitled to relief in the absence of prejudice to the payee. <em>See Young v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>80 <em>N.J.Super. </em>582, 586-87, 194 A.2d 488 (App.Div.1963); <em>see also Villanueva v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 286-91, 864 A.2d 428 (App.Div.2005). Judge Conford, writing for this court in <em>Young, </em>concluded that when a payment of insurance proceeds is induced by a mistake of fact, the insurer can rescind the settlement as long as the settling claimant would not be prejudiced thereby. <em>Young, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585-86, 194 A.2d 488. In <em>Young, </em>Judge Conford followed the rationale previously expressed in <em>Great American Insurance Co. v. Yellen, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 156 A.2d 36 (App.Div.1959), where the insurer had rejected, but later mistakenly paid a claim as a result of a clerical error. <em>Id. </em>at 242-44, 156 A.2d 36. \u201c[O]ne who has paid money under a mistake of fact but for which payment would not have been made may have restitution from the payee notwithstanding that the mistake was unilateral and a consequence of the payor\u2019s negligence, <em>providing, however, that such restitution will not prejudice the payee.\u201d Id. </em>at 244, 156 A.2d 36 (emphasis added). Because the facts relevant to the issue of prejudice were not yet known, the matter was remanded for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 156 A.2d 36. <em>See also Hamel v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 506-08, 559 A.2d 455 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Here, however, plaintiffs, as well as Lexington\u2019s insured, Girone, clearly would be prejudiced if the settlement were to be vacated. Girone did not participate in the trial of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and cannot be bound by the jury\u2019s verdict (which, as it happens, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>less than the settlement). For their part, plaintiffs tried their case against Deptford alone, and should not be burdened with the expense and delay of a retrial. Additionally, a structured payout of the settlement was approved by the Court, and presumably has been executed. Prejudice to both parties is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Moreover, there is an exception to the general rule set forth in <em>Young </em>and <em>Yellen </em>in circumstances \u201cwhere the insurance company deliberately elects to make payment of a claim on a policy although it is conscious that it does not know all the facts material to its liability to the payee.\u201d <em>Yellen, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 245, 156 A.2d 36. Here, the \u201cmistake of fact\u201d found by the trial judge and cited in the order vacating settlement apparently was Lexington\u2019s status as surety for the fireworks display and its resulting legal obligations to Deptford and to plaintiffs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But the record is amply clear: in light of the 1999 Supreme Court decision in <em>Cruz-Mendez, </em>Lexington had to be aware when it settled plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Girone, as well as plaintiffs\u2019 direct claim against Lexington, that at the very least, there was an open question whether Deptford\u2019s own insurer, Harleysville, and not Lexington itself, would be primarily responsible for paying any judgment against Deptford. <em>See Cruz-Mendez, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 569-70, 722 A.2d 515. Indeed, Lexington\u2019s awareness of its exposure to a direct claim evidences recognition of its liability under the surety statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5, and the holding of <em>Cruz-Mendez. </em>Yet Lexington chose to go ahead with the settlement with plaintiffs, knowing that it did not know two significant facts \u2014 the outcome of the trial and the outcome of the coverage dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">By choosing to settle plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Girone (and itself) with full knowledge that the outcome of the jury trial against Deptford, as well as the outcome of the surety coverage dispute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>remained unresolved, Lexington placed itself within the exception described in <em>Yellen, supra, 58 N.J.Super. </em>at 245, 156 A.2d 36, and <em>Villanueva, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 287, 864 A.2d 428. There was no question that the settlement was intended to be final as between plaintiffs, Girone, and Lexington. It was not conditioned upon the outcome of the trial or the resolution of the surety issue that had been raised by Deptford. Prior to trial, Harleysville moved to intervene in order to pursue the coverage dispute. In the course of addressing that motion, as well as several in limine motions just before choosing a jury, the trial judge explicitly preserved the coverage dispute for resolution after the scheduled trial of plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Deptford. Counsel for Lexington raised no objection, and did not attempt to argue that the settlement was contingent about the resolution of Deptford\u2019s coverage. Lexington has no right to withdraw from the settlement it made with awareness that subsequent determinations could affect its position. There was no mistake of fact, but only a mistake of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Several additional factors support the result we reach here. <em>McBride </em>and the fireworks statutes, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-1 to -5, have been known to the fireworks industry as well as to the insurance industry serving those who sell and operate fireworks. Lexington had issued a similar policy to Girone in at least one previous year, and had on more than one occasion issued a Certificate of Insurance naming another municipality, where Girone was to conduct a fireworks display, as an \u201cadditional insured\u201d on a general liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">As the Court noted in <em>Cruz-Mendez, </em>where Girone\u2019s insurance policy was issued by a different carrier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">Girone conducts ninety percent of its fireworks displays in New Jersey. Furthermore, the Insurers revised the Certificate of Insurance specifically to include the Township as an \u201cAdditional Insured.\u201d To suggest that the Insurers did not realize that they were issuing the policy to satisfy the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 is to ignore both the sophistication of the insurance industry and the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZV\">[156 <em>N.J. </em>at 572, 722 A.2d 515],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">We do not suggest that an insurer who issues a commercial general liability policy will be at risk as a surety whenever its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>insured undertakes to provide a third party with surety. The facts here are unique, involving as they do an insured in the business of manufacturing and conducting fireworks displays, which requires a municipal permit that in turn mandates surety as a condition of its issuance. Our holding, however, is based upon the conduct of the insurer which knew its role as surety and failed to act in good faith to protect the parties for whose benefit the suretyship was created. When Lexington chose to accept a release in its own favor and in favor of its named insured, without first protecting Deptford, it violated its duty as a surety and thereby exposed itself to a risk arguably greater than that which it originally undertook. Had there been no settlement, and had trial proceeded against Deptford and Girone, Lexington might well have been successful in limiting its overall liability to $1 million\u2014 to be paid out first to satisfy Deptford\u2019s judgment debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In holding Lexington liable for fulfilling its settlement on behalf of Girone, as well as covering the judgment against Deptford, we do not suggest that adding Deptford as an additional insured necessarily created a second policy that effectively doubled the aggregate coverage. Our holding is based upon the fact that Lexington, as surety, knowingly put Deptford at risk by first entering into a separate settlement with plaintiffs. There is no unfairness in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">We reverse the order vacating the settlement, reinstate the order approving the settlement, vacate the judgment against Girone, and remand for entry of an order requiring Lexington to pay the judgment against Deptford.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-12\"> The coverage provided to Deptford by means of the Lexington policy, naming it as an \"additional insured,\u201d arguably did not comply with Girone\u2019s contractual obligation to provide \"Insurance In the Sum of $2,000,000.00 Naming 'DEPT-FORD FUN DAY\u2019 as additional insured.\u201d No party has presented that argument, and we therefore do not address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-12\"> $952,300 was allocated to Brenden and $25,000 to his mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-13\"> Deptford had its own $1 million primary general liability policy with Harleysville, as well as a separate $4 million umbrella policy issued by Harleysville.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b311-15\"><em> </em>The judge who approved the settlement was not the same judge who subsequently tried the case against Deptford and later vacated the settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b311-16\"> That statute, part of the Tort Claims Act, is actually a form of collateral source rule that has not been argued in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\"> Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel maintained in the January 11, 2002 argument on the coverage motions, that he did not care who paid the judgment on behalf of Deptford, as that was not his problem, but that the Lexington payment did not satisfy the judgment against Deptford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> We infer that plaintiffs' argument against Lexington\u2019s role as surety reflects a concern that if the Lexington settlement payment is applied first to its surely obligation to Deptford, the settlement will be vacated or the policy limits exhausted, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b317-10\"> The statute requiring a $2,500 minimum surety bond has never been amended to reflect present-day financial conditions, but municipalities such as Dept-ford obviously have required significantly higher coverage. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-3 (requiring a \"suitable bond\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\"> The claim against the golf club was dismissed because the plaintiff had received workers' compensation benefits. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\"> In addition, the Court held that in order to prevail against the surety, the plaintiff must make a showing of proximate causation. <em>Id. </em>at 574-76, 722 A.2d 515.

Fireworks by Girone, Inc., </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>138, 861 A.2d 843 (2004). Plaintiff had settled with Fireworks by Girone and Lexington for $977,300 under its general accident policy before the trial against Deptford which resulted in a $1,600,000 verdict (apportioned 56% against Deptford, 33% against Girone and 11% against the plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">On this appeal, Lexington argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in ruling that the pre-trial payment of $952,300 to plaintiff, Brendan Wasniewski was paid on behalf of defendant Township of Dept-ford\u201d and in ruling \u201cthat Lexington breached its duty of good faith to protect the Township of Deptford, leaving \u2018Deptford out to dry\u2019 that \u201cthe Lexington policy was not, by operation of law, converted into a separate bond with an additional limit of liability of one million dollars, thereby increasing the limits from $1 million to $2 million,\u201d and that \u201cthe single satisfaction doctrine bars any further claims against Lexington, either as an insurer or a surety.\u201d In essence, Lexington asserts that it has satisfied its obligation resulting from Brendan\u2019s tragic injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Plaintiff as cross-appellant contends that \u201cthe trial court erred in vacating the settlement between plaintiffs and defendants Girone and Lexington,\u201d that \u201cdefendant Deptford is not entitled to use the pretrial payment from Lexington to plaintiffs as a credit towards its portion of the verdict,\u201d and that \u201cany disputes regarding insurance coverage are between Deptford and Lexington and do not affect plaintiffs\u2019 settlement with Girone and Lexington or plaintiffs\u2019 judgment against Deptford\u201d.

Deptford similarly argues that its obligation has been properly satisfied because the trial judge was correct in ruling that Lexington\u2019s payment must be deemed to have been made in satisfaction of plaintiffs judgment against the Township \u2014 a view which Harleysville shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The trial judge\u2019s view that the settlement had to be vacated based on a \u201cmistake of fact\u201d has some appeal, but no party before us supports that conclusion. Given the policy favoring settlements, as articulated by the majority, and the fact that no party to the settlement seeks its vacation, which would require yet another trial, I join my colleagues in reversing the order vacating the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">My colleagues\u2019 position, which requires Lexington to honor the judgment against Deptford, is reasonable. Lexington was fully aware of Deptford\u2019s contention that Lexington had an obligation to defend and indemnify it on the plaintiffs claim (because Lexington was surety and, independently, because Deptford was an \u201cadditional insured\u201d on the Lexington policy), but settled in disregard and breach of that obligation, and therefore assumed the risk of any recovery by plaintiff against Deptford. But plaintiff also understood the legal issues flowing from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 as well as the Tort Claims Act, and nevertheless released Lexington in accepting a settlement with it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, I am concerned that in settling with Girone and Lexington, plaintiff \u2014 also aware or charged with knowledge of the surety statute and the law concerning the surety\u2019s obligation \u2014 can be said to have released Lexing<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ton, and discharged it from its obligation as carrier and surety with respect to plaintiffs claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The trial court held that Lexington was liable under the surety bond to protect Deptford (on its obligation to plaintiff) prior to protecting Girone on its liability to plaintiff. As a result, the judge voided the settlement as a \u201cmistake of fact,\u201d ordered Lexington to pay the $896,000 portion of the judgment allocated to Deptford (leaving no balance to that judgment), and entered judgment against Girone for its allocated amount of $528,000 plus interest (ultimately amended to $659,000), minus the $104,000 balance on the policy which was given as a credit to Girone. The judge also found that the bond, required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5, did not replace Girone\u2019s liability policy,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and directed Lexington to reimburse Harleysville for the costs of defending Deptford. In essence, the judge treated the plaintiff as protected by Lexington\u2019s liability policy issued to Girone and to Deptford as \u201cadditional insured,\u201d and separately under a surety bond issued pursuant to statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">But while the statute requires issuance of the bond or other coverage to protect an injured person, it expressly permits \u2014 as <em>Cruz-Mendez v. ISU/Insurance Services of San Francisco, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>556, 722 A.2d 515 (1999), recognizes \u2014 that the liability policy can serve as the surety bond, so long as the required statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>coverage is provided. <em>Cruz-Mendez, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 568, 572-73, 722 A.2d 515. Here, there is no genuine dispute that the liability policy, which included Deptford as an \u201cadditional insured,\u201d provided that protection, and that the policy was issued for the specific Deptford exhibition on display. I find it significant that there is no contention that Lexington did not deliver to Deptford a surety bond, or policy, satisfying its statutory obligation of \u201cnot less than twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500.00),\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5, and no contention by Deptford, or plaintiff as third party beneficiary, that Girone did not satisfy its contractual obligation to provide the coverage it contracted to provide. Nevertheless, the trial court treated Lexington as having issued a policy and separate surety bond, each giving the plaintiff $1,000,000 in protection, as opposed to a policy with $1,000,000 in coverage for \u201ceach occurrence,\u201d which provided the protection the statute was designed to assure. In this regard, I believe the trial court was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">I join the majority in reversing the order vacating the settlement and in remanding for entry of judgment requiring Lexington to pay the judgment against Deptford as well as the settlement. The majority does so because of Lexington\u2019s conduct as surety when it \u201cfailed to act in good faith to protect the parties for whose benefit the surety was created.\u201d Op. at 295, 881 A.2d at 1256. The majority thus finds that by accepting \u201ca release in its own favor and in favor of its named insured, without first protecting Deptford, [Lexington] violated its duty as surety and thereby exposed itself to a risk arguably greater than it originally undertook.\u201d Op. at 295, 881 A.2d at 1256. I need not go that far or necessarily find a breach of Lexington\u2019s duty as surety obligated to protect the injured member of the public. I would hold, substantially for the reasons stated by the majority, that Lexington breached the fiduciary duty it owed to Deptford as an \u201cadditional insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\"><em>Cruz-Mendez </em>permits injured persons to bring direct actions against the surety. <em>Cruz-Mendez, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 567-68, 722 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>A.2d 515. It held \u201cthat plaintiff may maintain a direct cause of action under the policy against the Insurers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 722 A.2d 515. <em>See also </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 570, 722 A.2d 515 (\u201cconclud[ing] that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5 requires an exhibitor applying for a permit to conduct a fireworks display to obtain a surety instrument providing for action against the insurer\u201d). The carrier is not required to issue a bond separate from an insurance policy which satisfies the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 567-68, 722 A.2d 515. Among its claims plaintiff brought a direct claim against Lexington, and released Lexington knowing it was a surety when it settled with Lexington and its insured, Girone, under the policy. Thus, as a direct defendant, Lexington could satisfy its statutory obligation by settling the action on behalf of itself as surety and its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The question is really whether the plaintiff\u2019s release of the surety ends Lexington\u2019s contractual and legal obligations in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">There is some basis for ruling that plaintiff understood the impact of the statute when she voluntarily settled her claims against Girone and Lexington, as surety, and thereby effectively released Deptford, which the statute was also designed to protect. But the settlement proceedings seemed to make clear that the direct claims remained for resolution against Deptford, and no one suggested at the time of settlement that the complaint would be dismissed against the Township. To the contrary, when the settlement was placed on the record in the presence of all the parties, plaintiff was told that while she could not recover anything further from Girone and Lexington, she \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cmay not\u201d collect from Deptford depending on the result of a possible \u201csettlement\u201d or \u201ctrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We might also consider holding that Deptford and its carrier, Harleysville, should be liable for the judgment against Deptford because neither affirmatively asked that the settlement be rejected if it did not include Deptford, thereby affecting the available balance of the $1,000,000 coverage for the single occurrence (and because Deptford did not contend that the statute or its contract were not satisfied by the policy issued). But the record does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>suggest that either Deptford or Harleysville acquiesced in the settlement to the detriment of the municipality in the event of an adverse judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">I join the majority in holding that Lexington must both honor the settlement and pay the judgment against Deptford, aggregating $1,873,000, which plaintiff obtained through negotiations and trial, notwithstanding the settlement with Lexington. I do so because Deptford was made an \u201cadditional insured\u201d to which its carrier still owed a fiduciary obligation and not because the surety could not otherwise settle directly with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">I am satisfied to concur in the judgment of my colleagues because the policy in question served to both insure Girone and provide the surety obligation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>21:3-5. Whether it had to do so or not, the policy named Deptford as an \u201cadditional insured.\u201d And while the settlement may well have been made to protect Girone from being exposed to a verdict above the policy limits, Lexington had the same obligation to protect Deptford as its \u201cadditional insured.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of America, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 489-93, 323 A.2d 495 (1974) (imposing on insurer \u201cthe most urgent duty to act in good faith and with diligence in attempting to arrange a possible settlement\u201d given the factors of the case). <em>See also Webb v. Witt, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 24, 876 A.2d 858 (App.Div.2005) (\u201c[i]n discussing insurers\u2019 duties to their insureds, the case law does not distinguish between named insureds and additional insureds\u201d). This it did not do. Simply stated, Lexington left its \u201cadditional insured\u201d without coverage, as the policy limits had almost been exhausted as a result of the settlement. By settling with plaintiff on behalf of itself and Girone, Lexington knew, or should have known, the risks it was taking in light of its obligation to Deptford as an \u201cadditional insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">I therefore concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\"> I recognize that plaintiff apparently did not receive copies of Harleysville's letters, as Deptford\u2019s liability carrier, objecting to the settlement. In fact, Harleysville sought a defense from Lexington and a declaration that Lexington was obligated to pay the limits of the bond on behalf of Deptford before satisfying the liability of Girone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\"> In the briefs before us no party suggested a factual dispute as to the intent of the settlement or the need for a plenary hearing, although the question was considered at argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"> The judge stated that Lexington \"put up Deptford\u2019s money\u201d and that the settlement proceeds were \"paid by Lexington on behalf of Girone, when really it was paid by Lexington for Deptford, unbeknownst to Deptford and Lexington.\" The judge also found that, \"by making Deptford an additional insured, it created an additional/million dollars surety bond ... to conform to the statute.\u201d The parties disagree as to whether Lexington was ordered to pay the excess above the $104,000 balance on the policy, in light of the conclusion that Lexington\u2019s bond did not affect its obligation to Girone as its insured. In no event can judgment be entered against Girone for an amount determined at a trial in which it did not participate due to the settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\"> Lexington did protect Deptford to the extent plaintiff agreed that it would not seek to collect above Deptford's coverage through Harleysville.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
