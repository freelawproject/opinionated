N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>193, 881 A.2d 770 (App.Div.2005). The question is whether the C-5 exclusion in an employer\u2019s liability policy, applicable to certain employee \u201cintentional wrong\u201d claims, excludes coverage here. In <em>Charles Beseler, </em>on facts almost identical to those before us, we recently held that the C-5 exclusion for claims of \u201cbodily injury intentionally caused\u201d did not exclude coverage for claims alleging bodily injury that resulted from employer conduct that was \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to result in injury, and ordered the insurer to provide coverage. We adhere to that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">In this declaratory judgment action brought by New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Co. (NJM) with respect to a policy issued to defendants Delta Plastics Corporation and Flexsol Packaging Corp.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter jointly referred to as \u201cDelta Plastics\u201d), the Law Division judge granted NJM\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that the C-5 exclusion applied and NJM was not required to provide Delta with a defense to its employee\u2019s complaint. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">These are the background facts as they appear in the record. Alexis Attune, an employee of Delta Plastics, suffered bodily injury on the job while working on certain film winding equipment. NJM assumed Delta\u2019s defense on Attune\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>claim and paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits as a result of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Attune then filed a complaint against various entities allegedly involved in the design, manufacture, sale, distribution, installation, repair, maintenance, or modification of the machinery. As to those defendants, Attune alleged defective design, lack of \u201cadequate safety mechanisms\u201d to prevent the machine from catching \u201cclothing or limb,\u201d lack of sufficient guards, lack of \u201can emergency shut-off ... adjacent to its moving parts,\u201d and a design that permitted use \u201cwithout proper safety mechanism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Attune also named Delta and Flexsol, alleging as to those defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">4. Defendant Delta acted in an <em>intentional </em>or otherwise grossly negligent[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] manner by providing the defective machine and rendered the machine unsafe by altering the machine and rendering it unsafe [sic], and requiring plaintiff to work under conditions that produced a <em>substantial certainty </em>that plaintiff would sustain injury, which conduct of defendant Delta was a proximate cause of the above mentioned injuries to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">5. On information and belief defendant Flexsol Packaging Corp. is the successor to defendant Delta and is liable for the conduct of that defendant which caused injury to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Thus Attune initially sought to avoid the workers\u2019 compensation bar, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8, by alleging \u201cintentional\u201d conduct and a \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d of injury. It is undisputed that Attune never alleged that Delta or its employees subjectively intended to cause him injury, but only that Delta\u2019s conduct in \u201caltering the machine\u201d and requiring him to work on the altered machine created circumstances that were \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to result in iiy'ury. <em>See Laidlow v. Hariton Mach. Co., Inc., </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>602, 790 A.2d 884 (2002); <em>Millison, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>161, 501 A.2d 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>NJM had issued a \u201cWorkers Compensation and Employer\u2019s Liability Insurance Policy\u201d to Delta Plastics covering the period when Attune was injured. That policy, like the policy issued to Charles Beseler, consisted of \u201cPart One \u2014 Workers Compensation Insurance,\u201d and \u201cPart Two \u2014 Employer\u2019s Liability Insurance.\u201d Part Two \u201capplies to bodily injury by accident or bodily injury by disease\u201d where the injury \u201carise[s] out of and in the course of the injured employee\u2019s employment\u201d by the insured. NJM promises in section B of Part Two to \u201cpay all sums [its insured] legally must pay as damages\u201d and \u201cwhere recovery is permitted by law.\u201d Section C of Part Two lists various exclusions, including subsection 4 for \u201cany obligation imposed by a workers\u2019 compensation ... law.\u201d That exclusion mirrors the coverage provided by Part One. Section C also excludes, in sub-section 5 [the C-5 exclusion], \u201cbodily injury intentionally caused or aggravated by [the insured].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In addition, sub-section D of Part Two, entitled \u201cWe Will Defend,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">We have the right and duty to defend, at our expense, any claim, proceeding or suit against you for damages payable by this insurance. We have the right to investigate and settle these claims, proceedings and suits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\"><em>We, have no duty to defend a claim, proceeding or suit that is not covered, by this insurance. </em>We have no duly to defend or continue defending after we have paid our applicable limit of liability under this insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">NJM denied Delta\u2019s request for a defense to Attune\u2019s complaint, claiming that the C-5 exclusion relieved it of any obligation to indemnify Delta for damages that Attune might recover and therefore relieved it of responsibility for Delta\u2019s defense. NJM brought this declaratory judgment action seeking to determine that it had no obligation to provide Delta with a defense, and moved for summary judgment. Delta Plastics cross-moved for summary judgment. Attune voluntarily dismissed his tort complaint against Delta, with prejudice and without payment of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>After initially denying both parties\u2019 summary judgment motions, the Law Division judge granted NJM\u2019s motion. On the order granting summary judgment, the judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">The Court has reconsidered its analysis of the facts and law and is satisfied that the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Schmidt [v. Smith, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>44, 713 A.2d 1014 (1998),] applied to that set of facts and circumstances involving an LAD claim and was not intended to overrule <em>[N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co. </em>v.] <em>Joseph Oat [Corp., </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 670 A.2d 1071 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>515, 665 A.2d 1108 (1995)]. That being said, plaintiffs claim is excluded by Exclusion C-5. That C-5 is a valid and enforceable exclusion. The public policy motivating the decision in <em>Schmidt </em>of ensuring insurance coverage for all work related bodily injury claims is unaffected by denying coverage to plaintiff\u2019s intentional-wrong claim since plaintiff is receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits for this injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The judge thereafter denied Delta\u2019s motion for reconsideration for \u201cfailure to meet requirements of <em>[Rule] </em>4:49-2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">On appeal, Delta argues: \u201cPursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Schmidt, </em>the coverage which NJM refused to provide to Delta Plastics was, in fact, mandated by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u201d; and \u201cregardless of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schmidt v. Smith, </em>general principles of insurance law relating to the coverage obligations of an insurer clearly suggest that NJM had a duty to afford coverage to Delta Plastics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">In response, NJM argues: \u201cPursuant to the Appellate Division decision in <em>Joseph Oat, </em>there is no coverage under the policy for an intentional-wrong claim\u201d; \u201cthere is no significant or relevant distinction between an employer\u2019s alleged subjective desire to injure and proof of an employer\u2019s intent to injure under the substantial certainty standard\u201d; \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schmidt v. Smith </em>did not overrule <em>Joseph </em>Oat\u201d; \u201cNew Jersey public policy favors exclusion of insurance coverage for liability arising out of the wrongful intentional acts of the insured\u201d; and \u201cNJM has no duty to defend because there is no obligation to defend when there is no coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">As we said in <em>Charles Beseler, </em>\u201c[w]e conclude that the insured plaintiff is entitled to coverage because there is no assertion that the bodily injury was \u2018intentionally caused or aggravated by\u2019 the insured as opposed to an injury caused by an intentional act of the employer that resulted in the injury.\u201d 380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 198, 881 A.2d 770. Whether or not the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schmidt </em>has implicitly overruled <em>Joseph Oat,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we disagree with <em>Joseph Oat </em>with respect to the scope of the C-5 exclusion of Part Two coverage \u2014 the Employers\u2019 Liability Policy \u2014 and thus the scope of the Part Two coverage here.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The coverage dispute here concerns only the cost of Delta\u2019s defense, which ended when Attune voluntarily dismissed his complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ordinarily, an insurer\u2019s obligation to defend is broader than the obligation to indemnify. <em>Conduit and Found. Corp. v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 105, 746 A.2d 1053 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>135, 754 A.2d 1212 (2000). The duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations of the complaint (not the outcome of that complaint) with the coverage provided by the policy, <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 173-74, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992), and is triggered by a claim which on its face would require indemnification. <em>Id. </em>at 180, 607 A.2d 1255. <em>See also Danek v. Hommer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 77, 100 A.2d 198 (App.Div.1953), <em>aff'd, </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>573, 105 A.2d 677 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>NJM relies upon <em>Joseph Oat </em>in interpreting the C-5 \u201cinjury intentionally caused\u201d policy exclusion as one that excludes the obligation to indemnify the employer irrespective of whether the plaintiff succeeds in avoiding the statutory bar by proof of subjective intent or substantial certainty. Concluding that it has no duty to indemnify in a substantial certainty intentional wrong case, NJM understandably contends it is also relieved of the duty to defend. But we are convinced that the intentional wrong that constitutes an exception to the workers\u2019 compensation bar under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 is broader than the C-5 \u201cinjury intentionally caused\u201d exclusion to Part Two coverage. The boundaries are not coterminous; the \u201cinjury intentionally caused\u201d exclusion is narrower.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">A brief explanation of the intentional wrong exception provides important background. In <em>Laidlow, </em>Justice Long explained the statutory workers\u2019 compensation bar, reviewing the essence of the Court\u2019s prior holding in <em>Millison. Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 605-12, 790 A.2d 884 (citing <em>Millison, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 169-82, 501 A.2d 505). The intentional wrong exception to the workers\u2019 compensation bar includes more than injury resulting from a subjective intent to injure. <em>Id. </em>at 617, 790 A.2d 884. The \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d standard is \u201canother method by which a plaintiff could prove an intentional wrong.\u201d <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 614, 790 A.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">An employee\u2019s common law tort claim against an employer based upon conduct \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to cause injury has two elements. First, the employer must know that the conduct was, objectively, substantially certain to cause injury; second, the injury must be, in the circumstances, \u201cmore than a fact of life of industrial employment,\u201d and the employer\u2019s conduct must be outside the bounds of that which the Legislature intended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 to protect against common law liability. <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 617, 790 A.2d 884. The first element is normally a jury question, whereas the second is \u201csolely a judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 790 A.2d 884. <em>See also Crippen v. Cent. Jersey Concrete Pipe Co., </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>397, 408, 823 A.2d 789 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">As plainly set forth in <em>Laidlow, </em>the intentional wrong exception to the workers\u2019 compensation bar applies both to injuries where the employee alleges conduct by an actor who subjectively intends to cause injury, as well as to injuries where the conduct alleged is of a kind \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to cause injury although injury was not specifically intended. <em>Laidlow </em>involved only the delineation of the statutory intentional wrong that would avoid the workers\u2019 compensation bar and permit a common law tort action. It did not involve any question of insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">We find no reason to conclude that the C-5 \u201cinjury intentionally caused\u201d exclusion from employers\u2019 liability coverage is as broad as the statutory intentional wrong exception. The policy exclusion in our view applies only to injuries subjectively intended by the employer or its agent, a result consonant with the public policy against providing insurance coverage for criminal (specific intent) acts. <em>See Harleysville Ins. Cos. v. Garitta, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>223, 231, 785 A.2d 913 (2001). Were it otherwise (as NJM argues), the C-5 exclusion would come very close to eliminating meaningful Part Two coverage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Several rules of construction support our conclusion. First, policy exclusions are to be construed narrowly in favor of coverage. <em>Butler v. Bonner &amp; Barnewall, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567, 576, 267 A.2d 527 (1970). Second, to the extent that the C-5 exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>drafted by the insurer is ambiguous, it must be construed against the carrier. <em>President v. Jenkins, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>550, 563, 853 A.2d 247 (2004); <em>The Salem Group v. Oliver, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>1, 4, 607 A.2d 138 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The plain language of the policy exclusion is not as clear as NJM suggests and as <em>Joseph Oat </em>held. The exclusion would be unambiguous if it expressly excluded coverage for \u201call intentional wrongs within the exception allowed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8.\u201d It does not. The exclusion therefore cannot fairly be construed to deny coverage where the injured employee\u2019s Law Division complaint alleges conduct that was \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to cause injury, and therefore on its face is not, subjectively, an \u201cinjury intentionally caused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Moreover, even if the language is deemed unambiguous, the reasonable expectations of the insured must be considered. <em>See, e.g., Zacarias v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>590, 595, 775 A.2d 1262 (2001); <em>Salem Group, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 4, 607 A.2d 138; <em>see also Schmidt, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 51, 713 A.2d 1014; <em>Beseler, supra, </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 200, 881 A.2d 770. The essence of the two-part policy, Part One covering workers\u2019 compensation defense and indemnification, and Part Two covering defense and indemnification in other employer liability situations, is seamless coverage. Part Two coverage has been described as a \u201cgap filler.\u201d <em>Schmidt, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 49-50, 713 A.2d 1014. NJM\u2019s interpretation of Part Two would widen rather than fill the gap.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Delta has cited several decisions that are consistent with our conclusion. <em>See Royal Indem. Co. v. Soneco/Northeastern, Inc., </em>183 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>526, 532 (D.Conn.2002) (citing <em>Reliance Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Vitale, </em>183 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>506 (D.Conn.2001)). The employers\u2019 liability policy at issue in <em>Royal </em>and in <em>Reliance </em>contained the same C-5 exclusion we address here. In <em>Reliance, </em>the District Court described the Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation bar, comparable to the <em>Laidlow/Millison </em>interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>[A] plaintiff may escape the exclusivity of the Act and maintain a civil suit against his employer by demonstrating either (1) that the employer intended both the act itself and its injurious consequences (\u201cthe intended tort theory\u201d), or (2) that the employer intended the act and knew that it was substantially certain to cause the injury (\u201cthe substantial certainty theory\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">[183 F.Supp.2d at 510 (citing <em>Suarez v.

That decision certainly should have put insurers on notice that <em>Joseph Oat </em>might not be the final word on the C-5 exclusion. Moreover, the C-5 exclusion appears in similar policies issued in other states, where the scope of coverage is not governed, by <em>Joseph Oat. See, e.g., </em>Reliance; <em>Royal; Travelers, </em>and <em>Cavalier, supra. </em>Thus we do not view insurance company reliance as a persuasive argument for adhering to <em>Joseph Oat.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We subscribe to the explanation of the Court of Appeals of Michigan in <em>Cavalier:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">The conceptual difficulty that bedevils presentation of the present case is attributable to the use of virtually identical terminology in the exclusive remedy provision of the WDCA and in the appellee\u2019s insurance policies to describe two different things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201c[Iintentional tort\u201d as used in \u00a7 131 of the WDCA, as has already been established supra, has two related, but nonetheless distinct, meanings: (1) that of \u201ctrue intentional tort\u201d and (2) that of a legislatively formulated equivalent \u2014 applicable only to establishing tort liability in avoidance of the exclusive remedy provision\u2014 where an employer willfully disregards knowledge of a situation in which injury is \u201ccertain\u201d to occur.

One is the infant employee who is not a party to the statutory workers\u2019 compensation compact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-10; another is the employee who opts out of workers\u2019 compensation coverage, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-9; the third is the \"casual employee,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36. <em>See Cent. Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Utica Nat\u2019l Ins. Group, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 471-72, 557 A.2d 693 (App.Div.1989). But the overwhelming number of employees fall within the scope <em>of N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\"> The Michigan workers' compensation statute\u2019s exclusive remedy provision cited in <em>Cavalier, \u201c </em>\u00a7 131(1) of the WDCA\u201d [Mich. Comp. Laws Serv. \u00a7 418.131(1)], defines the intentional tort exception to include injury \"certain to occur,\" rather than \"substantially certain,\u201d as in the <em>Millison/Laidlow </em>definition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ5\">An intentional tort shall exist only when an employee is injured as a result of a deliberate act of the employer and the employer specifically intended an injury. <em>An employer shall be deemed to have intended to injure if the employer had actual knowledge that an injury was certain to occur and willfully disregarded that knowledge.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\"><em>[Cavalier, supra, </em>535 N.W.2d at 586 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">The Michigan court nonetheless distinguishes certain-to-occur from intent-to-injure claims for purposes of the C-5 exclusion. <em>See Ziebart Int'l Corp. v. CNA Ins. Cos., </em>78 F.3d 245 (6th Cir.1996).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">[I]t is reasonable to conclude, as the <em>Cavalier </em>court did, that the Act\u2019s definition of \"intentional tort\u201d and the language \"bodily injury intentionally caused\u201d in an insurance policy do not entirely overlap, and that insurers must defend employers in cases like the instant case despite the presence of an intentional tort exclusion clause like the one before us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 251.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\"> NJM relies on several Ohio cases that are not on point. <em>E.g., Penn Traffic Co. v. AIU Ins. Co., </em>99 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 227, 790 N.E.2d 1199 (2003) (addressing an employer\u2019s policy that expressly excluded liability coverage \"for both direct-intent and substantial-certainty employer intentional torts.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1204.) The only directly contrary decision cited by NJM with respect to the same C-5 coverage dispute is a brief, unpublished Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decision arising under North Carolina law. <em>Travelers Ins.

Mfrs. Ins. v. Joseph Oat Corp., </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 670 A.2d 1071 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>515, 665 A.2d 1108 (1995), which was written by Judge Conley and joined by Judges Landau and Pressler, we held that the exact same exclusion at issue in the instant case was valid and enforceable. I agree with that decision and find entirely unpersuasive the reasons given for rejecting its analysis and result. The creation of conflicting decisions of this court on this point is particularly unfortunate since the insurance companies have been relying on Judge Conley\u2019s decision for over a decade. It is reasonable to assume that the insured employers, who are presumed to know the law, also understood the import of this exclusion and knew, or should have known, that they were not insured for intentional conduct, however that conduct might be proved. \u201c[A]n intentional wrong can be shown not only by proving a subjective desire to injure, but also by a showing ... that the employer knew an injury was substantially certain to result.\u201d <em>Laidlow v. Hariton Mach. Co., </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>602, 614, 790 A.2d 884 (2002). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
