We conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by adequate evidence and consistent with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Plaintiffs Iyad Khawaja, Samer Abualouf and Joseph C. Limoli are general managers of restaurants owned by defendant Friendly Ice Cream Corporation (FICC).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They claim that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>erred in concluding that they are ineligible for overtime because they are employed in an \u201cexecutive capacity,\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:56a4 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Plaintiff Ibrahim Abushawar is an assistant manager employed by FICC. The issue he raises on appeal is unrelated to the issue raised by the other plaintiffs. Abushawar\u2019s claim for overtime was dismissed on FICC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and he does not challenge that ruling. Abushawar appeals from an order granting FICC\u2019s motion for costs and fees pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:58-3. We affirm that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In parts I-IV of this decision, we address the evidence and law relevant to the overtime claim raised by the plaintiffs who are general managers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We address Abushawar\u2019s distinct claim in part V of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">FICC owns and franchises the restaurants known as \u201cFriendly\u2019s.\u201d Each restaurant does three types of business \u2014 sale of prepackaged ice cream products, take-out service, and restaurant service. Uniform quality of products and service and profitability throughout the chain of restaurants are important to FICC. The corporate goal is to develop consistency to the point that customers expect that they will get specific food, prepared and served in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>a specific way whenever they go to a Friendly\u2019s restaurant. To that end, FICC sets menus, prices, and specific procedures designed to ensure courteous and prompt service of quality food and prevent waste through spoilage, oversized-portions and theft. To promote uniformity, FICC has developed manuals and check lists for daily, weekly and monthly tasks in its restaurants. Every Friendly\u2019s restaurant has one general manager who has overall responsibility for management of the facility, supervision of the staff and implementation of all FICC policies and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Abualouf was the general manager of defendant\u2019s Ramsey restaurant from 1999 to 2001, and Limoli managed the Bloomfield restaurant between March 2001 and May 2002. Khawaja was promoted to the position of general manager in 1996, and at the time of trial he was working as the general manager of the Bloomfield restaurant. All three plaintiffs had a minimum of eighteen employees on staff at all relevant times. FICC policies require a minimum of three employees in attendance during hours of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The starting salary for a general manager is $40,000 per year and the maximum salary is $65,000. A fifty-hour workweek is expected, and bonuses are available based upon the performance of staff and profitability of the restaurant. When the general manager is not present, either the assistant manager or guest service supervisor assumes the role of the general manager, but the general manager retains responsibility for the correct and profitable operation of the restaurant, and the general manager is expected to review the management work done in his or her absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">FICC pays its assistant managers at an hourly rate of $13.39 per hour, and they receive overtime pay for any hours over forty per week. Guest service supervisors, cooks, and servers are paid less than assistant managers and are also eligible for overtime. Each general manager reports to a district manager who visits the district\u2019s restaurants at his or her discretion and when needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>General managers hire, train, supervise, evaluate and schedule hours for members of the restaurant staff. They have the authority to fire staff members in accordance with FICC\u2019s progressive discipline policy. Approval of the district manager is required for termination of an assistant manager or guest services supervisor, but the general manager\u2019s recommendation is generally followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">General managers are also responsible for ordering the food and supplies, determining the quantity of perishable food to ready in advance of each shift, and ensuring that the various stations in the restaurants are properly equipped before each shift. They pay the restaurant\u2019s bills, analyze profit and loss statements and prepare or oversee the preparation of payroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The general manager must enforce FICC\u2019s waste and theft prevention procedures by: locking the kitchen door at all times; checking discarded containers to avoid waste; monitoring portion size; auditing customer checks to ensure proper charging; counseling servers when a customer leaves without paying; and charging employees for food they consume.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Oversight of maintenance of the restaurant facility is left to the general managers. Parking lots, tables and work stations must be kept clean. Appliances must be clean and operable.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The general managers must ensure the quality of food and service. They are expected to prevent service of food that does not meet standards of quality and appearance. Meals or desserts that are substandard are to be discarded and reported as waste. Food supplies must be dated to avoid service of spoiled food. There are time goals for serving customers, and general managers are expected to \u201clend a hand\u201d if necessary to relieve a \u201cbottleneck\u201d during peak hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">General managers are also responsible for sales promotion within the restaurant. They are required to train servers to promote sales by using techniques such as asking customers if they would like to add toppings to ice cream and suggesting purchase of a larger portion or a side dish. FICC sends \u201cmystery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>guests\u201d to its restaurants: they report to FICC on service and food quality, and FICC uses the reports to identify problems and develop the performance ratings which are used in awarding bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">While plaintiffs describe the general manager\u2019s job as one involving constant supervision of staff, they claim that FICC\u2019s mandatory menus, prices, detailed procedures and check lists leave no room for their meaningful exercise of discretion. Plaintiffs testified that they work as many as sixty to seventy hours per week and devote only fifteen to twenty percent of that time to managerial responsibilities. On a regular basis, they clean bathrooms and tables, vacuum and mop, defrost, unload food supplies, police the parking lot, and cook and serve food. As plaintiffs see it, they are required to devote their time to work that should be done by their staff because FICC sets the labor component of their budget at an amount too low to permit them to schedule enough workers to get the job done.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Michael Maglioli, former vice president of restaurant operations for FICC, explained the relationship between a restaurant\u2019s labor budget and staffing decisions. FICC utilizes a computer program that projects staffing levels based on recent sales. The program is sensitive to the type of sales \u2014 prepackaged, take-out or restaurant service \u2014 because the labor required varies depending upon the nature as well as the volume of sales. Maglioli explained that general managers are expected to schedule in accordance with the computer\u2019s projection of needs and to exercise their discretion to adjust for external factors the program does not consider \u2014 for example, school holidays that tend to bring increased business. A general manager has the discretion to exceed the labor budget. The budget represents the target for expenditures on labor costs not a ceiling. The budget is a planning tool designed to maintain a positive ratio between costs and profits. Maglioli did not know of one case in which a general manager had been terminated on account of exceeding the projected labor budget and noted that FICC as a whole generally exceeds the labor component of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>budget. A general manager\u2019s failure to meet the labor budget is not determinative of his or her bonus, but labor costs are relevant to the restaurant\u2019s profitability, which is taken into consideration in determining eligibility for bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">FICC considers its general managers to be \u201cexecutives\u201d who are not entitled to overtime pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56a4. Plaintiffs have not been paid overtime for any of their work as general managers.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">On the basis of the foregoing evidence the trial court concluded that plaintiffs were employed in an \u201cexecutive capacity\u201d and ineligible to claim entitlement to overtime compensation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56a4 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">An employer\u2019s obligation to pay overtime wages is a component of New Jersey\u2019s minimum wage law (MWL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56a to -56a30. The MWL was enacted \u201cto establish a minimum wage level for workers in order to safeguard their health, efficiency, and general well-being____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56a. It is patterned on the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 201-219. Both the FLSA and the MWL require an employer to pay an employee who works more than forty hours per week at a rate of one-and-one half times the employee\u2019s regular hourly rate for every hour after the fortieth, unless the employer establishes the right to an exemption from the \u201covertime\u201d obligation based upon the employee\u2019s salary, duties and work. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56a4; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1 to -7.6; 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 207; 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 217; 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 541.0-541.602 (2004). Both laws provide an exception for any employee who works in a \u201cbona fide executive capacity.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56a4; 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 213(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">State minimum wage laws that are more protective of workers than federal law are authorized by the FLSA. 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 218(a). On that basis, this court has held that the FLSA does not preclude states from extending its protection to a greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>number of employees by narrowing the group of employees excluded from the law. <em>Yellow Cab Co. of Camden v. State, Dir. of Wage &amp; Hour Bureau, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>81, 91-92, 312 A.2d 870 (App.Div.1973), <em>certif. denied, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>498, 317 A.2d 711 (1974). Based upon the Legislature\u2019s remedial purpose in enacting a minimum wage law, we have held that all exemptions to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56a4 should be construed narrowly and that the employer has the obligation to prove that an employee meets the criteria for exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 86, 312 A.2d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Under both the FLSA and MWL, the criteria for exempting an employer from the obligation to pay overtime to an employee who serves in a \u201cbona fide executive capacity\u201d is set forth in regulations promulgated by the head of the Department of Labor. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1; 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56a5 provides the Commissioner with the authority to promulgate regulations that are \u201cappropriate to carry out the purposes\u201d or \u201cnecessary to prevent the circumvention or evasion\u201d of the MWL. <em>See </em>29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 213(a)(1) (authorization for FLSA regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Although <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1 has not been applied by a court of this State in a published decision,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we have guidance. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1 is modeled upon and in many instances identical to the FLSA regulation defining the \u201cexecutive\u201d exemption, 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, we may rely upon judicial decisions construing the FLSA regulation and upon the interpretations of the FLSA regulation by the Secretary of the Department of Labor, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>are published with the regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations. <em>See State v. Chew, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>30, 695 A.2d 1301 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1052, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>593, 145 L.Ed.2d 493 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In order to invoke the \u201cexecutive\u201d exemption an employer must establish the employee\u2019s eligibility under six standards that, stated generally, relate to the following: compensation, managerial responsibility, authority to direct staff, authority to select and retain staff, authority to exercise discretion, and percentage of actual work devoted to management. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1. The purpose of this multifaceted test is to prevent invocation of the exemption by an employer who is using an \u201cexecutive\u201d title to avoid overtime obligations \u2014 a \u201cstrawboss\u201d supervisor is not exempt. 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.115(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">(a) \u201cExecutive\u201d means any employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">1. Whose primary duty consists of the management of the enterprise in which he or she is employed or of a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">2. Who customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees therein; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">3. Who has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring and firing and as to the advancement and promotion of any other change of status of other employees will be given particular weight; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">4. Who customarily and regularly exercises discretionary powers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-14\">5. Who devotes less than 20 percent of his or her workweek to non-exempt work or less than 40 percent if employed by a retail or service establishment, provided that in either ease he or she retains his or her role as manager and supervises two or more full time employees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-15\">6. Who is compensated for his or her services on a salary basis exclusive of gratuities, board, lodging or other facilities, at a rate of not less than $300.00 per week effective November 5, 1990, $350.00 per week effective April 1, 1991, and $400.00 per week effective April 1,1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-16\">(b) \u201cExecutive\u201d shall also include employees owning a bona fide equity in the enterprise of 20 percent or more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-17\">(c) \u201cExecutive\u201d shall not include employees training to become executives and not actually performing the duties of an executive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>TV.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">We begin our discussion of the discrete requirements with subsection (a)6 because it establishes a straightforward threshold requirement based upon compensation. An employer must pay an employee $400 per week or more to claim an exemption based upon the employee\u2019s \u201cexecutive\u201d capacity. There is no question that FICC pays compensation that is adequate under this standard. The lowest salary for a general manager, exclusive of bonus, is $40,000 per year, $769 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The remaining standards are not as easily understood or applied. We consider those standards in the order in which they appear in the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The focus of subsection (a)l is on the adequacy of the employee\u2019s responsibility for management. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56\u20147.1(a)1. This subsection is identical to 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1(a). It requires the employer to establish that the employee has management of a distinct unit as his or her \u201cprimary duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The purpose in requiring a distinct unit (in the terms of the regulation, \u201cthe enterprise ... or of a customarily recognized department or subdivision\u201d of the enterprise) is \u201cto distinguish between a mere collection of [workers] assigned from time to time to a specific job or series of jobs and a unit with permanent status and function.\u201d 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.101. Subsection (a)l prevents an employer from basing a claim of executive status on periodic or temporary assignment of managerial duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The evidence of FICC\u2019s eligibility with respect to distinct units is undisputed. Each restaurant has a separate location, payroll, deposit account, staff, budget and profitability rating. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1(a)1.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">The Secretary of Labor identifies the following as management duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">[Ijnterviewing, selecting, and training of employees; setting and adjusting then-rates of pay and hours of work; directing their work; maintaining their production or sales records for use in supervision or control; appraising their productivity and efficiency for the purpose of recommending promotions or other changes in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>status; handling their complaints and grievances and disciplining them when necessary; planning the work; determining the techniques to be used; apportioning the work among the workers; determining the type of materials, supplies, machinery or tools to be used or merchandise to be bought, stocked and sold; controlling the flow and distribution of materials or merchandise and supplies; providing for the safety of the men and the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">[29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.102.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">FICC\u2019s training manuals, procedures and the testimony presented by both plaintiffs and defendant establish that FICC\u2019s general managers have many of these \u201cmanagement duties.\u201d <em>See Murray v. Stuckey\u2019s Inc., </em>939 <em>F.2d </em>614, 619-20 (8th Cir.1991) (considering nationwide standards adopted by the <em>employer), cert. denied, </em>502 <em>U.S. </em>1073, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>970, 117 L.Ed.2d 135 (1992); <em>Cowan v. Treetop Enters. Inc., </em>120 F.Supp.2d 672, 691-92 (M.D.Tenn.1999) (manuals and training materials). They are responsible for interviewing, hiring, evaluating, disciplining, scheduling work hours, and assigning and reassigning staff. They plan for food preparation on a daily basis, order necessary supplies, implement procedures to prevent theft and waste, and analyze profit and loss statements. There is no question that they have management duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">As is apparently often the case, the \u201cmore difficult question\u201d is whether plaintiffs\u2019 managerial duties are \u201cprimary.\u201d For purposes of this regulation, \u201cthe meaning of \u2018primary\u2019 is \u2018principal\u2019 or \u2018chief,\u2019 not \u2018over one half.\u2019 \u201d <em>Donovan v. Burger King Corp., </em>672 F.2d 221, 226 (1st Cir.1982) <em>(Donovan I). </em>The determination requires consideration of \u201call the relevant facts\u201d and a qualitative assessment of the following: the employee\u2019s relative freedom from supervision; the frequency of the employee\u2019s exercise of discretion; the relative importance of managerial and non-managerial tasks; the time spent on managerial duties; and the employee\u2019s salary relative to the wages of workers supervised. <em>See Donovan v. Burger King Corp., </em>675 F.2d 516, 520-21 (2d Cir.1982) <em>(Donovan </em>II); 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.103. No single factor is dispositive. <em>See Donovan II, supra, </em>675 <em>F.</em>2d at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>FICC\u2019s evidence was adequate to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that management is the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cprimary duty\u201d under this criteria. Each FICC general manager is \u201cin charge\u201d of the restaurant and operates it without any day-to-day supervision. <em>Id. </em>at 522. District managers appear on a discretionary and irregular basis. <em>See Murray, supra, </em>939 F.2d at 619 (primary duty of a local store manager is no less managerial because of reporting to a regional manager whose primary duty is management of multiple stores at a higher level within the organization). District managers report on but do not control operations of the individual restaurants on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The general managers regularly make discretionary decisions necessary to the day-to-day operation of the restaurant. The obligation to complete forms and follow FICC procedures channels but does not eliminate the general manager\u2019s exercise of discretion. <em>See Donovan II, supra, </em>675 F.2d at 521-22. General managers must schedule employee hours, determine the quantities of food to order and prepare, select and correct employees, and move employees from one assignment to another as needs fluctuate throughout the day. These discretionary, managerial duties are performed on a regular basis throughout the day. 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.102; 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.107.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 managerial duties are their \u201cchief\u2019 duties in the sense that the managerial duties have greater importance to their role in the organization than does their performance of \u201cfill-in\u201d tasks when the demand for service is high or staff levels are low. They acknowledge that their obligation to supervise, correct, and discipline the restaurant workers is continual and a critical component of the job. Proper supervision is essential to the quality control and prevention of waste and theft that FICC requires. <em>Cowan, supra, </em>120 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 691 (where training materials demonstrate that a manager\u2019s \u201ccritical\u201d function is cooking, the exemption is not available).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">FICC trains and expects its general managers to step-in when there is a \u201cbottleneck,\u201d and plaintiffs\u2019 testimony was that low <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>staffing levels often require them to spend as much as eighty-percent of their day lending a hand. The trial court did not credit that testimony. But, even if the trial court had found plaintiffs credible, relative allocation of time is only one factor that is not determinative of \u201cprimary\u201d duty. <em>See </em>29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.103; <em>see also Baldwin v. Trailer Inns, Inc., </em>266 <em>F.3d </em>1104, 1113, 1115-16 (9th Cir.2001) (managers of recreational vehicle park spent ninety percent of time on nonexempt duties); <em>Murray, supra, </em>939 F.2d at 618-20 (manager of a Stuckey\u2019s, one of a chain of combination gasoline stations, convenience stores, and restaurants, claimed to spend sixty-five to ninety percent of time on non-managerial tasks); <em>Kastor v. Sam\u2019s Wholesale Club, </em>131 F.Supp.2d 862, 866-67 (N.D.Tex.2001) (manager of bakery department spent ninety percent of his time performing non-managerial tasks).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The time plaintiffs spend cooking, serving food or clearing and wiping tables does not preclude simultaneous performance of their supervisory duties. Cooking, serving and clearing tables is not necessarily inconsistent with effective supervision. It can permit a general manager to teach techniques that improve performance and efficiency, monitor the portions and quality of food and review the accuracy of guest checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In analyzing the various duties and tasks of managers and assistant managers employed in Burger King restaurants, two federal Courts of Appeal have concluded that their duties are primarily managerial within the meaning of the federal regulation. <em>Donovan II, supra, </em>675 <em>F.</em>2d at 520-22; <em>Donovan I, supra, </em>672 F.2d at 225-27. The courts concluded, as we do, that non-exempt tasks such as cooking and serving permit and are not inconsistent with simultaneous supervision. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Finally, the salary of FICC\u2019s general managers compares favorably with wages paid to other employees. An assistant manager working forty hours per week would earn less than $28,900. The minimum salary for a general manager is $40,000. The difference becomes more dramatic when the managers\u2019 salaries and the salaries of employees other than the assistant managers are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>compared. Servers earn under $3.00 per hour plus tips. <em>See Moore v. Tractor Supply Co., </em>352 F.Supp.2d 1268, 1276-78 (S.D.Fla.2004) (noting that courts have not developed a particular measure and discussing eases), <em>aff'd, </em>No. 05-10189DC, 2005 WL 1625237 (11th Cir. July 12,2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs each have the primary duty of managing a \u201ccustomarily recognized ... subdivision\u201d of the FICC under the qualitative, multi-factored standard incorporated in 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1(a) and adopted in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1(a)1 is supported by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The evidence also supports the conclusion that plaintiffs\u2019 supervisory obligations are sufficient to meet the requirements of subsection (a)2, which limits the \u201cexecutive\u201d exemption to employees who \u201ccustomarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other employees.\u201d Plaintiffs direct the work of all employees of the restaurant and FICC\u2019s regulations require the presence of a minimum of three employees. <em>See </em>29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1(b) (identical requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">FICC also established that its general managers have the authority to hire and fire required by subsection (a)3. <em>See </em>29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1(c) (identical requirement). FICC\u2019s evidence demonstrated that plaintiffs hire, schedule work hours, evaluate, discipline and, at a minimum, make recommendations as to firing which are routinely accepted if policies for progressive discipline have been followed. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1(a)3.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Plaintiffs also exercise sufficient discretion to meet the requirements of subsection (a)4, which limits the \u201cexecutive\u201d exemption (again in the words identical to those employed in the federal regulation) to employees who \u201ccustomarily and regularly exercise[] discretionary powers.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1(a)4; 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1(d). The preceding discussion of the general managers\u2019 \u201cprimary duty\u201d includes an analysis of the general managers\u2019 duties that require daily and continuing exercise of discretion that is not eliminated by FICC\u2019s procedures and guidelines. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>no evidence that would permit the conclusion that plaintiffs lack the degree of discretion required by subsection (a)4.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">A brief explanation of the relationship between subsection (a)l and subsections (a)2-5 is necessary. On the facts of this case, it appears that subsections (a)2-4 require a duplication of discrete aspects of the analysis of \u201cprimary duty\u201d under subsection (a)l. The Secretary\u2019s interpretations of the regulation explain the significance of the discrete standards in the course of discussing 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1(c), which requires exercise of discretion. The purpose of the separate standard is to exclude \u201c[a] person whose work is so completely routinized that he has no discretion\u201d even if that factor was not sufficiently weighty to require exclusion under the multi-factored analysis of \u201cprimary duty.\u201d 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.107. Thus, the subsections that appear repetitive in this case have significance because no single factor is determinative under the test of subsection (a)l. The separate subsections serve to exclude employees who lack one of the essential components included in subsections (a)2, (a)3, and (a)4 even though the employees have management as their primary duty within the meaning of subsection (a)l.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Subsection (a)5 poses difficult questions of interpretation and application. It excludes a claim of executive status based upon time devoted to \u201cnon-exempt work.\u201d In the context of the restaurant business, a \u201cservice establishment,\u201d eligibility requires the employer to demonstrate that the manager \u201cdevotes\u201d \u201cless than forty percent\u201d \u201cof his or her workweek\u201d \u201cto non-exempt work.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1(a)5. Here, New Jersey\u2019s regulation deviates from the federal model, and we must consider the differences in language as reflecting an intention to depart from the federal standard. <em>Airwork Serv. Div. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>2 <em>N.J.Tax </em>329 (Tax 1981), <em>aff'd o.b., 4 N.J.Tax </em>532 (App.Div.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>290, 294, 478 A.2d 729 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>1127, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2662, <em>86 L.Ed.2d </em>278 (1985). The remedial purpose of the law requires us to construe the changes as an effort to exclude employees from the exemption and afford protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>greater than the regulations implementing the FLSA. Where \u201cthe language or intent of state and federal labor laws substantially differ, reliance on federal regulations or interpretations to construe state regulations is misplaced.\u201d <em>Ramirez v. Yosemite Water Co., </em>20 Cal.4th 785, 85 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 978 P.2d 2, 10 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">We consider the differences to determine the purpose of the deviation. The comparable provision of the federal regulation has limited application; it is relevant only in cases involving employees who earn less than $250 per week. 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1(e).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the FLSA, an employer who pays at a rate of $250 per week or more may establish the employee\u2019s \u201cexecutive\u201d status under a less stringent \u201cshort test\u201d that does include this quantitative analysis of tasks performed on a weekly basis: the \u201cshort test\u201d does not require a determination of the percentage of the employee\u2019s workweek devoted to non-exempt work. <em>See Donovan II, supra, </em>675 F.2d at 518-21; <em>Donovan I, supra, </em>672 F.2d at 223-24. Where the \u201cshort test\u201d applies, the employer need establish only three elements: the employee\u2019s compensation is fixed at $250 per week or more; the employee\u2019s \u201cprimary duty consists of the management of the enterprise ... or of a customarily recognized department\u201d; and involves \u201ccustomary and regular direction of the work of two or more other employees____\u201d 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1(f).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Subsection (a)5 serves the same function as subsections (a)2, (a)3, and (a)4 discussed above. While relative time spent on managerial duties is one of several factors considered in determining \u201cprimary duty\u201d under (a)l, under (a)5 time spent on nonexempt duties provides an independent basis for excluding an employee from the \u201cexecutive\u201d exemption solely on the basis of a quantitative review of time spent on non-exempt work.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The term \u201cnon-exempt work\u201d is not defined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1. Interpretative statements explaining this component of the federal \u201clong test\u201d use the terms \u201cexempt\u201d and \u201cnon-exempt\u201d to describe the tasks that are counted in favor of and against \u201cexecutive\u201d status. <em>See </em>29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.112. The reasonable conclusion is that the intent here is to incorporate the descriptions included in the interpretative statements and simplify the language of the regulation. The phrasing of the federal standard is awkward, \u201cwork not directly and closely related to the performance of the work described in paragraphs (a) through (d).\u201d Use of the terms exempt and non-exempt, made familiar by the Secretary\u2019s interpretations, serves as shorthand. On that basis, we conclude that non-exempt means work \u201cnot directly and closely related to qualifying managerial duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The interpretative statement explains: \u201cNonexempt work is easily identifiable where, as in the usual case, it consists of work of the same nature as that performed by the nonexempt subordinates of the \u2018executive.\u2019 \u201d 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.111(b). The primary purpose of the exclusionary language placing a limitation on the amount of non-exempt work is to distinguish between the bona fide executive and the Vorking\u2019 foreman or \u2018working\u2019 supervisor who regularly performs ... work which is unrelated or only remotely related to his supervisory activities.\u201d 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.115(a). Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>explanation recognizes a distinction between a supervisor who does the same tasks side-by-side with the workers, and a supervisor who does the work to demonstrate or teach. <em>Ibid. </em>(using an example from the garment production industry). In that manner, it distinguishes \u201cfill-in tasks,\u201d which are assigned because the supervisory and managerial duties do not take full time, from those tasks that are done in furtherance of the supervisory role. Another example distinguishes general record keeping from keeping records for performance evaluations. 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.115(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The federal regulations were recently amended, and the amended regulations no longer require a time-percentage analysis of non-exempt activities for any employee. 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 541.1 (as amended effective Aug. 23, 2004). The Department of Labor explained that the requirement had fallen into disuse because of the outdated wage level that limited its application to low wage earners. <em>See </em>69 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>22122, 22126. The Department concluded that reactivation of the test, with its \u201cmoment-by-moment examination of an exempt employee\u2019s specific duties,\u201d would impose new monitoring requirements, recordkeeping burdens, and require employers to conduct a detailed analysis of the substance of each particular employee\u2019s daily and weekly tasks. <em>Id. </em>at 22126 to -27. Referencing judicial decisions that recognize an employee\u2019s ability to perform his or her primary duties while performing non-exempt tasks, and reporting complaints from department investigators and employers who found the distinction involved \u201ca subjective and difficult evaluative task that prompted contentious disputes,\u201d the agency dispensed with the standard. <em>See id. </em>at 22127 (referencing <em>Donovan I, </em>supra). To date, no conforming amendments have been proposed in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The question we must confront is the proof an employer must adduce to establish eligibility under the percentage standard. The issue has not been expressly addressed in a federal decision disclosed by our review of the cases. In both <em>Burger King </em>cases discussed above, the Courts of Appeal affirmed the trial judge\u2019s factual determination that the employer had not established the percentage requirement for lower paid assistant managers \u201cas not clearly erroneous,\u201d without discussion of proofs that would have sufficed. <em>Donovan II, supra, </em>675 <em>F.</em>2d at 517; <em>Donovan I, supra, </em>672 <em>F.</em>2d at 227. In other cases courts have found it unnecessary to reach the percentage requirement because of the employer\u2019s failure to establish \u201cprimary duty.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Cowan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We cannot conclude that the Commissioner intended to require an employer to establish proof in the form of a moment-to-moment analysis of an employee\u2019s workweek. That interpretation would necessarily require detailed records of tasks performed at work, and the New Jersey regulations do not call for maintenance of such records. <em>Cf. N.J.S.A. </em>34:56a20. The absence of a regulation requiring what would be needed suggests that there was no intention to demand proof of that sort to establish eligibility under subsection (a)5.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Like New Jersey, California has a test based on a quantitative assessment of time spent on tasks. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>85 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>844, 978 P.2d at 10 &amp; n. 4. The Supreme Court of California has described the questions and problems inherent in a \u201cquantitative\u201d review of exempt and non-exempt work as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgY\">Is the number of hours worked ... to be determined by the number of hours that the employer, according to its job description or its estimate, claims the employee should be working [on exempt work], or should it be determined by the actual average hours the employee spent on [such] activity? The logic inherent in the [regulation\u2019s] quantitative definition ... dictates that neither alternative would be wholly satisfactory. On the one hand, if hours worked on [exempt work] were determined through an employer\u2019s job description, then the employer could make an employee exempt from overtime laws solely by fashioning an idealized job description that had little basis in reality. On the other hand, an employee who is supposed to be engaged in [exempt] activities during most of his working hours and falls below the ... mark due to his own substandard performance [or affirmative choice] should not thereby be able to evade a valid exemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>[Ramirez, supra, </em>85 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 978 P.2d at 13.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The <em>Ramirez </em>court directed a solution that allows trial courts to \u201csteer clear of [the] two pitfalls\u201d it identified. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>85 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 978 P.2d at 13. The court held that a trial court should: \u201cinquir[e] into the realistic requirements of the job,\u201d giving consideration to \u201chow the employee actually spends his or her time,\u201d but also \u201cconsidering] whether the employee\u2019s practice diverges from the employer\u2019s realistic expectations____\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The approach adopted in <em>Ramirez </em>is properly protective of the employee without being unfair to the employer. The benefits of the <em>Ramirez </em>approach are particularly apparent in this case involving managers who schedule the hours of the non-exempt staff. On the one hand, there is a concern that the employer may provide an unreasonable labor budget which requires the managers to take on non-exempt work to succeed. On the other hand, there is a concern that the managers may schedule their staff time poorly, through inexperience, incompetence or design, thereby creating the necessity that justifies their own performance of nonexempt work and receipt of overtime pay.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By considering both the realistic basis for the employer\u2019s job description and the employees\u2019 fulfillment of the employer\u2019s reasonable expectations, the <em>Ramirez </em>test measures percentage of exempt and non-exempt work by a standard that is not only more practical but also more meaningful than a moment-to-moment analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The trial court in this case took an approach that is consistent with the <em>Ramirez </em>standard, and we hold that it is the appropriate approach. The trial court reviewed the FICC\u2019s evidence about the responsibilities of its general managers, the testimony about the computer program that general managers are directed to use in order to determine the staffing levels, which is based upon the need for staff, and the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony that they spend only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>twenty percent of their time on exempt work. The trial court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">[If it] is, in fact, the case, [that plaintiffs spend only twenty percent of their time on managerial tasks] they are not performing their function as managers. Their testimony was to the effect that they had to clean-up parking lots, do the cooking, handle the fountain service and, at times, they had to wash dishes themselves. To believe this testimony [about the eighty percent time commitment] would mean that the plaintiffs failed to delegate responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Thus, the trial court reviewed the evidence of FICC\u2019s reasonable expectations, determined that FICC\u2019s staffing levels are realistic because they are based upon need, and considered plaintiffs\u2019 testimony about how they spend their time during the workweek. The court did not credit plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, and the court implicitly recognized that under the circumstances if the general managers were spending as much as eighty percent of their job on non-exempt work, then they were not meeting FICC\u2019s reasonable expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We hold that FICC\u2019s evidence was adequate to meet the employer\u2019s burden to establish that its general managers are expected to devote less than forty percent of their workweek to non-exempt work and that the expectation is reasonable in light of the staffing permitted. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1(a)5. FICC established that the significant managerial responsibilities were sufficient to occupy the workweek. Proof of that sort negates any inference that non-exempt work is used as a prohibited \u201cfill-in,\u201d as it is with \u201cstrawboss\u201d supervisors. 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 <em>541.115. </em>FICC presented evidence that it employed computerized staffing models based upon criteria related to the demand for labor. That proof negates any inference that FICC either arbitrarily restricted staffing or did so in a bad faith effort to require its general managers to do non-exempt work for substandard pay. <em>Cf. Donovan II, supra, </em>675 F.2d at 519 (because the evidence that employer\u2019s ideal ratio of staff to production was inconsistent with actual staffing and tolerated by the employer who had knowledge of the inadequacy, the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Burger King failed to qualify its lower-paid, long test, assistant managers was not clearly erroneous).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>We hold that an employer may establish compliance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:56-7.1(a)5 by evidence that demonstrates that: proper performance of expected managerial duties reasonably requires devotion of more than sixty percent of the employee\u2019s workweek; and the staffing levels in the unit are based on criteria adequate to meet the demands without assistance of the exempt managerial employees that takes more than forty percent of their time. Employees may rebut the evidence with proof of actual tasks performed. The ultimate burden of proof remains with the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The decision of the trial court is supported by the evidence and consistent with controlling legal principles, and we defer to the judge\u2019s conclusions on the credibility of plaintiffs\u2019 rebuttal evidence. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974); <em>Maggio v. Pruzansky, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 537 A.2d 756 (App.Div.1988). We affirm the order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">We also affirm the trial court\u2019s decision awarding counsel fees pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:58-1 and <em>Rule </em>4:58-3. Abushawar raises only one narrow factual issue on this appeal, which does not have sufficient support in the record to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E). He argues that he should not be required to pay the fees as directed because \u201cthe offer[s] of settlement were contingent upon\u201d acceptance of offers by all plaintiffs. That is the only argument he raises, and it is not supported by the record. The offer of judgment is included in FICC\u2019s appendix on this appeal. The offer was made to \u201cplaintiff Ibrahim Abushawar.\u201d On its face, the offer of judgment is not contingent upon acceptance by any other plaintiff, and we decline to consider contradictory certifications about the plaintiffs\u2019 collective misunderstandings that were executed after the date of the trial judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The orders are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-11\"> The complaint included additional counts that are not at issue on this appeal.

The trial judge's order requiring Abushawar to pay fees and costs pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:58-3 left open the amount to be paid, and, as a result, the orders were not appealable as of right when the notices of appeal were filed.
