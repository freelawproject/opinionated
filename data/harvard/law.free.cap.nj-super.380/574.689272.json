As a result, plaintiff was precluded from recovering both noneconomic losses and future lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Plaintiff argues on appeal that the threshold embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a does not require a plaintiff to prove permanent injury in order to recover for economic damages. He alleges \u201cthat as a result of his injury, he suffered future economic damages since he is unable to perform at his pre-injury neuropsychological level\u201d and argues \u201cthat it was not necessary to prove a permanent injury or substantial impact [on his life] in order to recover future economic damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Liability was not contested at trial. Plaintiff testified that after the accident he had problems with his \u201cconcentration, memory [and] lack of focus.\u201d Dr. Carl Edward Bradford, a neuro-psychologist, testified that plaintiff suffered from a \u201cbrain injury\u201d and \u201cwould not be successful\u201d in graduate school, which he had planned to attend before the accident. Dr. Bradford further testified that plaintiffs difficulties with concentration and memory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>and Ms cogmtive problems, were neuropsychological impairments caused by the motor veMele accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Dr. Robert Wolfe, a vocational and rehabilitation economist, testified based on Dr. Bradford\u2019s diagnosis of \u201cneuropsychological and cognitive impairments\u201d and \u201cbrain injury\u201d that plaintiffs \u201cfuture employment opportumties would be limited.\u201d Dr. Wolfe also referred to the reports of other doctors relating to \u201cinjury-related emotional impairments,\u201d \u201cphysical limitations,\u201d and \u201cneurological deficits,\u201d and concluded that plaintiffs \u201cinjury-related impairments ... would negatively impact on academic and vocational functioning, which would have a further negative impact on earmng capacity.\u201d According to Dr. Wolfe, plaintiffs \u201ccurrent expected earnings post-accident\u201d were only $518,153 during Ms \u201clifetime,\u201d as opposed to $1,433,310 projected for an individual with an undergraduate degree. Thus, plaintiffs \u201cnet damage\u201d was $915,157 for the \u201cnet difference\u201d over his \u201cwork lifetime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">At the charge conference, the trial judge noted that the claim of future wage losses had to be premised on a finding by the jury of a permanent injury as testified to by Dr. Bradford, and ruled that he would not submit that issue to the jury in the absence of a finding of a permanent injury. According to the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">I believe that common sense dictates that for the jury to award anything for a brain injury that affects what this young man\u2019s going to make for the rest of his life, particularly when the expert says he\u2019s relying on medical information that says there\u2019s a permanent injury, requires before the jury can award any damages that there be a permanent injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">If there is not permanent injury then clearly there is not pain and suffering loss, that we are all in agreement with. But the same sort of logic dictates that you can\u2019t give someone hundreds of thousands of dollars, $1.2 or whatever to compensate them for economic loss in the future that\u2019s all premised on Dr. Wolfe\u2019s acceptance that there\u2019s a permanent injury. I mean, it\u2019s just illogical. If I\u2019m wrong then so be it, but it\u2019s just so illogical that it\u2019s wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">In ehargmg the jury, the judge included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">Dr. Wolfe discussed the present value of the plaintiff\u2019s future earning loss including projections as to future interest including its tax, consequences and inflation rates. You may consider some, all or none of the opinions of the expert in determining in a fair figure to compensate plaintiff for his future lost earnings. The expert has also given you his bottom line figure as to plaintiff\u2019s future lost earnings. As I told you previously, you need not give any of these bottom line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>figures automatic acceptance. You are free to determine, based on all of the evidence including the expert testimony you chose to accept, what amount of dollars will fairly compensate plaintiff for his or her future lost earnings. Or in this case, his.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The judge then charged on the proofs required to satisfy the verbal threshold with respect to \u201cpermanency\u201d and \u201cthat the injury has had a serious impact on [plaintiffs] life,\u201d and added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQB\">Question Two says, \u201cHas the injury or injuries sustained by the plaintiff, Todd Miskelly, caused a serious impact upon his life such that he Lis] no longer able to attend to his regular routine activities and is deprived of his physical ability to engage in L] social or recreational activities which had been previously been important to him?\u201d So, as to this question, you \u2014 and this is with \u2014 with the non-economic claim, the claim for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life, you determine whether or not ... that injury or injuries has caused a serious impact upon his life. You answer that question, yes or no. If you have answered Questions One and Two ... you proceed to question Three, \u201cHas the plaintiff, Todd Miskelly, sustained a future wage loss as a result of his involvement within the motor vehicle accident occurring on May 8,1999?\u201d <em>There is no serious impact requirement in this question. It is simply a requirement that you have already ruled that there was a permanent injury to answer this question.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">In its verdict sheet, the jury found that plaintiff did not \u201csustain[] a permanent injury or injuries as a result of his involvement within the motor vehicle accident occurring on May 8,1999.\u201d As a result, it did not answer the interrogatories concerning whether the accident had a \u201cserious impact\u201d on plaintiffs life, whether he \u201csustained a future wage loss as a result\u201d of the accident, and the amount of compensation appropriate \u201cfor his pain, suffering, disability and impairment, and loss of enjoyment of life due to his injuries,\u201d and \u201cfor his future lost wages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The question before us is whether plaintiff had to prove a \u201cpermanent injury\u201d in this context, in order to recover for future lost wages. He asserts that because future lost wages are economic damages, he need not prove \u201cpermanency\u201d or satisfy the threshold, as required with respect to a claim of \u201cnoneconomic loss.\u201d A noneconomic loss is defined as \u201cpain, suffering and inconvenience.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2i. For this type of claim, the plaintiff must satisfy the verbal threshold to prevail. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. This means that plaintiff must prove that his injury meets one of the six statutorily designated categories of injury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>one of which is a \u201cpermanent injury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. The threshold need not generally be satisfied to recover for an \u201ceconomic loss,\u201d which is defined as \u201cuncompensated loss of income or property, or other uncompensated expenses, including, but not limited to, medical expenses.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2k.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We have held that plaintiffs need not satisfy the threshold to recover for economic loss. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. Chhabra, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>387, 394-95, 864 A.2d 1155 (App.Div.2005); <em>D\u2019Aloia v. Georges, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>246, 858 A.2d 16 (App.Div.2004). In <em>Martin </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">[P]ersons who fail to surmount the verbal threshold are precluded from recovering only noneconomic losses, such as \u201cpain, suffering and inconvenience.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2i; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. Plaintiffs failing to surmount the threshold may recover unreimbursed income losses \u201cto the extent that the income loss is otherwise uncompensated by income continuation benefits or otherwise.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-12; <em>Bennett v. Hand, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 45 663 A.2d 130 (App.Div.1995). Economic loss \u201cmeans uncompensated loss of income or property, or other uncompensated expenses____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2k. Even evidence of prospective income loss based on a career choice that was denied plaintiff because of the injury was sufficient to defeat summary judgment as to \u201ceconomic damages.\u201d <em>Loftus-Smith v. Henry, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>477, 489, 669 A.2d 852 (App.Div.1996).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\"><em>[Martin v. Chhabra, supra, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 394-95, 864 A.2d 1155.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-9\"><em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-12, which specifically states that evidence regarding collections of personal injury protection (PIP) benefits is inadmissible with respect to noneconomic loss, but that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall be construed to limit the right of recovery, against the tortfeasor, of uncompensated economic loss sustained by the injured party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Future economic loss must depend upon an injury which affects plaintiffs ability to earn income in the future. Hence, where the claim is based on a permanent injury within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, there must be a \u201cpermanent injury\u201d to sustain recovery beyond wages lost during a reasonable period of recuperation and recovery. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a defines a \u201cpermanent\u201d injury to be one in which \u201cthe body part or organ, or both, has not healed to function normally and will not heal to function normally with further medical treatment.\u201d Wages may be lost by virtue of an accident that may not result in a \u201cpermanent injury,\u201d and plaintiff may recover for same irrespective of \u201cpermanency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>In this case, however, plaintiff alleged that his future wages would be lost throughout his \u201cwork lifetime.\u201d As the trial judge noted, such a claim is necessarily based on a \u201cpermanent injury.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, the finding of no permanent injury precludes the finding of the long-term loss of future earnings attributable to the accident in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">As already noted, the trial judge concluded that without a permanent injury, there could be no damages or recovery of future lost wages, and that, in any event, plaintiffs claims of traumatic brain injury, or a cognitive condition which would affect his ability to study, concentrate and work, had to result, if at all, from a \u201cpermanent injury.\u201d Thus, the trial judge thought that both the \u201cpermanent injury\u201d and \u201csubstantial impact\u201d prongs of the threshold had to be satisfied to collect future wages. Of course, the \u201csecond prong\u201d no longer exists and did not have to be found, <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005); <em>Serrano v. Serrano, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>508, 874 A.2d 1058 (2005), but the jury never considered that issue, and its presentation cannot be said to have prejudiced the jury\u2019s consideration of the issue concerning a \u201cpermanent injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Plaintiff contends that the relevant statutory complex, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8 and -12, and case law requires us to reverse the judgment because the threshold applies only to noneconomic losses and that he did not have to satisfy the threshold to recover for future lost wages. However, we agree with the trial judge that the long-term wages sought in this case were premised on a \u201cpermanent\u201d brain injury and his future income could not have been diminished without a permanent injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-12\"> The trial occurred following our June 8, 2003 reversal of the dismissal of plaintiff's complaint for failure to file a timely certificate of permanency. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> Plaintiff did not seek recovery for any actual economic losses. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4b (regarding income continuation benefits).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> We recognize that this case only applies to the particular claim before us and only with a type 6 injury where a \"permanent injury\u201d must be found. <em>See Rios v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>Szivos, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 808 <em>A.2d </em>868 (App.Div.2002). We also recognize that in some cases future lost wages may be deemed appropriate for a period of time even though the injury is not deemed to be \"permanent\" within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
