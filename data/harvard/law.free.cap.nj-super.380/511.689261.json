N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12(a). The Law Division granted defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, concluding that plaintiff had not produced sufficient evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>show that defendants\u2019 proffered business reasons for her termination (poor performance and a personality conflict with her superior) were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In this appeal, plaintiff argues that the motion judge erred when he applied an incorrect standard on summary judgment, weighing the evidence rather than giving her the benefit of the proffered evidence and its reasonable inferences. After reviewing the record and considering the applicable law, we agree with plaintiff and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Plaintiff was fifty years old at the time she was terminated from her position as RCN\u2019s senior vice president of customer service in 1998, after approximately eight years of service. She was the top-ranking woman in the company at the time of her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Defendant Michael Mahoney was, at all times relevant to the issues raised here, president of RCN Corporation, a provider of cable and long-distance telephone service. Defendant David McCourt was RCN\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Kenneth Knudsen, another RCN executive, was originally named as a defendant. Plaintiff did not pursue her claims against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Plaintiff started working for C-Tec, RCN\u2019s predecessor, in May 1990 as manager of marketing and ad sales, earning $42,055 per year. After several promotions and salary increases, she became director of development in February 1995, earning $77,500; vice president of marketing in August 1995, earning $97,500; and senior vice president of customer sales in February 1997, earning $125,000. She was the only woman vice president in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\n<em>Evidence of Pattern of Discriminatory Treatment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">In 1996, plaintiff complained that her salary was lower than it should have been in 1995 and 1996. In response, she was told that she would be \u201ctaken care of\u2019 at bonus time. Although she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>received a substantial bonus in 1996, she claimed that it was completely due to her work in a \u201cspecial project,\u201d and thus unrelated to any attempt at income parity. RCN president Mark Haverkate, her supervisor until 1995, noted that in 1996 her salary was the lowest in her \u201cband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">According to plaintiff, McCourt told her that Mahoney wanted to reduce the extraordinary bonus that she received in 1996 for her work on a special project, but did not want to reduce similar bonuses received by two male executives. In his deposition, Mahoney denied having any problems with plaintiffs 1996 bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Plaintiff testified that McCourt commented, upon introducing her to someone, that she had \u201cballs.\u201d She took this vulgarity to mean that she was tough. She further indicated that other people had used this term to describe her before, but she was \u201ca little shocked\u201d and \u201ctaken aback\u201d that the CEO would introduce her this way. According to plaintiff, this remark was indicative of a male-centric \u201catmosphere,\u201d where \u201c[y]ou had to be one of the guys to make it at RCN. And I was not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Plaintiff described Mahoney\u2019s attitude toward women as \u201c[e]litist\u201d and \u201cdismissive.\u201d She characterized Mahoney\u2019s demeanor as \u201cbothered\u201d by her \u201cchallenges\u201d to some of the things that he did. He also would ignore her at meetings and \u201clooked through you like you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Plaintiff described an incident in which she met Mahoney on the stairs and asked him how he was; he answered that he was \u201creally stressed.\u201d When she asked, \u201cIs there anything I can do to help,\u201d Mahoney replied, \u201cI guess you can just quit.\u201d In a subsequent deposition, plaintiff changed this testimony to indicate that Mahoney said that \u201che guessed that <em>he </em>could always quit.\u201d She added, however, that she took this comment as \u201can innuendo to mean that I could quit. He had no intention of quitting.\u201d Plaintiff explained that she interpreted Mahoney\u2019s remark this way because \u201c[t]hey were making my job really difficult,\u201d and there were rumors that her superiors were trying to force her to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>In late 1996, plaintiff testified that she was talking with Lorraine Reddington (RCN\u2019s controller), when Mahoney \u201csnickered\u201d and said: \u2018Well, imagine the two of you talking about technical issues.\u201d According to plaintiff, this remark revealed Mahoney\u2019s sexist attitudes toward women, in that \u201ctechnical issues\u201d are beyond the understanding of women.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">When Mahoney became president of RCN in June or July of 1997, McCourt decided to remove both plaintiff and Haverkate from marketing and sales. He made this decision because \u201csubscriber gains, access lines gains and numbers that were being achieved were not in line with the plan and were not in line with the growth rate that he had expected from them.\u201d Mahoney testified that he did not want plaintiff to remain in operations because her experience was in marketing and sales, and \u201cwe had a tremendous problem at RCN with provisioning customers, getting customers that had signed up for sales on to her network as billable customers.\u201d McCourt directed Mahoney to take over operations, and agreed with Mahoney\u2019s suggestion to hire someone new to assist.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">McCourt accepted Mahoney\u2019s suggestion to move plaintiff to customer service. Mahoney explained that \u201ccustomer service was a problem big enough that McCourt was getting multiple letters a day complaining.\u201d Mahoney removed John Gdovin, who was thirty-five years old, from customer service in October 1997, but Gdovin \u201ckept the programming responsibilities that he always had and also assumed responsibility for Cable Michigan,\u201d a part of CTec. According to Haverkate, McCourt chose plaintiff as \u201cthe best person in the company\u201d to manage customer service. She had taken over management of the New York office and turned it around \u201cfrom horrible to pretty good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Haverkate described McCourt\u2019s management style as involving \u201ca lot of mix-up and changes going on all the time.\u201d He said that McCourt</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>managed the company almost like a soccer team, and he ... expected that people would play whatever roles or positions that he thought was the best lineup at any given period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">And ... he had a tendency to elevate people to a higher status than maybe they deserved at the time____And then time would go by and ... they would make a mistake or they fumbled the ball ... and they would go, boom, right down to the bottom and would be ... in the doghouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">But that happened to everybody. It was a continual thing and people adapted to it____But the reality was that you had to play on the team____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">When people were in the doghouse they didn\u2019t get too depressed about it because you work hard and times will change and they\u2019ll get back out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Plaintiff testified that McCourt told her that \u201ccustomer service was all fucked up, and that because I had an operations, marketing and sales background and no one else in the company did, that I could straighten it out.\u201d She explained that she had a \u201ccrown jewel job,\u201d which she loved, and McCourt asked her to accept a \u201cjob in the black hole\u201d with accountability but no authority. Thus, she believed that she was \u201cset up to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">Plaintiff initially declined the customer service offer. She accepted in June or July 1997, after Knudsen assumed her marketing responsibilities. In August 1997, Mahoney hired forty-two-year-old Scott Jarus, who assumed plaintiffs other responsibilities. Plaintiff reported directly to Jarus.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Plaintiff described Jarus as sarcastic and belittling. She believed he was carrying out Mahoney\u2019s orders \u201c[bjecause no one could be that nasty and enjoy it.\u201d According to plaintiff, although Jarus was condescending toward men, he was worse with women.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">Under Jarus, plaintiff claims to have been unable to obtain \u201cthe tools and resources\u201d needed to adequately perform her customer service responsibilities. Mahoney corroborated, in part, plaintiffs claims in this respect. He admitted that plaintiff did not have the authority to increase staff and meet her department\u2019s infrastructure needs. Jarus denied a number of proposals made by plaintiff, including a plan to develop an incentive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>She testified that Jarus would assign projects directly to people who reported to her, without informing her, and then hold her accountable for their outcome. At least on one occasion, Jarus directed plaintiffs secretary to look for her when she was not at her desk, including following plaintiff into the restroom. Jarus would ostensibly forget that plaintiff had informed him when she would be out of the office, and failed to include her or invite her to meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Plaintiff testified that Mahoney asked her to agree that customer service should report to him. When she responded that she needed to think about it, Mahoney falsely told McCourt that plaintiff had agreed. As to plaintiffs performance, Mahoney acknowledged that she opened a customer service center in Princeton as directed, and characterized her efforts in this respect as adequate. He disagreed, however, with her approach to the customer service problem, which was to increase the size of the staff. He admitted that he did not have \u201cenough time\u201d to ascertain what was wrong with customer service before he left in March 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\n<em>The Termination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">In October 1997, C-Tec divided into three separate companies: RCN, Cable Michigan, and CTCo (Commonwealth Telephone Company). McCourt remained as chair of all three companies. RCN became plaintiff\u2019s employer. According to plaintiff, her reviews during her tenure at C-Tec/RCN were \u201csuperior or exceptional.\u201d When she began reporting to Mahoney four months later, \u201cI went from being a superior employee to getting terminated.\u201d Haverkate, who supervised plaintiff until she became senior vice president of customer sales in February 1997, corroborated that her performance was excellent.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">According to Mahoney, in September and October 1997, Jarus expressed concern about plaintiff\u2019s lack of cooperation and commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>nication. In December 1997, Jarus told Mahoney that he could no longer work with plaintiff. Mahoney said that he approached several senior executives \u2014 Haverkate, Knudsen, Gdovin, Mike Adams, and Dhiraj G. Gulati \u2014 to find another position for plaintiff in the company. None were interested. He thus decided to terminate plaintiff. McCourt told him: \u201cThat\u2019s your decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Gulati and Adams both denied that Mahoney asked them about a position for plaintiff in their departments. According to Haverkate, there were other positions that plaintiff could have taken, because the company was growing fast and had \u201ca history of musical chairs and people taking different roles.\u201d According to Haverkate, since plaintiffs termination, \u201clots of people have come and gone at the senior level positions.\u201d When Haverkate attempted to talk to Mahoney, he refused to see him. McCourt also declined to talk to Haverkate about plaintiffs termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Mahoney terminated plaintiff on January 13,1998. His reasons for doing so were twofold: \u201cher deteriorating work performance, coupled with her personality conflict with her supervisor, Scott Jarus, and other RCN employees.\u201d According to Mahoney, Jarus assumed her duties as head of customer service. Mahoney left operations in March 1998. Defendants hired Jeanne Daniels, a fifty-four-year-old woman, in June 1998 to replace plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">\n<em>Stock Option Plan as a Part of Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">According to Jonathan Paules, RCN\u2019s manager of executive compensation and stock options, plaintiff received 10,000 shares of C-Tec stock under the 1994 stock option plan. Two thousand of these shares vested on January 3, 1996. Another 2,000 shares vested on January 3, 1997, and another 2,000 on January 3, 1998, before plaintiffs termination on January 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">According to plaintiff, Mahoney intentionally delayed her receipt of her 1994 stock options. Haverkate told her that Mahoney, who had to approve her options, wanted to decrease the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>her options, and increase her \u201cstrike price.\u201d According to plaintiff, Gulati was granted options on the same day, and Mahoney did not want to increase his \u201cstrike price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Paules testified that plaintiff received 20,000 shares of C-Tec stock under the 1996 stock option plan. Because none of the shares had vested at the time of her termination on January 13, 1998, they were cancelled. Plaintiff asserted that her \u201cfirst round of options\u201d from 1996 would have vested thirty days after her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Mahoney admitted that when he terminated plaintiff in January 1998, he was aware that she had options that were about to vest, but he did not consider keeping her on the payroll until that time because \u201cthere was never a policy or a situation in the company where we did that for anyone.\u201d Despite Mahoney\u2019s explanations, Haverkate characterized the timing of plaintiffs termination (a month before her options would have vested) as \u201cpunitive.\u201d Haverkate was also aware of employees who, although terminated, had been allowed to stay on the payroll until their options vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">We will begin our analysis by reaffirming basic principles of appellate review. We review a summary judgment order by employing the same standard that governs trial courts. <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 167, 704 A.2d 597 (App.Div.1998). Because our review involves a purely legal analysis, we are not obligated to defer to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Illva Saronno Corp. v. Liberty Hill Realty, Inc., </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>443, 450, 782 A.2d 473 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c). Without assessing credibility, weighing the evidence, or determining its truth, the motion judge must \u201cconsider whether the competent evidential materials presented, when viewed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>light most favorable to the non-moving party, are sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12a, it is an unlawful employment practice \u201c[fjor an employer, because of the ... age ... [or] sex ... of any individual ... to discharge ... from employment such individual or to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment.\u201d We note that the motion judge correctly acknowledged <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>792, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1817, 36 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>668 (1973), as the case controlling the evaluation of defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Where there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the plaintiff-employee must first establish a prima facie case by showing that: (1) she was in a protected class; (2) she was performing her job at a level that met the employer\u2019s legitimate expectations; (3) she was nevertheless discharged; and (4) the employer sought someone else to perform the same work after she left. <em>Mogull v. CB Commercial Real Estate Group, Inc., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>449, 462, 744 A.2d 1186 (2000). Here, the court determined that plaintiff established each prong of her prima facie case: she was a member of a protected class (female and age fifty); she was performing her job in a satisfactory manner; she was discharged; and someone replaced her.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Establishment of the prima facie case creates a presumption of discrimination. The burden then shifts to the employer to produce evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for plaintiffs discharge. <em>Ibid.; Bergen Commercial Bank v. Sisler, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>188, 210, 723 A.2d 944 (1999). Here, the motion judge determined that defendants articulated two such nondiseriminatory reasons: (1) plaintiffs alleged unsatisfactory performance in customer relations; and (2) her personality conflict with Jams.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Once the employer produces evidence of a legitimate reason for the discharge, the presumption of discrimination disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>pears, and the burden shifts back to plaintiff to prove that the employer\u2019s reasons were a pretext for discrimination. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>502, 515, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2742, 2751-52, 125 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 407, 422 (1993); <em>Mogull, supra, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>at 462, 744 A.2d 1186; <em>Sisler, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 210-11, 723 A.2d 944. The ultimate burden of proof always remains with the plaintiff. <em>St. Mary\u2019s, supra, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>at 518, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2753, 125 L.Ed.2d at 423; <em>Sisler, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 211, 723 A.2d 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Defendants contend that the judge erred in determining that plaintiff established her prima facie ease, and that this is an alternative ground for affirming the summary judgment. According to defendants, plaintiff did not prove the second and fourth prongs of the prima facie case, because her job performance was not satisfactory and defendants replaced her with another, older woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">We reject defendants\u2019 argument. \u201cThe burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous\u201d; the function of the prima facie ease is to eliminate \u201cthe most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the plaintiff\u2019s rejection.\u201d <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>248, 253-54, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1089, 1094, 67 L.Ed.2d 207, 215-16 (1981). We agree with the motion judge that the record, considered in the light most favorable to plaintiff, shows that she was performing her job at a level that met her employer\u2019s reasonable expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">When considering a plaintiff\u2019s job performance for the purpose of her prima facie case, the standard is whether she was \u201cobjectively qualified\u201d for the position. <em>Pilkington v. Bally\u2019s Park Place, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>262, 850 A.2d 1225 (2004); <em>Baker v. Nat\u2019l State Bank, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 285, 711 A.2d 917 (App.Div.1998), <em>aff'd and remanded, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>220, 736 A.2d 462 (1999); <em>Greenberg v. Camden Cty. Vocational &amp; Tech. Schs., </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>189, 203, 708 A.2d 460 (App.Div.1998). Here, plaintiff was employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>RCN and its predecessor, C-Tec, for approximately eight years, although not in the customer service position from which she was terminated. Nevertheless, plaintiff had been vice president of marketing for eighteen months before she was promoted to senior vice president of customer service. According to Haverkate, who supervised plaintiff until her promotion to vice president, her performance was excellent. Mahoney acknowledged that plaintiffs performance was satisfactory during her first few months in customer service. This was sufficient proof that plaintiff was objectively qualified for her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Defendants also contend that plaintiff failed to satisfy the fourth prong of the prima facie ease, that defendants sought someone else to perform the same work after she left. <em>Mogull, supra, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>at 462, 744 A.2d 1186. In support of this argument, defendants complain that the judge did not consider a supplemental certification submitted by Paules, their manager of executive compensation and stock options, which, according to defendants, \u201ccontained information regarding Ms. Daniels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Paules\u2019s certification did not pertain to Daniels. It merely listed 323 employees who were terminated or resigned from RCN from October 1997 through December 1999, and who lost their unvested stock options at the time of their termination. Moreover, the motion judge correctly determined that Daniels\u2019s status as a member of both of plaintiffs protected classes (age and gender) was not probative because Mahoney, who terminated plaintiff, did not hire Daniels.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Unless a plaintiff is claiming reverse discrimination, it is unnecessary to show a replacement outside of the protected class in order to satisfy the fourth prong of the prima facie case. <em>Pivirotto v. Innovative Sys., Inc., </em>191 F.3d 344, 353 (3d Cir.1999) (a woman claiming that she was discharged because of her gender need not show that she was replaced by a man); <em>Wright v. L-3 Communications Corp., </em>227 F.Supp.2d 293, 301 (D.N.J.2002) (\u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>fourth <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>element is satisfied in traditional cases if the employer sought others to perform the same work that the plaintiff performed after the plaintiff was terminated\u201d); <em>Petrusky v. Maxfli Dunlop Sports Corp., </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 82, 775 A.2d 723 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>388, 788 A.2d 772 (2001) (\u201cit is erroneous, in an ordinary case of age discrimination in employment, to use reference to a particular replacement employee as the only means for satisfying the customary fourth element of the prima facie showing\u201d); <em>Reynolds v. Palnut Co., </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 168, 748 A.2d 1216 (App.Div.2000) (a plaintiff asserting a traditional age discrimination claim need not show that he was replaced by someone younger). <em>But see Swider v. Ha-Lo Indus., Inc., </em>134 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>607, 625 (D.N.J.2001) (\u201cin order to satisfy the fourth prong of the <em>McDonnell Douglas prima facie </em>case, plaintiff must show that he was replaced by someone sufficiently younger to create an inference of unlawful age discrimination\u201d); <em>Warner v.

Ed.2d </em>at 418. \u201cThe factfinder\u2019s disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Plaintiffs prima facie case, together with rejection of the defendants\u2019 reasons, \u201cdoes not <em>compel </em>judgment for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>133, 146, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2097, 2108, 147 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>105, 119 (2000). We have adopted the analysis in <em>Reeves. See Blume v. Denville Tp. Bd. of Educ., </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 29-34, 756 A.2d 1019 (App.Div.2000) (reinstating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>jury verdict in plaintiffs favor and vacating trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion to set aside verdicts because plaintiffs evidence supported a finding of discrimination on the basis of a handicap); <em>Mattiello v. Grand Union Co., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 17, 754 A.2d 563 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>677, 762 A.2d 658 (2000) (affirming a jury verdict in favor of defendant-employer, because the judge correctly charged the jury that it may, but not must, find in favor of plaintiff, on an age discrimination claim, if it finds that defendant\u2019s proffered reason is not believable).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Court in <em>Reeves </em>explained: \u201cProof that the defendant\u2019s explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive.\u201d 530 U.S. at 147, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2108, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Defendants rely on <em>Viscik v. Fowler Equip. Co., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14, 800 A.2d 826 (2002), a handicap discrimination case, in which the Supreme Court held that after the employer articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse action,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aae\">the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was merely a pretext for discrimination. To prove pretext, however, a plaintiff must do more than simply show that the employer\u2019s reason was false; he or she must also demonstrate that the employer was motivated by discriminatory intent ____ Thus, under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, a plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of persuasion at all times____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">(Internal citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Viscik </em>is misplaced, because the Supreme Court in that case did not address the standard for a motion for summary judgment. In <em>Viscik, </em>defendant appealed after a jury verdict, and the issues were whether plaintiff had established a handicap (obesity) and whether there were errors in the jury charge. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 800 A.2d 826. The Court was emphasizing that the ultimate burden of proof was upon plaintiff and did not consider a plaintiffs burden on a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">The Third Circuit, however, has established the standard, on a motion for summary judgment, for determining whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>plaintiff alleging discrimination has produced sufficient evidence to rebut the employer\u2019s alleged legitimate reason for its adverse action. <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 <em>F.3d </em>759, 761-62 (3d Cir.1994). In <em>Fuentes, </em>the court held that a plaintiff may defeat a motion for summary judgment \u201cby <em>either </em>(i) discrediting the proffered reasons, either circumstantially or directly, or (ii) adducing evidence, whether circumstantial or direct, that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">As to the first means of proof, the <em>Fuentes </em>court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">the non-moving plaintiff must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder <em>could </em>rationally find them \u201cunworthy of credence,\u201d <em>Ezold [v. Wolf, Block, Schorr &amp; Solis-Cohen, </em>983 F.2d 509, 531 (3d Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>826, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>88, 126 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>56 (1993)], and hence infer \u201cthat the employer did not act for [the asserted] non-discriminatory reasons.\u201d <em>Josey v. John R. Hollingsworth Corp., </em>996 F.2d 632, 638 (3d Cir.1993).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">[Id. at 765 (other citations omitted; footnote omitted.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">We have adopted and consistently applied this standard. <em>See, e.g., Kolb v. Burns, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 478, 727 A.2d 525 (App.Div.1999) (teacher alleged that superintendent of schools retaliated against her for testifying for a handicapped student regarding his placement); <em>Greenberg, supra, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 200, 708 A.2d 460 (teacher alleged age and gender discrimination in denial of tenure); and <em>Romano v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 551-52, 665 A.2d 1139 (App.Div.1995) (employee alleged retaliatory discharge for testifying on behalf of a co-employee in her sexual harassment case).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Unfortunately, the motion judge here did not apply this standard. The judge addressed only the second of the two alternative ways in which plaintiff could defeat the motion for summary judgment: by adducing direct or circumstantial evidence that \u201cdiscrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause\u201d of plaintiffs discharge. <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>32 F.3d at 764. He did not consider either that plaintiff might have discredited defendants\u2019 proffered reasons, or that a jury is permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>infer discrimination on the basis of a rejection of defendants\u2019 reasons together with plaintiffs prima facie case. <em>Reeves, supra, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>at 147, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2108, 147 L.Ed.2d at 119-20; <em>St. Mary\u2019s, supra, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>at 511, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2749, 125 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Although the motion judge articulated the correct standard, he did not actually consider whether plaintiff had produced sufficient evidence to enable a jury to find that defendants\u2019 proffered reasons for her termination were false, which might also constitute circumstantial evidence of discrimination. Instead, as plaintiff points out, he focused throughout his opinion on whether each incident or piece of plaintiffs evidence alone could be the basis for an inference of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The judge viewed defendants\u2019 preferential treatment of young men, reassigning them to other positions instead of discharging them for unsatisfactory performance, as insufficient to constitute \u201can LAD violation.\u201d He failed to recognize, as a jury is entitled to do, that this is also an inconsistency, incoherency or weakness in defendants\u2019 explanation that they terminated plaintiff for unsatisfactory performance. Nor did the judge analyze any of the specific instances of this disparate treatment, which must be \u201cviewed in the light most favorable\u201d to plaintiff. <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Thirty-five-year-old Gdovin was plaintiffs predecessor as manager of customer services. Despite his failure in that role, defendants assigned him responsibility for one of the spin-off companies, Cable Michigan, while he continued his duties in programming. Jarus, to whom plaintiff reported, was accountable for the poor condition of customer service, but was retained when plaintiff was discharged. Mahoney, to whom Jarus reported, admitted that he was unable to develop a solution to the customer service problems, but was also retained when plaintiff was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>There are other facts supporting plaintiffs argument, that a rational jury could reject defendants\u2019 non-discriminatory reasons for her termination. Mahoney disagreed with plaintiffs approach to the customer service problems, but he was unable to present any alternative approach. Jarus did not permit plaintiff to develop an employee incentive plan, and rejected all of her proposals. Mahoney admitted that plaintiff did not have the authority to increase staff and meet her department\u2019s infrastructure needs. All of these explanations, of course, may also be used by a jury to find in favor of defendants. They are not a basis, however, to dismiss plaintiffs case as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The contradiction between Mahoney\u2019s testimony that he attempted to find plaintiff another position in the company, and the denials of three of the executives whom Mahoney said he approached further discredit defendants\u2019 job-performance explanation. Defendants\u2019 counter argument, that the availability of another position in the company is irrelevant, is unavailing, because the absence of another position was not one of their proffered reasons for plaintiffs termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The second reason that defendants advanced for plaintiffs termination was her personality conflict with Jarus. In his analysis, the motion judge did not consider plaintiffs contradictory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Defendants are incorrect that plaintiff admitted a personality clash with Jarus. To the contrary, she said that it was an \u201coversimplification\u201d that she and Jarus \u201cwere not a good fit.\u201d She described Jarus as a nasty, belittling, sarcastic, and condescending person, who rejected her proposals, undermined her authority, required her to report her location at all times, and excluded her from meetings. If a jury credits plaintiffs account, it could rationally find that Jarus\u2019s behavior was so extreme that it went beyond a personality conflict, and that defendant\u2019s explanation was thus unworthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">A rational jury could find that plaintiff discredited each of defendant\u2019s three alleged legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>for her termination. <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146. The evidence on each of defendants\u2019 three proffered reasons was not \u201cso one-sided\u201d that defendants \u201cmust prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>242, 252, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2505, 2512, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>202, 214 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In addition, plaintiff produced some evidence that Mahoney was prejudiced against women and treated men more favorably, which, as defendants stress, was insufficient to advance a claim for a hostile work environment, but which supports her claim that he discriminated against her when he terminated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Mahoney \u201csnickered\u201d and commented that plaintiff and another woman were discussing \u201ctechnical issues.\u201d The judge acknowledged that this was \u201csomewhat sexist\u201d but dismissed it as \u201cisolated\u201d and a \u201cpassing comment\u201d that occurred well before plaintiffs termination and did not \u201cplay a role\u201d in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In <em>Reeves, </em>an age discrimination case, the Court of Appeals discounted \u201cage-related comments\u201d of one of the decision makers because he did not make the comments in the context of plaintiffs termination. 530 <em>U.S. </em>at 152, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2111, 147 L.Ed.2d at 123. The Supreme Court admonished that the Court of Appeals \u201cfailed to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of petitioner.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Here also, the \u201csomewhat sexist\u201d comment, although not directly related to plaintiffs termination, revealed Mahoney\u2019s arguable discriminatory animus. According to plaintiff, Mahoney also had an \u201celitist\u201d and \u201cdismissive\u201d attitude toward women. This comment and attitude, taken together with Mahoney\u2019s (1) desire to reduce plaintiffs 1996 bonus, while failing to consider similar action against two male executives; (2) delay of plaintiffs 1994 stock options; and (3) desire to reduce plaintiffs number of options and increase her strike price, while not seeking to change the stock-option terms of male executives, together provide a sufficient record from which a jury could draw a rational inference of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
