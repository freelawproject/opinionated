Virginia, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>304, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002) the United States Supreme Court held that the execution of mentally retarded defendants convicted of capital murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>constituted excessive punishment that violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, it left to the states the task of developing the procedures to be utilized in determining who should thus be exempted.

We affirm the latter, but reverse the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">A. <em>The Atkins Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">In <em>Atkins, </em>a six-member majority of the Supreme Court, abrogating the Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>Penry v. Lynaugh, </em>492 <em>U.S. </em>302, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989) in light of evolving standards of decency as reflected in legislative enactments<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>other sources, found the execution of mentally retarded defendants convicted of capital murder to be excessive punishment, because that punishment was not proportional to the defendant\u2019s personal responsibility and moral guilt, and thus was violative of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments. The Court observed: \u201cmentally retarded persons frequently know the difference between right and wrong and are competent to stand trial.\u201d 536 <em>U.S. </em>at 318, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2250, 153 L.Ed.2d at 348. However, it recognized that because of their impairments, by definition the mentally retarded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">have diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and leam from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others. There is no evidence that they are more likely to engage in criminal conduct than others, but there is abundant evidence that they often act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premeditated plan, and that in group settings they are followers rather than leaders. Their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, but they do diminish their personal culpability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 318, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2250-51, 153 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 348 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">As the result of these intellectual deficiencies, the Court found two bases for the categorical exclusion of the mentally retarded from capital punishment. First, the Court found that a serious question existed as to whether either deterrence or retribution, the commonly recognized justifications for capital punishment, applied to the mentally retarded. <em>Id. </em>at 318-19, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2251, 153 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 349. Retribution, the Court found, was a concept that required proportionality between the severity of the punishment and the culpability of the offender \u2014 a culpability that was recognized to be lessened in the retarded. \u201cIf the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of retribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2251, 153 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 349. The Court similarly found that deterrence did not present a compelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>rationale for the imposition of the death penalty upon the mentally retarded because \u201cthe same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpable \u2014 for example, the diminished ability to understand and process information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, or to control impulses \u2014 ... also make it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that information.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 320, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2251, <em>153 L.Ed.2d </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Additionally, the Supreme Court observed that \u201csome characteristics of mental retardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2250, 153 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 348. As a consequence, a risk exists that the death penalty will be imposed despite factors that may call for a lesser penalty. <em>Id. </em>at 320, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2251, <em>153 L.Ed.2d </em>at 350 (quoting <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>586, 605, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2954, 2965, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>973, 990 (1978)). Not only is there a possibility of false confessions, but also mentally retarded defendants may possess a lesser ability \u201cto make a persuasive showing of mitigation in the face of prosecutorial evidence of one or more aggravating factors. Mentally retarded defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and are typically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320-21, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2251-52, 153 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 350. Further, the Court found, reliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor, a device frequently employed in capital sentencing, may be counterproductive, since jurors may construe the existence of the condition, instead, as enhancing the likelihood of future dangerousness, a commonly-employed aggravating factor. <em>Id. </em>at 321, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2252, 153 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 350. Mentally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>retarded defendants in the aggregate face a special risk of wrongful execution. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Atkins </em>forms a part of a trilogy, consisting also of <em>Ford v. Wainwright, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>399, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986) (holding that the Eighth Amendment prohibits states from inflicting the death penalty upon a defendant who is insane) and <em>Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>551, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (holding that execution of a defendant who commits a capital crime while under the age of eighteen is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment). In both <em>Ford </em>and <em>Atkins, </em>the Court left \u201cto the State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon [their] execution of sentences.\u201d <em>Ford, supra, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>at 416-17, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2605, 91 L.Ed.2d at 351; <em>Atkins, supra, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>at 317, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2250, 153 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Although the Court\u2019s procedural invitation is seemingly broad, we recognize it to be limited not only by the strictures of the United States Constitution, but also those of the Constitution of New Jersey. <em>See id., </em>art. I, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">We are also very mindful of the fact that what we are concerned with here is the implementation of the death penalty, not some lesser, reversible punishment. <em>Atkins </em>has established that even in cases in which capital punishment would otherwise appear warranted, that sanction cannot constitutionally be applied to the retarded. As stated in non-eategorical terms in <em>Roper:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">The death penalty may not be imposed on certain classes of offenders, such as juveniles under [18], the insane, and the mentally retarded, no matter how heinous the crime. These rules vindicate the underlying principle that the death penalty is reserved for a narrow category of crimes and offenders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">[543 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1195, 161 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 21 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">This is so, in the case of retardation, because we as a civilized society can no longer justify the infliction of so irrevocable a penalty upon one whose culpability is lessened by mental infirmity. Lingering concerns regarding the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings involving the mentally retarded reinforce that view. In <em>Ford, </em>the Court observed that in capital proceedings, it \u201chas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>demanded that factfinding procedures aspire to a heightened standard of reliability.\u201d 477 <em>U.S. </em>at 411, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2602, 91 L.Ed.2d at 347. And the Court has held if, as here, the Constitution renders the fact of execution contingent upon the establishment of a further fact \u2014 the mental status of the defendant \u2014 \u201cthen that fact must be determined with the high regard for truth that befits a decision affecting the life or death of a human being.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2602-03, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 347-48. <em>See also State v. Harris, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>391, 525, 859 A.2d 364 (2004) <em>(Harris III) </em>(quoting <em>Ford), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>2973, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2005). We thus view a maximal reduction of the risk of wrongful execution to constitute both a moral and a constitutional imperative. That view underlies our opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">B. <em>The Capital Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">In order to place the present issues in context, we briefly summarize the procedures employed in New Jersey in a capital prosecution. As described by the Court in <em>State v. Fortin, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>540, 843 A.2d 974 (2004) <em>(Fortin </em>II):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">Under New Jersey\u2019s death penally statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3c, the State must prove specific facts in each step of a three-tiered process before a defendant may be sentenced to death. First, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant purposefully or knowingly caused death or serious bodily injury resulting in death. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(1), (2). Second, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt one of the capital \u201ctriggers\u201d in order to advance the defendant to the penalty-phase trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\"><em>[Id. </em>at 634, 843 A.2d 974.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">If the jury is unable to agree that one of the triggers has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least thirty years without parole eligibility pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b(1) or to life imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>with no possibility of parole pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b(2) or (3). If the jury unanimously finds a capital trigger to exist then,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">[t]hird, in the penalty-phase trial, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of any alleged statutory aggravating factors. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c(2)(a). If the jury finds one or more aggravating factors, it must then determine whether those outweigh all of the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c(3)(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\"><em>[Fortin II, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 635, 843 A.2d 974.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The defendant has the burden of producing evidence of the existence of any mitigating factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c(5) \u201cbut shall not have a burden with regard to the establishment of a mitigating factor.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c(2)(a). Prior to <em>Atkins, </em>mental retardation could be considered solely as a mitigating factor. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c(5)(d) or (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">(a) If the jury or the court finds that any aggravating factors exist and that all of the aggravating factors outweigh beyond a reasonable doubt all of the mitigating factors, the court shall sentence the defendant to death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">(b) If the jury or the court finds that no aggravating factors exist, or that all of the aggravating factors which exist do not outweigh all of the mitigating factors, the court shall sentence the defendant pursuant to subsection b.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\">(c) If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the court shall sentence the defendant pursuant to subsection b.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">Subsection b(3)(a) and (b) specify that a person convicted of murder of a child under the age of fourteen years while in the course of the commission of sexual assault in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2 or criminal sexual contact in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3 who is not sentenced to death shall be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">Thus, in summary, a finding by the jury of purposeful or knowing murder only exposes a defendant to a sentence between thirty years and life imprisonment. \u201cWithout any other finding by the jury, life imprisonment is the maximum allowable sentence under the capital-murder statute.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b. \u201cThe jury must find a capital trigger <em>and </em>an aggravating factor to elevate the punishment from a term of imprisonment to death.\u201d <em>Fortin II, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 636, 843 A.2d 974 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>C. <em>Facts of This Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">On May 22, 2001, the body of W.C., a ten-year-old boy, was found near the Whippany River in Morristown after a two-day search. When discovered, the child\u2019s body showed evidence of multiple stab wounds. It is alleged that his head had been bludgeoned with a garden tool, that he had been sexually assaulted, and that evidence of semen was found in his underpants.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Investigation, described in fuller detail by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Jimenez, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>475, 815 A.2d 976 (2003), led the police to defendant, who gave a lengthy confession to the police following his arrest on May 28, 2001 that contained details of the murder. In September 2001, defendant was charged by a Morris County Grand Jury with murder in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(1) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(2) (count one), two counts of felony murder in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(3) (counts two and four), kidnapping in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-1b (count three), attempted aggravated sexual assault in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(1) (count five), attempted aggravated sexual assault in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(6) (count six), and third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4d (count seven.) The State notified Jimenez of its intent to seek the death penalty by filing a notice of aggravating factors pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c(2) and <em>R. </em>3:13\u2014 4(a). However, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fortin II, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 632-650, 843 A.2d 974, finding that aggravating factors are the functional equivalent of elements of capital murder and thus must be submitted to a grand jury and returned in an indictment, Jimenez\u2019s case was re-presented to a grand jury together with allegedly applicable aggravating factors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>perseding indictment amending count one to include the aggravating factors found by the grand jury and otherwise containing the same counts was handed down.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Prior to trial, counsel for Jimenez advised the court and the State that they intended to pursue an <em>Atkins </em>claim on Jimenez\u2019s behalf and, in that connection, they submitted the September 17, 2004 report of Frank J. Dyer, Ph.D., an expert in forensic psychology. The trial judge then requested that both parties propose procedures to permit an adjudication of the mental retardation issue. On September 23, 2004, the defense filed a motion seeking an order that would preclude the State from seeking the death penalty and would establish specific procedures to assess Jimenez\u2019s retardation claim. The State then successfully sought to compel a mental evaluation of Jimenez, which was conducted by forensic psychologist Frank Dattilio, Ph.D.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dr. Dattilio issued reports dated December 24, 2004 and January 25, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Both the State and the defense have agreed that the appropriate definition for mental retardation is that promulgated by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and contained in its <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>(DSM-IV) (4th ed.2000), which requires evidence of significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning (Criterion A), accompanied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two enumerated skill areas (Criterion B) and onset before the age of eighteen years (Criterion C). Significantly subaverage intellectual function is defined as an IQ of 70 or below, as measured by one or more of the standardized individually administered intelligence tests. Because a measurement error of five points in assessing IQ is recognized, a score of 70 in actuality may represent a range of 65 to 75. Mild mental retardation is generally associated with IQ levels in the range of 50-55 to 70; moderate retardation with IQ levels of 35-40 to 50-55; severe retardation with IQ levels of 20-25 to 35-40; and profound mental retardation with IQ levels below 20 or 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In addition to evidence of IQ levels within the specified range, a diagnosis of mental retardation depends on a determination that the person has significant limitations in adaptive function in at least two of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety. In the context of a criminal prosecution, the fact that the condition must arise before the person is eighteen years of age provides important protections against specious claims premised on symptoms manifesting at or around the time of that prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Because a mentally retarded defendant must nonetheless possess the mental competency to stand trial, we assume that the vast majority of defendants to whom <em>Atkins </em>may apply will be found to suffer from mild mental retardation. The <em>DSM-IV </em>describes mild mental retardation in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">Mild Mental Retardation is roughly equivalent to what used to be referred to as the educational category of \u201ceducable.\u201d This group constitutes the largest segment (about 85%) of those with the disorder. As a group, people with this level of Mental Retardation typically develop social and communication skills during the preschool years (ages 0-5 years), have minimal impairment in sensorimotor areas, and often are not distinguishable from children without Mental Retardation until a later age. By their late teens, they can acquire academic skills up to approximately the sixth-grade level. During their adult years, they usually achieve social and vocational skills adequate for minimum self-support, but may need supervision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>guidance, and assistance, especially when under unusual social or economic stress. With appropriate supports, individuals with Mild Mental Retardation can usually live successfully in the community, either independently or in supervised settings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The defendant in <em>Atkins </em>was alleged to be mildly mentally retarded, with an IQ of 59. <em>Atkins, supra, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>at 309, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2245, 153 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 342. His mental age was described by dissenting members of the Supreme Court of Virginia as between nine and 12. <em>Id. </em>at 310, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2246, 153 L.Ed.2d at 343 (citing <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>260 <em>Va. </em>375, 534 <em>S.E.2d </em>312, 323-25 (2000) (dissenting opinion of Justices Hassell and Koontz)).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">In the present case, both Dyer and Dattilio agreed, following administration in Spanish of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that Jimenez\u2019s IQ fell into the Mildly Retarded range. Dr. Dyer obtained a score of 68, whereas Dr. Dattilio obtained a score of 69. However, the two experts differed as to Jimenez\u2019s adaptive functioning. Dr. Dyer found him to be deficient in a number of areas of adaptive behavior, whereas Dr. Dattilio did not.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">D. <em>Trial Court Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Following briefing and argument, on March 7, 2005, the trial judge issued a written opinion establishing the procedures to be utilized in determining Jimenez\u2019s mental status.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">He commenced by affirming that the utilization of the <em>DSM-IV </em>definition of mental retardation accorded with the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Harris III, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 528-530, 859 A.2d 364 and <em>Atkins, supra, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>at 308 n. 3, 317 n. 22, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2245 n. 3, 2250 n. 22, 153 L.Ed.2d at 342 n. 3, 348 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>n. 22 (both citing without reservation the substantially similar definitions of mental retardation adopted by the American Association on Mental Retardation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the American Psychiatric Association).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The judge then considered whether both the Sixth and Eighth Amendments applied to the issue at hand. In this connection, he noted recent United States Supreme Court precedent applying the Sixth Amendment to sentences that were enhanced without a finding by a jury of the facts underlying the enhancement. <em>See, Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>466, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>296, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The judge also noted that a decision of ours construing <em>Blakely </em>remained under consideration by the Supreme Court. <em>See State v. Natale, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>226, 861 A.2d 148 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. granted, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>425, 866 A.2d 981 (2005).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He further noted that the Court in mandating a hearing to assess mental retardation in a post-conviction relief context in <em>Harris III, </em>but not finding one necessary after ruling that the defendant had not demonstrated that he was retarded, had not specifically addressed <em>Blakely. </em>However, the judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtM\">If, however, <em>Blakely </em>has any impact on the mental retardation issue, then the required hearing, as I read <em>Harris III, </em>may not be necessary. I presently do not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s view on this issue. If <em>Blakely </em>does, in fact, affect <em>Harris III, </em>that may mean once there is a \u201cshowing,\u201d the retardation issue would be an issue to be determined by a jury with the heavy burden upon the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Despite strong indications that he thought an assessment of Jimenez\u2019s mental condition raised Sixth Amendment concerns requiring jury resolution, the trial judge, influenced by <em>Harris III, </em>established pre-trial hearing procedures as well. He ruled that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>a credible issue as to retardation were demonstrated (as here), a pre-trial hearing should take place pursuant to <em>Harris III, </em>at which the Rules of Evidence would apply and sworn expert testimony would be required. At that hearing, defendant would have the burden of proving his retardation. If proof of such condition were established by clear and convincing evidence, then trial would proceed as a non-capital matter. If proof were established by a preponderance of the evidence, the issue would be reserved for jury consideration at the commencement of the penalty phase, and the State would have the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was not retarded. If defendant\u2019s proofs fell below the preponderance standard, then the issue of mental retardation would not be presented to the jury for its consideration as a potential bar, in and of itself, to execution. However, such evidence could be adduced in the penalty phase as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">As we have previously noted, both the State and the defense moved for leave to appeal from the trial court\u2019s ruling. We granted both motions by orders dated March 23, 2005. The State\u2019s motion for direct certification by the Supreme Court was denied on April 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Before us are the following issues: (1) the standard of proof (preponderance, clear and convincing evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt); (2) the burden of proof (State or defense); (3) the factfinder (judge or jury); and (4) the timing of the decision (pretrial, post-guilt phase or both).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">E. <em>The Parties </em>\u2019 <em>Positions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">On appeal, the State argues that the trial judge improperly applied Sixth Amendment trial-by-jury requirements to defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>dant\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim, and that a jury\u2019s determination of the non-existence of mental retardation is not required. Moreover, the State contends, because the lack of retardation is not an \u201celement\u201d of capital murder, the burden of proof that retardation exists properly can be placed upon the defendant, who must demonstrate the condition by a preponderance of the credible evidence. The State argues that the determination should be made pre-trial, by the court, sitting without a jury. However, it contends that if a jury is employed, the burden of proof should still remain with the defendant. If the defendant fails to meet his burden of proof at the pre-trial or other hearing, then his mental status could be used only as a mitigating factor in the penalty phase. A penalty phase would be required, it contends, even if the defendant were found to be retarded, for the limited purpose of determining a defendant\u2019s eligibility for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In contrast, the defense argues that the fact of a defendant\u2019s mental retardation presents a jury issue under the Sixth Amendment that must be determined in a separate proceeding between the guilt and penalty phases. There, the defense contends, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is not mentally retarded before the case can proceed to a traditional penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The defense agrees with the State that, initially, a pre-trial determination of the retardation issue by a judge is appropriate because a finding of retardation will result in a substantial savings of resources and time. However, it contends that a judicial determination that a defendant is <em>not </em>mentally retarded cannot substitute for an ultimate determination by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Both the State and the defense agree that the issue of retardation must be considered if a defendant presents a \u201ccolorable\u201d claim of retardation pre-trial. As we have previously recognized, they agree as well as to the psychiatric standard applicable to a determination of retardation. We will therefore not discuss either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>of these .issues further, being in substantial agreement with the parties\u2019 positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">A. <em>Retroactivity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The parties have not addressed the issue of the retroactivity of <em>Atkins, </em>and that subject was not addressed by the Supreme Court in its decision. However, in <em>Penry, supra, </em>the Supreme Court found unanimously that any decision exempting a defendant from execution on Eighth Amendment grounds as the result of mental retardation would be applied retroactively to include all cases on collateral review. 492 <em>U.S. </em>at 313-319, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2944-47, 106 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 274-78. The Supreme Court permitted consideration of <em>Atkins </em>issues raised on post conviction review in <em>Harris III, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 520-21, 859 A.2d 364. We thus find no impediment to our consideration of the issue in connection with a pre-trial interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">B. <em>The Effect ofApprendi, Ring, Blakely, and Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">As we have stated, the State takes a position different from the defense when it argues that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantees of trial by jury are inapplicable in this <em>Atkins </em>context. As we will later explain, our resolution of this issue is substantially influenced not only by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence but also by the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s utilization of that precedent in <em>Fortin II </em>when determining the related issue of the necessity of presentation to the grand jury of those aggravating factors necessary to elevate murder to a capital crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">The Sixth Amendment issue arises as the result of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>466, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2348, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>435; <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>584, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002); <em>Blakely v. Washington, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>296, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>L.Ed.2d 403; and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>220, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>738, <em>160 </em>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We find throughout these decisions a consistent adherence to the principle that the existence of those facts, whether denominated statutory \u201celements\u201d of a crime or not, that serve to permit an increase in the penalty imposed upon a criminal defendant must, under the Sixth Amendment, be decided by the jury upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>defendant was convicted, following a plea of guilty, to two counts of second-degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4a, and one count of third-degree unlawful possession of an anti-personnel bomb, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-3a. Prior to sentencing, the State moved for imposition of an extended term of imprisonment on one of the second-degree weapons convictions pursuant to the State\u2019s hate crime statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3(e), which permitted enhanced sentencing by a judge in any case in which \u201c[t]he defendant in committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">At a pre-sentencing evidentiary hearing held to consider Apprendi\u2019s purpose in the conduct at issue, the judge determined by a preponderance of the evidence that his crime was motivated by racial bias and that his actions, consisting of firing shots at the home of a black family, were taken with a purpose to intimidate. The judge found the hate crime statute applicable to Apprendi on this basis and imposed an extended term on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">On appeal, Apprendi argued that the racial bias that permitted sentencing above the maximum that was otherwise applicable to his second-degree weapons offense was transformed through the State\u2019s sentencing laws into the functional equivalent of an element of his weapons crime, and that the court\u2019s procedures thus violated his right under the Fourteenth Amendment to due process prior to any deprivation of liberty and his right under the Sixth Amendment to have his guilt determined by a jury verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That argument was accepted by the United States Supreme Court, which held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 <em>U.S. </em>at 490, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In Apprendi\u2019s case, the Court found, the hate crimes sentencing enhancement imposed a second <em>mens rea </em>requirement of a finding of a \u201cpurpose to intimidate\u201d on account of, in his case, race. <em>Id. </em>at 492-93, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2364, 147 L.Ed.2d at 456-57. The Court held that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s intent in committing a crime is perhaps as close as one might hope to come to a core criminal offense \u2018element\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2364, 147 L.Ed.2d at 457. Moreover, the Court noted that the finding of intent required by the hate crime statute exposed Apprendi to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, turning a second-degree crime into a first-degree one for sentencing purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 494, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2365, 147 L.Ed.2d at 457. It thus concluded, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not of form, but of effect \u2014 does the required finding expose the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict?\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court answered that question affirmatively, thereby requiring a jury\u2019s determination beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">Both in terms of absolute years behind bars, and because of the more severe stigma attached, the differential here [between potential sentences of 10 and 20 years] is unquestionably of constitutional significance. When a judge\u2019s finding based on a mere preponderance of the evidence authorizes an increase in the maximum punishment, it is appropriately characterized as \u201ca tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 495, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2365, <em>147 L.Ed.2d </em>at 458 (quoting <em>McMillan v.

The Court\u2019s reasoning closely followed that of the majority in <em>Apprendi, </em>in that it viewed sentencing factors functionally when determining whether the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantees applied.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 536 <em>U.S. </em>at 609, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2443, 153 L.Ed.2d at 577 (quoting <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>at 494 n. 19, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2365 n. 19, 147 L.Ed.2d at 457 n. 19).

This prescription governs, <em>Apprendi </em>determined, even if the State characterizes the additional findings made by the judge as \u201csentencing factor[s].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 492, <em>120 S.Ct. </em>at 2363-64, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 456].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\"><em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>reasoning is irreconcilable with <em>Walton\u2019s </em>holding in this regard, and today we overrule <em>Walton </em>in relevant part.

We hold that the Sixth Amendment applies to both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">[Id. at 609, <em>122 S.Ct. </em>at 2443, 153 L.Ed.2d at 577.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Ring </em>and the functional approach to the characterization of sentence enhancements for Sixth Amendment purposes that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>decisions embody constituted the foundation for the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fortin II, </em>in which the Court determined as a matter of state constitutional law that the aggravating factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c(4) essentially were elements of capital murder that must be presented to a grand jury, just as evidence of their presence must be determined by a petit jury to exist, beyond a reasonable doubt, during the penalty phase of a capital proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The <em>Fortin II </em>Court\u2019s focus was on the necessity of the presentment to a grand jury of aggravating factors \u2014 a Fifth Amendment concern under the United States Constitution and federal law, but one determined by the <em>Fortin </em>Court as a matter of State constitutional law under Article 1, paragraph 8.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, because its analysis turned on <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Ring, </em>both of which essentially were Sixth Amendment petit jury cases, we find the Court\u2019s rationale of significance in the present instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In particular, we note the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of New Jersey\u2019s capital murder statute as accretive in nature. Although the potential for the imposition of a death penalty inheres within the statute \u2014 a point upon which the State\u2019s arguments to a large extent depend \u2014 and to that extent death constitutes the statutory \u201cmaximum\u201d provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c, the Court did not view the statute in that fashion. Rather, it viewed the implementation of the statute as a three-step process \u2014 requiring a sequential finding of (1) knowing or purposeful murder, (2) the existence of a capital trigger and (3) one or more aggravating factors that outweighed beyond a reasonable doubt any mitigating factors\u2014 before death could be imposed. 178 <em>N.J. </em>at 634-35, 843 A.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Because each step serves to increase the potential penalty, the <em>Fortin II </em>Court held that under <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Ring </em>\u201c[t]he jury\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and not the court, \u201cmust find a capital trigger <em>and </em>an aggravating factor to elevate the punishment from a term of imprisonment to death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636, 843 A.2d 974 (emphasis supplied). Abrogating its prior holding in <em>Martini I, </em>the Court held that the aggravating factors \u2014 and presumably the capital triggers \u2014 do not merely enlarge the available sentencing options for certain defendants, as the State has argued here. <em>Id. </em>at 637, 843 A.2d 974 (quoting <em>State v. Martini, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 224, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993) <em>(Martini </em>I)). The <em>Fortin II </em>Court acknowledged <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>holding that the \u201crelevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect \u2014 does the required finding expose the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641, 843 A.2d 974 (quoting <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>at 494, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2365, <em>147 L.Ed.2d </em>at 457).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Since <em>Fortin, </em>the United States Supreme Court has also decided <em>Blakely, </em>holding there that a Washington judge violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights when he sentenced him to a term greater than the maximum he could have otherwise imposed as the result of his determination that in defendant\u2019s manner of kidnapping his wife, defendant had acted with \u201cdeliberate cruelty\u201d \u2014 a fact neither admitted by the defendant nor found by a jury. 542 <em>U.S. </em>at 303, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2537, <em>159 L.Ed.2d </em>at 413.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">Our precedents make clear ... that the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>... In other words, the relevant \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.

We read <em>Atkins, </em>as implemented under this State\u2019s statutory scheme, as transforming mental retardation from solely a mitigating factor to the functional equivalent of a capital trigger, since death can be imposed only upon those who are not retarded.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">We are also persuaded that if, as the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases dictates, Jimenez has the right to insist that the State prove to a jury all facts legally essential to his punishment, once the issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>raised, the fact that he is not retarded must be proven in like fashion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This is so because the existence of a capital trigger constitutes a threshold determination of fact forming a condition precedent to the imposition of a death sentence, similar to the aggravating factors that were the subject of <em>Ring </em>and, in a non-capital context, the sentencing factors considered in <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker. See State v. Loftin, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>295, 349, 680 A.2d 677 (1996) <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c imposes a triggering device for the death penalty \u2014 an additional requirement that renders the defendant death-eligible). Thus its effect is to act as a sentencing enhancer under the interpretation of our capital sentencing scheme adopted in <em>Fortin II. </em>Although a lack of retardation would not constitute a threshold consideration in every case (or indeed, in most cases), when a defendant\u2019s mental status has been placed in issue, as here, we find a clear right on the part of a defendant to insist that a juiy determine whether he is mentally retarded and thus whether that threshold to the imposition of a death sentence can be met, or whether he is barred from execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\"><em>In re Winship, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>358, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), together with <em>Ring, </em>requires as a matter of due process, that the absence of retardation be established by the State beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See also, e.g., State v. Stanton, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>75, 87-88, 820 A.2d 637 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Such a determination, we find, should be made in the second phase of a capital murder trial, immediately following a determination of defendant\u2019s guilt. The same jury should be utilized. <em>State v. Chenique-Puey, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>334, 343, 678 A.2d 694 (1996); <em>State v. Ragland, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>189, 195, 519 A.2d 1361 (1986). The jury must be informed of the consequences of its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>including the likely term of imprisonment if defendant is found to be mentally retarded and, if the matter is to proceed as a capital prosecution, the jury must determine unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is not mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The Court has previously held in a double jeopardy context that the requirement of the death penalty statute that the murder be by defendant\u2019s \u201cown conduct\u201d does not constitute an \u201celement\u201d of the crime of murder, but rather a \u201ctriggering device.\u201d <em>State v. Cruz, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>419, 426-27, 794 A.2d 165 (2002). <em>See also State v. Gerald, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>40, 100, 549 A.2d 792 (1988). We do not regard those decisions as precluding our present interpretation, since in neither case was the issue that we address specifically raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">We find as well as a matter of public policy that the risk of error \u2014 of putting to death one who should rightfully be constitutionally exempt \u2014 is too great for any burden of proof to be placed upon the defendant and for the determination of death qualification to be made by the trial judge, as it is in some states.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Jimenez or any other capital defendant is in fact retarded, the whole purpose for the imposition of the death penalty is lost, since as <em>Atkins </em>recognizes, it provides neither effective deterrence nor retribution and has been determined to be inhumane. As the Court noted in <em>Ring, </em>Arizona had suggested in that case that a judicial determination of aggravating factors might be a better guarantee against the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. However, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">Entrusting to a judge the finding of facts necessary to support a death sentence might be</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201can admirably fair and efficient scheme of criminal justice designed for a society that is prepared to leave criminal justice to the State____The founders of the American Republic were not prepared to leave it to the State, which is why the jury-trial guarantee was one of the least controversial provisions of the Bill of Rights.

It would thus be anomalous to increase the court\u2019s power in this one instance, while diminishing that of the jury.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">It has been argued that such a shift is justified in this circumstance because, as recognized in <em>Atkins, </em>mentally retarded individuals may be poor witnesses, may not be perceived as exhibiting remorse, and may be regarded by a jury as posing a greater risk of future dangerousness. <em>Atkins, supra, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>at 321, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2252, 153 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 350. However, nothing in <em>Atkins </em>indicates that a single judge is better equipped than a jury to recognize and consider the deficiencies of a retarded person or to assess his future dangerousness. We thus view the jury not as an impediment but as an important bulwark standing between the individual defendant and the power of the government to execute him. <em>See Booker, supra, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 752, 160 L.Ed.2d at 645. Moreover, we regard the existence of the due process and perceptual problems recognized in <em>Atkins </em>as providing a practical ground for raising the level of proof from a preponderance of the evidence to one of beyond a reasonable doubt, thereby providing added assurance to the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>In a concurring opinion in <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>Justice Harlan discussed the State\u2019s burden of proof in a different context, but nonetheless in terms of relevance here.

[397 <em>U.S. </em>at 372, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1076-77, 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 380.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Here, where the consequences of error are so immeasurably more severe, we accord the Justice\u2019s comments added weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">As the defense recognizes, placing the burden upon the State to demonstrate to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Jimenez is not mentally retarded is consistent with the State\u2019s treatment of diminished capacity. <em>See State v. Delibero, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>90, 692 A.2d 981 (1997). <em>See also State v. Breakiron, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>591, 532 A.2d 199 (1987). Although as the State notes, insanity is an affirmative defense that must be proven by a defendant by a preponderance of the credible evidence, a claim of diminished capacity operates differently. \u201cA jury considers evidence of diminished capacity in relation to the State\u2019s burden to prove the essential elements of the crime.\u201d <em>Delibero, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 98, 692 A.2d 981 (citing <em>State v. Harris, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>525, 555, 662 A.2d 333 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Although the State argues otherwise, we find a claim of mental retardation to more closely resemble that of diminished capacity than insanity. \u201cDiminished capacity describes a disease or defect of mind that may negate the mental state that is an element of the offense charged\u201d whereas \u201c[t]he insanity defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>exculpates an actor from guilt for conduct that would otherwise be criminal.\u201d <em>Delibero, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 92-93, 692 A.2d 981. Although mental retardation, at least as asserted by one competent to stand trial, does not negate a defendant\u2019s state of mind, and he may still be found guilty of knowing or purposeful murder, it does negate a trigger essential to the imposition of the penalty of death and to that extent is similar. Rather than negating a mental condition to the crime, it negates a mental condition necessary to the implementation of the extreme penalty of death\u2014 the ability to appreciate the deterrent and retributive purposes of capital punishment. Mental retardation differs markedly from insanity in this regard, since insanity absolves a defendant from guilt, whereas mental retardation merely absolves a defendant from a form of punishment. Mental retardation, as we have previously demonstrated, can no longer be viewed as exculpatory, as insanity is viewed, or solely as a factor in mitigation of sentence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We recognize as well that the procedures that we have adopted are consistent with those recommended, following considered study, by the Trial Judges Committee on Capital Causes. <em>See Judges Bench Manual for Capital Causes </em>at 65-74 (January 1, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">As a final matter, we turn to the trial court\u2019s pre-trial procedures for the implementation of <em>Atkins. </em>The court proposed that when a colorable claim of mental retardation had been made, the issue of its existence would be considered by the court prior to trial in a hearing to which the Rules of Evidence would apply. Unlike the post-guilt phase proceedings that the court also proposed, here, the defendant would have the burden of proof, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>if met by clear and convincing evidence, would eliminate the necessity of a penalty phase. If met only by a preponderance of the evidence, the issue would then be reserved for the jury\u2019s consideration under Sixth Amendment standards after the guilt phase. If lesser proof were found by the court to exist, the defendant could only utilize his mental status as a traditional mitigating factor in the penalty phase of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">It is here that we disagree with that court\u2019s thoughtful analysis, finding that the hearing procedures of <em>Harris III </em>upon which the trial court\u2019s decision appears to have depended were proposed in a different, post-conviction relief context, and that a hearing and factfinding of the sort envisioned by the judge have no place in a case in which a claim of mental retardation is raised prior to trial. We regard the court\u2019s concern that the specter of execution not hang over a defendant unnecessarily and that the cost of a capital prosecution be minimized when possible to have been both rationally and humanely founded. Thus, we find that if reasonable minds could not differ as to the existence of a defendant\u2019s mental retardation, that determination should be made as early in the proceeding as practicable. However, we doubt that such a circumstance will arise among those defendants (who we assume will at most be mildly retarded) that a prosecutor will seek to prosecute capitally, because the difficulty of applying the <em>DSM-IV\u2019s </em>adaptive skill factors will in all likelihood lead to divergent views of a defendant\u2019s mental capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Because we have determined that when the contrary is asserted, the fact that a capital defendant is not mentally retarded constitutes a triggering event with constitutional implications, we cannot in any other circumstance, consistent with constitutional principles, permit a shift in the burden of proof, a change in the degree of proof,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or the substitution of a judge as factfinder for a jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The constitution does not permit a judge to function as a gatekeeper in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">As a practical matter, we note as well the State\u2019s argument that regardless of the result of a pre-trial hearing, a weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors in a penalty phase proceeding may be required in order to determine whether a life sentence without parole should be employed. Further, we have concerns that a pretrial determination of mental condition will inevitably lead to motions for leave to appeal by the disappointed party and a likelihood of fractionated appellate review that would be eliminated if all guilt and sentencing issues were considered together following the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">YII.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In summary, we reverse the order of the trial court as it relates to pre-trial procedures designed to resolve the issue of whether Jimenez is mentally retarded, finding that a judge can make that decision pre-trial only in those rare occasions in which reasonable minds cannot differ as to the existence of retardation. We affirm his order as it relates to proceedings after the guilt phase, finding on state constitutional and policy grounds that when the issue of retardation has been properly raised, the lack of retardation functions in a manner similar to a triggering factor to be determined by a jury in the second, post-guilt, phase of a capital prosecution, with the State bearing the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Even if the defendant is found by a jury not to be mentally retarded, evidence of his mental status can be introduced as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The court\u2019s order is thus affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-9\"> Bills to govern the procedures for assessing mental retardation and to amend the New Jersey Constitution to bar the death penalty for the mentally retarded have been introduced in the New Jersey Legislature, but have never been released from committee.

Instead, the Court left it to the states, in the first instance, to create processes for the adjudication of mental retardation claims. Having granted the motions of both the State and defendant for leave to appeal the order of March 7, 2005 \u2014 an order which memorialized the trial judge\u2019s laudable efforts at constructing sensible parameters for the <em>Atkins </em>adjudication required in this ease \u2014 we resolved to \u201ctinker with the machinery of death,\u201d <em>Callins v.

Accordingly, we are required to engage in what some may critically refer to as \u201cjudicial activism,\u201d an enterprise that is, in this circumstance, and quite often others, unavoidable. We are not permitted the luxury of inaction; we are obligated to establish a procedure by which defendant\u2019s claim of mental retardation may be constitutionally adjudicated because defendant stands in the dock accused of murder, and because the State insists upon taking his life if he is convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">I agree with my colleagues that (a) the State must be put to the burden of proving the absence of mental retardation when a colorable issue is presented; (b) the State\u2019s burden is to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>absence of mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt; (c) the jury must be the factfinder; and (d) a defendant may never be put to any burden of persuasion at any pretrial proceeding concerning the issue.

Assigning the burden of persuasion to the State.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In holding that the State must bear the burden of proving the absence of mental retardation, the majority has thoroughly and forcefully described the requirements of the Sixth Amendment as outlined in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>466, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Ring v.

Washington, 542 U.S. </em>296, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>220, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). These authorities demonstrate that the Sixth Amendment, as well as art. I, \u00b6 9 of our state constitution, requires that the State bear the burden of proving that this defendant is not mentally retarded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\n<em>B. Defining the burden of persuasion as requiring proof of the absence of mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The level of proof that the State must meet \u2014 proof beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 is also required by the federal and state constitutions. In recent non-capital cases, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires that facts which would increase a sentence by years had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt because of the serious loss of liberty at stake. <em>See Booker, supra, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 756, 160 L.Ed.2d at 650; <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at 301, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2536, 159 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 412; <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>at 490, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d at 455. <em>Accord Natale II, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 473-75, 878 A.2d 724; <em>Franklin, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 530-32, 878 A.2d 757; <em>Abdullah, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 498-99, 504-05, 878 A.2d 746. It inexorably follows from these authorities that the enormity of imposing a death sentence instead of a prison term also requires that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is not mentally retarded. Since the Supreme Court has now construed the Eighth Amendment in a manner that precludes the execution of mentally retarded defendants, it would be incomprehensible to assume that either the federal or state constitutions would authorize the execution of an individual even if the factfinder harbored a reasonable doubt about whether that individual was mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">While many of the death penalty states have imposed lesser standards in response to the <em>Atkins </em>mandate, I agree with my colleagues that the State must be held to the burden of proving the absence of mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt. Considering this defendant\u2019s low IQ, as recognized by both his and the State\u2019s expert, and his likely limited ability to assist in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>defense at either the guilt or sentencing phases \u2014 and considering that the imposition of death is irrevocable \u2014 I believe that the federal and state constitutions require that a defendant may be found eligible for a death sentence only through the application of the criminal justice system\u2019s highest standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Indeed, I also believe we can infer from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3 that the Legislature, if it had acted in this regard, would have imposed the reasonable doubt standard upon the State. Nothing in this statute suggests that defendant is required to prove anything during a death sentence proceeding, nor is there anything in the statute to suggest that the State is permitted to prove any factor that would render a defendant eligible for a death sentence by a standard any less rigorous than the reasonable doubt standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, I am convinced that if the Legislature were to act to conform <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3 to the requirements of <em>Atkins, </em>it would recognize its obligation to adopt the standards we have imposed in order to adhere to the requirements of the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\n<em>C. Identifying the jury as the constitutionally-required factfinder.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">I would also conclude that our holding that the <em>Atkins </em>issue should be decided by a jury is not only compelled by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3 and <em>State v. Fortin, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>540, 634-35, 843 A.2d 974 (2004), but also, in my view, by the Sixth Amendment. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court explained the historical position of the jury as a protection constitutionally available to the individual against the strong forces of the State.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 530 <em>U.S. </em>at 477, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2356, 147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 447 (\u201cTo guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of our rules and as the great bulwark of our civil and political liberties, trial by jury has been understood to require that the truth of every accusation ... should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of the defendant\u2019s equals and neighbors.\u201d); <em>accord In re Winship, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>358, 362, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1068, 1071, 25 L.Ed.2d 368, 374 (1970) (\u201cThis notion \u2014 basic in our law and rightly one of the boasts of a free society \u2014 is a requirement and a safeguard of due process of law in the historic, procedural content of \u2018due process.\u2019 \u201d). This was recognized very recently by our Supreme Court. <em>Natale II, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 472-73, 878 A.2d 724; <em>Franklin, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 530-32, 878 A.2d 757. While the <em>Apprendi </em>Court stated that its holding did not alter capital sentencing schemes, 530 <em>U.S. </em>at 496, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2366, 147 L.Ed.2d at 459, that untenable distinction was short-lived and the Court soon thereafter held in <em>Ring </em>that juries and not judges are required to find the aggravating factors necessary to sentence a defendant to death. 536 <em>U.S. </em>at 589, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2432, 153 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 564 (\u201cCapital defendants, no less than noncapital defendants, ... are entitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in their maximum punishment.\u201d). Since mental retardation constitutes more than an aggravating factor \u2014 it is instead a capital trigger, as the majority holds and in which I join \u2014 I can find no principled reason why we should decline to state that <em>Ring </em>compels, on Sixth Amendment grounds, that it is the jury which must determine whether defendant is mentally retarded. Once a substantive constitutional right is recognized, the states must enforce that right with procedures adequately designed to guarantee its protections. In my view, that approach compels the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>defendant\u2019s right to have this issue resolved by a jury. Thus, I would fix our holding to the Sixth Amendment and to our state constitution, and not the \u201cpublic policy\u201d enunciated by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\n<em>D. The trial judge\u2019s proposed pre-guilt phase hearing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">As for the pretrial procedures outlined by the trial judge, I would conclude that since, here, the State concedes that defendant has raised a colorable issue of mental retardation, we need not further consider what types of inquiries a trial judge may pursue at a pretrial stage in other cases. Because defendant\u2019s contention that he is mentally retarded is arguable, as the expert opinions in the record indicate and as the State concedes, there is no need for a pre-trial proceeding to further adjudicate its sufficiency; defendant is entitled to have this issue resolved at trial. However, I would agree with my colleagues that if, in an appropriate case, there should be some pretrial inquiry into the subject, then the burden of persuasion \u2014 in any degree \u2014 should never be placed on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">In the final analysis, our ruling must be premised on the fact that the criminal justice system was created and is administered by human beings. For that reason, the system must be presumed capable of producing erroneous results. As Judge Learned Hand famously stated, \u201c[o]ur procedure has always been haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted. It is an unreal dream.\u201d <em>United States v. Garsson, </em>291 <em>F. 646, 649 </em>(S.D.N.Y.1923). Far more disturbing is the specter that a mistaken conviction could lead to the execution of an innocent person. Yet, it seems to be accepted that such events have occurred and Judge Hand\u2019s ghost walks the land. In concluding that the death penalty was incapable of being constitutionally administered, Justice Blackmun observed that \u201c[ijnnocent persons <em>have </em>been executed.\u201d <em>Callins, supra, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>at 1159 n. 8, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1138 n. 8, 127 L.Ed.2d at 449 n. 8<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>See also Furman, supra, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>at 367-68, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2792, 33 L.Ed.2d at 422-23 (Marshall, J., concurring) (\u2018We have no way of judging how many innocent persons have been executed but we can be certain that there were some.\u201d); http://www.deathpena ltyinfo.org/state (last visited August 2, 2005) (asserting that since 1973, 119 inmates have been released from death row as a result of the production of evidence of their innocence, suggesting the statistical likelihood that others have not been so fortunate); Scheck, Neufeld and Dwyer, <em>Actual Innocence </em>(Signet 2001) at 281-82 (\u201c[E]ighty-eight condemned men and women have been released from death row, and ultimately had their convictions vacated forever. For every seven executed, one innocent person is freed, not only from death row but from incarceration.\u201d). Even death penalty proponents acknowledge that the criminal justice system is capable of producing the mistaken conviction and execution of innocent defendants. <em>See </em>van den Haag, <em>The Ultimate Punishment: A Defense, </em>99 <em>Haro. L.Rev. </em>1662,1664 (1986) (\u201cI do not doubt that, over a long enough period, miscarriages of justice will occur even in capital cases.\u201d). Added to the occasional fallibility of the criminal justice system is the unresolved question of whether the Supreme Court of the United States considers the execution of a defendant who asserts a tardy claim of \u201cactual innocence\u201d to be of constitutional dimension, <em>Herrera, supra, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>390, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>853, 122 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>203 \u2014 a fact that should generate doubts about whether appellate and habeas corpus review are sufficient safety nets for the catching of all miscarriages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Thus, in designing procedures for the constitutional adjudication of a capital trigger such as the absence of mental retardation, we must accept as a fact of life that our criminal justice system is not perfect and that appellate or habeas review is not guaranteed to detect \u2014 or that it will always endeavor to detect<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 all mistaken adjudications.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">If our federal and state constitutions should be construed as permitting man-made institutions to impose the God-like penalty of death \u2014 an interpretation with which I may disagree, as have others,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but to which I am bound to adhere \u2014 it nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>remains a matter of constitutional imperative that the greatest of care must be taken to insure that the death penalty is not imposed in unauthorized circumstances or in an arbitrary, discriminatory or capricious manner. As Justice Stewart recognized in <em>Furman,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">The penalty of death differs from all other forms of criminal punishment, not in degree but in kind. It is unique in its total irrevocability. It is unique in its-rejection of rehabilitation of the convict as a basic purpose of criminal justice.

I, \u00b6\u00b6 9 and 12 of our own state constitution. The qualitative difference between a lengthy prison term, on the one hand, and the penalty of death, on the other \u2014 let alone the enormity of the latter \u2014 militates, as a matter of federal and state constitutional imperative, that the State be put to the most rigorous standards in seeking to prove that a defendant is not mentally retarded and, thus, eligible to be executed. <em>See Lockett v.

Simmons, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>551, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of defendants who are sixteen or seventeen years of age); <em>Thompson v.

The door also remains open to further limitations because the \"basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man [and] draw[s] its meaning from the evolving standards of decency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>that mark the progress of a maturing society:\u201d <em>Trop v.

So long as the scope of the Eighth Amendment is fixed to evolving standards of decency, the extent to which it permits the use of the death penalty can be expected to further shrink if not wither away altogether.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b67-9\"> Our task in this matter has been, in essence, to surgically repair <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c in light of the fact that it has remained unchanged since <em>Atkins. Accord State v. Natale, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>458, 485-86, 878 A.2d 724 (2005) <em>(Natale II). </em>Because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c does not expressly exclude mentally retarded defendants from the class of persons eligible for a death sentence, the statute is broader in scope than permitted by the Eighth Amendment. As a result, in the words of our Supreme Court in <em>Natale II, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 491-92, 878 A.2d 724, we are obliged to \"judicially adjust[]\" the capital murder statute so that it conforms with <em>Atkins </em>and with what we perceive the Legislature\u2019s approach would have been if it had acted in this regard. <em>See Natale II, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 485-86, 878 A.2d 724; <em>State v. Franklin, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>516, 539-40, 878 A.2d 757 (2005); <em>State v. Abdullah, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>497, 506-07, 878 A.2d 746 (2005). Guided by the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would conclude that we should interpret the capital murder statute as if <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c now included a condition that the trial not proceed to a death sentence proceeding unless the State proves the defendant is not mentally retarded. In effect, in my view, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>constitutionally applied, the capital murder statute must be interpreted as if it had been amended to include the emphasized phrase in the following portion of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c: \"Any person convicted under subsection a.(l) or (2) <em>who is not mentally retarded and </em>who committed the homicidal act by his own conduct____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b69-9\"> <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3c(2)(a) (\u201cAt the [death sentence] proceeding, the State shall have the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of any aggravating factors set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection.
