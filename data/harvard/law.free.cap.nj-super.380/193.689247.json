Homar. NJM has assumed that defense under a reservation of rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">NJM contends that it provides \u201cno coverage under [its employer\u2019s liability] policy for an intentional-wrong claim.\u201d NJM issued a \u201cWorkers Compensation and Employers Liability Policy\u201d to LBS. There is no dispute that it provided coverage at the time of the accident. The policy included \u201cPart One \u2014 Workers Compensation Insurance\u201d and \u201cPart Two \u2014 Employers Liability Insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Count seven of the underlying Homar complaint against Beseler and LBS alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">3. On May 23,2001, Malden A. Homar was injured while operating a Cincinnati Shaper press brake machine at LBS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\"><em>4. At the time of the </em>alleged incident, Beseler was one of the entities responsible for the design, manufacture, inspection, servicing and maintenance of the Cincinnati Shaper Machine, including all of its component parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">5. Beseler was negligent because it failed to adequately design, inspect, service and maintain the Cincinnati Shaper Machine, including all of its component parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">6. The actions or inactions of Beseler as set forth hereinabove created a defective and dangerous machine and rendered it unfit, unsafe and unsuitable for its intended or foreseeable users.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Count eight of the complaint further alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">3. On May 23, 2001, Malden A.

At the time of the alleged incident, Malden A. Homar was an employee of LBS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">5. Mr. Homar was removing metal from the brake machine when it unexpectedly cycled again and crashed down upon both of his hands crushing and severing eight of his fingers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">6. As a result of this incident, Malden A. Homar sustained serious injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">7. At the time of the alleged incident, LBS was one of the entities responsible for the design, manufacture, inspection, servicing and maintenance of the Cincinnati Shaper Machine, including all of its component parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">8. At the time of [ ] this incident, warning labels, safety or protective guards or other similar devices which would have prevented the incident were either missing, disabled or allowed to fall into disrepair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">9. Defendant LBS removed or disabled or caused to be removed or disabled such warning labels, safety or protective guards or other similar devices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">10. LBS failed to inspect and ensure the safety of the press brake machine which caused Mr. Homar\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">11. Defendant LBS knowingly allowed the machine to operate knowing of its unfit, unsafe and dangerous condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">12. The actions or inactions of LBS as set forth hereinabove created a substantial certainty that plaintiff would be injured and were a proximate cause of the injuries sustained by Malden Homar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">13. The actions and inactions of LBS as set forth hereinabove were in reckless disregard to plaintiffs rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">14. As a proximate result of the actions and inactions of LBS as set forth hereinabove and as a proximate result of the defective machine, Malden A. Homar sustained amputations of eight fingers, (four on each hand), which required medical treatment, caused pain and suffering and disabled Malden Homar from the performance of usual activities and, which in the future, will similarly require medical treatment, cause him pain and suffering and disable him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">The allegations of a complaint generally control for purposes of the obligation to defend; \u201cthe complaint should be laid alongside the policy and a determination made as to whether, if the allegations [of the complaint] are sustained, the insurer will be required to pay the resulting judgment.\u201d <em>Danek v. Hommer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 77, 100 A.2d 198 (App.Div.1953), <em>aff'd, </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>573, 105 A.2d 677 (1954); <em>see also, e.g., Voorhees v. Preferred Mutual Ins.

Ins. Co. [NJM] v. Joseph Oat Corp., </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 670 A.2d 1071 (App.Div.), certif. denied, 142 <em>N.J. </em>515, 665 A.2d 1108 (1995), that it has no obligation to defend a claim for intentional wrong by virtue of the \u201cintentionally caused\u201d exclusion of the policy. Specifically, NJM contends that <em>Joseph Oat </em>controls; that the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent opinion in <em>Schmidt v. Smith, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>44, 713 A.2d 1014 (1998), has no application to this case; that there is no \u201cmeaningful or relevant distinction between an employer\u2019s alleged subjective desire to injure and proof of an employer\u2019s intent to injure under the \u2018substantial certainty standard\u2019\u201d as alleged in the employee\u2019s underlying complaint; that Beseler had no \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of coverage; that \u201cpublic policy favors exclusion of insurance coverage for liability arising out of the wrongful intentional acts of the insured;\u201d and that there is \u201cno duty to defend ... because the claims asserted against LBS are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>not covered by Part Two [of the policy] and there is no obligation to defend where there is no coverage under the standard workers\u2019 compensation policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Part Two of the policy covers acts not covered by the statutory \u201celective\u201d benefits of the workers\u2019 compensation law (covered by Part One of the policy). <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7. By statute, in exchange for the \u201celective\u201d benefits of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme, for which the employee obtains compensation irrespective of fault, the employee waives the right to commence a common-law action \u201cexcept for intentional wrong[s].\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34.15-8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 excepts from the waiver any act or omission which can be deemed an \u201cintentional wrong.\u201d Nonetheless, exclusion C5 of Part Two of the policy expressly excludes \u201cbodily injury intentionally caused or aggravated by you.\u201d We conclude that the insured plaintiff is entitled to coverage because there is no assertion that the bodily injury was \u201cintentionally caused or aggravated by\u201d the insured, as opposed to an injury caused by an intentional act of the employer that resulted in the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">An employee can bring a common-law action when the employer intends to injure the employee or knows \u201cthat death or injury [of the employee] are substantially certain to result.\u201d <em>Laidlow v. Hariton Machinery Co., Inc., </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>602, 621, 790 A.2d 884 (2002). To proceed the plaintiff must demonstrate \u201cthe evidence could lead a jury to conclude the employer acted with knowledge that it was substantially certain that a worker would suffer injury\u201d and the alleged conduct is \u201coutside the purview of the conditions the Legislature would have intended to immunize under the Workers\u2019 Compensation bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 790 A.2d 884. The Supreme Court permitted <em>Laidlow\u2019s </em>common-law action to proceed in a case like this one, in which the employee claimed \u201cthat his employer ha[d] removed a safety device from a danger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ous machine, knowing that the removal was substantially certain to result in injury to its workers and, in addition, deliberately and systematically deceived safety inspectors into believing that the machine was properly guarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 790 A.2d 884. The Supreme Court held that \u201cthe employee\u2019s allegations, if proven, meet both the conduct and context prongs of <em>Millison [v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>161, 174, <em>501 </em>A.2d <em>505 </em>(1985) ], thus entitling the employee to pursue his common-law remedies.\u201d <em>Ibid. Millison </em>recognized that \u201cindustry knowingly exposes workers to the risks of injury and disease,\u201d 101 <em>N.J. </em>at 177, 501 A.2d 505, and distinguished between the claims of intentional exposure to asbestos, for which there could be no common-law action, <em>id. </em>at 179, 501 A.2d 505, and the claims of fraudulent concealment of the plaintiffs asbestos-related diseases, for which there could. <em>Id. </em>at 182, 501 A.2d 505. Only the latter could the Legislature \u201cnot have intended to insulate ... from tort liability.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also Crippen v. Cent. Jersey Concrete Pipe Co., </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>397, 405-11, 823 A.2d 789 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In <em>Joseph Oat </em>we reviewed the C5 exclusion involved in this case in the context of a <em>Millison </em>claim and held that there was no coverage. We expressly found no distinction between an intent to injure or injury resulting from circumstances in which injury was substantially certain to occur. <em>Joseph Oat Corp., supra, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 196-97, 670 A.2d 1071. We noted that under <em>Millison </em>a \u201cdeliberate intent to injure can be proved not only by evidence of actual subjective intent to injure, but also by circumstances where injury is a substantial or virtual certainty, i.e., facts \u201cwithout which an actor cannot be said to intend the harm that his act produces.\u2019 \u201d <em>Joseph Oat, supra, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 197, 670 A.2d 1071, quoting <em>Millison, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 501 A.2d 505. We added that \u201c[t]here are not, then, two discrete categories of conduct which will satisfy the requirement of an \u2018intentional wrong\u2019 to escape the exclusivity of workers\u2019 compensation remedies. Both subjective intent and substantial certainty of harm are expressive of the same standard, i.e., deliberate intent to harm.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Subsequently, in <em>Schmidt v. Smith, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>44, 713 A.2d 1014 (1998), the Supreme Court recognized the purpose of Part Two of the policy as a \u201cgap filler\u201d where the employee has the right to maintain a common-law action. <em>Schmidt, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 49-50, 713 A.2d 1014. The liability portion of the policy was said \u201cto bridge the gap between the typical workers\u2019 compensation obligations and the obligations arising from injuries not covered by the workers\u2019 compensation regime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 713 A.2d 1014. <em>Schmidt </em>required coverage for the employer in a case involving sexual harassment of an employee by a corporate officer, and so held despite the same C5 exclusion involved in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In considering a separate exclusion, C7, for damages arising from defamation, harassment, discrimination, personnel action and the like (which is in the Beseler policy, but not raised as an issue in this matter), the Court agreed with our assessment that the \u201cemployer would reasonably expect the employer\u2019s liability section to provide coverage for the types of injuries [plaintiff! suffered,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and was valid \u201cas long as the liability from those discomforts is not related to bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 713 A.2d 1014. <em>Schmidt </em>emphasized that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-72 requires an employer to have coverage to protect employees from bodily injury. 155 <em>N.J. </em>at 51-52, 713 A.2d 1014.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Francis X. Garrity, \u201cIs the Laidlow Claim Covered? Whether an Employer\u2019s Liability Policy Covers an \u2018Intentional Wrong\u2019 Remains to be Seen,\u201d 178 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>524 (November 1,2004). <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Despite <em>Schmidt, </em>NJM insists <em>Joseph Oat </em>controls. Under NJM\u2019s theory Part Two of the policy covers the \u201cgap\u201d caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the absence of coverage under the elective provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7, that is where there is no requirement that the employee have \u201celective\u201d coverage, the employee elects to waive workers\u2019 compensation protection, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7, the employee is physically injured by the intentional wrongdoing of a co-worker, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8, or the injured employee is a minor, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In <em>Schmidt, </em>the Supreme Court held that the C5 exclusion, involved in that case and <em>Joseph Oat, </em>was inapplicable. The Supreme Court did not cite <em>Joseph Oat </em>in <em>Schmidt. </em>In our opinion in <em>Schmidt, </em>we distinguished <em>Joseph Oat </em>because no corporate policy or activity was involved as a result of the single employee\u2019s wrongdoing, 294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 583, 684 A.2d 66. The employer was \u201cvicariously liable for the intentional conduct of its president\u201d and \u201c[pjlaintiff never attempted to prove that [the employer] acted intentionally in order to escape the exclusivity provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8.\u201d 294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585, 684 A.2d 66. We found it significant that the employer was \u201cvicariously liable for the intentional acts of\u2019 its president. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 684 A.2d 66. The Supreme Court agreed with us \u201cthat Exclusion C5 does not apply because there is no evidence [the employer] intended to harass\u201d the plaintiff. 155 <em>N.J. </em>at 51, 713 A.2d 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">As previously noted, <em>Joseph Oat </em>rejected the distinction between coverage for \u201can actual subjective intent to injure\u201d and \u201ccircumstances where injury is a substantial or virtual certainty,\u201d 287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 197, 670 A.2d 1071. While we could technically reconcile the two eases because here there is a claim of direct wrongdoing by the insured-employer, we decline to do so or to distinguish between claims of vicarious and direct liability for purposes of coverage. In <em>Schmidt </em>the Court upheld the carrier\u2019s obligation to defend and indemnify the insured where an employee received injuries flowing from its president\u2019s intentional misconduct, and <em>Laidlow </em>upholds a common-law action in circumstances like those alleged herein. <em>See also Crippen, supra, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>at 408-09, 823 A.2d 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>It has been suggested by plaintiff that <em>Schmidt </em>overruled <em>Joseph Oat </em>and that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-71, -72 and -78 mandate coverage \u201cfor all occupational injuries\u201d irrespective of intent to injure. <em>See also Garrity, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>at 532. We need not go so far, but conclude that the policy in this case excludes only injuries intentionally caused, and not the type of act alleged in this case \u2014 an unintended injury caused by an intentional wrong. In light of <em>Schmidt, </em>and the fact exclusions in insurance policies are subject to \u201cstrict interpretation,\u201d <em>Butler v. Bonner &amp; Barnewall, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567, 576, 267 A.2d 527 (1970), we find no exclusion of the type of conduct alleged in this case which was the type of wrongdoing for which a common-law cause of action was recently sustained in <em>Laidlow. Schmidt </em>specifically addressed the \u201creasonable expectations\u201d of the insured in the context of exclusion C7; the same reasoning applies here. Comparatively little would be covered under Part Two if the C5 exclusion and the concept of \u201cintentional wrong\u201d are as broad and the \u201cgap\u201d as little, for coverage purposes, as NJM contends. In any event, exclusion C5 cannot be read to exclude bodily injuries based on the conduct alleged in this case. <em>See President v. Jenkins, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>550, 563, 853 A.2d 247 (2004) (\u201c[wjhen an insurance policy\u2019s language fairly supports two meanings, one that favors the insurer, and the other that favors the insured, the policy should be construed to sustain coverage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We do not deal with an alleged act designed to purposely injure the employee, coverage for which would offend public policy. Further, in light of <em>Schmidt, </em>the fact <em>Joseph Oat </em>rejected any distinctions between \u201csubjective intent and substantial certainty of harm,\u201d <em>Joseph Oat Corp., supra, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 197, 670 A.2d 1071, must be deemed outdated in this ease involving bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We decide only that the underlying complaint does not allege an intent to injure and that this policy, consistent with statutory and case law authority, does not exclude coverage for intentional acts which are not themselves intended to cause injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The judgment of the Law Division is affirmed.
