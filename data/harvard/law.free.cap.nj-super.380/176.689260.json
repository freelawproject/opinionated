Gross appeals from orders of the Law Division entered on July 25, 2003, dismissing counts five and six of plaintiffs complaint alleging violations of the Consumer Fraud Act (CFA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and its order of May 7, 2004, dismissing counts seven (alleging common law fraud) and eight (alleging unconscionability).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>that the remaining counts were settled resulting in a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">On August 31, 2001, plaintiff purchased a 2002 Jaguar X Type 2.5 automobile from defendant Cherry Hill Classic Cars for $35,220.00, and was charged a \u201cregistration/title fee\u201d of $113.50 and a \u201cdocumentary fee\u201d of $135.00. He challenges the two components of the latter, a \u201cclerical expense\u201d fee and an \u201cMV messenger service\u201d fee of $67.50 each, claiming they violate consumer protection regulations (counts five and six), and asserts that the \u201cmessenger service\u201d fee constitutes common law fraud (count seven) and is unconscionable (count eight). He specifically contends that \u201cthe trial court erred when it dismissed counts five and six for failure to state a claim\u201d because the \u201cclerical expense\u201d disclosure on the vehicle order form was not sufficiently detailed and \u201cthe practice of charging for services not actually rendered violates\u201d administrative regulations. He also challenged the dismissal of counts seven and eight because the motor vehicle \u201cmessenger service\u201d charge is \u201cunconscionable\u201d in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2. Plaintiff further contends that \u201cdefendants\u2019 expert report was inadmissible and should have been excluded,\u201d plaintiff proved an \u201cascertainable loss and damages\u201d and \u201cthe court erred when it denied plaintiff\u2019s motion to extend the discovery period to allow for class wide discovery period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In February 2003 plaintiff filed an eight-count complaint \u201cas a class action pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:32-1(b)(3),\u201d on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased vehicles from defendants over a six-year period and who were charged a \u201cdocumentary fee\u201d or similar fee. Plaintiff alleged fraudulent misrepresentation with respect to a \u201cregistration/title fee\u201d charged by defendants\u2019-related corporations (count one); violation of the CFA with respect to the \u201cregistration/title fee\u201d (counts two and four); conversion with respect to the \u201cregistration/title fee\u201d (count three); violation of the CFA with respect to the \u201cdocumentary service\u201d fee charged by defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>because of their failure to itemize the service being performed (count five); violation of the CFA because the \u201cclerical expense\u201d for which a corresponding fee was charged was not actually performed (count six); fraudulent misrepresentation with respect to the \u201cmessenger service fee\u201d (count seven); and violation of the CFA based on the excessive nature of the \u201cmessenger service fee\u201d (count eight).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Defendants \u201cshare common ownership with Cherry Hill Classic Cars.\u201d Their names all appear on the top of the sales agreement plaintiff executed when he purchased the Jaguar from defendant Cherry Hill Classic Cars. The purchase price was $35,220. The price had been agreed upon the prior day, at which time plaintiff was permitted to test drive the vehicle and drove the car to his home. Plaintiff was presented with a sales agreement on which was listed a \u201cRegistration/Title Fee\u201d of $113.50 and a \u201cDocumentary Fee\u201d of $135.00, comprised of $67.50 representing a \u201cM.V. Messenger Service\u201d and $67.50 representing a \u201cClerical Expense.\u201d Plaintiff believed that the \u201cdocumentary fee\u201d was merely \u201ca way of boosting] the sales price\u201d and complained about the fee, telling the salesman that he \u201cfelt very strongly about it.\u201d In response, plaintiff was given a copy of a document entitled \u201cDEALER DOC FEE,\u201d which included thirteen items covered, including preparation of paperwork for registration and transfer of title, document recording, notarization and postage and handling. The bottom of the document indicated that \u201cfor deals that do not require the entire amount of the fee to cover the ... listed items, the balance will be credited as additional dealer income.\u201d Plaintiff also objected to the \u201cclerical fee\u201d on the basis that his purchase did not involve a trade-in and required no document preparation related to financing or warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Plaintiff also objected to the \u201cmessenger fee\u201d as an \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d fee and offered to take the relevant documents to the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) himself. Michelle Condo, defendants\u2019 comptroller, conceded that while on occasion, defendants have permitted other customers to title and register their vehicles, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>she asserted that plaintiffs request was denied because he was not considered to be \u201csincere.\u201d He \u201cwould have had to agree\u201d to do various things to complete the transaction and have the vehicle registered at DMV before he could have taken possession of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Plaintiff signed the purchase agreement. Next to the disputed fees, however, plaintiff wrote the word \u201coutrageous.\u201d He also wrote a separate check for the $135.00 \u201cdocumentary fee\u201d and suggested that the sales manager not cash the check, the implication being that plaintiff would take legal action if the check was cashed. At the time, plaintiff only objected to the amount of the \u201cclerical expense\u201d portion, but subsequently objected to the amount of the \u201cmessenger fee\u201d portion as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">According to Condo, Cherry Hill\u2019s runner took the relevant documents associated with plaintiffs purchase to the DMV on September 4, 2001. Documents relating to license, title and registration for five other customers were delivered from Cherry Hill to the DMV at the same time. All completed documents for the three dealerships are consolidated at Condo\u2019s office, where the documents are processed to ensure they are accurate and that they meet any special customer-related needs. Each defendant employs a driver, or \u201crunner,\u201d who is responsible for providing the messenger service. Defendants also use a courier service to transfer title to trade-ins at local DMV offices and in Trenton. The courier also picks up blank registration forms from the DMV and brings them back to the dealerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">With each vehicle purchased, defendants prepare a \u201csold and trade pack\u201d which contains at least one odometer statement in compliance with federal law, a power of attorney form permitting \u201cthe dealership to efficiently process [the] paperwork on behalf of [the] customers,\u201d and an agreement that the customer will \u201cprovide insurance on the vehicle while the vehicle is being driven with a temporary tag.\u201d In addition, defendants provided a detailed list of \u201clabor\u201d and \u201ccosts/expenses\u201d which comprised the \u201cmessenger fee.\u201d These included pick-up or delivery of the necessary paper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>work, obtaining or transferring license plates and tags, transferring completed motor vehicle work, and the cost of maintaining and utilizing the vehicles and office equipment used in providing the service. Keith Camiolo, manager of Cherry Hill Classic Cars, determined that $67.50 \u201cwas a competitive and appropriate rate for the [messenger] service provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Defendants offered an expert report prepared jointly by Elliot J. DeSanto, a certified public accountant, and Louis Young, a specialist in \u201cautomotive dealership financial information and ... operating procedures for automotive retailers.\u201d The report examined the messenger fees charged by other dealers in defendants\u2019 geographic area as well as the actual cost of the fee. Young and DeSanto determined that the \u201caverage [messenger service] fee\u201d in the Cherry Hill area was $56.32, ranging from $30.00 to $120.00. Based on their own analysis, Young and DeSanto determined the actual cost of the messenger service fee to be in a \u201crange between\u201d $30.40 and $45.24 for each vehicle sold. The report further analyzed the time defendants\u2019 comptroller and general managers spend on a daily basis in overseeing, supervising and coordinating the messenger service for the three dealerships. It conducted the same analysis with respect to the comptroller\u2019s administrative staff and runners. The report also considered various costs associated with the vehicles used in providing the service, including \u201cdepreciation,\u201d \u201cmaintenance, parts and labor,\u201d fuel, tolls and insurance and registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Plaintiff contends that counts five and six, regarding the \u201cclerical expense\u201d fee, should not have been dismissed because the \u201cclerical expense\u201d fee set forth on the sales agreement did not comply with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26B.2(a)(2)(i), and thus constituted a violation of the CFA. Specifically, plaintiff maintains that the clerical expense fee charged by defendants did not contain the itemization envisioned by the regulation and that, as evidenced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the \u201cdealer doc fee\u201d document presented to him, the charge includes services not actually performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In dismissing counts five and six, Judge Kassel found that the $135.00 \u201cdocumentary fee\u201d complied with the regulation, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">The arguments concerning whether or not that was deceptive if, in fact, the actual cost was less to the dealership ... that argument, in my judgment, goes to counts seven and eight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">But, anyway, in count five, I\u2019m satisfied that the sales document itself complied with [the regulation], again, on its face____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">Count six also alleges that there was a violation of administrative code 13:45A-26(b) in regard to the $67.50 for clerical expenses. And it seems to me the gist of the argument is that it is insufficient just to say clerical expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">Again, if there are no clerical expenses but the customer was ... charged, that may very ... well be relevant to count[s] seven and eight. But in my judgment, putting forth in the sales document $67.50 for clerical expenses is sufficient as a matter of law. Therefore, I\u2019m dismissing count she.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">In reviewing a complaint dismissed under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e), the inquiry is limited to examining, with liberality, whether the complaint has sufficiently set forth a legal cause of action. <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elec. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989). The court is not concerned with the plaintiffs ability to prove the allegations contained in the complaint, and the plaintiff is entitled to every reasonable inference of fact. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">Pursuant to the CFA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-4 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-48, the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs promulgated regulations defining a \u201cdocumentary service fee\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">any monies or other thing of value which an automotive dealer accepts from a consumer in exchange for the performance of certain documentary services which include, but are not limited to, the preparation and processing of documents in connection with the transfer of license plates, registration, or title, and the preparation and processing of other documents relating to the sale of a motor vehicle to said consumer].]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26B.1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">The regulations make it an \u201cunlawful practice\u201d under the CFA \u201cautomotive dealer\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>[a]eeept[ ], eharg[e], or obtain[ ] from a consumer monies, or any other thing of value, in exchange for the performance of any documentary service without first itemizing the actual documentary service which is being performed and setting forth in writing on the sale document the price for each specific documentary servicet.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26B.2(a)(2)(i).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Proof of a violation of a regulation promulgated under the CFA is enough to establish an \u201cunlawful practice\u201d and wrongful conduct under the Act, \u201cregardless of intent or moral culpability.\u201d <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>2, 18-19, 647 A.2d 454 (1994). \u201cIn those instances, intent is not an element of the unlawful practice, and the regulations impose strict liability for such violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 647 A.2d 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">In <em>Delaney v. Garden State Auto Park, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 722 A.2d 967 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>477, 734 A.2d 792 (1999), the buyer alleged that the dealer violated the CFA by failing to disclose the price of \u201cpre-delivery\u201d services and by failing to itemize such services in the final sales agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 16, 722 A.2d 967. Prior to purchasing the used vehicle there involved, the buyer declined to purchase a service contract and extended warranty for $1,100.00. <em>Id. </em>at 17, 20, 722 A.2d 967. However, the sales contract was for $7,983.00, which the buyer subsequently learned included $2,200.00 for the cost of \u201crust proofing, undercoating, paint sealer and fabric guard,\u201d the very expenses embodied in the service contract and warranty he declined to accept. <em>Id. </em>at 18, 722 A.2d 967. The sales agreement did not include or enumerate any pricing or listing of these \u201cpredelivery services,\u201d as required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26B.2, and the dealership admitted that it cost them only $85 to perform these services. <em>Id. </em>at 18-19, 722 A.2d 967. As a result, we had \u201cno hesitancy in concluding that the circumstances presented ... were designed to be eliminated by the consumer fraud legislation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20, 722 A.2d 967, and that the dealership had \u201cengaged in an unconscionable business practice in violation of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 722 A.2d 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Here, however, there was itemization and enumeration of the documentary services, and the question is whether that itemization and enumeration was sufficient under the applicable regulations promulgated under the Act, which must be \u201cliberally construed as remedial legislation in favor of protecting consumers.\u201d <em>Delaney, supra, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 19-20, 722 A.2d 967 (citing <em>Fenwick v. Kay Am. Jeep, Inc., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>372, 376-77, 371 A.2d 13 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The regulations were adopted in response to practices that caused consumers to spend additional monies for services that were either unnecessary or not being performed. As noted by one commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">The main thrust of the regulations is to protect consumers against fraudulent practices related to pre-delivery services, such as vehicle and document preparation services. The intent of the regulations is to prevent dealerships from performing unauthorized, unnecessary and expensive pre-delivery work on a motor vehicle that is under a contract of sale. Such services may only be performed with the consent of the consumer and only by first presenting an itemized invoice of the precise predelivery services to be delivered and the exact cost for each service. Failure to follow this procedure constitutes both an unconscionable business practice and a violation of the regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">[25 <em>New Jersey Practice, Motor Vehicle Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 17.9, at 112 (Robert Ramsey) (2001).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">We conclude that the \u201cclerical expense fee\u201d included sufficient itemization of the actual \u201cdocumentary service\u201d being performed to satisfy <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26B.2(a)(2)(i), a position which is consistent with precedent under the analogous federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1601 to -1693r, and its implementing Regulation Z regarding disclosure requirements. 12 <em>C.F.B. </em>\u00a7 226.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">In <em>Downey v. Whaley-Lamb Ford Sales, Inc., </em>607 <em>F.2d </em>1093, 1094-95 (5th Cir.1979), it was held that a single $2.00 charge for \u201clicense, title and registration fees\u201d was sufficient because each fee did not have to be individually itemized and disclosed, despite the provision of Regulation Z requiring that charges not part of the finance charge be \u201cindividually itemized.\u201d Rejecting the purchaser\u2019s claim that the fee was not sufficiently or \u201cindividually item<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ized\u201d because it was not broken down into its individual components, the Fifth Circuit, while recognizing its \u201cresponsibility to construe the act and regulations favorably to the consumer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1095, held that separate itemization of the fees would not advance the purpose of the law because it \u201cwould not contribute to the informed use of credit or enable the consumer \u2018to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him.\u201d\u2019 <em>Ibid. See also Wallace v. Brownell Pontiac-GMC Co., </em>703 <em>F.</em>2d 525, 528 (11th Cir.1983) (a $37.50 \u201cclerical fee,\u201d \u201cwithout separate itemization of the components of the charge\u201d did not violate Regulation Z); <em>In re Brown, </em>106 <em>B.R. </em>852, 858 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Pa.1989) (\u201c[a]s long as the entire sum of the fees charged was set forth, the disclosure ... is sufficiently itemized\u201d). The principle applies to the similar protections afforded under the CFA. Accordingly, count five was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In count six, plaintiff claims that the inclusion of services not actually rendered as part of the \u201cclerical expense\u201d violated the CFA and is unconscionable. However, the regulation does not require a different fee in every ease so long as the fee is itemized based on the services regularly and routinely performed, is reasonable, and is not excessive. Accordingly, we agree with the motion judge that the \u201cclerical expense fee\u201d did not violate <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26B.2(a)(2)(i) and the CFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Plaintiff also argues that the \u201cmessenger fee\u201d violated the CFA because the cost was approximately seventeen times the actual cost of the service provided. Plaintiff further asserts that the \u201cmessenger fee\u201d constitutes common law fraud because it is deceptive, given that defendants do not usually use a messenger service but rather its own employee, and because the fee covers costs other than the actual messenger activity performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">In granting summary judgment, Judge Donaldson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>I don\u2019t think that the charge of ... $67.50 or whatever they decide to charge for the messenger service is ... a violation of the Consumer Fraud Act. I don\u2019t believe it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">I don\u2019t think it is a contract of adhesion. I think that it is a very open marketplace. I think that ... just as you bargain for the price of a car, I think that you can bargain for the price of this. There\u2019s nothing that says you need to buy a car at that particular place. The fact that you have negotiated for it doesn\u2019t stop you from going somewhere else where you can negotiate a lower price ... for the messenger service or no charge whatsoever____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">I don\u2019t think that ... there\u2019s a regulatory violation. I think they complied with the regulation. I don\u2019t think there was a material admission [sic]. I don\u2019t think there was any unconscionability about this, the fact that they make money on this____[T]hey can charge ... what they feel is appropriate for having provided this service and for the convenience of their consumers] ... Somebody may think it\u2019s worth $67.50 to have somebody else take care of these items, which is getting their license plate tags and ... registration. Somebody might think it would be worth more than that. Somebody thinks it\u2019s worth less than that ... It\u2019s an open marketplace, and this is a marketplace where people can buy and purchase what they feel they can afford, and if they feel they can\u2019t they can go to the next dealer with it. And if they feel they can get a better deal [with] the next dealer they will do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">I think that there is no cause of action under the Consumer Fraud Statute or under common law fraud. I certainly don\u2019t think that in this case there is even a[n] ascertainable loss in this matter, therefore the motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">We can find no genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995); <em>Prudential Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v.

It is designed to promote \u201creal bargaining between parties\u201d and to assure that purchasers realize their \u201cfreedom of choice and [have an] understanding [of their] ability to negotiate in a meaningful fashion.\u201d <em>Kugler v.

Based on that determination, plaintiff asserts that the fee is approximately seventeen times its cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">But, as Judge Donaldson noted, plaintiff has not considered the relevant market forces or market price. While it is true that in <em>Delaney, </em>we focused on the disparity between the dealer\u2019s charge ($2,200.00) and its cost ($85.00), the cost was actually the \u201cflat fee\u201d the dealership paid to a third-party for the service. <em>Delaney, supra, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 18, 722 A.2d 967. Thus, the market price for the service was not even considered. More importantly, the buyer in <em>Delaney </em>declined to purchase the very services in question, and the services were not disclosed in the sales agreement. Neither factor is present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In addition, the difference between the amounts in question, $2,200.00 in <em>Delaney </em>and approximately $63.50 in this case, is significant because, as noted above, the intent of the CFA regulations is to prevent \u201cunauthorized, unnecessary and expensive predelivery work\u201d and services. 25 <em>New Jersey Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 17.9 at 112. <em>See also Kugler, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 527-28, 279 A.2d 640 (violation of CFA based on door-to-door sale of educational books in areas where consumers were of limited education and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>economic means at more than twice their market price). <em>See also, e.g., Brannam v. Huntington Mortgage Co., </em>287 <em>F.</em>3d 601, 606 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 <em>U.S. </em>1048, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>635, 154 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>522 (2002) (concluding that $250.00 mortgage document preparation fee, although not \u201cthe amount of the lender\u2019s actual costs for preparing loan related documents\u201d did not violate Regulation Z because \u201cit was for a service actually performed and reasonable in comparison to the prevailing practices of the industry in the relevant market\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Based on the defendants\u2019 expert reports<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the absence of any expert proofs to the contrary, see <em>Brannam, supra, </em>287 F.3d at 606, it appears that the messenger fee is both in line with the market price in the region and reasonable in amount. Moreover, as an attorney who represented the plaintiff in a major ease decided under the CFA, <em>see Cox, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 6, 647 A.2d 454, plaintiff knew he had the right to bargain and walk away if Cherry Hill declined to reduce or waive the messenger fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Plaintiff further maintains that the messenger fee is an adhesive term. \u201c[T]he essential nature of a contract of adhesion is that it is presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, commonly in a standardized printed form, without opportunity for the \u2018adhering\u2019 party to negotiate except perhaps on a few particulars.\u201d <em>Rudbart </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>v. North Jersey Dist. Water Supply Comm\u2019n, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>344, 353, 605 A.2d 681, <em>cert. denied, First Fidelity Bank, N.A. v. Rudbart, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>871, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>203, 121 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>145 (1992). In determining whether such terms should be enforced, courts have looked to the nature of the \u201cstandardized form of the document\u201d used and to the \u201csubject matter of the contract, the parties\u2019 relative bargaining positions, the degree of economic compulsion motivating the \u2018adhering\u2019 party, and the public interests affected by the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 605 A.2d 681. Particular focus is on whether there is gross or substantial inequality in bargaining power, or whether the parties are in positions of relative equality. <em>See, e.g., Vasquez v. Glassboro Serv. Ass\u2019n, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>86, 101-03, 415 A.2d 1156 (1980); <em>Ellsworth Dobbs, Inc. v. Johnson, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>528, 555-56, 236 A.2d 843 (1967); <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>358, 391, 161 A.2d 69 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">There was no undue disparity in bargaining power in this case, which involved the purchase of a Jaguar automobile. As noted above, plaintiff knew he was free to refuse to purchase the vehicle if Cherry Hill refused to reduce or waive the fee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Finally, plaintiff alleges that the messenger fee constitutes common law fraud because the fee is deceptive in that defendants use their own employees rather than an actual messenger service, and that a consumer would not know that the fee covered remotely related clerical costs. The elements of common law fraud are a material misrepresentation of a presently existing or past fact; knowledge or belief by the defendant of its falsity; an intention that the other person rely on it; reasonable reliance thereon by the other person; and resulting damages. <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>582, 610, 691 A.2d 350 (1997) (citing <em>Jewish Ctr. of Sussex County v. Whale, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>619, 624, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>432 A.2d 521 (1981)). The record indicates that defendants do, in fact, use a courier service, primarily to transfer title to trade-ins at local DMV (now MVC) offices and in Trenton. In any event, we cannot conclude that the description of the fee can be found to constitute a \u201cmaterial misrepresentation\u201d given that the messenger service can be said to be a \u201cservice\u201d whether performed by the dealer or by an outside courier.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In order for a private party to bring an action under the CFA, the party must have suffered \u201cany ascertainable loss of moneys or property.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19; <em>see also Furst v. Einstein Moomjy, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12, 860 A.2d 435 (2004); <em>Weinberg v. Sprint Corp., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>233, 249-51, 801 A.2d 281 (2002). However, as there has been no showing of a violation of the CFA, we need not develop whether plaintiff made a showing that he suffered an ascertainable loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Finally, plaintiff argues that in the event of a reversal, the order denying the extension of the class action discovery period should also be reversed. As we affirm the judgment, we need not consider the request, and find no other contention or argument not addressed warrants discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-15\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to-135.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-16\"> Plaintiff also appears to <em>appeal a </em>separate order of May 7, 2003, denying his motion to extend the discovery deadline to permit the filing of a motion for class certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b214-14\"> There is no dispute that defendants are \"automotive dealers.\u201d <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26B.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\"><em> </em>Plaintiff contends that defendants' expert report was inadmissible because the report was irrelevant, because it was not shown that the authors of the report had expertise in the field of messenger services and because the fee included inappropriate and duplicate \"clerical expenses.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">Generally, a trial court should consider all of the information it knows to be available when evaluating a motion for summary judgment, including an expert\u2019s report, <em>Ziegelheim v. Apollo, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>250, 264, 607 A.2d 1298 (1992), viewing the report in the light most favorable to plaintiff. <em>Scully v. Fitzgerald, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>114, 130, 843 A.2d 1110 (2004). Moreover, we can find no timely objection by plaintiff to the introduction of the expert report or any request for a hearing on qualifications in advance of consideration of the motion. <em>See Kemp ex rel. Wright v. State of New Jersey, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>412, 426-27, 809 A.2d 77 (2002). In any event, it is not clear that Judge Donaldson relied on the report in reaching the conclusion she did based on the facts presented.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> Plaintiff does nor dispute Condo's assertion that plaintiff's request to do the paperwork himself was refused because Cherry Hill did not believe the request was \"sincere,\" As a result, this case does not turn on the response he received to the statement he would perform the service himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
