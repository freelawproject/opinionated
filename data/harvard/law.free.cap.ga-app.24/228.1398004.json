January 22, 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-10\">The exceptions were to the overruling of a certiorari in a case from the municipal court of Atlanta in which W. S. Cox was sued by the Charles Cone Realty Company for a commission of $190 alleged to be due the plaintiff as agent for the defendant in the sale of a certain meat market and grocery store. The trial in the municipal court resulted in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the amount sued for. The defendant, in his petition for certiorari, contended that the judgment was contrary to law and without evidence to support it, because \u201cthe declaration alleges that W. S. Cox is due the plaintiff certain commissions for the sale of a meat market and grocery store, whereas it is shown by the proof that said market was owned by a partnership composed of W. S. &amp; H. J. Cox, and that H. J. Cox, a member of said firm, employed the plaintiff to sell the place of business owned by said partnership.\u201d The answer to the suit was a general denial of indebtedness. There was evidence that W. S. Cox was the owner of the meat market and store at the time of the sale, that the business conducted there had been held out to the public as a partnership business under the name of Cox Brothers, and was listed with the plaintiff for sale under that name by H. J. Cox, the defendant\u2019s brother, that the preliminary negotiations in the sale were conducted through H. J. Cox, and that W. S. Cox ratified the acts of H. J. Cox and prior to the consummation of the sale agreed personally to pay the commission.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-11\"><em>Anton L. Etheridge, F. A.
