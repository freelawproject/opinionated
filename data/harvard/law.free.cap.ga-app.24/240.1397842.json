The defendant demurred, upon the grounds: that the petition set forth no cause of action; that it did not appear that the promise to pay was in writing; that the petition failed to show that the plaintiff was prevented from levying the fi. fa.; and that there was no agreement between the three persons and concurred in by them whereby Spooner was released and Bailey accepted as the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">It was not error for the court to sustain the demurrer and dismiss the suit. In every such case, in order to take the transaction out of the operation of the statute of frauds, it must appear that the person substituted for the debtor was, by agreement between the creditor, the debtor, and himself, substituted for the original debtor, and the latter released from the obligation.
