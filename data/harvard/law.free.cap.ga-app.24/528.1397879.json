The plaintiff sought to recover the cost of repairing the damage. The plaintiff obtained judgment for the amount sued for; certiorari was sued out by the defendant, the certiorari was overruled, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The insurance company urges the following part of the insurance contract as a complete defense to the action, to wit: \u201cThis company shall not be liable for loss caused directly or indirectly by invasion, insurrection, riot, civil war or commotion, or military or usurped power, or by order of any civil authority, or by theft, or by neglect of the insured to use all reasonable means to save and preserve the property at and after a fire, or when the property is endangered by fire in neighboring premises, or (unless fire ensues, and, in that event, for the damage by fire only) by explosion of any kind, or lightning, but liability for direct damage by lightning may be assumed by specific agreement hereon.\u201d The only question presented for consideration necessarily is whether the explosion in an adjoining building, in which the explosive was placed in the manner in which it was and for the purposes for which it was so placed, is such an explosion as it is expressly contracted that the company would not be liable for. We have examined the authorities that may be used as precedents for holding that such an explosion as occurred in this case is specially excepted by the contract. We are convinced that the explosion contemplated in the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>here is an explosion resultant from accident or from the fire itself. The Civil Code (1910), \u00a7 3476, provides that \u201cA loss or injury may occur from fire without the actual burning of the articles or property; as, a house blown up to stop a conflagration, or goods removed in imminent danger, or damage by water used to extinguish the flames.\u201d The present contract of insurance must be construed ifi the light of this section. When the dynamite was placed under a near-by building with the intent of destroying it for the purpose of arresting the conflagration, and the charge was of sufficient force not only to blow the building up under which it was placed, but to injure other buildings, the liability of the insurance company extended to the other buildings, upon which it carried a policy of insurance, just the same as its liability would have arisen if the policy in this case had covered the building under which the charge of dynamite was so placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The judge of the superior court did not err in overruling the certiorari of the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AU-\">\n<em>Broyles, G.
