The bill Laving been taken for confessed against Ray, a decree was obtained by Law for a sale. The sale had been made under the decree, and notice given, that \u25a0on a certain day, the sale would be ratified, unless cause was shown. On that \u25a0day, Ray appeared, but not showing good cause, in the opinion of the court, the sale was confirmed. Ray prayed an appeal to this court, on the decree for the sale, which the court refused, on the ground, as it is understood, that -the decree for the sale was not a final decree in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-8\">Ray, on this day, presented a petition to this court, setting forth those facts, among others, praying relief, and that this court would direct the court below to send up the record. At the same time, he produced sundry papers, purporting to be the substance of that record, but not properly authenti-eated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-9\">Marshall, Ch.
