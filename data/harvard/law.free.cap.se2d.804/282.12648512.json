Anderson County (the County) filed the instant action against Preston seeking rescission of that agreement. Following a nonjury trial, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of Preston on all causes of action as well as his counterclaim against the County. The County appeals the circuit court's decision, raising numerous issues on appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to the vote on Preston's Severance Agreement, the political environment in Anderson County was \"toxic.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Throughout his tenure, Preston was involved in constant litigation-both individually and in his capacity as county administrator-with members of the council he served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The 2008 Council was comprised of Chairman Michael Thompson and Council members Larry Greer, Ron Wilson, Gracie Floyd, Robert Waldrep, Cindy Wilson, and Bill McAbee. In June 2008, primary challengers ousted three incumbent members of the 2008 Council: Tommy Dunn defeated Thompson, Tom Allen defeated McAbee, and Eddie Moore defeated Greer. Some of the primary victors, as well as Waldrep and Cindy Wilson, ran on platforms calling for examination into and possible reform of the financial and governance practices of the Preston administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From June to December 2008, Waldrep and Cindy Wilson held a series of meetings with Moore, Dunn, and Allen at Waldrep's office. During these meetings, the participants laid\n   out an agenda for the incoming Council (the 2009 Council) that included firing the law firm for the County and hiring a new one; hiring a financial investigator or auditor; designating Moore as chairman; drafting resolutions for the first meeting; implementing a hiring freeze; and addressing the position of county administrator and various other personnel matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the primary elections, Preston retained Robert Hoskins as his attorney. On September 25, 2008, Hoskins notified the 2008 Council of Preston's anticipatory breach of contract claim, stating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [I]t has come to Mr. Preston's attention that certain existing Council members have made statements that they and certain newly elected Council Members intend, after January 2009, to prevent him from carrying out his duties as County Administrator.... Preston considers the intent of certain members of Council and their allies to prevent him from performing his job as an anticipatory breach of his employment contract.... [T]he political and personal agenda of the obstructionists has rendered his ability to serve the people of Anderson County beyond January 1, 2009 impossible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response, the 2008 Council referred Preston's claim to its personnel committee-chaired by Ron Wilson-and hired Tom Bright, an employment attorney, to advise the County on the matter. Bright then interviewed all seven members of the 2008 Council, as well as the county attorney, to receive their input.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 23, 2008, Preston's attorney delivered a letter to Bright, in which he alluded to a number of causes of action and tort claims Preston planned to assert against current and incoming Council members. In the letter, however, he offered to settle Preston's anticipatory breach claim and \"all claims against the County and the two individual Council [m]embers [he] previously mentioned.\" Under this proposed settlement, Preston would resign and execute a complete release of all claims against the County, Waldrep, and Cindy Wilson in exchange for the\n   County paying $1,276,081 in damages: $827,222 for the total amount of pay and benefits due under his employment agreement\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the Employment Agreement);\n   $356,087 to the South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS) to purchase seven years, seven months, and twenty-three days of service credits to allow him to retire immediately with a full pension; and $92,772 to his health reimbursement account for retiree health benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After receiving the letter, Bright met with the personnel committee to discuss how the County should address the matter. In his notes outlining Preston's claims and the County's options, Bright stated Preston had no anticipatory breach or constructive discharge claim. Bright also advised the committee that, under our supreme court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Piedmont Public Service District v. Cowart\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Cowart II\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"514503\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/324/239/\">\n    324 S.C. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"514503\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/324/239/\">\n    478 S.E.2d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), the County had a good argument that Preston's Employment Agreement was voidable-and therefore, had no value-because it purported to extend his employment beyond the term of the Council that approved it. Nevertheless, Bright also told the committee if the County were to lose, then it could face up to $2 million in litigation costs going forward. Thus, Bright advised the 2008 Council it could (1) do nothing, (2) leave the issue for the 2009 Council to decide, (3) terminate Preston and pay him nothing, or (4) settle with Preston and pay out his contract. As to the fourth option, Bright cautioned that \"[c]itizens may go after Preston and former Council members for giving away their [money] without good reason\" if the 2008 Council chose to settle. After considering the options, the personnel committee directed Bright \"to go and talk to Mr. Hoskins and try and get the best deal you can.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following several weeks of negotiations, Bright emailed Hoskins a copy of a proposed severance agreement and release of all claims on November 18, 2008. That evening, the 2008 Council voted to amend the agenda to consider the Severance Agreement, voted for its approval, voted to approve budget transfers to fund it, and then voted to reapprove it on reconsideration. The 2008 Council approved the Severance Agreement, and the budget transfers to fund it, by a 5-2 vote. After the votes, the 2008 Council voted to hire Michael Cunningham\n   as the new county administrator and adjourned without conducting any further business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pursuant to the terms of the Severance Agreement, Preston agreed to resign as county administrator on November 30, 2008, and release all claims against the County and any of its Council members regarding his employment. In exchange, Preston received $1,139,833-less state and federal withholdings-from the County. The County also contributed $359,258 to the SCRS \"to pay for retirement service credits,\" paid Preston $780,575 \"in the form of a severance benefit,\" and gave Preston title to the 2006 GMC Yukon he was using as a County vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The newly constituted 2009 Council held its first meeting on January 6, 2009, during which it voted to hire a new law firm and a financial investigator to review Cunningham's employment contract, investigate the manner in which he was hired, and review the actions taken by the 2008 Council on November 18, 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thereafter, the County sued Preston, alleging causes of action for (1) violation of the State Ethics Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   section 2-37(g) of the\n   Anderson County Code of Ordinances (the County Code), and the common law; (2) violation of public policy; (3) breach of fiduciary duty; (4) fraud; (5) constructive fraud; (6) negligent misrepresentation; (7) capriciousness, unreasonableness, and fraud; (8) fundamental and substantial breach of the Severance Agreement; (9) breach of fiduciary duties relating to back-dated documents; (10) constructive trust; and (11) unjust enrichment. The County later amended its complaint to\n   include additional factual allegations. Preston filed his answer to the amended complaint, asserting counterclaims against the County and SCRS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County then filed a reply to Preston's counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 12, 2011, the case was designated as complex and assigned for all purposes to the Honorable Roger L. Couch. After hearing arguments, the circuit court denied the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment in all respects on October 23, 2012. As to Preston and the County, the court found summary judgment was inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact existed regarding the claims and counterclaims asserted. The matter was tried without a jury from October 29, 2012, to November 5, 2012. In its May 3, 2013 order (the Final Order), the court granted judgment in favor of Preston on all causes of action as well as his counterclaim against the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the Final Order, the circuit court disqualified four 2008 Council members for improperly participating in the votes approving the Severance Agreement. The court found Thompson voted in violation of section 2-37(g)(4)(e) of the County Code because he was seeking future employment from the County through Preston at the time of the vote. The court likewise found Ron Wilson's vote violated subsections 2-37(g)(4)(a) and (e) because Ron Wilson's daughter had recently received a substantial financial benefit from Preston after he extended her personal services contract with the County. Although Waldrep and Cindy Wilson voted against the Severance Agreement, the court found their votes violated section 2-37(g) because both had a \"financial interest greater than that of the general Anderson County public\" and their participation created \"a substantial appearance of impropriety.\" Given that \"Preston agreed not to pursue any further claims against any County Council member,\" the court found Waldrep and Cindy Wilson \"had a direct economic interest\"-regardless of the\n   vote's outcome-and should not have participated while he maintained a lawsuit against them individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After disqualifying four of the seven members, the court-relying upon\n   <em>\n    Baird v.

Preston filed an answer, and the County submitted a reply. Richard Freemantle,\n   a third party, filed a post-trial motion to intervene. The circuit court, however, denied all of the parties' post-trial motions in an order (the Post-Trial Order) dated November 8, 2013.

Because\n   <em>\n    Baird\n   </em>\n   indicates we do not follow the single tainted vote rule in South Carolina, we find the circuit court properly declined the County's invitation to apply it in the instant case.

BAKER, APPELLATE PROCEDURE IN SOUTH CAROLINA 189 (3d ed. 2016) (\"Post-trial motions are ... utilized to raise issues that could not have been raised at trial.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   After entry of the Final Order, the County filed a motion to reconsider, arguing the circuit court's \"invalidation of four total votes mean [t] there was no quorum for the vote on [the Severance Agreement], rendering the vote void.\" In the Post-Trial Order, the court found the quorum issue was not preserved because the County failed to present the issue to the court, despite having ample opportunity to raise it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Unlike the circuit court, we find the prospect of a quorum being destructed did not exist until the court invalidated four Council members' votes in the Final Order, and in doing so, granted relief that was not requested by either party. Neither the County nor Preston presented an argument prior to or during trial that would have resulted in four votes being invalidated. The County repeatedly argued in favor of invalidating the votes of Thompson, Ron Wilson, and McAbee. Nevertheless, invalidating three votes would not have destroyed the quorum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   At trial, the circuit court noted the issue of whether Cindy Wilson and Waldrep had conflicts of interest \"has come up as an allegation\" and stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   I didn't remember this being alleged or discussed during our pretrial motion period, that the two votes I want to say that weren't in favor because one time it was an abstention and one time it was a vote against, should also not count because they had a dog in the fight. I don't know whether that's ple [aded]. I don't know if it[ ] just wasn't argued. It's come up as an argument now, and I ... went over the pleadings before we started, and I started off with hearings going over those, and I don't recall that being something that was ple[aded], but maybe it has been. I don't know. So, I'm [going to] ask you about that, and I'll give you a chance to tell me about your side of it in just a minute, Mr. Davis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The court, however, never ruled at trial on whether Cindy Wilson or Waldrep's votes were invalid based upon their conflicts of interest. The court did not find Cindy Wilson and Waldrep were disqualified from voting due to conflicts of interest until it issued the Final Order. Therefore, once the court decided to invalidate Thompson and Ron Wilson's votes, along with Cindy Wilson and Waldrep's votes, the quorum issue arose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because the argument regarding Cindy Wilson and Waldrep's votes was not raised prior to trial or ruled upon during trial-and the County argued only for the disqualification of Thompson, Ron Wilson, and McAbee-we find the question of whether a quorum existed first arose when the circuit court invalidated the votes of four Council members due to conflicts of interest in the Final Order. Accordingly, we hold the County's Rule 59(e) motion was the proper means by which to raise the argument that the Severance Agreement should be invalidated because the 2008 Council passed it in the absence of a quorum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fryer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655571\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/369/395/#p399\">\n    369 S.C. at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655571\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/369/395/#p399\">\n    631 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   920 ; TOAL ET AL. ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 189. Further, while the circuit court initially found the quorum issue was not preserved, we note the court also addressed the merits of the parties' quorum arguments in the alternative. Based on the foregoing, we find the County's argument is preserved for appellate review because it was properly raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Turning to the merits, the County argues the circuit court erred in finding the 2008 Council's approval of the Severance Agreement was valid because-contrary to the court's findings\n   71\n   Council members destroyed the quorum necessary for conducting valid business. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In the Post-Trial Order, the circuit court found a quorum was present and the vote was valid for the following reasons: (1) a quorum is determined based on a person's presence at the meeting, not on voting ability; (2) \"the County's Code did not require a majority of Council to vote on an issue to be a valid vote, but rather a majority of those present and voting to carry the question\"; (3) \"the County's prior interpretation and usage under its own Code ... allowed votes to be taken despite the disqualification of certain members, so long as present at the meeting site\"; and (4) \"the County Code expressly incorporated [the Freedom of Information Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] and the State Ethics Act-both of which define quorum without reference to voting disqualifications-into County meeting procedures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Section 2-37(g)(3) of the County Code provides, \"Except where otherwise specified in these rules, a majority vote of those members present and voting shall decide all questions, motions, and other votes.\" Section 2-37(d) defines a quorum as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A quorum shall consist of a majority of the council. In the absence of a quorum, the meeting cannot be convened. Should sufficient members leave during a meeting, the chairperson shall immediately declare a recess and attempt to obtain a quorum. If, after a reasonable time, a quorum has not been obtained, the meeting shall be adjourned. Members of county council may excuse themselves briefly during a meeting without loss of a quorum; however, no vote may be taken during the temporary absence of quorum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In the instant case, the circuit court invalidated four of the Council member's votes. The County Code, however, provides no guidance for situations in which a vote is invalidated due to a member's conflict of interest. For issues of parliamentary procedure not addressed in the County Code, it provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   In all particulars not determined by these rules, or by law, the chairperson or other presiding officer shall be guided by the previous usage of county council or by parliamentary law and procedure as it may be collected from Roberts [sic] Rules of Order, latest edition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Anderson County, S.C., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 2-37(g)(12) (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The County Code states the Council may not take a vote during the temporary absence of a quorum, but it does not specifically address what happens when such a vote is taken. Therefore, we look to\n   <em>\n    Robert's Rules of Order\n   </em>\n   , which provides, \"In the absence of a quorum, any business transacted ... is null and void.\" HENRY M. ROBERT ET AL., ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER \u00a7 40, at 347 (11th ed. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Robert's Rules of Order\n   </em>\n   renders any business transacted in the absence of a quorum null and void, it does not address the effect of an invalidated vote on the calculation of a quorum. Nevertheless, South Carolina courts have repeatedly addressed this issue as it relates to various governing bodies. In\n   <em>\n    Garris v. Governing Board of South Carolina Reinsurance Facility\n   </em>\n   , for example, our supreme court considered the effect of a disqualified vote in a corporate context and stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   In the absence of any statutory or other controlling provision, the common-law rule that a majority of a whole board is necessary to constitute a quorum applies, and the board may do no valid act in the absence of a quorum. A member who recuses himself or is disqualified to participate in a matter due to a conflict of interest, bias, or other good cause may not be counted for purposes of a quorum at the meeting where the board acts upon the matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"799420\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/333/432/#p453\">\n    333 S.C. 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 453,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"799420\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/333/432/#p453\">\n    511 S.E.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59 (1998) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Prior to\n   <em>\n    Garris\n   </em>\n   , our supreme court repeatedly stated the general rule that a corporation's director or board member with a personal interest in a corporate matter may not be \"counted to make a quorum at a meeting where the matter is acted upon.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Talbot v.

Specifically, the\n   <em>\n    Baird\n   </em>\n   court considered the issue of \"whether invalidation of a bond ordinance [was] a proper remedy for a violation of the State Ethics Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 535, 511 S.E.2d at 77.

Under these circumstances, Griggs's delay in seeking rescission works no prejudice on DuPont, thus making it proper and equitable to grant rescission without requiring Griggs to make complete restoration of the benefits he received in connection with his initial lump-sum election. At the same time, because the relief we describe allows Griggs to rescind his lump-sum election and instead receive a monthly payment for life (albeit in a lesser amount), DuPont's breach of fiduciary duty does not go unremedied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319491\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/440/#p452\">\n    385 F.3d at 452-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In light of our invalidation of the Severance Agreement, we find rescission is an unavailable remedy because the contract never existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cordell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2120553\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/237/88/#p98\">\n    237 S.C. at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2120553\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/237/88/#p98\">\n    115 S.E.2d at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting \"there can be no rescission of a nonexistent contract\").

After providing a lengthy list of actions, the court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   [W]hen taken in its totality, the evidence of record firmly establishes that the County, by and through certain of its sitting Council members acting with members of the Council-elect, engaged in a pattern of conduct intended to harass\n   and interfere with Preston's ability to execute his duties as [c]ounty [a]dministrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   We hold the circuit court erred in finding the County had unclean hands for two reasons. First, the listed actions taken by incoming members of the 2009 Council are irrelevant to the analysis of this issue because those individuals had not been sworn into office yet, and therefore, had no authority to act on behalf of the County. While the court acknowledged these individuals' conduct could not be attributable to the County, it nevertheless included their conduct in the list and used such conduct as a basis for finding the County had unclean hands. To the extent the circuit court relied upon the actions of the incoming Council members, we agree with the County's contention that it \"confused the political rhetoric of primary winners with actual County conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Most of the remaining conduct the circuit court cited concerns actions taken by Waldrep and Cindy Wilson toward Preston during his tenure as county administrator, for which he sued both of them in their\n   <em>\n    individual capacities\n   </em>\n   , not their capacities as Council members. We find the conduct of two Council members acting in their individual capacities may not, however, be imputed to the County. Accordingly, we hold the circuit court erred in considering the conduct of \"others\" in reaching its conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arnold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2058384\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/201/523/#p532\">\n    201 S.C. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20S.E.2d%20735\">\n    23 S.E.2d at 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting \"[t]he expression 'clean hands' means a clean record with respect to the transaction with\n   <em>\n    the defendants themselves\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    not with respect to others\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   30A C.J.S.\n   <em>\n    Equity\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 118 (2015) (\"An innocent party is, of course, not barred from relief because of the misconduct of others for which he or she is not responsible....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Second, we find the listed conduct had nothing to do with the subject matter of this litigation. In the Final Order, the circuit court primarily focused its analysis upon the actions of two individual Council members, Waldrep and Cindy Wilson, dating back to 2005. In concluding the County had unclean hands, the court specifically found the behavior of Waldrep and Cindy Wilson-along with incoming members of the 2009 Council-\"prejudiced Preston in the execution of his duties, prompting his assertion of the anticipatory breach claim and tort claims in the first instance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As noted above, the County was not responsible for the conduct of its incoming Council members, and thus, their conduct prior to taking office is irrelevant here. We find the court's reliance upon meetings that took place between incoming Council members in 2009 misplaced because the instant matter concerns actions leading up and relating to the November 18, 2008 meeting of the 2008 Council. What occurred after this meeting among individuals not yet sworn into office simply has no bearing upon the resolution of this issue. More importantly, much of the conduct referenced by the circuit court was already litigated in separate matters not before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   For these reasons, we hold the circuit court erred in considering conduct that-although indicative of \"the atmosphere that surrounded the actors in this case\"-was irrelevant to the subject matter of the instant litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arnold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2058384\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/201/523/#p532\">\n    201 S.C. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20S.E.2d%20735\">\n    23 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   738 ;\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1246086\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/365/482/#p493\">\n    365 S.C. at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1246086\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/365/482/#p493\">\n    617 S.E.2d at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We find the court ignored the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Arnold\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   in concluding such conduct prejudiced Preston in the execution of his duties as county administrator because, simply put, Preston's ability to execute his duties as county administrator has nothing to do with this case. The instant litigation focuses on whether improper conduct at the November 18, 2008 meeting of the 2008 Council requires this court to invalidate the approval of Preston's Severance Agreement and rescind the agreement itself. Furthermore, Preston had already relinquished his position as county administrator before the 2009 Council decided to bring this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we hold the circuit court erred in finding the County could not invoke its equitable powers to rescind the Severance Agreement because the County had unclean hands. Although we agree rescission is unavailable as a remedy in this case, we reverse the circuit court's finding that the County had unclean hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

The County's main purpose in bringing this action was to seek the above equitable relief, not merely to question the legality of the Severance Agreement. Because the anti-alienation provision in section 9-1-1680 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2016), only allows a party to reach a retiree's benefits in a constructive trust case, we find no adequate remedy at law existed as to this equitable claim. Regardless of whether rescission was available, the County could not have received complete relief without the court invoking its equitable powers to place Preston's retirement benefits in a constructive trust. Thus, we find a declaratory judgment action would not have afforded the complete relief sought in this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santee Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2174549\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/298/179/#p185\">\n    298 S.C. at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2174549\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/298/179/#p185\">\n    379 S.E.2d at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting \"[a]n adequate remedy at law is one which is as certain, practical, complete[,] and efficient to attain\n   the ends of justice and its administration as the remedy in equity\" (citation omitted)). Further, as noted above, a declaratory judgment action can be equitable in nature-and indeed, would have been given the relief sought in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Accordingly, given that no adequate remedy at law existed, we reverse the circuit court's finding that the County could not invoke its equitable powers because the County could have challenged the Severance Agreement's legality via a declaratory judgment action instead of directly suing Preston.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. Breach of the Severance Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In light of our previous holding that the Severance Agreement is invalid because it\n   was approved during an absence of a quorum, we find Preston can no longer succeed on his breach of contract counterclaim. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's finding that the County breached the covenant not to sue provision in the Severance Agreement by bringing the instant action. We decline to address whether attorney's fees are appropriate because the circuit court found this issue \"should be held in abeyance pending the final disposition of this case and the filing of any petition as required by law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Remaining Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Finally, because our resolution of prior issues is dispositive in this appeal, we decline to rule upon whether the circuit court erred in finding the Severance Agreement was not unreasonable and capricious; a product of fraud and abuse of power; or void as against public policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"30017\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/335/598/#p613\">\n    335 S.C. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 613,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"30017\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/335/598/#p613\">\n    518 S.E.2d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Like the circuit court, we are mindful of the separation of powers concerns attendant to the judicial branch of government overturning the action of a duly elected county council, and therefore, take this opportunity to clarify that nothing in this opinion shall be construed as passing judgment on the merits or propriety of the 2008 Council's decision. Our decision hinges on the narrow question of whether the 2008 Council\n   had legal authority to approve the Severance Agreement when four of the seven members, despite having clear conflicts of interest, improperly cast their votes on the matter. We hold the 2008 Council had no such authority because it could not legally act in the absence of a quorum. As a result, the Severance Agreement is null and void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   We affirm the circuit court's finding that Preston owed no fiduciary duty to inform the 2008 Council of improper votes and his conduct did not constitute fraud, constructive fraud, or negligent misrepresentation. The circuit court also properly declined the County's invitation to apply the single tainted vote rule because\n   <em>\n    Baird\n   </em>\n   demonstrates South Carolina does not follow such rule. We hold the court erred, however, in refusing to invalidate the 2008 Council's approval of the Severance Agreement based upon the absence of a quorum, and accordingly, we reverse. Although we agree with the circuit court that rescission is not an available remedy because the parties cannot be returned to their status quo ante, we reverse the court's finding of unclean hands. We further reverse the court's finding that the County could not invoke its equitable powers because an adequate remedy at law existed. Lastly, we reverse the court's holding that the County breached the terms of the Severance Agreement by bringing the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   HUFF, J., concurs.
