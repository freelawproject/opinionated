Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   In this appeal we consider whether a district court has jurisdiction to modify a child support order without a party filing a motion to modify asserting that there is a change in circumstances. The Court of Appeals concluded that the district court did not have jurisdiction because Catawba County, by and through its Child Support Agency,\n   <em>\n    ex rel.\n   </em>\n   Shawna Rackley (plaintiff) failed to comply with procedural mandates to file a motion to modify the child support order at issue as required by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13.7(a) (2015). We hold that the district court maintained\n   continuing jurisdiction to modify the child support order and that plaintiff's failure to file a motion to modify the child support order did not divest the district court of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the Court of Appeals decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On 15 February 1999, the District Court in Catawba County entered a Voluntary Support Agreement and Order (VSA) under which Jason Loggins (defendant) agreed to pay \"$0.00\" in child support for his two children with Shawna Rackley (Ms. Rackley). Additionally, starting 1 March 1999, defendant was to reimburse the State $1,996.00 for public assistance paid on behalf of his children. Defendant was also required to provide health insurance for the minor children through his employer or when it was available at a reasonable cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Defendant failed to reimburse the State as required, and on 19 October 2000 plaintiff filed a motion to show cause. The district court ordered defendant to appear, but he failed to do so. Defendant was arrested and later released on a $500.00 cash bond that was allocated to his arrearage. After hearing the matter in January 2001, the district court found that defendant was employed at Carolina Hardwoods earning $9.95 per hour, and was able to comply with the 1999 VSA. The court ordered defendant to make $50.00 monthly payments towards his then-arrearages of $1,165.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Subsequently, a second VSA titled \"Modified Voluntary Support Agreement and Order\" was signed by defendant on 25 June 2001. This agreement did not reference the original VSA or the 1999 order, nor did it show that the district court established defendant's paternity in 1999. The parties did attach a child support worksheet stating defendant had a monthly gross income of $1,724.66 and recommending $419.00 for his monthly child support obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2001 VSA was approved by the court and entered on 28 June 2001. This order is the basis of all controversy on appeal. In the 2001 VSA, defendant agreed to pay $419.00 per month in child support starting 1 July 2001 and to reimburse the State $422.78 for public assistance given to his children. In addition, defendant agreed to provide health insurance to his children through his then-employer, Crown Heritage, Inc. Unlike the 1999 VSA, the 2001 VSA contains no modification provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Throughout the following years, defendant failed to comply with the 2001 VSA. Accordingly, the trial court entered consent contempt orders on 20 November 2003, 21 July 2005 and 25 January 2007. Each time defendant admitted to being in civil contempt for his failure to pay amounts due under the 2001 VSA. By 2007, the amount defendant owed totaled $16,422.28. In the 2007 consent\n   order, the trial court ordered defendant to make monthly child support payments totaling $479.00 with $60.00 going towards arrears. On 5 April 2007, the district court concluded defendant was in compliance with the 25 January 2007 order and determined that his arrearages were $15,572.80. The district court ordered defendant to continue his monthly child support payments of $419.00 plus $60.00 towards arrears. Eventually, defendant again failed to pay the child support ordered by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 7 April 2011, defendant filed,\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   a motion to modify the 2007 consent order. Defendant stated there was a change in circumstances because he \"draw[s] unemployment, [and his] kids [ages 17 and 18] have quit school.\" The district court heard the matter on 11 August 2011. Ms. Rackley failed to appear. On 15 September 2011 the district court found a change in circumstances, noting that \"[d]efendant was drawing unemployment benefits, since has obtained fulltime employment. Oldest child ... has emancipated according to [ N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13.4(c) ].\" Based on the child support guidelines, the district court reduced defendant's monthly child support obligation to $247.00 and found his arrears to be $6,640.75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 13 March 2014, defendant, now represented by counsel, moved the district court pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 60, to set aside the 2001 VSA as void. Defendant contended that \"prior to June 28, 2001 there was [sic] not any motions filed by [Ms. Rackley] or on her behalf to modify the 'then' existing child support obligation [of $0.00 under the 1999 VSA].\" A hearing was held on 31 July 2014, during which defendant asserted that the 1999 VSA was a permanent order and that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to modify it without a motion in the cause by plaintiff and a showing of a change in circumstances. He argued that the 2001 VSA was void and, as a result, unenforceable. Plaintiff's counsel conceded, \"There's no indication that [the 1999 VSA] was a temporary order. We use the colloquial term 'permanent' although every order can be modified, but I would agree that that's what we normally refer to as a permanent order rather than a temporary order.\" Following the hearing, defense counsel tendered a draft order to the district court without serving it upon plaintiff's counsel. The district court entered an order on 18 December 2014 granting defendant's motion but a few days later set aside that order because it contained \"errors and was not presented\n   following approved procedure\" in that defendant did not serve the proposed order on plaintiff before tendering it to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 29 December 2014, the district court entered a second order granting defendant's Rule 60 Motion. The district court found that it did not have jurisdiction to enter the 2001 VSA because there was no precipitating motion filed by plaintiff or on her behalf, nor was there any proof of a change in circumstances; therefore, the order resulting from the 2001 VSA was void. Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the Court of Appeals, plaintiff argued, in pertinent part, that the district court erroneously concluded that a motion to modify a child support obligation must precede a modification order. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the plain language of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13.7(a) \"requires a 'motion in the cause and a showing of changed circumstances' as a necessary condition for the [district] court to modify an existing support order.\"\n   <em>\n    Catawba County ex rel.

Unlike the current statute, in the original version of the law the legislature restricted the court's authority by expressly stating that, except in exigent circumstances, an order to vacate or modify could not be entered if the other party was not given five days notice. The same language regarding the establishment and modification of support orders-including the mandatory five-day notice requirement-survived various\n   revisions of the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 N.C.

The same language was later incorporated in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13 (1943) along with additional provisions regarding custody; however, in 1967 N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13 (1943) was repealed and replaced with the original version of the current statute, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13.7(a) (1967).

Two of these alimony laws are relevant here. The first of them allowed alimony\n   <em>\n    pendente lite\n   </em>\n   . The language in this alimony enactment is similar to that used to establish and modify child support and custody orders, stating that \"such order may be modified or vacated at any time, on the application of either party or of any one [sic] interested:\n   <em>\n    Provided,\n   </em>\n   That no order allowing alimony\n   <em>\n    pendente lite\n   </em>\n   shall be made unless the husband shall have had five days' notice thereof.\" Ch. 193, sec. 38, 1871-72 N.C.

The laws were later codified, with the modification and mandatory notice provisions surviving in subsequent versions of the\n   <em>\n    pendente lite\n   </em>\n   alimony law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 N.C.

While this edict did not originally have the language concerning modifications or notice, such wording was later added in 1919 and survived several revisions of the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ch. 193, sec. 39, 1871-72 N.C.

This comprehensive analysis of the legislative history of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13.7(a), the governing statute in the case at bar, establishes that the legislature did not intend that subsection 50-13.7(a) create a jurisdictional prerequisite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The Provision in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13.7(a) Is Directory Rather than Mandatory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The provision of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13.7(a) requiring a motion to be filed is directory rather than mandatory; consequently, the absence of a motion to modify a child support order does not divest the district court of jurisdiction to act under the purview of the statute.

According to defendant, to hold otherwise will encourage parties to disregard other procedural requirements such as filing complaints, issuing summonses and observing other mandatory provisions. This Court is not persuaded by defendant's \"snowball effect\" argument. Here, plaintiff filed a VSA, which was sufficient to satisfy the purposes of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13.7(a). A primary purpose of a requirement to file a motion in order to modify child support is to make the court aware of \"important new facts unknown to the court at the time of the prior custody decree.\"\n   <em>\n    Tank v.

When a VSA is filed to modify an earlier court order on child support, the VSA is customarily a request to modify the child support order because circumstances have changed. Thus, a VSA submitted to the district court without such a motion still serves the purpose highlighted in\n   <em>\n    Tank, a\n   </em>\n   case from the State of North Dakota that is instructive for this analysis. Thus, our decision also harmoniously aligns with the\n   statutory provision requiring a showing of a change in circumstances in order for a child support order to be modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the COA affirming the trial court's order declaring the 2001 VSA void and remand this case to that court for further remand to the District Court,\n   Catawba County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The parties attached \"Work Sheet A,\" Form \"AOC-CV-627 Rev. 10/98\" of the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines.

Under subsection 50-13.7(a) of our General Statutes, \"an order of a court of this State for support of a minor child may be modified or vacated at any time,\n    <em>\n     upon motion in the cause\n    </em>\n    and a showing of changed circumstances.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-13.7(a) (2015) (emphasis added). Here, the district court acted only after defendant had entered into a proposed Modified Voluntary Support Agreement and Order (the consent order), which the parties then submitted to the district court for approval. Because the consent order served as the functional equivalent of a joint motion, I concur in the result that the majority opinion reaches.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    But I do not concur in the majority's reasoning, as the majority's rationale seems to extend much further than the context of this case. Because it holds that the \"motion in the cause\" language of subsection 50-13.7(a) is directory rather than mandatory, the majority seems to allow a district court to modify a child support order-and thus to alter the legal rights and duties of the parties involved-sua sponte, without any party invoking the court's power. This rule, if the majority is indeed establishing it, ignores the plain language of the very statutory provision that gives district courts the power to modify these kinds of orders. It also potentially subverts the customary role that courts play in our adversarial system: to rule on the issues actually raised and argued by the parties. This seems imprudent at best, and may raise serious jurisdictional\n    concerns as well. I therefore write separately to express my opinion that the majority's reasoning should be read narrowly.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    This Court said in\n    <em>\n     State v.

Jur. 2d\n    <em>\n     Statutes\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 19, at 280). Under this standard, a provision that requires a motion in order for a district court to modify an existing support order should be viewed as mandatory for several reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    First of all, the motion requirement in subsection 50-13.7(a) is not \"a mere matter of form.\" It defines both the role of the parties and the role of the court in child support proceedings. If a party wishes to have a child support order modified, that party must file a motion in the cause\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    serve it on the opposing party. That gives the opposing party notice of the motion and the chance to present arguments opposing it. And that is how our adversarial system normally operates. But parties have no opportunity to contest a potential modification when a court acts sua sponte. Granting a court the power to act sua sponte in this context, as the majority appears to do, both destabilizes already concluded agreements and affects the substantial rights of parties who rely on those agreements. Parties also have an interest in the finality of judgments and the repose that they provide. Under the majority's apparent rationale, though, cases once resolved could be reopened even though neither party wants to continue litigating.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <em>\n     In re T.R.P.\n    </em>\n    is an analogous case. There, we held that a statutory provision requiring a verification signature on a juvenile petition-the lack of which would in many cases be a simple oversight-was mandatory.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787934\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/360/588/#p590\">\n     360 N.C. 588\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 598,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12637106\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/636/787/#p789\">\n     636 S.E.2d 787\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 794-95 (2006).

A similar logic motivates the language of subsection 50-13.7(a). A district court can always modify a support order on request of a party who shows a change in circumstances and good reason to modify the\n    order. But if the majority ruling is read to permit even sua sponte modifications, it would disturb several decades of Court of Appeals precedent that domestic relations parties and social services agencies throughout North Carolina have\n    presumably come to rely on.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Royall v.

At the very least, the majority does not establish that it is not. The majority's discussion of jurisdiction establishes only that the district court here had continuing jurisdiction over this case and these parties. That is clear. But by focusing on continuing jurisdiction, the majority ducks the real issue: whether, in the absence of a motion or its functional equivalent, a district court has the power to modify a child support order, or instead lacks the power to do so unless and until it receives a request from an interested party to modify the order.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The term \"[j]urisdiction\" refers to \"[a] court's power to decide a case\n    <em>\n     or issue a decree\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     In re M.I.W.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154260\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/365/374/#p379\">\n     365 N.C. 374\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 379,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=722%20S.E.2d%20469\">\n     722 S.E.2d 469\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 473 (2012) (second set of brackets in original) (emphasis added) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    927 (9th ed. 2009)). \"[H]aving jurisdiction is simply a state of being that requires, and in some cases allows, no substantive action from the court.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 379,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=722%20S.E.2d%20469\">\n     722 S.E.2d at 473\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Hence the concern here: a district court that ignores a mandatory motion requirement in issuing an order may well be acting in excess of its jurisdiction, and its order may well be void.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Defending its position, the majority notes that \"the jurisdiction of the court entering ... a [child support] decree continues as long as the minor child whose custody is the subject of the decree remains within its jurisdiction,\" quoting\n    <em>\n     Stanback v.

But again, the issue here is not whether the district court had continuing jurisdiction, but whether the district court exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    A court can, of course, dismiss a case sua sponte for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) ;\n    <em>\n     accord\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3), but that is one of the few exceptions that proves the rule. Many other things, including personal jurisdiction, are waivable and should not be raised sua sponte.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1) ;\n    <em>\n     accord\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1). Courts always have jurisdiction to determine subject-matter jurisdiction, but they do not always have-in fact, they usually do not have-the power to determine other matters unless asked to do so by a party.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    By ignoring the possibility that a district court that modified a support order sua sponte may be acting in excess of its jurisdiction, and by reading the standard for directory versus mandatory statutes in a way that strongly favors the \"directory\" label, the majority raises several troubling questions. What must the General Assembly do to make a procedural rule actually binding on the courts? Does the magic word \"jurisdictional\" now have to be in the statute's text? Would a court with both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction have the power to issue a summary judgment order when no party had moved for summary judgment? Would a court be able to issue a final judgment in a case that had disputed material facts in the absence of settlement or trial? These last two questions show the error in the majority's thinking, and the inconsistency of its reasoning with foundational principles of our adversarial\n    system: a district court can plainly have jurisdiction over a case but lack the power to issue a certain decree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The consent order satisfied subsection 50-13.7(a)'s motion requirement, so the district court here did not act sua sponte. We therefore do not have to decide whether a district court that did act sua sponte in this context would be exceeding its jurisdiction. It is important, however, that we distinguish in future cases between a court's jurisdiction over a case, on the one hand, and a court's power to issue a particular order or remedy, on the other. Those two things are not the same. Accordingly, I concur in the result only.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Justice ERVIN joins in this concurring opinion.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
