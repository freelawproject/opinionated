We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 20, 2012, Nero was working on a SCDOT road crew supervised by lead man Benjamin Durant and supervisor Danny Bostick. Nero's work, along with that of four or five other members of the crew, involved pulling a thirty-foot-long two-by-four \"squeegee board\" to level freshly poured concrete. At some point during the day, Bostick pulled Nero off the squeegee board temporarily because Nero appeared overheated. After a break, Nero returned to pulling the squeegee board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At approximately 3:00 p.m., after finishing their work and cleaning up, the crew, including Nero, Durant, and Bostick, was talking and joking near the supervisor's truck when Nero lost consciousness and fell to the ground. Nero regained consciousness, stood up, told his supervisors he was fine, and drove home. Once home, Nero passed out again while sitting in his driveway. His wife immediately took him to the hospital where he was admitted and treated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the emergency room, Nero filled out a \"History and Physical Report\" and stated, \"I passed out talking to my boss.\" Nero was initially seen by his primary care physician, Dr. Robert Richey. After a series of tests, Dr. Richey determined Nero had cervical stenosis and referred Nero to a neurosurgeon, Dr. William Naso, who performed a fusion surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 9, 2012, prior to his surgery, Nero provided the human resources department with his \"SCDOT Certification of Health Care Provider for Employee's Serious Health Condition (Family Medical Leave Act)\" paperwork. Nero did not mention the squeegee incident in this submission, and under the section designated \"approximate date condition commenced,\" Nero stated, \"several years-neck and syncope.\" During his deposition, Nero testified he had not been treated for any back or neck problems prior to the squeegee board incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 6, 2014, Nero filed a request for a hearing, alleging he suffered injuries to his neck and shoulders while pulling the squeegee board on June 20, 2012. The single commissioner found Nero's claim compensable as an injury by accident that aggravated a preexisting cervical disc condition in Nero's neck. The single commissioner further determined Nero had a \"reasonable excuse\" for not formally reporting his work injury because (1) his lead man and supervisor were present and knew of pertinent facts surrounding the accident sufficient to indicate the possibility of a compensable injury, (2) the lead man and supervisor followed up with Nero, and (3) SCDOT was aware Nero did not return to work after the June 20, 2012 incident. Further, SCDOT was notified Nero was hospitalized and ultimately had neck surgery. Finally, the\n   single commissioner found\n   SCDOT was not prejudiced by the late formal reporting of the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   SCDOT appealed to the Appellate Panel. The Appellate Panel reversed the single commissioner, finding that although Nero's supervisors witnessed him pass out, Nero never reported that the squeegee board accident involved a \"snap\" in his shoulders and neck. The Appellate Panel further found Nero's excuse for not formally reporting was not reasonable and SCDOT was prejudiced because Nero's late reporting deprived it of the opportunity to investigate the incident and whether Nero's work aggravated his preexisting cervical stenosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for our review of Appellate Panel decisions.\n   <em>\n    Lark v.

Nero was able to communicate with SCDOT because he submitted the necessary paperwork for benefits under the Family and Medical Leave Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FMLA). As Nero has not alleged any mental condition, physical issue, or third party prevented his formal reporting, we must determine whether SCDOT had knowledge of Nero's accident pursuant to section 42-15-20(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nero submits the following facts in support of his argument that SCDOT had adequate notice of his workplace injury. On June 20, 2012, Bostick was concerned about Nero due to both the heat and his age and temporarily pulled Nero off of the squeegee board. After finishing for the day, though while still on the clock, Nero lost consciousness and fell to the ground-Durant and Bostick both witnessed the incident. After regaining consciousness and driving home, Nero passed out a second time. His wife immediately took him to the hospital where he was admitted, treated by a neurosurgeon, and diagnosed with cervical stenosis. He underwent neck surgery approximately two months later. Durant and Bostick were both aware that Nero was hospitalized and had surgery. In fact, they spoke with Nero while he was in the hospital. Nero never returned to work thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   SCDOT argues Nero omitted several crucial facts contrary to his argument that a reasonably conscientious manager should have been aware of a potential compensation claim. First, \"and most importantly,\" SCDOT points to the \"SCDOT Certification of Health Care Provider for Employee's Serious Health Condition (Family Medical Leave Act)\" (Exhibit 1), signed by Nero and Dr. Richey and delivered to the human resources department on July 9, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exhibit 1 states the\n   approximate date Nero's condition commenced was \"several years-neck and syncope.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, SCDOT contends Nero never actually reported his injury to his employer, despite speaking to both Bostick and Durant while hospitalized. Finally, SCDOT remarks on the medical evidence in the record. In the \"Patient Health History Questionnaire\" Nero prepared and signed for Dr. Naso, Nero stated his problems were not related to his job and this was not a worker's compensation injury. Dr. Naso initially commented, \"I do not think his syncope is related to cervical spine pathology.\" However, Dr. Richey testified Nero's preexisting cervical spine condition was aggravated by his pulling of the squeegee board and that this, along with Nero's work in the heat, caused the syncope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At his deposition, Nero testified the injury to his upper back and shoulders was a result of pulling the squeegee over a concrete pad.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q: And tell me what happened during that process of you pulling the squeegee board?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A: I got a pain in between pulling the squeegee board when they take someone off it that put more stress in there, due to whoever is left on the squeegee has got less to help pull it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q: Yes Sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A: But you also still got to keep going [be]cause if you don't keep going-you're going to blotch up.

Nero testified he told Bostick, \"I think he asked me what ... was wrong. I said I am in the hospital. I said ever since I fell out, I said, I've been here ever since.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although Nero never formally reported his injuries to his supervisors, Durant and Bostick both witnessed Nero fall to the ground, unconscious, after completing the physically challenging squeegee board work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hanks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2166724\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/286/378/#p381\">\n    286 S.C. at 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2166724\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/286/378/#p381\">\n    335 S.E.2d at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 42-15-20 provides no specific method of giving notice, the object being that the employer be actually put on notice of the injury so he can investigate it immediately after its occurrence and can furnish medical care for the employee in order to minimize the disability and his own liability.\"). Significantly, Durant's reason for not reporting Nero's incident to Bostick was that Bostick was \"right there.\" Because our supreme court has long held that the statutory notice provision is to be liberally construed in favor of claimants, we find the Appellate Panel erred in reversing the single commissioner's determination that SCDOT received adequate notice under section 42-15-20(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Etheredge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"169618\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/349/451/#p458\">\n    349 S.C. at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"169618\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/349/451/#p458\">\n    562 S.E.2d at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding \"notice is adequate, when there is some knowledge of accompanying facts connecting the injury or illness with the employment, and signifying to a reasonably conscientious\n   supervisor that the case might involve a potential compensation claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Reasonable Excuse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nero next contends the Appellate Panel erred in finding he failed to establish a \"reasonable excuse\" for any notice deficiency and that SCDOT was prejudiced by this lack of notice. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Section 42-15-20(B) provides in relevant part that \"no compensation shall be payable unless such notice is given within ninety days after the occurrence of the accident or death, unless reasonable excuse is made to the satisfaction of the commission for not giving timely notice, and the commission is satisfied that the employer has not been prejudiced thereby.\" Once reasonable excuse has been established, it is the employer's burden to demonstrate prejudice from the\n   absence of formal notice.\n   <em>\n    Lizee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2607823\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/122/#p127\">\n    367 S.C. at 129-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2607823\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/122/#p127\">\n    623 S.E.2d at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, \"lack of prejudice does not justify compensation unless the requirement of reasonable excuse is also satisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray v. Laurens Mill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2100473\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/231/488/#p492\">\n    231 S.C. 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 492,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2100473\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/231/488/#p492\">\n    99 S.E.2d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (1957). When determining whether prejudice exists, the Appellate Panel should be cognizant that the notice requirement protects the employer by enabling it to \"investigate the facts and question witnesses while their memories are unfaded, and ... to furnish medical care [to] the employee in order to minimize the disability and consequent liability upon the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Mintz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2087271\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/218/409/#p413\">\n    218 S.C. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2087271\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/218/409/#p413\">\n    63 S.E.2d at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, Nero's reason for not formally reporting his workplace incident was that his supervisors were present when he lost consciousness. Moreover, Durant and Bostick talked with Nero while he was hospitalized and were aware of his treatment and subsequent surgery, as well as the fact that he never returned to work after his collapse. Further, as the single commissioner recognized, Durant testified he never reported the incident to his own supervisor, Bostick, because it happened in Bostick's presence.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q: I'm looking at [these] instructions you guys got about injuries on the job. As the lead man, do you get to choose-you have some discretion in choosing what injuries to report and what injuries not to report?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A: Do we get-no.

Yes, if it happens right here with me, I have a responsibility to report it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q: What if I say, look here, lead man, it's just my thumb.

Well, let me ask you, when [Nero] passed out that day, did you tell your supervisor about it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A: He was right there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q: Safe to say, after that day, when you knew that Nero had passed out, you felt like that it had been reported wherever it needed to be reported on the count of the fact that your supervisor was standing right there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A: Well, not only that, I mean, being real, it probably done got back to whoever it need[ed] to get back to when he was out of work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In reversing the single commissioner's finding that Nero provided a \"reasonable excuse\" for not formally reporting his work injury, the Appellate Panel found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Although Claimant's supervisors witnessed Claimant's syncope episode, Claimant never reported the alleged accident from pulling the squeegee board, which was the basis of his claim. Claimant was given several opportunities to report his work accident\n   and even submitted FMLA paperwork ... indicating that his problem lasted for several years instead of requesting workers' compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Although Nero failed to give SCDOT formal notice, his excuse was reasonable because his supervisors were both present at the time of his injury and were aware of his treatment. In fact, Durant's reason for not reporting Nero's incident to Bostick was that Bostick was \"right there\" during the incident. The preponderance of the evidence in the record does not support the Appellate Panel's finding that Nero presented no \"reasonable excuse\" for failing to provide timely notice pursuant to section 42-15-20(B). Further, because SCDOT was aware Nero never returned to work following the June 2012 syncopal episode and knew of his hospitalization and surgical treatment, no prejudice can be established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, the decision of the Appellate Panel is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   LOCKEMY, C.J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -2654 (2009 &amp; Supp. 2011).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Bostick testified that had he been aware of the contents of Exhibit 1, he would have further investigated the accident.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    SCDOT failed to note that Exhibit 1 also indicated Nero required neck surgery and that his beginning date for incapacity was listed as June 20, 2012.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
