Barnes believes Coleman was a key witness whose credibility was central, as she identified him as the gunman in the gray sweatshirt on the surveillance video, and also testified she had seen him with a gun on another occasion. Barnes claims in a separate trial he would have been able to elicit that Coleman and Young were codefendants in an unrelated pending burglary charge. Barnes believes this would have allowed him to better portray to the jury that Coleman's testimony lacked credibility because she was seeking to protect Young, with whom she shares two children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The record reveals the trial court only prohibited Barnes from telling the jury Young was charged in the pending burglary case, presumably because to do so would have introduced improper evidence of Young's character and prior bad acts, transgressing Rule 404, SCRE. Nothing stopped Barnes from confronting Coleman about her bias in favor of Young based on their relationship or her willingness to testify in hopes of reducing her exposure to substantial prison time on the burglary charge. In fact, these areas were explored during her testimony. Being tried with Young did not hamper Barnes' right to cross-examine Coleman effectively; consequently, no prejudice accrued to him. Moreover, we do not believe exclusion of this singular point of impeachment prevented the jury from making a reliable judgment about Barnes' guilt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"281879\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/337/275/#p282\">\n    337 S.C. at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"281879\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/337/275/#p282\">\n    523 S.E.2d at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Coleman's testimony was cumulative to other evidence, including Barnes' letter to his mother and his mother's identification of him in the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Barnes also claims the joint trial prevented him from cross-examining Young about the statements he made to Alfred D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wright and Michael Schaefer identifying \"Trigg\" and \"Trap\" as his accomplices. Because Young did not take the stand, Barnes maintains he could not confront Young and consequently\n   <em>\n    Bruton v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    391 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968), required Barnes be granted a separate trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This is a closer issue. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , the State's decision to try Barnes and Young together was fraught with risk. It also placed the trial court in difficult positions throughout the almost three week trial. Yet,\n   as we concluded in Young's appeal, the trial was fundamentally fair and we can confidently say the jury was not prevented from making a reliable judgment about Barnes' guilt. As more fully explained in Section II,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the evidence of Barnes' guilt was overwhelming. The probability Barnes would have fared better in a separate trial is remote. Accordingly, even if the denial of severance compromised Barnes' right to confront Young, the error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ms. Barnes admitted the communication occurred, but flatly denied she had stated Barnes was the one in the surveillance video wearing the gray sweatshirt. For good measure, the State had Ms. Barnes reaffirm her denial at the end of her direct examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On November 17, the State called McCoy and, over Barnes' objection, published the portion of the August 2013 conversation when Ms. Barnes states her familiarity with her \"kid's build\" and identifies Barnes as the one wearing the gray sweatshirt in the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Rule 613(b), SCRE, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (b) Extrinsic Evidence of Prior Inconsistent Statement of Witness. Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is advised of the substance of the statement, the time and place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made, and is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement. If a witness does not admit that he has made the prior inconsistent statement, extrinsic evidence of such statement is admissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Barnes maintains the State should have been forced to play the recorded conversation between Ms. Barnes and McCoy during Ms. Barnes' testimony. According to Barnes, this approach would have allowed Ms. Barnes the opportunity to explain the inconsistency and given Barnes the opportunity to cross examine her about it. Barnes claims these opportunities vanished once Ms. Barnes was released by consent from her subpoena at the conclusion of her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We see no error. Once the State confronted Ms. Barnes with the substance of her previous statement, the time and place it was made, and the person to whom it was made, and she denied making it, the foundation required by Rule 613(b)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   was complete.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Bixby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865600\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/388/528/#p551\">\n    388 S.C. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551-52,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865600\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/388/528/#p551\">\n    698 S.E.2d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 584-85 (2010) (finding State laid proper foundation under Rule 613(b) for introduction of recorded conversation after witness was excused because witness admitted having conversation at issue but denied making the statements);\n   <em>\n    State v. McLeod\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834092\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/362/73/#p81\">\n    362 S.C. 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834092\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/362/73/#p81\">\n    606 S.E.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating that under Rule 613(b), extrinsic evidence of the statement is not admissible unless witness is advised of the substance of the statement, the time and place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The rule does not require extrinsic evidence of the prior statement be admitted immediately. It merely authorizes the use of extrinsic evidence to prove the inconsistency. Because the impeaching evidence is \"extrinsic,\" the avenue of its admissibility may not always run through the witness to be impeached by it, for that witness may not be competent to authenticate the extrinsic evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCormick on Evidence\n   </em>\n   215 - 16 (7th ed. 2013) (equating \"intrinsic evidence\" with cross-examination, as opposed to \"[e]xtrinsic evidence of inconsistent statements, that is, the production of other witnesses' testimony about the statements\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In some instances-say, if the previous statement was to a third party and unrecorded-it may, for many reasons, be impossible to produce the proof while the denier remains on the stand. One reason would be the principle that no two bodies may occupy the same space at the same time. Counsel may also have strategic reasons for delaying such proof. We are not prepared to require a witness who has denied making a prior inconsistent statement to remain glued to the stand until thoroughly impeached, so a party can ask the witness to \"explain\" her earlier denial.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Conveyors &amp; Dumpers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1943784\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/731/1221/#p1231\">\n    731 F.2d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1231 (5th Cir. 1984) (no requirement that admission of prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence per Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1) occur while witness on stand).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We also see no prejudice. The State read the statement to the witness twice; we are unclear what difference playing the recording of the statement to her would have made. While Ms. Barnes was no longer under subpoena, we know of no reason why Barnes\n   could not have recalled his mother to the stand,\n   voluntarily or not, after McCoy's testimony. Nor have we been apprised what Barnes would have asked his mother about the inconsistency that he had not already had the opportunity to pursue during her initial cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Rule 613(b), SCRE, works in tandem with Rule 611(a), SCRE, which arms the trial court with vast discretion in controlling the mode and order of witness testimony. We find the trial court properly handled this impeachment evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the reasons set forth, we affirm Barnes' convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   GEATHERS and MCDONALD, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Although not an issue before us, it is unclear how Wright and Schaefer's testimony concerning how they learned the identities of \"Trigg\" and \"Trap\" complied with Rule 602, SCRE.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    One of Barnes' best defenses may have been that he was the lookout standing outside the door of the kitchen and \"merely present\" when the crimes took place. Wright and Schaefer's testimony might have helped advance this defense, as they both placed Barnes outside, implicating Troy Stevenson as the man in the gray-hooded sweatshirt who went inside.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
