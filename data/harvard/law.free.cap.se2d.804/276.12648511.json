On appeal, Ameris argues the master erred (1) in concluding Ameris owed Respondents a fiduciary duty in a $2.8 million commercial loan transaction for a real estate venture that ultimately failed; (2) in concluding Ameris\n   was liable for negligent misrepresentation because one of Ameris's future employees told Gibson that the transaction was a \"good deal\" and that the \"rents would cover the debt\" and because Ameris structured the loan \"to include borrowing the down payment of $700,000\" such that the apartments were purchased with \"100% borrowed money\"; (3) in concluding Ameris aided and abetted Gibson's real estate agent in breaching his fiduciary duty; and (4) in awarding actual damages and excessive punitive damages. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ameris commenced this foreclosure action when Respondents failed to repay a $2.8\n   million loan that Ameris made to Heritage Seven\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the purchase and renovation of an apartment complex in North Charleston. Respondents answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims of negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. The foreclosure action settled, and Galt Valley, LLC-the entity to which Ameris assigned the loan-accepted deeds to the apartment complex and collateral in lieu of foreclosure. Respondents' counterclaims remained, however, and were tried before a master.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In deciding to purchase the apartment complex, Gibson first consulted her real estate and financial advisor, Rolando Villavicencio. On August 28, 2007, Gibson signed a contract to purchase the apartment complex and sought financing from First Reliance Bank (First Reliance). Gibson previously worked with First Reliance in 2005 when First Reliance financed Heritage Seven's purchase of a $2.4 million shopping center in Moncks Corner. Karl Zerbst was the loan officer and Benji Lanier was the analysist for the 2005 shopping center loan from First Reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After seeking financing from First Reliance for the apartment complex, Villavicencio complained to Zerbst that he and Gibson were not being served at First Reliance and wanted to know who could help them obtain financing. According to Gibson, Zerbst told her that she would be better served at Ameris and that he had given her loan documents to Lanier, who had left First Reliance and had begun working at Ameris\n   on October 11, 2007. Gibson decided to seek financing from Ameris. Her understanding was that Lanier would handle the loan at Ameris and Zerbst would ultimately handle the transaction for her. However, Zerbst testified he never told Gibson or Villavicencio that he was going to work for Ameris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Zerbst ended his employment with First Reliance on October 5, 2007. Although Zerbst spoke with other banks, including Ameris, regarding potential employment, he remained unemployed from October 5, 2007, until January 11, 2008, when he accepted a written employment offer from Ameris. Zerbst testified he did not work for Ameris and did nothing on Ameris's behalf before January 11, 2008. Marc Bogan, an executive at Ameris, testified Ameris did not encourage Zerbst to refer customers to it or authorize Zerbst to do anything on its behalf before hiring Zerbst in January 2008. Bogan stated no one at Ameris had the ability or right to control Zerbst's conduct before Zerbst formally accepted the employment offer on January 11, 2008. Further, Richard Sturm, the President of Ameris, testified Ameris never told Gibson that Zerbst was acting on Ameris's behalf prior to January 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In mid-October 2007, Gibson spoke with Zerbst about the apartment complex transaction. At that time, Gibson believed Zerbst had left First Reliance but had not yet joined Ameris. Gibson testified she and Zerbst discussed \"the wisdom\" of her closing the apartment transaction, the appraisal, the location, and the rents she would charge. According to Gibson, Zerbst thought the apartment complex was a \"good investment,\" and Zerbst assured her that the rents would cover the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 2, 2007, Respondents and Ameris closed the apartment complex loan. Gibson underwent surgery soon after the loan closing. While Gibson was recuperating, Ameris disbursed funds to Villavicencio when he submitted invoices for work performed in the renovation of the apartment complex. Gibson testified that while she was unable to visit the apartment complex because of her health problems, Villavicencio assured her that \"everything was fine, on schedule, on budget.\" On February 7, 2008, Villavicencio sent an email to Lanier, stating that the project was \"moving along as planned\" and that he expected the units to be completed and ready for leasing by the next month. When Gibson visited the apartments in March 2008 after recovering from her surgery,\n   however, she discovered Villavicencio and the contractor were not on speaking\n   terms, Villavicencio had lied to her about the status of the project, and all three apartment buildings were being renovated at once, instead of one at a time as originally planned. In May 2008, Gibson fired Villavicencio because she believed he had mismanaged her properties and stolen several hundred thousand dollars from her while managing her shopping center and apartment complex. After firing Villavicencio, Gibson managed the apartment complex herself. Gibson also took control of the loan proceeds and arranged for Ameris to place the disbursements in her checking account without receiving invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Gibson began renting the units, several tenants lost their jobs and were unable to pay rent. Gibson allowed many of the tenants to remain in the apartments and pay a lower rate. Gibson testified the rental income from the apartment complex was insufficient to cover the interest payments on the loan, so she had to use funds from her savings account to pay the remaining interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The master determined the relationship between Zerbst and Gibson was more than a creditor and debtor relationship. The master found Zerbst accepted Gibson's trust, Zerbst advised Gibson about the apartment complex transaction, Zerbst was Ameris's agent when Respondents purchased the apartment complex, and Zerbst and Ameris breached their fiduciary duties to Respondents. The master also found Appellant liable for breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, and aiding and abetting Villavicencio's breach of fiduciary duty. The master awarded Respondents actual damages of $1,153,625.00 and punitive damages of $3,551,232.00, for a total damages award of $4,704,857.00. The master found Respondents comparatively at fault for 20% of their damages and reduced the total award of actual and punitive damages by 20%. The master then applied an $850,000.00 set-off to the reduced total award for the money received in the settlement of the case Respondents had filed against Villavicencio and others for the same injury. The final judgment was $2,913,886.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"An action in tort for damages is an action at law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Longshore v.

Zerbst explained the calendar was produced in litigation with First Reliance in which First Reliance alleged he violated his covenant not to compete by going to work for Ameris. First Reliance, Ameris, and Zerbst ultimately settled that case. Ameris could not produce that calendar after Gibson requested it in discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The master found,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties' filings in the litigation between First Reliance and [Zerbst] and Ameris state that Ameris was in possession of [Zerbst's] 2007 day planner, which presumably would have shown exactly when [Zerbst] and Ameris met to discuss Zerbst['s] employment. However, Ameris has failed to produce the 2007 calendar, claiming it has been lost.\" ...

The fact that the calendar might have shown that Zerbst discussed employment with Ameris before accepting its written employment offer on January 11, 2008, is of no consequence because Zerbst admitted he discussed employment with Ameris before January 2008. More importantly, however, the calendar would not have contained any representations by Ameris that Zerbst was acting as its agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"91206\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/323/240/#p245\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"91206\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/323/240/#p245\">\n    at 244-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"91206\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/323/240/#p245\">\n    473 S.E.2d at 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Apparent authority to do an act is created as to a third person by written or spoken words\n   <em>\n    or any other conduct of the principal\n   </em>\n   which, reasonably interpreted,\n   causes the third person to believe the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, we hold Zerbst was not Ameris's agent in October 2007 and reverse the master's decision finding Ameris liable for breach of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The record on appeal contains no evidence that, while Villavicencio was involved with the apartment project from November 2007 until May 2008, Ameris's employees had actual knowledge that Villavicencio was breaching his fiduciary duty to Respondents. Zerbst testified Gibson authorized Villavicencio to receive loan disbursements. Further Zerbst stated Gibson never told him, or anyone at Ameris, not to disburse money according to Villavicencio's instructions during the construction phase\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The record on appeal shows Zerbst was the first Ameris employee to express concerns about Ameris's administration of the loan disbursements. Zerbst testified he worked in Ameris's Murrell's Inlet office when Ameris first hired him in January 2008 and he was not involved with making advancements on Respondents' loan while he worked in Murrell's Inlet. Zerbst testified he did not learn about the disbursements on Respondents' loan until October 2008-five months after Gibson fired Villavicencio in May 2008. Zerbst communicated his concerns to Don Snipes, a regional credit officer at Ameris, in May 2009. On July 3, 2009-more than a year after\n   Gibson fired Villavicencio-Snipes emailed another Ameris employee and expressed concerns that Ameris had mismanaged the loan and had potentially aided Villavicencio in siphoning off some of the loan proceeds. Because the evidence does not show that Ameris had actual knowledge of Villavicencio's breach of fiduciary duty while Villavicencio was committing his breach, we hold the master erred in finding Ameris knowingly participated in Villavicencio's breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ameris argues the master erred in awarding actual and punitive damages and in calculating the damages award.
