After her boyfriend left the tavern without her, she stayed on, and later accepted a ride home with the defendant Leland Graves (Graves). Graves first dropped off his friend Lannie Sipes; shortly thereafter, his car hit a tree. Beam was seriously injured and remains in a comatose condition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Suit was brought against Graves and the tavern on her behalf with a loss of consortium claim on behalf of her three minor children. Five months prior to the accident, Beam\u2019s three children had been removed from Beam\u2019s custody by the Department of Social Services and placed in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The case was tried in the Franklin Superior Court. The jury found both Graves and the tavern negligent, and awarded damages to Beam in the amount of $2,750,000 and in the amount of $750,000 to each of the children. Judgments entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">In response to the defendants\u2019 motions for judgments notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial, the judge ordered that the amount of damages for each child be reduced to $10,000, but that if the plaintiffs refused to accept the reductions, they could elect a new trial as to each child on damages only. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(a),-365 Mass. 827 (1974). Before the plaintiffs responded to this order, an amended judgment was entered on December 30, 1992, establishing the liability of Graves and the tavern to Beam in the sum of $2,475,000,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but reducing the liability of Graves and the tavern to $10,000 for each of the three minor children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The minor plaintiffs filed a timely motion to vacate the amended judgment as to the amount of damages and to schedule a new trial on damages. The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Graves appealed from the denial of his motions for a directed verdict and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the loss of consortium claim on the ground that the evidence did not show that the children received \u201cappropriate support\u201d from their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The tavern appealed on the same grounds as Graves, and in addition argues that there was insufficient evidence to show that Graves was served alcoholic beverages while intoxicated. We affirm the judgments of negligence against Graves and the tavern and we order a new trial on damages only regarding the claim of the minor plaintiffs for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>Service of alcohol to Graves. </em>The tavern appeals from the denial of its motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the count alleging negligence against it. \u201cIn evaluating the judge\u2019s refusal to grant [the defendants\u2019] motions for directed verdicts and for judgments notwithstanding the verdicts, we assess whether the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, could support verdicts for the plaintiffs. . . . The plaintiffs are entitled to the judgments if \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>Barbosa </em>v. <em>Hopper Feeds, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 610, 613 (1989), and cases cited. We disregard evidence favorable to the defendant. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim against the tavern is based on the allegation that the tavern served liquor to Graves when he was intoxicated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[A] tavern keeper does not owe a duty to refuse to serve liquor to an intoxicated patron unless the tavern keeper knows or reasonably should have known that the patron is intoxicated .... [T]he plaintiff (must) introduce some evidence showing the defendant was on notice that it was serving alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated patron.\u201d <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Le Disco, Inc., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 630, 632 (1993), quoting from <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 323, 327-328 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>We summarize the evidence favorable to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the day of the accident, September 17, 1990, Graves picked up his friend, Lannie Sipes, around 6:30 p.m. or 7:00 p.m. to go to the tavern and play pool. After picking up Sipes, Graves bought a six-pack of bottled beer, and while on the way to the tavern, Sipes drank two bottles; Graves drank one. At the tavern, Graves and Sipes played pool and consumed draft beers (the number is uncertain), and each one had two \u201cshots\u201d of Jack Daniels whiskey.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The bartender served Graves one beer \u201cfor the road\u201d after he had his coat on.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Joseph Gralenski, Beam\u2019s boyfriend (and, by his admission, an alcoholic), was also at the tavern on September 17, 1990. In Gralenski\u2019s opinion, Graves was intoxicated by the time Gralenski left the tavern at about 10:00 p.m. His opinion was based on the fact that Graves\u2019s \u201cwhole manner changes when he drinks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Graves, Sipes, and Beam left the tavern about 11:20 p.m. They drove in Graves\u2019s car; Graves was driving, and Beam was a passenger in the front seat. Sipes, who lived only a mile and one-half away, was dropped off first. He arrived home at 11:30 p.m. Graves continued on toward Beam\u2019s residence, but soon hit a tree with the passenger side of his vehicle, leaving Beam, as we have said, in a comatose condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">John Newton, a police officer for the town of Greenfield, arrived at the accident scene at about 11:40 p.m., about ten minutes after Graves left Sipes at his house, and about twenty minutes after Graves left the tavern. The officer noted a strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>odor of alcoholic beverage coming from inside the vehicle, and he observed that Graves\u2019s speech was slurred and slow, and that he was difficult to understand. Graves was slow to respond and his dexterity in trying to produce any kind of identification was poor. The officer was of the opinion that Graves was intoxicated, and that when Graves hit the tree, he was traveling at no less than fifty-nine miles per hour in a thirty-five miles per hour zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Officer Peter Skerritt also arrived at about 11:50 p.m. He observed that Graves\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, unsteady, and unfixed. The officer smelled a very strong odor of alcohol coming from Graves\u2019s breath. In the opinion of Officer Skerritt, Graves was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">A third police officer, Ralph Odom, who arrived at about 11:40 p.m., found Graves unsure of from where he had been coming, where he was going, who Beam was, and who was driving the car. Graves had a \u201ccarefree attitude\u201d, his speech was slurred, his eyes were watery, bloodshot and glazed over, and there was an odor of alcohol coming from his breath. Officer Odom concluded that at the time of the accident, Graves \u201cwas under the influence of alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The tavern argues that there was absolutely no evidence as to Graves\u2019s behavior, appearance or conduct at the tavern which put the bartender on notice that she may have been serving an intoxicated person. That position ignores evidence, previously recounted, that Graves had drunk one beer on the way to the tavern, consumed draft beers and two shots of Jack Daniels while at the tavern, and finally, was served one beer \u201cfor the road.\u201d Within twenty minutes of leaving the tavern, Graves drove off the road at a high rate of speed and directly into a tree. Gralenski, who left the tavern at 10:00 p.m., saw that Graves, while at the tavern, was intoxicated. Three police officers found Graves obviously intoxicated within twenty minutes of his leaving the tavern, and without any intervening consumption of alcohol (so the jury could have found). Their observations permit the inference that Graves would have demonstrated signs of intoxication twenty minutes earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">While the testimony is not clear as to what hour in the evening Graves\u2019s intoxication became obvious, nor is it clear how many drinks Graves was served after that point, at the very least the service of \u201cone for the road\u201d was one too many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to avoid liability. Based on reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the testimony favorable to the plaintiffs, a rational juror could have concluded from the evidence that the bartender should have known that Graves was intoxicated when she served him his last beer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Norwood Country Club, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 126, 139 n.9 (1996) (in determining the issue of negligence, the jury could consider evidence of blood alcohol level taken two hours after the accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Loss of consortium. </em>As noted above, \u201c[t]he plaintiffs are entitled to the judgments if \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>Barbosa </em>v. <em>Hopper Feeds, Inc., </em>404 Mass, at 613. We disregard evidence favorable to the defendant. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In support of the claim of the loss of consortium, the plaintiffs offered the testimony of Sylvia Charland.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> She had taken two of the children to visit their mother at Worcester County Hospital. Steivie, who had expressed a desire to see her mother, \u201cmade a shrine of her mother\u2019s picture of her in the hospital and would take it to bed with her and cry.\u201d Amber wanted to go because Steivie had gone. When the children arrived at their mother\u2019s hospital room, Amber \u201cjust kind of ran out of the room.\u201d When the children returned home, Amber cried hysterically when one of the cats did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>want to be petted. It was Mrs. Charland\u2019s opinion that Amber was expressing her sadness about her mother. For a month after that she would bring up her sadness about her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u201c[I]n order to recover for loss of parental consortium, [a child] must establish <em>a reasonable expectancy </em>of a dependent relationship with the injured parent\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Angelini </em>v. <em>OMD Corp., </em>410 Mass. 653, 662 (1991). The dependent relationship has to do with the child\u2019s \u201cdependence on the injured parent for management of the child\u2019s needs and for emotional guidance and support rather than economic dependence on the injured parent.\u201d <em>Barbosa </em>v. <em>Hopper Feeds, Inc., </em>404 Mass, at 618, citing <em>Glicklich </em>v. <em>Spievack, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 496 (1983). While there is no requirement that a child must be living in the injured parent\u2019s household to recover for loss of parental society,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the plaintiff carries the burden of proving the existence, and impairment, of a dependency relationship between the child and parent in a loss of consortium claim. <em>Barbosa </em>v. <em>Hopper Feeds, Inc., </em>404 Mass. at 618 n.6. \u201cIt is fair to say that no extensive display of facts is required to demonstrate, in light of ordinary human experience, an emotional or psychological dependence by the child upon her mother. See <em>Ferriter </em>[v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 516 (1980)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The amount of damages to which the children may be entitled as a result of the loss of their mother\u2019s consortium presents genuine issues in dispute, for it cannot be said that the value of the reasonable expectancy of their loss is zero. There was plain error in the entry of a judgment based on the judge\u2019s \u2014 not the jury\u2019s \u2014 assessment of the damages suffered by the children. See <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel </em>&amp; Co., <em>KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 803 (1987). See also Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(a). Nevertheless, the judge did not, in our opinion, abuse his discretion in entering the order dated December 18, 1992, requiring the plaintiffs to accept either the remittitur or a new trial on damages. <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>D\u2019Annolfo </em>v. <em>Stoneham Hous. Authy., </em>375 Mass. 650, 658-662 (1978). The plaintiffs\u2019 brief makes it clear that had they been given the opportunity, they would have elected a new trial on damages, and they are now entitled to that remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The judgments for plaintiff Patricia Beam against defendant Graves and against defendant Herzig-Baker Corporation are affirmed. The judgment for the minor plaintiffs against defendants Graves and Herzig-Baker Corporation is vacated as to the amount of damages, and the case is remanded for a new trial on the issue of damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\">A physician testified that she could respond only to painful stimuli.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\">There may have been a clerical error in the entry of the amended judgment.

However, the liability of the tavern is grounded on the common law of negligence, not the statute. See <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 323, 327 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In response to the plaintiffs\u2019 request for admissions of facts, see Mass. R.Civ.P. 36, 365 Mass. 795 (1974), Graves made numerous material admissions. The judge instructed the jury that the answers of Graves were \u201capplicable in the case against Graves . . . |andj would not be applicable in the case against the corporate or individual owners of the bar.\u201d There was no objection to these instructions. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 51(b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974) . Consequently we do not consider any of Graves\u2019s admissions in assessing the case against the tavern. See <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Withers, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 924, 925 (1983), citing Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 36.9, at 402 (1975) (\u201cadmission does not affect any party other than the one making it\u201d). See also Wright, Miller &amp; Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2264, at 580 (2d ed. 1994) (admissions of a party do not bind a coparty).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b198-11\">The tavern admitted in its response to requests for admissions that Graves was served \u201cbeers and Jack Daniels.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b198-12\">The bartender added that she \u201ctook that beer from him,\u201d but the jury need not have credited that testimony, and we are not obliged to' consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"><em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Le Disco, Inc., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 632, cited by the defendant, is inapposite on the facts. There the defendant had consumed eight beers over two hours, but no whiskey or bourbon, and while the defendant\u2019s post-tavern conduct revealed a vicious character, there was no evidence that he was intoxicated. Closer to the facts of this case is <em>O'Hanley </em>v. <em>Ninety-Nine, Inc., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 64 (1981). The action was dismissed by the judge on summary judgment; that judgment was reversed on appeal. The proffered evidence showed that the plaintiff had been served and consumed at least fifteen beers and six martinis. There, too, the defendant argued that there was nothing in the evidence which permitted the inference that the bartenders served the plaintiff after they knew or should have known that the plaintiff was intoxicated. We rejected that argument. \u201cWe think a rational jury could properly conclude that a person in the position of the plaintiff would have displayed some outward manifestation of intoxication well in advance of ordering his fifteenth beer or his sixth martini which could have been recognized by an experienced bartender who was more interested in observing the law than in pocketing tips.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Charland and her husband were in the process of adopting Beam\u2019s children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The parties stipulated that in April of 1990, the Department of Social Services had taken custody of the minor children of Patricia Beam because, in the opinion of the department, Patricia Beam was unable to care for her children properly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
