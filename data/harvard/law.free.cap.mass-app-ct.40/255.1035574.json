L. c. 272, \u00a7 35, and G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He appeals, claiming that the judge erred in denying his motion for required findings of not guilty. The only issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>before us is whether the evidence warranted a finding that the defendant\u2019s sexual conduct occurred in public.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that it did not and, therefore, reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">A State trooper, James Gilhooley, the sole witness at trial, testified essentially as follows: On June 2, 1992, about 8 p.m., he drove his cruiser into a large paved parking area adjacent to Route 95 in the town of Rowley. That area served as a truck weigh station but also was used as a rest stop by motorists and truckers. Signs on the highway signaled the upcoming weigh station and directed trucks to it. A sign indicated that the weigh station was closed at that time but there were no barriers to entry. There were no signs identifying the parking area as a rest stop. The paved lot was bordered on three sides by fairly thick woods containing \u201cnumerous beaten paths that go deep into the woods.\u201d There were no bathrooms, lights, telephones, picnic tables, or other buildings in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Gilhooley stated he was patrolling that location \u201c[bjecause of the large concentration of males . . . who abandon their motor vehicles and congregate in the wooded areas.\u201d At that time, traffic on Route 95 was medium to light. Gilhooley testified that travelers who used the parking area as a rest stop and sought to relieve themselves, \u201cwould go into the woodlands area outside the parking lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">When Gilhooley drove into the paved area, he noticed a truck and a Mercedes automobile, both unoccupied. Soon, two men emerged from the woods, one entered the truck and drove off, the other remained inside the parked Mercedes. Shortly thereafter, the defendant drove into the paved area, stopped about a hundred yards from the Mercedes and remained in his vehicle. Gilhooley then drove away, circled around and returned about 8:20 p.m. Noticing that the Mercedes and the defendant\u2019s vehicle were unoccupied, he \u201ctook a path that was in sort of the center of the two motor vehicles and followed that in.\u201d Dusk then was approaching, but it was still light. At a point about one hundred feet from the parking area he observed the defendant and the other man engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>in what trial counsel stipulated was an unnatural sexual act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> From that point in the woods, Gilhooley could see neither the parking area nor the adjacent highway. There was no evidence that any other person was in the area at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">While neither of the statutes upon which the defendant\u2019s convictions are based uses the word \u201cpublic,\u201d each has been construed to require proof of the public nature of the conduct in question. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scagliotti, </em>373 Mass. 626, 628 (1977) (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 117 (1980) (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53). The reported cases may be read as establishing that \u201c[t]he essential query is whether the defendant intended public exposure or recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of exposure to one or more persons .... The Commonwealth must prove that the likelihood of being observed by casual passersby must have been reasonably foreseeable to the defendant, or stated otherwise, that the defendant acted upon an unreasonable expectation that his conduct would remain secret.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. 13, 16 (1981) (applying G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 183-184 &amp; n.4 (1987) (adopting the <em>Ferguson </em>standard in a case under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, and noting that there is no reason to treat \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 53 differently for purposes of defining the word \u201cpublic\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauchemin, </em>410 Mass. 181, 183-184 (1991) (describing \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 53 as \u201cclosely related\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Arguably, proof of likely observation by a casual passerby sufficient to withstand a motion for a required finding of not guilty is enhanced by evidence that the proscribed conduct occurred in an unenclosed outdoor area frequented by the public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Notwithstanding such enhancement, fundamental requirements of criminal proof must be met. The Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>monwealth\u2019s best case may not rely upon inference piled upon inference. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, supra </em>at 18. Here, evidence of moderate use of the nearby highway may have permitted an inference that some travelers may have decided to use the weigh station as a rest stop at approximately the time the defendant occupied the nearby, woods. Notably lacking, however, was any evidence that travelers utilized that part of the woods in which the defendant was found. Therefore, a further conclusion that some persons were likely to venture into that area relied on conjecture rather than reason. Even if the presence of travelers in that general area were inferable, there was no evidence that the defendant would have been visible from the vantage point likely to be occupied by them. The existence of a path in that general vicinity did not establish use at the time that the defendant was observed. A fact finder necessarily would have to employ impermissible speculation to conclude that the defendant chose a place for his sexual conduct where the likelihood of his being observed was reasonably foreseeable. The evidence was not such as is reasonably susceptible of conflicting interpretations, one of which establishes the Commonwealth\u2019s case beyond a reasonable doubt and thus requires submission to the fact finder. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scagliotti, </em>373 Mass. at 629; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 185. Accordingly, it was error to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\n<em>Judgments for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-14\">Concurrent sentences committing the defendant to a ninety-day confinement in a house of correction have been stayed pending this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-15\">In pertinent part, G.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 117-118 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, post </em>901 (1996); Model Penal Code \u00a7 251.1, comment 2 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The other man was a codefendant in the trial and was convicted of the same crimes as the defendant.
