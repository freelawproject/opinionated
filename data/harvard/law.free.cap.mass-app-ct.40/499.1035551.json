His appeal challenges the denial of his pretrial motion to suppress the inculpatory drugs, which were seized from his pocket by a police officer who had run up to his car while Joe was stopped at a red light. He contends that the police did not have probable cause to stop and search him on the basis of a confidential informant\u2019s tip and subsequent police observations. Viewing \u201cthe facts and circumstances as a whole in assessing the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 conduct\u201d here, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>422 Mass. 111, 116 (1996), we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>At an August, 1993, evidentiary hearing on Joe\u2019s motion to suppress, two police officers and a special agent of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), whom the motion judge found credible, testified as follows.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Special Agent Reeves of the INS received a telephone call on September 24, 1992, from a confidential informant (Cl). Reeves had spoken with Cl in the past but had never before used Cl as an informant. Cl told Reeves that Cl had called Joe earlier that day and had ordered two ounces of \u201cChina White\u201d heroin to be delivered to Cl at a specific doughnut shop on Morton Street in the Roxbury section of Boston later in the day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The delivery was to be made by Joe himself driving alone in a black Mercedes Benz automobile. Cl knew Joe (by the alias \u201cDavid\u201d) and had identified him from a photographic array several weeks earlier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Joe was also, according to Reeves, \u201cknown to us,\u201d although how or why he was so known was never explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Reeves immediately conveyed this information to Boston police detectives Morrissey and Grant, experienced members of the Asian organized crime task force. They also \u201cknew\u201d both Cl and Joe in some undescribed way. Together the agent and the detectives planned a stakeout of the doughnut shop. Reeves then called Cl and reported that \u201ceverything was all set up.\u201d In three separate vehicles, Reeves, Morrissey, and Grant drove to and parked in the area where the scheduled heroin delivery was to occur. Their surveillance began at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>about 3:00 p.m. Cl was observed standing in front of the doughnut shop making several calls from a pay phone. After 15 to 20 minutes, Cl walked across Morton Street and stood by gas pumps at a service station. Cl\u2019s departure from the doughnut shop was not part of the police plan. Approximately 45 minutes later, Joe appeared, alone, driving a black Mercedes Benz. The car pulled up in front of the doughnut shop and slowed down almost to a stop. Joe appeared to be looking around as if he were meeting someone. He then drove off down Morton Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The officers followed Joe\u2019s car in their separate vehicles. Reeves became trapped in heavy traffic. Grant and Morissey, however, were close behind Joe when he had to stop at a red light. Grant got out of his car, ran in front of Joe\u2019s idling Mercedes, and displayed his badge. Joe then stepped out of his car and stood between the open car door and the driver\u2019s seat. Facing Grant, Joe inserted his right hand into his upper left hand pocket. Morrissey, who had by this time run up to the Mercedes to join Grant, saw Joe\u2019s hand movement and drew his gun. Grant reached into Joe\u2019s upper left hand pocket and pulled out two large plastic bags containing a \u201ctannish\u201d powder that on analysis proved to be 54.20 grams (almost two ounces) of heroin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The motion judge rejected Joe\u2019s argument that these facts did not establish probable cause to stop Joe\u2019s vehicle. Evaluating the evidence flowing from the unnamed informant\u2019s tip under the <em>\u201cAguilar-Spinelli\u201d </em>standard of probable cause, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 896 (1990),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the judge concluded that (a) the facts inherent in the tip itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>particularly Cl\u2019s role in setting up the heroin sale, demonstrated a sufficient basis of personal knowledge (a conclusion not disputed by Joe); (b) although Cl had no track record as an informant, the tip was sufficiently detailed to possess \u201csome indicia of reliability\u201d; and (c) the \u201cindependent police corroboration of the detailed information provided by the informant established the informant\u2019s veracity,\u201d particularly since events \u201cunfolded precisely as predicted by the informant.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Joe\u2019s essential appellate argument is that the police observations did not sufficiently corroborate the informant\u2019s deficient credibility. It confronts us, as so \u201cfrequently occurs in search and seizure cases, . . . with line-drawing of a difficult nature.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 797 (1985) (Hennessey, C.J., concurring). It has been presented to us, however, as it was framed for the motion judge, as a question of the reliability of an unidentified informant\u2019s tip in the context of probable cause. That is the test for measuring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>validity of a search and seizure pursuant to a warrant, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 370, 374-375 (1985), or an arrest, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>403 Mass. 163, 164-165 (1988), based upon such a tip. Neither the warrant nor the arrest scenario fits the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Rather, based upon the hearing transcript and the judge\u2019s findings, what occurred here was a police investigatory stop based upon an informant\u2019s telephone tip and subsequent police surveillance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>415 Mass. 814, 815 (1993) (whether a police stop is an arrest or a threshold inquiry is a \u201chighly fact-based question[ ]\u201d). The proper focus of our attention, therefore, is whether the tip, as corroborated by independent police observations, exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make that investigatory stop. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 18-20 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 110, 113-115 (1988). Cf. <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 328-331 (1990). On this record, we conclude that reasonable suspicion existed to justify the stop.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass, at 19, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Judicial Court set forth the analysis to be employed in determining whether the police had sufficiently reliable information to warrant making an investigatory stop:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201cTo meet the \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 standard in this Commonwealth, police action must be \u2018based on specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences therefrom\u2019 rather than on a \u2018hunch.\u2019 . . . [I]f the police conduct an investigatory stop based on an informant\u2019s tip, our evaluation of the tip\u2019s indicia of reliability will be focused on the informant\u2019s reliability and his or her basis of knowledge. Independent police corroboration may make up for deficiencies in one or both of those factors. <em>Because the standard is reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause, a less rigorous showing in each of these areas is permissible. </em>An investigatory automobile stop requires that the Commonwealth prove that the officer \u2018has a reasonable suspicion that the occupants have committed, are committing, or are about to commit a crime.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">There is no question here, as the judge correctly found, concerning Cl\u2019s basis of knowledge, since Cl had set up the heroin delivery by Joe. Such involvement implied the informant\u2019s first-hand and direct knowledge rather than the receipt of casual rumor or the implication of Joe because of his unsavory reputation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass, at 893, 896; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 293 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 927, 928 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">As to the \u201cveracity\u201d prong of the analysis, it is true that Cl had done nothing to establish presumptive reliability, such as providing tips producing prior arrests and convictions, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>381 Mass. 301, 302 (1980), or seizures of contraband, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez-Baez, </em>410 Mass. 43, 46 (1991). Cl\u2019s tip nevertheless reflected first-hand information from a known informant about a pending drug deal involving both the defendant and the informant. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>factor weighed in favor of Cl\u2019s credibility, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bakoian, </em>412 Mass. 295, 301 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 293, as did the fact that Cl was reachable by the authorities. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass, at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Moreover, as the judge also found, the tip contained fairly specific information of the sort not easily obtainable by a casual bystander. Details such as the identity of the drug dealer,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the vehicle he would be driving, his exact destination, and the approximate time frame when he would arrive constituted significant indicia of Cl\u2019s reliability that compare favorably with precedent, particularly under the applicable \u201cless rigorous showing\u201d standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>366 Mass. 394, 399-400 (1974) (anonymous informant\u2019s tip reflected personal knowledge and accurately predicted defendant\u2019s movements); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cantalupo, </em>380 Mass. 173, 174, 176 (1980) (known informant, considered reliable by police, identified defendant as possessing and selling drugs at a certain location); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bakoian, </em>412 Mass, at 301-302 (known informant\u2019s tip identified drug dealers, their vehicle, their destination, and approximate time of arrival); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 457-459 (1987) (known informant possessing personal knowledge identified defendant as dealing cocaine from a particular car and predicted when and where the activity would take place); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 293 (known informant set up drug deal with defendant, described automobile to be used, and predicted time and place of arrival); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 928 (reliability of known informant established by his participation in the drug buy, identification of the defendant, and precise predictions as to the time and place of the delivery). Compare <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>White, </em>496 U.S. at 332 (anonymous tipster\u2019s prediction of identified defendant\u2019s future behavior, including how, when and where defendant would conduct narcotics transaction, indicated someone \u201clikely to . . . have access to reliable information about [the defendant\u2019s] illegal activities\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>17, 20-21 (no reliability in anonymous tip that defendant \u201cwould be heading for Bridgton, Maine\u201d in a particular car with drugs just purchased in Chelsea, which reflected no special knowledge of defendant\u2019s affairs and provided only details \u201cobtainable by an uninformed bystander\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrasquillo, 30 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 783, 786-787 (1991) (unidentified informant\u2019s tip, the source of which was unknown, that defendant had gone to New York City that day and would be returning to his home in Springfield in the afternoon with cocaine and an Hispanic male who was planning to set up a drug distribution system, possessed no indicia of reliability).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Even were there a close question as to the veracity of Cl\u2019s information, the police surveillance here independently corroborated the tip sufficiently to satisfy the <em>Lyons </em>standard. \u201cThe police corroboration of such \u2018nonobvious [and predictive] details\u2019 [including the defendant\u2019s identity, exact destination, and approximate time of arrival] provided by the informant, prior to investigating the defendant and the vehicle, removed any doubt as to the informant\u2019s reliability.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bakoian, </em>412 Mass, at 302.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Police observations verifying a defendant\u2019s future expected behavior, particularly his showing up where, when and how predicted by an informant, have been regarded as especially confirmatory of the reliability of the tip in a number of cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>366 Mass, at 400; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>403 Mass, at 166 n.2; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>407 Mass, at 898, 899-900; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cosme, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 452-453 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 459; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 293; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 920, 922 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 928. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrasquillo, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 786-787 (police observed defendant\u2019s car going in a different direction and toward an apparently different destination than predicted by informant; deemed insufficient corroboration).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Finally, enhancing both the reliability of Cl\u2019s information and the corroborative effect of the police investigation in this case was Joe\u2019s arguably suspicious conduct: slowing almost to a halt in front of the doughnut shop and looking around as if he were meeting someone, then driving off. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>391 Mass. 705, 707-708 (1986) (officer\u2019s observations of suspect\u2019s vehicle \u201ctraveling very slowly and then speeding up\u201d one of the elements supporting a stop on reasonable suspicion); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oreto, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 581, 586 (1985) (experienced trooper could infer from, inter alla, abnormally slow speed of vehicle, likelihood of drug offense being committed inside car); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 922 (defendant said by informant to be going to sell drugs was observed by police at the location and time predicted to drive up and begin \u201cobviously looking for someone [he] intended to meet\u201d there, a circumstance adding to the verification of the tip). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>366 Mass, at 400 (defendant\u2019s \u201cacting somewhat suspiciously in looking back over his shoulder [as he walked briskly out of the bus terminal] . . . lends some corroborative effect to the facts known to the police\u201d). Observations of a defendant\u2019s conduct that would appear innocent or ambiguous to the casual onlooker can \u201ctake[ ] on special significance \u2018to the trained eye of the officer,\u2019 [and] may be relied on by an officer in making his or her assessment\u201d in search and seizure situations. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass, at 900.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We conclude that Cl\u2019s tip and the officers\u2019 corroborative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>observations satisfied the less rigorous showing required by the reasonable suspicion standard. They provided the police with sufficient specific, articulable, and reliable facts, including the rational inferences the police were entitled to draw from those facts, to justify briefly stopping Joe for a threshold inquiry. The police officers acted neither on hunch nor instinct, but rather with \u201ca particularized and objective basis for suspecting [Joe] ... of criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-418 (1981).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">At that point, the officers were entitled to conduct a brief inquiry of Joe \u201cto determine his identity or to maintain the status quo while obtaining more information.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 570, 579, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 418 Mass. <em>777 </em>(1994), quoting from <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146 (1972). Joe\u2019s subsequent actions in getting out of the driver\u2019s seat, standing behind the driver\u2019s side door, and reaching into his upper left hand pocket frustrated that limited investigatory inquiry but warranted the police seizure of the incriminating bags of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The police officers did not (and Joe makes no argument to the contrary) engage in a disproportionate use or show of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>force. They did not block his car, already stopped at a red light, nor display any weapons as they initially approached the car. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bottari, </em>395 Mass. <em>777, </em>782 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanderson, </em>398 Mass. 761, 766 (1986). Our law unquestionably recognizes the right of the police, when an investigatory stop is justified, to take reasonable precautions for their own protection, based upon their analysis of the situation they confront and their experience. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 600-601 (1992). The issue in evaluating the validity of the police action that discovered Joe\u2019s illegal drugs is whether all the circumstances faced by Officer Grant, taken together, were \u201cenough to warrant belief by a \u2018reasonably prudent man . . . that his safety or that of others was in danger.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 546 (1991), quoting from <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, 392 </em>U.S. 1, 27 (1968). We are persuaded that Grant\u2019s reaching into Joe\u2019s pocket, which revealed the heroin, was reasonable under that test. Grant\u2019s action was undoubtedly a warrantless search, but it was within constitutional limits, being \u201cconfined to what was minimally necessary to learn whether the suspect [was] armed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 408 (1974). It constituted, as required, a degree of intrusion that was \u201cproportional to the degree of suspicion that prompted the intrusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass, at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Joe\u2019s sudden emergence from his car while stopped in traffic at a red light, with his body partly concealed behind the car door but facing Grant, could reasonably have been considered by the police unexpected, suspicious, and menacing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 207, 210 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, ante </em>6, 7-9 (1996). Joe\u2019s behavior, in conjunction with the recognized \u201cinordinate risk\u201d every police officer assumes when approaching a vehicle she has stopped, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sumerlin, 393 </em>Mass. 127, 130, 132 (1984), cert, denied, 469 U.S. 1193 (1985), may well have itself justified a limited search for weapons on Joe\u2019s person. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, supra </em>at 210-211.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We need not, however, rely on those factors alone. Joe\u2019s simultaneous act of reaching into his pocket as he confronted Grant realistically transformed the situation into one of imminent threat. It now supported a reasonable police belief that Joe might not only be armed but was also preparing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>pull out a weapon.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass, at 543, 545-546 (officer saw defendant bend down behind truck, then confront officer with hands in pockets; frisk of pockets for weapon upheld); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass, at 600-601 (officer\u2019s observation of defendant reaching into his pants justified search of pants for weapon). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patti, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 440, 441, 443 (1991) (even though defendant was apparently cooperative and weather was cold, officer could interpret defendant\u2019s putting his hands in his pockets late at night in a high crime area as a potential reach for a weapon).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In response to this reasonably perceived threat to safety, Officer Grant did not engage in a general exploratory search for evidence of criminal activity. Nor did he conduct a general frisk of Joe\u2019s entire person for possible weapons, as he would have been justified in doing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>414 Mass. 595, 600 (1993). Instead, his limited search, of the very pocket into which Joe had thrust his hand, was \u201c \u2018strictly tied to and justified by\u2019 the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass, at 407, quoting from <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 19. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Grant properly \u201cconfined his search strictly to what [was] minimally necessary to learn whether . . . [Joe was] armed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 408. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>407 Mass. 147, 149, 152 (1990) (protective search for weapons that was limited to suspicious object seen in crack in front seat was reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In this situation, Officer Grant \u201c \u2018had no more than a few seconds in which to assess the extent, if any, of the danger, and to ascertain the most effective and least intrusive means of protecting himself. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sumerlin, </em>[393 Mass.] at 129-130.\u2019 . . . Given the circumstances faced by the officers in this case, they were warranted for their own protection in finding out what [Joe] had concealed inside his [pocket]. Police officers are \u2018not required to gamble with their personal safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass, at 601-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The fact that the limited, protective search of the pocket yielded not a weapon but illegal drugs was not ground for invalidating the seizure. See <em>id. </em>(seizure of incriminating cocaine concealed in defendant\u2019s pants, discovered by police who saw him hide something in pants and searched there for a possible weapon, held proper); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 210-211 (frisk of defendant\u2019s person by police reasonably concerned that defendant might be armed, which resulted in seizure of potentially incriminating heroin in defendant\u2019s pocket, was proper although the case was remanded on other grounds); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patti, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 440, 443-444 (officer\u2019s search of defendant\u2019s pocket, out of concern he \u201cmight be reaching for a weapon\u201d after defendant put his hands in pockets, which revealed incriminating drugs in pocket, held valid).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u201cIn sum, it is our conclusion that, given these circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>stances, what occurred here was a proper threshold inquiry producing evidence which was justifiably employed in the trial against the defendant. We see no error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, 366 </em>Mass, at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\"> The motion judge had made no written findings of fact or conclusions of law prior to the filing of the parties\u2019 briefs on this appeal in 1995.

Since, however, a coordinated police response was quickly arranged and set up in the area of the doughnut shop by 3:00 p.m., and Cl showed up at the shop at the same time, it is a reasonable inference that Cl had in some fashion indicated to Reeves the approximate time of anticipated delivery that afternoon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 896 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 927, 928 (1994).

It is unclear from the transcript and the findings whether Grant reached into the pocket before or after Joe removed his hand from it in apparent response to seeing Morrissey\u2019s gun. Grant did not testify at the suppression hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\"> When an informant\u2019s tip is involved, the State Constitution mandates satisfaction of the twofold standard set forth in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969). The Commonwealth is required to demonstrate: (1) some underlying circumstances from which the law enforcement officials could have concluded that the information was reliable (the \u201cveracity\u201d test); and (2) some underlying circumstances which demonstrate a basis for the informant\u2019s knowledge (the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d test). \u201cTo justify the intrusion of an arrest and search, the tip must not only come from a credible person, but he must be shown to be relying on something more than a casual rumor or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>individual\u2019s general reputation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>365 Mass. 59, 63 (1975). However, independent police corroboration of information supplied by an informant can compensate for deficiencies in either or both prongs of <em>the Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test and thus satisfy the art. 14 requirement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 374-375 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>403 Mass. 163, 164-166 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 896 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bakoian, </em>412 Mass. 295, 298 (1992). As discussed <em>infra </em>at 504, satisfaction of these tests is less demanding in the reasonable suspicion context than when dealing with probable cause. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 19 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\"> Deference to such rulings by a trial or motion judge on a motion to suppress is a fundamental tenet of appellate review. \u201cThe evidence before the judge at the hearing on the motions to suppress consisted entirely of oral testimony. The determination of the weight and credibility of the testimony is the function and responsibility of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses, and not of this court. In such a situation, where subsidiary findings of fact have been made by the trial judge, they will be accepted by this court, and we do not substitute our judgment for his, absent clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 755-756 (1980). Further, it is well-settled that \u201cthe judge\u2019s findings of fact are \u2018binding in the absence of clear error . . . and [wej view with particular respect the conclusions of law which are based on them.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>381 Mass. 65, 76 (1980). While the judge\u2019s ultimate findings of fact and rulings of law, as they bear on issues of constitutional dimension, are open for reexamination by this court, such ultimate findings are \u2018entitled to substantial deference by this court.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bookman, </em>386 Mass. 657, 661 n.6 (1982). Questions of credibility are, of course, for the trial judge to resolve. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552, 557 (1979).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bottari, </em>395 Mass. 777, 780 (1985). Our decision reflects these principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\"> An appellate court may affirm a ruling on grounds different from those on which the trial or motion judge relied if the correct or preferred basis for affirmance is supported by the record and the findings, even if the parties and the judge did not raise the issue below. See <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 613 n.4 (1982); <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>390 Mass. 285, 299 n.18 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>414 Mass. 269, 271-272 (1993). This principle applies to search and seizure cases and motions to suppress. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Signorine, </em>404 Mass. 400, 403 &amp; n.l (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Osorno, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 327, 332 n.8 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dise, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 701, 705 (1991). Although the motion judge here raised the issue of viewing the situation as an investigatory stop under <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968), the prosecutor assumed that he had to establish probable cause for the police stop of Joe rather than reasonable suspicion. Defense counsel noted the possible application of <em>Terry </em>but also assumed that the Commonwealth nevertheless had to establish \u201cprobable cause to justify |thej stop under <em>Terry </em>or for any reason.\u201d Joe\u2019s appeal brief argued only the failure of the facts to support probable cause under the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>standard (see note 5, <em>supra). </em>He asserted that the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d test does not apply here because \u201cthe Commonwealth conceded to the motion judge that it had to establish probable cause\u201d while acknowledging, without conceding, that the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cbest argument\u201d would be that what occurred here was a valid <em>Terry </em>stop. The Commonwealth\u2019s brief in fact argued explicitly, as an alternative ground of affirmance, that the stop was a valid investigatoiy one based on reliable facts giving rise to reasonable suspicion. Joe submitted no reply brief in response to this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\"> See also G.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>403 Mass. 163, 166 (1988). In <em>Draper, </em>the police corroborated all of the known informant\u2019s predictions as to the defendant\u2019s appearance and manner and time of arrival except, as here, the most inculpatory, the defendant\u2019s actual possession of the heroin the informant said he would be carrying. The court stated that the confirmation of all of the other aspects of the tip gave the police \u201c \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 to believe that the remaining bit of [the informant\u2019s] information \u2014 that [the defendant] would have the heroin with him \u2014 was likewise true.\" 358 U.S. at 313. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>29 Mass.

App. Ct. at 292-294, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 927-929. In both cases, as here, an informant had told the police that he had arranged to buy drugs from the defendant at a certain time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>place. When the defendant in <em>Rivera </em>arrived, as predicted by the informant, he twice \u201clooked from side to side,\u201d then drove away (the informant not being then in the area), returning shortly thereafter. These were among the \u201csuspicious acts\u201d observed by the police \u201cwhich provided further corroboration of the tip.\u201d The defendant in <em>Fleming </em>was observed at the time and place predicted \u201clooking up and down the street\u201d (the informant did not initially show up), a circumstance deemed part of the \u201c \u2018limited but significant police corroboration.\u2019 \u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 921-922 (informant told of defendant\u2019s impending drug sale at particular location; part of police corroboration consisted of observing defendant and companion \u201clooking up and down the street, in all directions, as if they were looking for somebody\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\"> Indeed, \u201c[ajlthough . . . unnecessary to decision of the present case . . . the \u2018suspicion\u2019 reasonably generated in the present case was substantial, rising almost, if not quite to the probable cause that would support an arrest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>23 Mass.

App. Ct. 666, 668-669 (1993). Even in the probable cause context, judges are enjoined not to deal in technicalities but rather probabilities, \u201cthe factual and practical considerations of every day life on which reasonable and prudent . . . [people] act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desper, </em>419 Mass. 163, 170 (1994) (citations omitted). Those pragmatic considerations support the judge\u2019s conclusions here, under the less stringent reasonable suspicion test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> Police experience of the frequent association of guns with drug dealing, though not the subject of testimony here, has been noted in appellate decisions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. 136, 143 (1990) (approving of motion judge\u2019s observations that police are aware that \u201cdrug trafficking is fraught with violence,\u201d a factor justifying protective search for weapons); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>415 Mass. 447, 451 (1993) (from his experience, police officer understood that \u201chandguns were a danger to law enforcement agents during drug-related searches\u201d). At the suppression hearing, Joe\u2019s counsel argued that the officers had not explicitly testified to a concern for their safety or that they thought Joe had been \u201cgoing for a gun.\u201d There is, however, no legal requirement that an officer testify to having been placed in fear by the potential threat, \u201cso long as it is clear that he was aware of specific facts which would warrant a reasonable person to believe he was in danger.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tharpe, </em>536 F.2d 1098, 1101 (5th Cir. 1976) (en banc). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgibbons, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 301, 306-307 n.5 (1986) (\u201cthe officers\u2019 concern for their own safety is a fact that can be inferred from all the circumstances; it does not necessarily depend on direct testimony,\u201d citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ballou, </em>350 Mass. 751, 756-757 [1966], cert, denied, 385 U.S. 1031 [1967]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patti, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 440, 443-444 (1991) (officer need not testify to fear of safety concern if circumstances warranted search of pocket as safety precaution). The test is an objective one, and Officer Morrissey\u2019s immediate reaction to Joe\u2019s hand movement \u2014 drawing his handgun \u2014 speaks more eloquently of police perception of the potential risk than any testimony. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, supra </em>at 142 n.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> \u201cIn most instances\u201d of a limited search for reasonably suspected weapons after an investigatory stop, the search is implemented by a \u201cfrisk,\u201d i.e., \u201ca pat-down of the outer clothing of the suspect. . . [and] [ojnly after the pat-down gives indication that a weapon is present do the police have the privilege to search further.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass, at 408. That \u201cexternal patting\u201d limitation \u2014 which reflected the actual facts in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 29-30 \u2014 was not mandated by <em>Terry </em>as the invariably necessary first step in every protective search. Nor does it appear to be so, at least where it is reasonably suspected that the weapon is in a specific place on the defendant\u2019s person and the search is confined to that very place. Thus, in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143 (1972), the investigating officers, who had stopped the defendant\u2019s car upon information that he was carrying drugs and \u201ca gun at his waist,\u201d immediately reached through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the car window and removed a loaded revolver from his waistband. \u201c[TJhe policeman\u2019s action in reaching to the [very] spot where the gun was thought to be hidden constituted a limited intrusion designed to insure his safety, and we conclude that it was reasonable. The loaded gun seized as a result of this intrusion was therefore admissible\u201d in evidence against the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 148. That reasoning, dispensing with the ceremonial initial pat-down when the police have reason not only to suspect that the person detained is armed but also to apprehend that he is about to use the weapon against them, is applicable to the limited, focused search by Officer Grant here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>415 Mass. 814, 816, 820-821 (1993) (police, in the course of proper investigatory stop of defendant suspected of being armed, were justified in reaching into defendant\u2019s pants and removing a gun; the \u201cmost important\u201d factor in assessing the reasonableness and proportionality of police intrusion on a defendant\u2019s person in such a stop is \u201cthe danger to the safety of the officers or the public or both\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 970, 971 (1984) (police observed what appeared to be outline of a gun in defendant\u2019s rear pocket and, upon learning from him he did not have a permit to cony, \u201creached into Barrett\u2019s pocket and seized a .22 caliber derringer\u201d; in \u201csuch circumstances, no Miranda warning or \u2018pat down frisk\u2019 was required before taking the gun from Barrett\u201d); <em>New York </em>v. <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 653, 656, 657 (1984) (because of safety threat, no need to give Miranda warnings before asking rape suspect where he had hidden his gun).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
