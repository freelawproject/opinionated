We affirm the suppression ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">Both parties have adopted the judge\u2019s detailed findings, which he made following an evidentiary hearing on the motion, and so do we. We shall supplement his findings in minor respects from the record of the hearing. The judge found as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-16\">\u201cOn August 16, 1994, the Defendant was contacted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>members of the Massachusetts State Police assigned to the Northwestern District Attorney\u2019s Office. He was asked to come to the District Attorney\u2019s Office to speak with the police. At approximately 5:30 p.m., the Defendant and his wife arrived at the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Trooper Habel and Sergeant VonFlatem asked the Defendant\u2019s wife to wait while they spoke with her husband. The Defendant accompanied the officers to an interview room. In the interview room, the Defendant was advised of his [M]iranda rights and signed a form acknowledging that he understood those rights. The Defendant then again signed the form indicating that he wished to waive his rights. The police then advised the Defendant that they had information that he had raped his daughter, [Jane (a pseudonym)]. The Defendant denied the allegations. The police then informed the Defendant that they also had information that he had sexually abused his older daughter. Sergeant VonFlatern then asked the Defendant whether [Jane] was the \u2018only one.\u2019 The defendant stated \u2018yes.\u2019 The Defendant then asked to speak to an attorney. Once this request was made, the interrogation stopped. The Defendant tried to reach an attorney, but there was no answer at the number he called. The Defendant was then arrested and booked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cThe Defendant was then to be taken to the Franklin County House of Correction to await arraignment the next day. The Defendant had never been arrested and was nervous. While awaiting transportation and still in the District Attorney\u2019s Office, the Defendant asked Sergeant VonFlatern if he was going to the House of Correction. He was told that he was. The Defendant then stated that he knew that he did not rape his daughter. Sergeant VonFlatem replied as follows: T will tell you one thing, but this is not meant to be a question. Rape is not always what people think and things like oral sex are rape.\u2019 The Defendant then replied, \u2018Well I don\u2019t know where I go from here, because if that\u2019s considered rape then I guess I\u2019m guilty.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The defendant moved to suppress only the statements that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>he made after he invoked his right to counsel. Holding that Sergeant VonFlatern\u2019s unsolicited definition of rape was impermissible further interrogation, the judge allowed the motion. The Commonwealth urges on appeal that the judge\u2019s suppression ruling was error because VonFlatem\u2019s statement was not interrogation. It was an \u201cattempt to explain the elements of the crime charged, an explanation that was nothing more than a humane attempt to dispel any confusion that might exist concerning the charge.\u201d The Commonwealth does not argue that VonFlatem\u2019s statement was a question invited or permitted by the defendant\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. <em>All </em>(1981), teaches that, once a prospective defendant invokes his right to counsel, further interrogation without counsel is impermissible unless the defendant thereafter \u201cinitiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484-485. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Entremont, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 474, 478 (1994); 1 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 6.9, at 538 (1984). The police may ask routine booking questions, but not about the crime that is under investigation. If the defendant initiates further conversation about the subject matter of the investigation, the police may interrogate further, but they may not construe unrelated questions by the defendant as indicative of a change of position on his part. <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. 1039, 1044-1045 (1983). Further statements by a defendant that are not the product of impermissible further interrogation need not be suppressed. <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>380 Mass. 876, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1004 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chipman, </em>418 Mass. 262, 272-273 (1994). Finally, in order to use a defendant\u2019s statement to the police, the Commonwealth must prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berg, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 203 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">As noted, the Commonwealth does not suggest that the defendant invited further interrogation, so we focus on whether Sergeant VonFlatem\u2019s explanation of rape was a question or its functional equivalent, i.e., whether an objective observer would infer that it was designed to elicit an incriminating response. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Entremont, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 479; Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 341 (2d. ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 1996). The judge here found that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>was so intended, but while we accord his findings and conclusions substantial deference, his \u201cultimate findings and conclusions of law, especially those of constitutional dimensions, are open to independent review on appeal.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, 420 </em>Mass. 656, 657 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The following undisputed facts provide the context for the crucial exchange. Sergeant VonFlatem had conducted several hundred interviews during his twelve-plus years as a State trooper. The defendant, forty-seven, had not been in jail or arrested previously. After the defendant received his Miranda warnings and agreed to be interviewed, Trooper Habel and Sergeant VonFlatern questioned him about alleged sexual misconduct with his daughter or daughters. After about twelve to fifteen minutes, just after the defendant denied \u201cmolesting [Jane],\u201d VonFlatem asked \u201cif she\u2019s the only one.\u201d At that point, according to VonFlatern, the defendant said, \u201cyeah,\u201d and asked to speak to his lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Later, after speaking with his wife, who had accompanied him to the district attorney\u2019s office, and trying unsuccessfully to call a lawyer, the defendant was formally arrested and booked. He asked if he would be taken to the house of correction, and he was told that he would be. Then VonFlatern, in order to appraise the defendant\u2019s mental state, asked if he had ever been in jail before. The defendant said, \u201cno,\u201d and added, \u201cI know I didn\u2019t rape my daughter.\u201d Then, according to VonFlatem: \u201cI hesitated for a moment, and I said to him that, T didn\u2019t want him to take this as a question, but that the definition of rape is not always what people think it is, and that things like oral sex are also rape.\u2019 \u201d The defendant then made the incriminating admission that the judge ordered suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The defendant\u2019s assertion was not a question, but VonFlatern evidently believed that some responsive comment or rejoinder was called for. With a nod toward <em>Edwards </em>(\u201cdon\u2019t take this as a question\u201d), he gave the defendant a significant and possibly provocative piece of information. Would an objective observer infer that VonFlatern\u2019s comment was designed to elicit an incriminating response? Put differently, was it a question about the crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The judge found that it was: \u201cThe officer\u2019s response to the exculpatory statement, though not posed as a question, certainly invited a response since it disputed the Defendant\u2019s denial that he raped his daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>We agree and add the following observations. The principle of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>has been called a \u201cbright line\u201d and \u201cprophylactic\u201d rule. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>891 F.2d 389, 394-395 (1st Cir. 1989). But this safeguard will be neither clear nor protective if its applicability comes to depend upon case-by-case nuanced judgments of police officers. Moreover, there is often the possibility that a successful circumvention of the principle will yield something useful, and that temptation is corrupting. Therefore, the correct rule, we think, is that, when a suspect in custody asks for a lawyer, discussion of the charge should cease unless that suspect changes his mind, either in so many words or by conduct clearly to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The defendant has moved for \u201chis costs of appeal together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(d), as amended, 420 Mass. 1501 (1995). The motion is allowed in the amount of $2,830.35, $2,781.25 in fees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and $49.10 in costs; the trial court shall enter an order to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The defendant may submit a supplemental affidavit setting forth his attorney\u2019s fees for the appellate argument as those fees had not yet been incurred when the original affidavit was prepared.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
