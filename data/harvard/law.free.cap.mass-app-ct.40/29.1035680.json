When Robert W. Rose conveyed the locus to Morris Tobin by deed dated April 12, 1971, and recorded on July 16, 1971, he reserved for himself, his heirs, and assigns \u201cthe right to pass and repass over said property, to fish from the rocks and generally to enjoy the benefits of said property in common with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>others.\u201d The deed recites that the conveyance is for nominal consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The defendant Lilly is now the record owner of the locus; the defendant Sokolow is the grantee of an unrecorded deed of the locus from Lilly. The plaintiff Carol Rose Burritt is the daughter, and heir, of Robert W. Rose, and the remaining plaintiffs are the children of Burritt.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Sokolow seeks to construct a residence on the locus.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, relying on the easement quoted above, claim that he has no right to do so and brought this action in the Land Court to enjoin any construction on the locus. The judge\u2019s decision states that the parties stipulated at the hearing that there was no genuine issue of any material fact, and the judge so found. He concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to the injunction they sought, and he allowed their motion for summary judgment. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The proposed residence is shown on a plan dated June 9, 1992. The plan shows that the residence would be above the soil line and would occupy a \u201cfootprint\u201d of about 560 square feet. The plan also shows a concrete walk extending from the end of Bass Rock Lane across a portion of the locus to below the soil line, together with masonry stairs, both of which are designed to facilitate access to the locus for those having easement rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The judge made these findings about the locus:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIt is the end of a promontory, affording views of the ocean in three directions. Most of it is rock, which, even in its harbor location, must provide a satisfying surf at times. The part not rock is covered by sea-side vegetation. Locus is an unspoiled area which can provide pleasure, perhaps even delight, to the senses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">The judge concluded that these unspoiled areas jutting into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the sea are the \u201c \u2018benefits of said property\u2019 [referred to in the easement], and they would be materially interfered with by the proposed residence and its parking areas.\u201d The judge entered a final judgment which (i) adjudged that the easement set forth in the deed to Tobin \u201cmay [be] exercise[d]. . . over the entire area conveyed under said deed and said area shall be kept in its natural state\u201d and (ii) enjoined the defendants from constructing the proposed residence on the locus, \u201cand from otherwise disturbing the natural state of said area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The judge\u2019s finding that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact apparently was based on his conclusion that the Tobin deed was \u201cnot ambiguous.\u201d However, the documents on file in the case include the affidavit of Richard Sokolow to which is attached a copy of a letter from Carol Rose Burritt to Tobin, dated May 18, 1976, five years after the date of the deed to Tobin. That letter states, \u201cMy father discussed the best solution for the land . . . [deeded to To-bin], With my approval it was deeded to you by my father <em>for your use and not to be held for the family\"</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The 1976 letter from Burritt to Tobin, which the judge ruled was not relevant because the Tobin deed was not ambiguous, as well as the underlying conversation between Burritt and Rose,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> bear directly on the question of the intention of Rose at the time of the deed to Tobin. Given the position of the plaintiffs in this litigation \u2014 that Tobin\u2019s deed granted him, as owner, no more property rights than those Rose reserved to himself and his heirs and assigns, namely, the right to walk over the property, but not to alter its natural state \u2014 Rose\u2019s intention, viewed in the context of Burritt\u2019s 1976 letter to Tobin, is far from clear, and evidence is admissible \u201cto elucidate its meaning in context.\u201d <em>Antonellis </em>v. <em>Northgate Constr. Corp., </em>362 Mass. 847, 851 (1973). See also <em>Robert Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 753 (1973). Compare <em>Doody </em>v. <em>Spurr, </em>315 Mass. 129, 133 (1943) (language of a grant should be construed in the light of attending circumstances that show the intention of the parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>We conclude that there is a genuine issue as to a material fact \u2014 whether Rose intended his deed to a third party, To-bin, to be the means by which the natural state of the property would be preserved, as the plaintiffs claim, or whether the Tobin deed was intended to permit Tobin to make use of the locus, including construction upon it, while preserving the right of the heirs to go upon the property for the purpose of viewing and enjoying the ocean scene, as Sokolow claims. The issue of Rose\u2019s intention is critical to the outcome in this case. See <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Wingate, </em>338 Mass. 481, 485 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In these circumstances we hold that the stipulation of the parties was improvidently entered into and the judge should not have accepted the stipulation as binding upon him. See <em>Granby Heights Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 266, 269 (1995) (a court may vacate a stipulation made by the parties if it is deemed \u201cimprovident or not conducive to justice\u201d), quoting from <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Mercier, </em>318 Mass. 599, 601 (1945) (an appellate court as well as the trial court may vacate an improvident stipulation).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Because this case must be remanded to the Land Court, we offer certain guidelines, which the trial judge may find helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The judge divided the easement into separate components (the right to pass and repass over said property; the right to fish from the rocks \u2014 as to which there is no dispute; and the right to enjoy the benefits of the property in common with others), analyzing each component separately. We disagree with this mode of analysis. The right to pass and repass over the property together with the right to enjoy the benefits of the property would seem to be united by a single intention of the grantor. Whatever was intended by the grant of the right to enjoy the benefits of the property, the right to pass and repass merely provided specific assurance that that right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>enjoyment would be available without trespassing upon the property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We also emphasize that what the plaintiffs seek in these proceedings is similar to a negative easement, that is, it resembles a covenant by Rose that the locus will not be built upon and will be kept in its natural state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such restrictions on use are not favored; they are limited in time to thirty years from the date of the deed. See G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Finally, we observe that the right to an injunction against the obstruction of an easement \u201cis not an absolute one.\u201d <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hewitt, </em>314 Mass. 346, 350 (1943). It is important to consider whether the intrusion upon the easement is serious or substantial. <em>Ibid. </em>If, for example, the rights reserved by the easement are deemed to require, consistently with the intention of the grantor, merely enforceable assurances that access to those portions of the locus that afford the beneficiaries of the easement the enjoyment of \u201cjust watching the ocean from the area at the end of Bass Rock Lane,\u201d as described in Carol Rose Burritt\u2019s affidavit,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> then it may be feasible to protect rights under the easement while not precluding <em>all </em>construction on the locus. See <em>Barchenski </em>v. <em>Pion, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 896, 897 (1980) (\u201cIn dealing with the grant of an easement that is general in nature, a standard of reasonableness is applied to determine the extent of uses permitted for either the easement holder or the owner of the servient estate\u201d). But these are matters for the judge\u2019s sound discretion, and we do not intimate any particular result.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Land Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b70-10\">The Marblehead planning board approved a site plan special permit for Sokolow\u2019s proposed house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b70-11\">The judge stated that in prior proceedings involving Bass Rock he had viewed the locus. Those proceedings involved the defendants but not the plaintiffs. We need not consider whether it was appropriate for the judge, in considering a motion for summary judgment, to include his impressions from the view, see <em>Berlandi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>314 Mass. 424, 451 (1943) (information acquired on a view may be treated as evidence), for nothing turns on that fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">There is also on file the affidavit of Carol Rose Burritt, dated October 25, 1991, which states that her father told her that \u201cby deeding the property to Attorney Tobin he was guaranteeing that it would never be built upon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b71-11\">At the trial, the parties will be obliged to consider whether, or the extent to which, Burritt\u2019s conversations with her father are admissible. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 65, regarding declarations of deceased persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Without denying or referring to the judge\u2019s statement that the parties stipulated that there was no genuine issue of a material fact, Sokolow, in this court, seeks a remand for trial on the merits, relying on the claim that the filed affidavits are directly contradictory as to Rose\u2019s intention in conveying the locus to Tobin. We are not unmindful of the rule that parties may not change the theory on which, by assent and with the approval of the judge, the case was tried. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>374 Mass. 453, 465 (1978); <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 341 (1990). Nevertheless, we conclude, for the reasons stated in the text, that this rule must yield to the need to consider the argument made on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Illustrations of a negative easement may be found in <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Salin, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 127, 134 n.9 (1982). There is some authority that a negative easement is always an appurtenant easement \u2014 a condition that does not exist in this case. See 2 American Law of Property \u00a7 8.12, at 237 (Casner ed. 1952). Section 8.12 explains that the \u201cinterest protected by a negative easement is always an interest in the enjoyment of land possessed by the one entitled to the benefit of the easement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b73-16\">The affidavit states, \u201cDuring the last several years I have come to Marblehead at least once each year and have gone on Bass Rock and have greatly enjoyed just watching the ocean from the area at the end of Bass Rock Lane. Those moments are very precious to me.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
