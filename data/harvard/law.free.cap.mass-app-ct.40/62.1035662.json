L. c. 266, \u00a7 28, and larceny in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30. After an unrecorded side bar conference, the defendant paid the victim $500 in restitution. A District Court judge then dismissed the case over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, stating: \u201cI\u2019m going to dismiss this case on payment of restitution as I promised I would.\u201d The Commonwealth appealed. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15(b), as amended, 397 Mass. 1225 (1986); G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E. The Commonwealth correctly argues that the pretrial dismissal over its objection was contrary to legislative mandate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>violated art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We vacate the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Article 30 creates a separation of powers among the branches of government giving the prosecutor broad discretion in determining whether to prosecute a case. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>409 Mass. 398, 401 (1991). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pellegrini, </em>414 Mass. 402, 404 (1993). \u201cPretrial dismissal, over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, of a valid complaint or indictment before a verdict, finding, or plea, and without an evidentiary hearing basically quashes or enters a nolle prosequi of the complaint or indictment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>410 Mass. 498, 503 (1991).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pellegrini, supra </em>at 404. A decision to nol pros a criminal case rests with the executive branch of government and, absent a legal basis, cannot be entered over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 500-501. A judge, however, often dismisses a case with the consent of the Commonwealth where the result is fair and just to both the defendant and the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brandano, </em>359 Mass. 332, 335 (1971). Here, the record reflects that the Commonwealth objected and that there was no independent legal basis for the dismissal, and, therefore, the dismissal cannot stand. The judge\u2019s dismissal also unconstitutionally usurped the Legislature\u2019s power to prescribe punishment for criminal conduct. See <em>Sheehan, petitioner, </em>254 Mass. 342, 345 (1926); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brandano, supra </em>at 336; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 922 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuitt, </em>393 Mass. 801, 814 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The defendant was charged with larceny of a motor vehicle under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28, as amended through St. 1989, c. 341, \u00a7 101, which provides that \u201c[a] prosecution commenced under this subdivision shall not be placed on file or continued without a finding.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n our tripartite system of government it is unquestionable that the Legislature has the authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>determine what conduct shall be punishable and to prescribe penalties.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 922. The provision of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28, stating that a prosecution shall not be placed on file or continued without a finding indicates a legislative determination that, absent some independent legal justification, a judge cannot dispose of a charge under the statute without a determination of guilt or innocence. See District Court Department of the Trial Court, Standards of Judicial Practice: Sentencing and Other Dispositions, Commentary to Reg. 7:10 (1984) (\u201cA prosection commenced under the statutes set forth below must proceed to a finding ... [3] Motor Vehicle Theft . . . G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28[n]\u201d). Here, contrary to legislative mandate, the judge dismissed the case without determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Just as the judiciary may not exercise the executive powers, it may not exercise those of the Legislature. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Article 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides: \u201cIn the government of this commonwealth, the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them: the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In addition, a person found guilty of violating G.
