L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63, inserted by St. 1991, c. 412, \u00a7 22. The statute grants such officers \u201cthe same power to make arrests as regular police officers for any criminal offense committed in or upon lands or structures owned, used or occupied by such college.\u201d The Commonwealth contends that the statute empowered the officer to arrest the defendant for operating under the influence of liquor on part of a public way that was within the confines of the college campus. For the reasons herein stated, we affirm the order of the judge allowing the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">We summarize the findings of the motion judge, supplemented in significant respects with uncontroverted testimony adduced at the hearing on the motion. On November 18, 1993, at about 2:10 a.m., Robert Harrington, a campus police officer at Fitchburg State College, was proceeding in a southerly direction on North Street, a public way maintained by the town of Fitchburg. Part of his duty was to patrol North Street. Harrington observed a red Ford Escort automobile pull out of Authority Drive, a private way maintained by the college, heading in an easterly direction. Framing the intersection of North Street and Authority Drive are certain college buildings, including the Hammond Library building and two residential towers. Students commonly walk up and down North Street and cross the street there. Harrington stated that there are no traffic control devices at the intersection. When Harrington\u2019s cruiser was almost to the point of the exit area, the Escort came out of Authority Drive at an angle to the right, and Harrington was forced to swerve into the left lane (the opposite travel lane) to avoid being hit. The Escort ended up in Harrington\u2019s lane. Harrington activated his blue lights; the Escort backed up onto Authority Drive and he backed up next to the Escort. The motion judge found that \u201c[t]he officer thereafter stopped the defendant on North Street and arrested the defendant for GUI and the defendant was also charged with [two] civil motor vehicle infrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>tians.\u201d When asked on cross-examination what he stopped the defendant for, Harrington replied that he stopped the defendant for failure to yield at an intersection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Without citing to any authorities or explaining his analysis, the motion judge in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress concluded as matter of law only that \u201c[t]he Fitchburg State College employee lacked legal authority to do those things which were done.\u201d The parties at the motion hearing and on appeal focus their attention on a question of statutory construction, viz., whether North Street was \u201cowned used or occupied\u201d by Fitchburg State College, so as to permit Harrington to make arrests for any criminal offense committed thereon. It is not necessary to reach the issue framed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Harrington stopped the defendant for failure to yield at an intersection, a civil motor vehicle infraction punishable only by a thirty-five dollar fine. G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 8, as amended through St. 1991, c. 552, \u00a7\u00a7 64, 65. See <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>415 Mass. 126, 128 (1993). It is not an arrestable offense. St. 1988, c. 202, \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zorilla, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 79 (1995). At the time he stopped the defendant, Harrington did not have reason to suspect that the defendant had committed an arrestable offense. It was only after the officer stopped the defendant and made observations concerning his sobriety that Harrington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>discovered grounds to arrest the defendant for the arrestable offense of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. If Harrington had the authority to stop the defendant in the first instance, the validity of the defendant\u2019s subsequent arrest based on probable cause discovered to exist after the stop is not thereby put in question, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>366 Mass. 277, 278-279 (1974), and the issue framed by the parties would then be pertinent. As it is, however, we conclude that Harrington did not have authority to stop the defendant for a civil motor vehicle violation and, accordingly, the subsequent warrantless arrest cannot be justified by observations made following the stop. It is, therefore, of no consequence to our analysis that North Street may be \u201cowned, used or occupied\u201d by Fitchburg State College.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">General Laws c. 22C, \u00a7 63, does not confer upon campus security staff all the powers of a State police officer appointed pursuant to c. 22C, \u00a7 10. On its face, G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63, confers upon those appointed thereunder by the colonel of the Massachusetts State police as special State police officers only \u201cthe same power to make arrests as regular police officers for any criminal offense committed in or upon lands or structures owned, used or occupied by such college.\u201d The police powers thus conferred upon certain college employees are similar, but by no means identical, to the specific police powers conferred by c. 22C, \u00a7\u00a7 56-68, upon certain agents or employees of: the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> various humane societies and associations,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Port of Boston Authority,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Department of Mental Health or Department of Mental Retardation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Department of Public Health,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> various soldiers\u2019 homes,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Civil Defense Agency,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Middlesex County Sanatorium,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Department of Employment and Training,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the State Lottery Commission<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the Bureau of Special Investigations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The statutory provisions of c. 22C, \u00a7\u00a756 through 68, are all silent as to the authority, if any, of special State police officers appointed thereunder to enforce the civil motor vehicle laws on public ways within their respective jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">General Laws c. 90C details the procedures to be employed with regard to motor vehicle offenses. It is c. 90C, \u00a7 2, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>inserted by St. 1985, c. 794, \u00a7 3, which authorizes a police officer to stop a motorist in order to issue a citation for automobile law violations. This section provides <em>inter alla </em>that \u201cany police officer assigned to traffic enforcement duty\u201d shall record the violation upon a citation. Section 3, as amended by St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 5A, provides that \u201cIf a police officer observes ... the occurrence of a civil motor vehicle infraction, the officer may issue a written warning or may cite the violator for a civil motor vehicle infraction. . . .\u201d To do so, the police officer must, of course, in many instances first stop the offender. However, c. 90C, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1991, c. 412, \u00a7 64, defines \u201cpolice officer\u201d narrowly to include \u201cany officer . . . authorized to make arrest or serve criminal process, any person appointed by the registrar under section twenty-nine of chapter ninety, any person appointed by the trustees of the University of Massachusetts under section thirty-two A of chapter seventy-five, any person appointed by the trustees of Southeastern Massachusetts university under section seventeen of chapter seventy-five B and any person appointed by the colonel of state police under section fifty-nine of chapter twenty-two C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">While virtually all special State police officers are empowered by c. 22C, \u00a7\u00a7 56 through 68, to \u201cmake arrest\u201d and/or \u201cserve criminal process,\u201d we do not read c. 90, \u00a7 1, to encompass all such special State police officers within the definition of \u201cpolice officer.\u201d Were this so, it would have been redundant and unnecessary for c. 90, \u00a7 1, expressly to include within the definition of \u201cpolice officer\u201d only those special State police officers appointed under c. 22C, \u00a7 59. Accordingly, we conclude that campus police officers, unlike those employed by the Departments of Mental Health or Mental Retardation under c. 226, \u00a7 59, are not empowered under c. 90C, \u00a7 2, to stop motorists for automobile law violations on public ways within their jurisdiction.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Consistent with the foregoing, the motion judge specifically found that Officer Harrington \u201chad no citation book and the [defendant did not receive any motor vehicle citations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>As the acknowledged basis for the stop by the officer was a civil motor vehicle violation which was not an arrestable offense, the evidence relating to the subsequent complaint for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol was properly suppressed in circumstances where the officer did not suspect that the defendant had committed an arrestable offense prior to the stop. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zorilla, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 78-81 (warrantless search and seizure of a motor vehicle unlawful where basis for the police stop was a nonarrestable civil offense). The order of the judge allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Complaints issued against the defendant for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24), operating a motor vehicle without license in possession (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 11), and failure to yield at an intersection (G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 8), the latter two complaints being civil infractions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\"> There was no testimony at the suppression hearing concerning the citation of the defendant for operating under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The judge read the complaint into the record. The complaint recites that the defendant \u201cdid operate a motor vehicle on a way as defined in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, and while turning left in an intersection of ways, across the path of a vehicle approaching from the opposite direction, did fail, before turning, to yield the right-of-way until such time as the left turn could be made with reasonable safety, in violation of G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 8.\u201d Presumably based on Harrington\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that the Escort pulled out of Authority Drive at a right angle, the judge specifically found that the defendant was \u201cnot making a left turn as set forth\u201d in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Indeed, as the defendant suggests here, it appears that the judge may have in fact determined that the failure to yield infraction may not have occurred at all, for the reason that the defendant was not making a left turn. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zorilla, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 79 n. 4 (1995). General Laws c. 89, \u00a7 8, provides that an operator \u201cintending to turn left . . . [must] yield the right-of-way.\u201d The judge found that the defendant was not making a left turn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Chapter 22C, \u00a7 56: \u201c[AJgents . . . shall have and exercise throughout the commonwealth the powers of state police officers to serve warrants and other criminal processes, except the authority to arrest without warrant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Chapter 22C, \u00a7 57: \u201cThey . . . shall have throughout the commonwealth the powers of constables and police officers to arrest and detain any person violating any law for the prevention of cruelty to animals.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Chapter 22C, \u00a7 58: \u201c[TJhey shall have the same power to make arrests as the state police for any criminal offense committed in or upon lands, piers or structures within the charge of said authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Chapter 22C, \u00a7 59: \u201c[EJmployees . . . shall have the same power to make arrests as the state police for any criminal offense committed in or upon lands or structures within the charge of said departments or of the various institutions under the respective jurisdictions of said departments.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Chapter 22C, \u00a7 60: \u201c[Ejmployees . . . shall have the same power to make arrests as the state police for any criminal offense committed in or upon the lands or structures within the charge of the department of public health or the various institutions under its jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\">hapter 22C, \u00a7 61: \u201c[TJhey shall have the same power to make arrests as the state police for any criminal offense committed in or upon lands or structures within the control of said authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\">hapter 22C, \u00a7 62: \u201c[Ejmployees . . . shall have the same power to make arrests as the state police for any criminal offense committed in or upon land or structures within the charge of said boards of trustees. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\">hapter 22C, \u00a7 64: \u201c[Ejmployees . . . shall have the same power to make arrests as the state police of any criminal offense committed in or upon lands or structures located in the town of Framingham within the charge of said director.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b448-10\">hapter 22C, \u00a7 65: \u201c[Ejmployees . . . shall have the same power to make arrests as regular police officers for any criminal offense committed in or upon lands, or structures owned, used or occupied by said sanatorium.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b448-11\">hapter 22C, \u00a7 66: \u201c[TJhey shall have the same power to make arrests as the state police for any violation of section forty-seven of chapter one hundred and fifty-one A and shall have the power to serve warrants and other criminal processes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b448-12\">hapter 22C, \u00a7 67: \u201c[TJhey shall have the same power to make arrests as the state police for any criminal offense committed in connection with any activities operated or regulated by the state lottery commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b448-13\">hapter 22, \u00a7 68: \u201c[TJhey shall have and exercise throughout the commonwealth the same powers as state police officers to serve warrants and other criminal processes for any criminal offense resulting from either a fraudulent claim for payment or service under any assistance program administered by the department of public welfare or any program administered by the department of social services or a receipt of payment or services by a person entitled thereto or for any violation of chapter two hundred and seventy-three relative to the support of spouses and children for whom the department of public welfare is entitled to receive payment, or in whose behalf said department is giving aid; except, that said officers shall not have the authority to arrest without a warrant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Since at least 1961, prior to the enactment of both c. 22C, \u00a7 59, and c. 90C, \u00a7 1, special police officers appointed under c. 147, \u00a7 10B, and employed by the Department of Mental Health have enforced regulations relative to controlling motor vehicle traffic on the grounds of State hospitals.
