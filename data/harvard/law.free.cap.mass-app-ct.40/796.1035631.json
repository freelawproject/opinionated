Jon-Son Steel Erectors, Inc. (Jon-Son), a subcontractor, was injured at a work site where the defendant, Kiewit Construction Co. (Kiewit), was the general contractor. Temporary stairs providing access to a building were removed by Kiewit, and, failing to notice their absence, Collins fell when leaving the building. After Collins sued Kiewit for negligence, Kiewit filed a third-party complaint essentially seeking indemnifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>tian from Jon-Son. A bifurcated trial was held in the Superior Court with Collins\u2019s claim being tried first to a jury. The jury awarded damages to Collins after finding in answer to special questions that both he and Kiewit were negligent and that the negligence of each was a proximate cause of Collins\u2019s injury. Apportioning negligence pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, the jury attributed three percent to Collins and ninety-seven percent to Kiewit. A judgment for Collins was entered for $751,750 reflecting ninety-seven percent of the total damages found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">By agreement, the third-party action was decided on the basis of the jury\u2019s findings. Acting on cross motions for summary judgment, the judge allowed that of Kiewit, thereby determining that Jon-Son was in breach of the indemnification and insurance provisions of its subcontract with Kiewit. Accordingly, he ordered Jon-Son to indemnify Kiewit for the judgment against it, and awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Jon-Son appeals from the ensuing judgment in the third-party action, arguing alternatively that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C, either voids the indemnification clause or should be construed to limit the indemnity obligation to that portion of negligence attributable to it. Jon-Son also claims it was not in breach of its insurance obligation. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">1. <em>Validity of indemnity clause. </em>We first look to the language of the indemnity clause. See <em>Harnois </em>v. <em>Quannapowitt Dev., Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 288 (1993); <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>A. J. Welch Equip. Corp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 611 (1994). That clause, as set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is enforceable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because it \u201climit[s] the subcontractor\u2019s obligation to indemnify to cases in which there is a causal connection between the subcontractor\u2019s work and the injury.\u201d <em>M. DeMatteo Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>A.C. Dellovade, Inc., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 3 (1995). See also <em>Harnois </em>v. <em>Quannapowitt Dev., Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 288-289; <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>A. J. Welch Equip. Corp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 611-612. It is not affected by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23, releasing an employer from all common law claims of an employee. See <em>Whittle </em>v. <em>Pagani Bros. Constr. Co., </em>383 Mass. 796, 799-800 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">2. <em>Application of indemnity clause. </em>The indemnity clause plainly states that Jon-Son was responsible to indemnify for \u201cinjur[y] ... on account of acts or omissions of . . . any of its . . . employees.\u201d Accordingly, any degree of negligence on Collins\u2019s part, which the jury determined to be \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of his indivisible injury, brings Jon-Son within the terms of that provision. It was agreed at trial that Kiewit\u2019s claim for indemnification was not based on the negligence of any Jon-Son employee other than Collins. We do not, as did the trial judge, rely on any common law imputation of Collins\u2019s negligence to Jon-Son but rather on Jon-Son\u2019s contractual undertaking.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On its face, the clause does not limit indemnification where the negligence of the indemnified party also is a cause of that injury. Compare <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Dimeo, Inc., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 626, 627, 629-630 (1991), involving a generally similar indemnity provision in similar circumstances arising prior to the enactment of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C. The only contractual limitation is for an injury caused by the <em>sole </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>negligence of an indemnitee. Although very substantial, Kiewit\u2019s apportioned negligence was not entire, and Collins was not completely free from fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Jon-Son argues that to permit Kiewit to recover for the damages caused by Kiewit, as attributed by the jury, denies Jon-Son the protection the Legislature intended to give subcontractors when it enacted G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C. This argument ignores the history of the statute. In its original form,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it declared indemnity clauses in construction contracts which absolved indemnitees from their own negligence to be against public policy and void and unenforceable. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., </em>28 Mass. App. 77, 81 (1989). In that version, the statute appeared to \u201cpreclude[ ] indemnification whenever the <em>indemnitee\u2019s </em>negligence, no matter how slight, caused the injury\u201d (emphasis in original). Musacchio, Statutory Limitations on Indemnity Agreements in Construction Contracts: The Meaning and Effect of G.L.M. c. 149, \u00a7 29C, 80 Mass. L. Rev. 54, 57 (1995). Less than five months after its original effective date, \u00a7 29C was amended by substituting the current version which \u201cis less sweeping and declares void indemnity provisions in construction contracts only when the injury is \u2018not caused by the subcontractor or its employees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., supra </em>at 81-82. The refocusing brought about by the current statute does not preclude full indemnification when an indivisible injury is caused by negligence concurrently attributable both to the indemnitee, and, by the terms of the indemnity agreement, to the indemnitor. An effect of the amendment to \u00a7 29C is to avoid any inconsonance with preexisting case law upholding clauses which permitted indemnification notwithstanding an indemnitee\u2019s concurrent fault. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Bay State Gas Co., </em>383 Mass. 218, 224 (1981); <em>Whittle </em>v. <em>Pagani Bros. Constr. Co., </em>383 Mass, at 799; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Dimeo, Inc., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 629-630; Musacchio, <em>supra </em>at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">At the time of the trial of this action, none of our appellate decisions had expressly addressed the issue of proportionate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>indemnification, although <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., supra, </em>may be read to indicate that full indemnity is not precluded under the statute. Jon-Son, relying on several Superior Court decisions limiting subcontractors\u2019 responsibility to their own negligence notwithstanding broad indemnification language, seeks to have \u00a7 29C applied so as to bar indemnification for that portion of the damages attributable to Kiewit\u2019s negligence. We discern nothing in our case law or the language or history of \u00a7 29C that prevents parties from agreeing to full indemnification in the event of concurrent negligence. See <em>Herson </em>v. <em>New Boston Garden Corp., ante </em>779, 788 (1996) (holding that \u201c29C does not proscribe full indemnification when the subcontractor is only a partial cause of the injury\u201d). If the Legislature had intended that indemnification provisions in construction contracts be interpreted to reflect the application of our comparative negligence statute, or to preclude indemnification when the injured claimant is an employee of the subcontractor, it could have said so. <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>A. J. Welch Equip. Corp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 612. Moreover, given the proposition that \u201c[ijndemnity provisions are not read with any bias in favor of the indemnitor and against the indemnitee,\u201d <em>Urban Inv. &amp; Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Turner Constr. Co., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 100, 107 (1993), and the opportunity of the parties to negotiate indemnity clauses and to adjust to any unequal bargaining power by the assumption of the burdens of insurance coverage, <em>Speers </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood, Inc., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 598, 601 (1986), we perceive no need to construe \u00a7 29C as imposing a limitation on a valid bargain struck by the parties. See also Alexander, Developments in Indemnity Law: Express, Implied Contractual, Tort-Based and Statutory, 79 Mass. L. Rev. 50, 51-52 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">3. <em>Insurance. </em>There is no merit in Jon-Son\u2019s argument that it was not in breach of a provision in its subcontract requiring it to obtain certain insurance and that the judge erred in so concluding and awarding costs of defense. The insurance provision aside, the indemnification clause states an obligation to defend. In the circumstances, costs of defense properly are a part of the indemnification claim. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 82; <em>Urban Inv. &amp; Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Turner Constr. Co., supra </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\"> Kiewit\u2019s cross appeal on this issue of damages is not argued to us and is, therefore, waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-8\"> The indemnification provision in pertinent part is as follows: \u201cThe Subcontractor further specifically obligates itself to the Contractor, Owner and any other party required to be indemnified under the Prime Contract, jointly and separately, in the following respects, to wit: . . .
