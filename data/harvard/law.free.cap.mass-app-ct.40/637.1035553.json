The plaintiff alleged that a 1991 amendment to the condominium master deed that extended the time to add additional phases to the condominium<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was obtained upon approval by seventy percent of the unit owners was invalid. On cross motions for summary judgment, a Land Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>judge agreed, ruling that the amendment affected the plaintiffs undivided percentage interest in the condominium\u2019s common area and that, pursuant to G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 5(6), one hundred percent approval of all unit owners whose percentage interests were affected by the amendment was required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A final judgment was entered declaring that the right to add additional phases had expired, that the amendment was void, and that the percentage interests of each unit owner should be restored to the interest existing as of the date of expiration of the reserved right. The bank has appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The Herring Run Condominium was created by master deed dated on March 14, 1986, and recorded at the Barnstable County registry of deeds. The master deed, upon which the plaintiff had a right to rely at the time she acquired her unit, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\"><em>\u201cSection 13A. Construction of Phases 2 through 12. </em>With respect to each of said Phases 2 through 12:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">\u201ca.

Adding Future Phases by Amending Master Deed. </em>If any additional phases are constructed, the Declarant shall add such future phases and the buildings and Units therein to the Condominium by executing and recording with the Barnstable County Registry of Deeds amendments to this Master Deed ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">\u201cIt is expressly understood and agreed that no such amendments adding new phases to the Condominium shall require the consent (except as in this Section already granted) or signature in any manner by any Unit Owner . . . and the only signature which shall be required on any such amendment is that of the Declarant. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\u201cEach Unit Owner understands and agrees that as additional phase(s) containing additional Unit(s) are added to the Condominium by amendment to this Master Deed pursuant to the Declarant\u2019s reserved rights hereunder, the percentage ownership interest of his Unit in the Common Areas and Facilities, together with his Unit\u2019s concomitant interest in the Condominium Corporation and liability for sharing in the common expenses of the Condominium, shall be reduced ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">\u201cEvery Unit Owner by the acceptance of his deed to his Unit hereby consents . . . to the Declarant\u2019s reserved rights under this Section 13 and expressly agrees to the alteration of the Unit\u2019s appurtenant percentage ownership interest in the Common Areas and Facilities of the Condominium as aforesaid when new phase(s) are added to the Condominium by amendment to this Master Deed pursuant to this Section 13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">\u201cIn the event that notwithstanding the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>this Section 13 to the contrary, it shall ever be determined that the signature of any Unit Owner, other than the Declarant, is required on any amendment to this Master Deed which adds new phase(s) to the Condominium, then the Declarant, and Declarant\u2019s successors in title (including ... by deed in lieu of foreclosure) shall be empowered, as attomey-in-fact for the owner of each Unit in the Condominium, to execute and deliver any such amendment by and on behalf of and in the name of each such Unit Owner; and for this purpose each Unit Owner, by the acceptance of the deed to his Unit . . . constitutes and appoints the Declarant as his attomey-in-fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\"><em>\u201cSection 14A. Amendments to Master Deed. </em>Except with respect to Section[ ] ... 13 hereof, this Master Deed may be amended by (a) the vote of at least seventy percent (70%) in common interest of all Unit Owners . . . at a meeting duly held in accordance with the provisions of the By-Laws of the Herring Run Condominium Corporation ... or (b) in lieu of a meeting, any amendment may be approved in writing by seventy percent (70%) in common interest of all Unit Owners . . . ; provided, however, that, without the consent of any Unit Owner, (a) the Declarant (or the Declarant\u2019s successors as aforesaid) may at any time within seven (7) years of this Master Deed, amend this Master Deed so as to increase the number of Units in the condominium to include . . . [all or portions of Phases 2 through 12 or such other phase or phases as permitted by Sections 12'and 13 of the Master Deed].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Although the exact date of the recording of the master deed is not part of the record, it is undisputed that the master deed was recorded in March, 1986, and that no new phases were added to the condominium by March 31, 1993, i.e., within the seven-year period after the recording of the master deed. After accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure from the developer, the defendant bank purported to amend the master deed under the general amendment provision (with seventy percent unit owner approval) so as to extend the period within which it could develop additional phases. The judge ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>that the bank, by employing the general amendment provision of the master deed (contained in \u00a7 14A, requiring approval of only seventy percent of unit owners) to extend the period within which additional phases were permitted, attempted to circumvent the requirements of G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 <em>5(b).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">At oral argument, the bank asserted that the plaintiff, having accepted a deed to her unit and having agreed thereby to the reduction of her percentage interest in accordance with additional phases added pursuant to \u00a7 13 of the master deed, cannot now argue that the addition of additional phases contemplated by the master deed works an impermissible reduction of her percentage interest. The argument lacks merit. The reserved right to add additional phases (and to amend the master deed accordingly, under \u00a7 13C, without approval of any unit owner) was limited under \u00a7 13B(a) to a period of seven years after the recording of the master deed. There having been no phases added pursuant to \u00a7 13 by the time the reserved right expired (together with the plaintiff\u2019s concomitant agreement to reduction in her percentage interest), the plaintiff\u2019s percentage interest became fixed. Any subsequent attempt by the bank to add phases affecting the unit owners\u2019 percentage interests required, under G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 <em>5(b), </em>one hundred percent approval of all owners whose percentage interests were affected.

The quoted language was retained, and the section also provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe organization of unit owners, upon the affirmative vote of seventy-five percent of the holders of the undivided interest in the common area and facilities, shall have the right to extend, for a specified period of time, the rights of the declarant to continue to exercise its development rights.\u201d The 1994 amendment is not applicable to the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> By \u00a7 14A of the master deed, the \u00a7 13 phasing was excepted from the general amendment provision authorizing approval by seventy percent of the unit owners.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
