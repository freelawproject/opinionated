The Boston Public School Building Custodians\u2019 Association (union) filed charges with the Labor Relations Commission (commission) that the school committee had violated G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(1), (3) and (5), by laying off the custodians in order to interfere with their right to vote in a scheduled add-on election which was to be ordered on July 3, 1992.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">After an investigation, the commission issued a complaint alleging that the school committee had violated \u00a7 10(a)(1) and (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, a hearing officer conducted evidentiary hearings and issued her recommended findings of fact. Subsequently, on the basis of the evidence at the hearings and the hearing officer\u2019s recommended findings, the commission made its findings of fact and issued its opinion that the school committee had violated \u00a7 10(a)(1) and (3) \u201cby laying off the thirty-nine temporary and provisional custodians in retaliation for engaging in concerted, protected activity . . . .\u201d The school committee appealed the decision of the commission to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">We review the commission\u2019s findings of fact in accordance with the standards set out in the State Administrative Procedure Act.

However, we are \u201cfree to examine the legal standards employed by the commission.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We conclude that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s findings and that the commission employed the appropriate legal standards; thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The commission identified the elements that the union, in the first instance, must establish in order to make its required prima facie showing that the school committee unlawfully discriminated against the custodians, namely: (1) that the custodians were engaged in protected concerted activities; (2) that the school committee knew of these activities; (3) that the school committee took adverse action against the custodians; and (4) that the adverse action was motivated by the school committee\u2019s desire to penalize or discourage the protected activity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">If the union does make out its prima facie case including the employer\u2019s unlawful motive, the school committee then has the responsibility to come forward with \u201ca lawful reason for its decision and [to] produce supporting facts indicating that this reason was actually a motive in the decision.\u201d <em>Trustees of Forbes Library, supra </em>at 566. The \u201csupporting facts\u201d must include \u201c \u2018credible evidence . . . [which] show[s] that the reason or reasons advanced were the real reasons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys.

Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 138 (1976). If the reason given \u201chas no reasonable support in the evidence or is wholly disbelieved (and hence is transparently a pretext), the employee should prevail.\u201d <em>Wheelock College, supra </em>at 138.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Blare, supra </em>at 442 (\u201cIf the defendant fails to meet its burden, . . . then the presumption created by the preponderance of evidence supporting a prima facie case entitles plaintiff to judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">If the school committee satisfies its responsibility, the union must then persuade the commission that the discharge would not have occurred but for the committee\u2019s motive to interfere with the right of the custodians to vote in the forthcoming add-on election. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The burden of persuasion before the commission always remains with the union (or employee). <em>Trustees of Forbes Library, supra </em>at 566. However, as the party challenging the commission\u2019s decision on appeal, the school committee \u201chas the burden of showing that the commission\u2019s action was invalid.\u201d <em>Quincy City Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>400 Mass. 745, 749 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">1. <em>The union\u2019s prima facie case.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The school committee first argues that the union failed to make out a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination. The first three elements of the union\u2019s prima facie case are not in dispute: the employees were engaged in a protected activity \u2014 the attempt to participate in an election regarding a bargaining unit; the school committee knew of that activity; and the school committee, by terminating the custodians, obviously took action adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>to the interests of the custodians. See note 5, supra. From these undisputed facts, and from the additional facts described below, the commission drew the inference of the school committee\u2019s unlawful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In August, 1991, the parties were unable to agree on the scope of the bargaining unit for custodians and the impending add-on election. On August 21, 1991, the union filed a charge of a prohibited practice with the commission, alleging that the school committee had refused to apply the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement to the custodians, and had refused to recognize the union as their bargaining agent. The commission responded that it would investigate the charges, but not until March 13, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Meanwhile, between January and April, 1992, the union and the school committee met about six times to discuss the impact of a required reduction of $345,000 in the custodial budget for fiscal 1992. After the union rejected a proposal to lay off all the custodians for the remainder of the 1992 fiscal year, the parties signed a comprehensive settlement agreement dated April 23, 1992, regarding a custodial budget reduction of $345,000. In brief, the parties agreed that the reduction would be achieved by requiring all the custodians (permanent, temporary, and provisional) to accept two days furlough (no work-no pay). On March 30, 1992, while these discussions were on-going, the union filed a representation petition to \u201cadd-on\u201d the provisional and temporary custodians to the existing custodial bargaining unit. The union then withdrew its previously filed prohibited practices charge on April 15, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">On May 13, 1992, the school committee and the union met to discuss the representation petition. While the school committee agreed that the thirty-nine custodians would be eligible to vote in the add-on election, they would not agree that later hired temporary custodians should be included in the bargaining unit. The meeting ended without any agreement and, on May 29, 1992, the hearing officer, as we have previously stated, notified the parties in writing that on July 3, 1992, she would order an add-on election. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Regarding the period immediately prior to the discharge notice, the commission found that, \u201c[a]t no time, from May 13, 1992, [when the parties last met and were unable to reach an agreement] until June 25, 1992 [when the school commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>tee notified the custodians of the termination of their employment] did the school committee or its representative raise the possibility that the thirty-nine custodians who were the subject of the up-coming hearing and add-on election would be laid-off,\u201d and that this was so even though the school committee was then working on the 1992 budget deficit, anticipating only level funding for fiscal year 1993. A representative of the school committee who attended the May 13 meeting explained that while he knew that consideration was being given to possible layoffs of custodians for fiscal year 1993 as part of the effort to meet the anticipated level funding for fiscal year 1993, he said nothing because he did not have any definite information about those plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">While the foregoing evidence demonstrated that the decision to discharge the custodians must have occurred sometime between May 13 and June 25, the commission found, there was \u201cno evidence that any intervening event triggered the school committee\u2019s action.\u201d In that context, the fact that the termination notice of Jun\u00e9 25 was only a few days before the add-on election was to be ordered (July 3), was an especially telling event, and the commission was justified in concluding, on the first phase of the case, that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence of the antiunion animus to sustain the union\u2019s prima facie case and thereby warrant a presumption of unlawful discrimination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">2. <em>The response of the school committee. </em>The commission then considered the school committee\u2019s proffered reason for the layoffs. The school committee asserted that the discharge of the custodians was motivated by budgetary decisions \u2014 a proffer of a facially lawful reason. It was the responsibility of the school committee then to \u201cproduce supporting facts indicating that . . . [the proffered] reason was actually a motive in the decision.\u201d <em>Trustees of Forbes Library, supra </em>at 566. As noted above, the \u201csupporting facts\u201d must include \u201ccred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ible evidence\u201d that the proffered reason was the real reason. <em>Wheelock College, </em>371 Mass. at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Having in mind that the school committee has the burden in this court of showing that the commission\u2019s decision was invalid, we look first to the school committee\u2019s recitation of its evidence of \u201csupporting facts\u201d offered in substantiation of the proffered reason for the layoff. The school committee\u2019s evidence<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> showed that beginning in February, 1992, the school committee and the superintendent began the budgetary process for the 1993 fiscal year which would begin July 1, 1992. In fiscal year 1992, the school department had exceeded its budget by $16 million, requiring an additional appropriation, the two-day furlough plan, and other reductions in expenditures. The target fiscal year 1993 budget received from city administration was the same as that originally received for the 1992 fiscal year, $378.5 million, and the directive to the school committee was that the fiscal year 1993 budget should be consistent with that level of appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">As part of the effort to achieve that result, the school committee, in February, 1992, first projected a cut in custodial staff of sixty-two positions for fiscal year 1993; in April, the projected cut rose to eighty-five, and then to eighty-seven in June, 1992. In July, 1992, the projected cut fell to sixty-six.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As noted earlier, the layoff notices for the thirty-nine custodians were sent June 25, 1992. No other custodians were laid off, nor was there any evidence that there were budget reductions in any other of the areas of custodial administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">From these facts, the school committee argues that \u201csimple math\u201d required the school committee to reduce its spending, and \u201c[wjhile a reduction of up to eighty-seven custodians was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>projected, the school committee massaged the budget such that only provisional and temporary custodians were laid off.\u201d In short, the school committee argues that it had sustained its stage two burden before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The commission\u2019s opinion acknowledged that the evidence just described established that the school committee faced a declining budget for custodial operations. The difficulty, the commission said, was the failure of the school committee to introduce evidence on \u201ccertain critical issues. . . [including] the identity of the decision-maker, the date or time frame in which the decision was made, the rationale for laying off only the custodians scheduled to vote in the upcoming elections when the . . . [draft budgets] documented the necessity of reductions in staff in other positions, and an explanation for the silence at the May 13th meeting concerning even the <em>possibility </em>of laying off any custodians, including all of the voters under consideration. Nor did the committee produce evidence demonstrating that layoffs or budget reductions occurred in other areas of the school system ... at the same time as the custodial layoffs.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">From these observations the commission concluded that while such evidence from the school committee could have established a nexus between the prevailing economic conditions and the layoffs, the failure to present such evidence left the school committee only with the argument that the commission \u201cshould infer a causal relationship between the fiscal constraints and the layoff from the fact that the two events occurred in the same time period,\u201d leaving the commission, in turn, with the speculation that the layoffs merely \u201chappened to coincide with the exact scope of the bargaining unit at issue.\u201d On that basis, the commission concluded that the school committee had failed to produce evidence rebutting the presumption of discrimination created by the union\u2019s prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The school committee argues that by analyzing the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>dence as it did, the commission misapplied the procedure mandated by <em>Trustees of Forbes Library, supra </em>at 566, namely, that the commission effectively, and erroneously, switched the burden of persuasion from the union to the school committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">It is most assuredly true that the school committee\u2019s burden at stage two was limited to articulating nondiscriminatory layoffs. Nevertheless, \u201c \u2018articulating\u2019 a reason in cases of this kind requires the employer to produce not only evidence of the reason for its action but also underlying facts in support of that reason.\u201d <em>Wheelock College, </em>371 Mass. at 136. Part of that burden on the employer is to \u201cproduce supporting facts indicating that this reason was actually a motive in the decision.\u201d <em>Trustees of Forbes Library, </em>384 Mass. at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The commission decided that this is precisely where the school committee\u2019s proof failed: it presented no direct evidence of the particular decision-making process \u2014 who the decision-maker was, and why or when the decision-maker made the layoff decision. See note 12, <em>supra. </em>Rather, the school committee depended entirely upon the argument that the commission should infer from circumstantial evidence that budgetary considerations were the motivation for the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Whether or not an inference \u2014 in this case, a decisive inference \u2014 is to be drawn depends on the connection between two facts \u201cin light of common experience.\u201d Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 5.8.6, at 243 (6th ed. 1994). Here the commission declined to draw the inference sought by the school committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In substance the commission concluded that the school committee\u2019s suggested reason of budgetary considerations, unaccompanied by evidence that it was in fact a reason for the decision, failed to satisfy the school committee\u2019s burden at stage two of the established analysis. The commission concluded, in other words, that the school committee\u2019s suggestions that the layoffs were the result of budgetary considerations, and that it was innocefttly coincidental that the layoffs affected only those custodians about to participate in a representation election, and occurred, without warning or discussion (contrary to recent practice) immediately before the election, was simply inadequate to rebut the union\u2019s prima facie case. That is not a switching of the burden of persuasion, as the school committee argues; it is an experienced calculation of whether the school committee carried its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>stage two burden of producing <em>credible </em>evidence in support of its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We must, in a case significantly devoid of direct evidence of the primary facts involved in this controversy, defer to the judgment of the commission because it is \u201cpresumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, [and its] findings within that field carry the authority of an expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect.\u201d <em>School Comm. of E. Brookfield </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 46, 52 (1983), quoting from <em>Universal Camera Corp., </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951). See also <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fedn. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>410 Mass. 890, 892 (1991) (\u201cWe generally accord considerable deference to the commission\u2019s disposition of a charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the commission is not shown to have been incorrect as matter of law in concluding that the school committee failed to meet its burden of producing some evidence that its motivation for the layoffs was budgetary. The commission\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Provisional and temporary custodians are not hired or appointed from a civil service list.
