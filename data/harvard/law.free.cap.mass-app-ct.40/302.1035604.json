See <em>DeCristofaro </em>v. <em>DeCristofaro, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 231, 239 n.10 (1987); <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Parrish, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 78, 79 (1991). Fortunately, however, in this case the precise meaning of the nebulous language is not essential to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">The plaintiff, Patricia Coumoyer (the wife), and the defendant, Gerald Coumoyer (the husband), were married in 1965 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>and divorced by a judgment nisi of the Middlesex Probate and Family Court on May 2, 1980. A separation agreement, dated June 6, 1979, was not to be \u201cmerged into the divorce judgment, but [would] survive the same and be thereafter forever binding upon the Husband and Wife. ...\u201d Any modification to the agreement was to be signed by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The agreement provided, among other things, that the wife have custody of their two daughters, and that the husband pay: (1) $500 a month to the wife, as alimony; (2) $250 a month to the wife as child support for their child Jennifer (who was born in 1968), until she attained age eighteen, or completed her formal education; and (3) $250 a month to the wife as child support for their seriously mentally retarded child, Mary (who was bom in 1966), until she attained age twenty-two, and if Mary continued to reside at home after attaining age twenty-two, the support would continue in the form of payment equal to the specific expenditures made each previous month on Mary\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In 1983, the wife, suffering from chronic alcoholism, was unable to care properly for the children, and the custody of the children was given to the husband, first at the Waltham District Court and later in the Probate Court. This unfortunate change in the wife\u2019s situation led directly to the first of two amendments to the agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">On August 8, 1984, both parties signed an amendment (Amendment I), giving sole legal and physical custody of Mary and Jennifer to the husband, that included the language, \u201cThis Amendment is without prejudice to either party seeking to modify any other terms or provisions of the Agreement dated June 6, 1979.\u201d The following paragraph stated, \u201cThis Amendment shall be submitted to the Middlesex Probate Court, incorporated and merged into a Judgment for Modification.\u201d In the same paragraph, crossed out, were words that would have made all terms of the 1979 agreement survive. This was initialed and signed by both parties and accepted by the court. Amendment I did not address alimony payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">At the time of Amendment I, the husband, remarried in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>1981, had one child by his second wife and was expecting another. Since the change in custody, the husband and his second wife had been complete caregivers for Mary, as well as for the other children, including Jennifer. The wife had no contact with either of her children from early 1985 until 1994, when she was granted limited visitation rights of eight hours a year with Mary.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On June 30, 1986, by temporary order of the Middlesex Probate Court, the husband\u2019s obligation to pay child support for both children to the wife was formally vacated, and the husband\u2019s obligation to continue alimony payments to the wife was reaffirmed. This order was followed by other temporary orders on July 16, 1986, and March 4, 1987, both of which directed the wife to pay child support payments to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">On July 1, 1987, the parties executed a second amendment (Amendment II) to the agreement. Amendment II, which provided that the wife pay the husband the sum of $260 a month for support and maintenance of Mary, and nothing for Jennifer, as she was not a full-time student, was also by its terms, \u201cincorporated and merged in a Judgment of Modification of the Judgment of Divorce.\u201d Amendment II also stated, \u201cExcept as amended herein, or as previously amended, [the parties] agree that the terms of their Separation Agreement dated June 6, 1979 shall remain in full force and effect.\u201d There was nothing in Amendment II specifying when, and if, child support payments by the wife to the husband should cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In September of 1988, Mary attained the age of twenty-two, and the wife ceased making child support payments. In December of the same year, the husband ceased making alimony payments to the wife. In January, 1993, the wife filed a complaint for contempt for unpaid alimony. The husband answered by filing both a cross complaint for contempt against the wife for failing to pay child support, and also a counterclaim for modification on his obligations to pay alimony. The husband also filed a petition for guardianship, requesting that he and his second wife become coguardians of Mary.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The judge, after finding countervailing equities, entered his findings of fact and conclusions of law on the cross complaints for contempt, equity complaint, counterclaim for modifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tian, and petition for guardianship. The judge dismissed both parties\u2019 complaints for contempt, dismissed the equity complaint, and entered a modification judgment on the counterclaim, which terminated the husband\u2019s obligation to pay alimony as of December, 1988. The court also indicated that an amendment to the existing guardianship would be allowed, adding the husband\u2019s second wife as coguardian of Mary. The wife now appeals from the probate judge\u2019s dismissal of her complaint for contempt and the modification judgment on counterclaim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><em>The status of the separation agreement. </em>The ramifications that stem from the survival or extinction of a separation agreement have been considered at length in numerous cases. See <em>DeCristofaro </em>v. <em>DeCristofaro, supra </em>at 235-236, and cases cited. See also <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>406 Mass. 236, 239-241 (1989); <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Parrish, supra </em>at 82-83. Thus, here, we rehearse them only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In short, \u201c[i]f an agreement does not survive a judgment of divorce, that is, if it is merged in the judgment in the technical sense, the agreement loses its identity; it retains no independent legal significance apart from the judgment.\u201d <em>DeCristofaro </em>v. <em>DeCristofaro, supra </em>at 235. Upon merging, modification of the judgment is governed by the usual rule, which requires a showing of a material change in circumstances. <em>Ibid. </em>However, if a validly entered separation agreement fixing interspousal support is incorporated in a divorce judgment, but survives the judgment, the agreement retains its force as an independent contract. In that event, the agreement should be specifically enforced, absent \u201csomething more than a material change of circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 236 n.7, or, as commonly denoted, \u201ccountervailing equities.\u201d <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Perry, supra </em>at 241. <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Parrish, supra </em>at 83. Under both standards, the petitioner must demonstrate that the change occurred since the entry of the last judgment. <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 368 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In deciphering whether the parties\u2019 separation agreement survives the judgment of divorce, it is the intent of the parties, inferred from the entire agreement, rather than the inclination of the judge, that controls. <em>DeCristofaro </em>v. <em>DeCristofaro, supra </em>at 237. <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Parrish, supra </em>at 83. Extrinsic evidence bearing upon the background and purpose of the parties may be considered in the construction of ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>contract language and in resolving uncertainties in applying the terms of the written contract to the subject matter. <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Parrish, supra </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In this case, however, no clear intent emerges from the record before us with respect to the two modification amendments, nor did the parties offer any extrinsic evidence that could aid the probate judge or us in contract interpretation. Thus, we are at a loss to discern the ultimate intent of the parties with regard to the status of the original agreement. However, the final status of that agreement does not make a difference to the outcome of this case because under either the \u201cmaterial change of circumstances\u201d or the \u201ccountervailing equities\u201d standard, the husband has made a showing sufficient to support a modification of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\"><em>Countervailing equities standard. </em>Generally, the more stringent modification standard, \u201ccountervailing equities,\u201d has been interpreted to include the situation where the party attempting to use the surviving agreement as a bar to modification has not complied with provisions of the agreement. <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>371 Mass. 433, 437 (1976). <em>Stansel </em>v. <em>Stansel, </em>385 Mass. 510, 515 (1982). Here, the party attempting to block the modification, the wife, has done exactly that \u2014 she has stopped making the agreed-upon child support payments for her child, Mary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In addition, numerous other conditions have arisen since the entry of the last judgment, that together meet the \u201csomething more\u201d standard, and serve to show why the wife\u2019s claim that the husband failed to meet the necessary criteria to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>modify the judgment is untenable. These conditions include: (1) the husband now has physical custody of Mary; (2) the husband\u2019s second wife has recently been appointed coguardian of Mary, cementing both her legal and emotional commitment to Mary; and (3) the wife is self-sustaining, earning $30,000 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Other factors, too, while present in some degree before the entry of the previous judgment, further strengthen the husband\u2019s claim. These factors include: (1) the original foundation upon which the agreement was built has shifted with the changed custodial arrangement; (2) the husband and his new family have assumed the responsibility of caring for Mary, who may need constant lifelong supervision and attention; (3) the wife owns the marital home, which has significant equity value with a relatively low outstanding mortgage; and (4) the husband\u2019s liabilities greatly exceed his assets, and he has present obligations to the Internal Revenue Service and the State Department of Revenue in excess of $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Under either standard of modification, the wife\u2019s arguments fail. Her contention that she, too, has undergone financial hardship in the past, a factor she claims should ensure her the receipt of alimony, is unpersuasive upon comparing her financial picture with that of her husband. Likewise, the wife\u2019s dual arguments that there were no substantial changes since the entry of the previous judgment, and that she was not under an obligation to pay child support for Mary, are to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>Material change standard. </em>The same factors that meet the \u201ccountervailing equities\u201d standard more easily meet the less rigorous \u201cmaterial change of circumstances\u201d standard. Thus, the probate judge was not clearly in error in finding that both countervailing equities and a material change of circumstances existed that warranted the modification of the judgment of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order dismissing the wife\u2019s complaint for contempt and the modification judgment on the husband\u2019s counterclaim terminating the husband\u2019s obligation to pay alimony are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\"> After the change in custody, the wife\u2019s alcoholism caused her to make a series of inappropriate telephone calls to the children and the husband. After the issuance of a restraining order, the wife\u2019s calls stopped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The wife argues that her obligation to pay child support in accordance with G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, ended when Mary turned twenty-two. The Supreme Judicial Court has noted, however, that the statute, specifically addressing the care and maintenance of \u201cminor\u201d children, does not necessarily reach to adult, incapacitated children. <em>Feinberg </em>v. <em>Diamant, </em>378 Mass. 131, 133-137 (1979) (the Probate Court did not have jurisdiction under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, to award support by a divorced parent for a mentally incapacitated adult child but instead acted pursuant to its general equity power to decide all matters relative to persons placed under guardianship). Moreover, both parties knew at the agreement\u2019s inception that Maty would need constant lifelong care, and thus, in the original agreement and both subsequent amendments, there is no provision explicitly addressing the cessation of child support for Maiy. Furthermore, Mary\u2019s incapacity existed at the time of her coming of age, a factor that many courts have found influential when determining that an incapacitated adult is unaffected by child support legislation. See <em>id. </em>at 134, and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
