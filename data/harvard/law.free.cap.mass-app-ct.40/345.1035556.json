L. c. 182, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is a legal entity apart from its shareholders. Here, the taxpayers\u2019 (the four trusts, collectively) appeal to the Appellate Tax Board (board) was denied because the board, without a hearing, decided that the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) had rightly treated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>trusts as separate taxable entities. From that determination and the denial of their applications for abatement of the taxes imposed, the taxpayers appeal. We reverse the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In summary, these are the salient facts (as stipulated by the parties) considered by the board. During the 1960s, Isadore Minkin and his wife, Gladys, acquired four properties, used as nursing homes, from which they earned substantial income. The four properties were placed in four separate business trusts. Until 1983, Gladys and Isadore each owned fifty per cent of the beneficial interest of each trust, represented by transferable shares. When Isadore died in 1983, Gladys inherited his shares and became one hundred per cent beneficial owner as well as sole trustee of the four trusts. When Isadora's estate was settled in 1984, the estate paid inheritance taxes on the fair market value of his fifty per cent interest in each trust. For purposes of valuation of Isadora\u2019s shares, the date of acquisition of the properties was used as a starting point.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Gladys liquidated the four trusts later in 1984. Each trust then filed Federal and State income tax returns, taking advantage of tax free distribution of corporate income under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 337 (1982). The commissioner challenged the treatment of the business trusts as corporations for purposes of State taxation, see G. L. c. 62, \u00a7\u00a7 !(/) and 8, and assessed additional taxes. As required by G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37 (1980), the taxpayers paid the taxes and filed timely applications for abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The taxpayers concede that, as the commissioner contends, the trusts are taxed as \u201cresident natural persons,\u201d not corporations, under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7\u00a7 1(/) and 8. However, they claim abatement of a portion of the additional taxes on the ground that Isadora\u2019s estate had already paid an inheritance tax on the appreciation of his fifty per cent interest calculated from the 1960s to 1984. Therefore, they argue, the trusts were entitled to a \u201cstepped-up\u201d cost basis for those assets that had been includable in Isadora\u2019s estate. Accordingly, the taxpayers claim that the board must use the fair market value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>of Isadore\u2019s fifty per cent interest in 1984 as a basis to establish the trusts\u2019 tax on the four properties upon liquidation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We are asked to make a determination on an issue that involves only a question of law. See <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner, of Rev., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 707, 712 (1992), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 416 Mass. 540 (1993); G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 5. We start with the proposition that \u201cthe basis of property in the hands of a person acquiring the property from a decedent . . . shall . . . be . . . the fair market value of the property at the date of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014(a)(1) (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gladys inherited her husband\u2019s one-half interest in the trusts upon his death. As both parties agree, she would have been entitled to the benefit of the stepped-up basis if, for example, she had sold the shares and become subject to taxation prior to liquidation. However, once the trusts were liquidated, the trusts, not Gladys, became subject to taxation on the proceeds of the trust property sold. The question remains, then, whether the trusts are sufficiently endowed with a legal personality apart from the shareholder that they are ineligible to benefit from the stepped-up basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Trusts with transferable shares are hybrid business organizations that are neither partnerships nor corporations. <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>282 Mass. 352, 357-358 (1933). A business trust is excused from some of the filings and formalities required by G. L. c. 156B, and it allows the organizers a measure of limited liability not available to partnerships. See G. L. c. 182, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. The legal treatment of trusts with transferable shares may differ depending upon the context in which an issue is raised, and on the facts of the particular case. For example, in some jurisdictions, including Massachusetts, a business trust is treated as a corporation for the purpose of bestowing limited liability on its shareholders. <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Hubbard, 252 </em>Mass. 37, 43 (1925). However, courts will look behind formal labels and make a case-by-case deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>mination of whether the organization is a \u201ctrue\u201d business trust with quasi corporate features. The test, called the \u201ccontrol test,\u201d is generally formulated as whether, under the declaration of trust, the trustees \u201cact as principals and are free from the control of the certificate holders.\u201d <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>219 Mass. 360, 365 (1914). Where the shareholders retain excessive control over the trustees, the business trust fails and shareholders will not be entitled to limited liability. <em>First Natl. Bank of New Bedford </em>v. <em>Chartier, </em>305 Mass. 316, 321 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">For purposes of Federal taxation, a business trust may be considered either an association taxable as a corporation, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a)(3) (1982), or a partnership, \u201cif, applying the principles set forth in [26 C.F.R.] \u00a7\u00a7 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3, the organization more nearly resembles an association or a partnership than a[n] [ordinary] trust.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7701-4(b) (1984). A business trust qualifies as an association if it possesses certain attributes, including associates, a business purpose, centralized management, limited liability, continuity of existence, and free transferability of interests. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7701-2(a)(l) (1984). <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Rev., </em>296 U.S. 344, 359 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In view of the foregoing authorities, we think the facts, as stipulated by the parties, require treating the trusts as if they had no separate legal identity apart from their sole trustee and beneficiary. We are handicapped by not having been furnished with the instruments establishing the trusts, details of the operations of the business, or other information that would shed light on either the \u201ccontrol test\u201d or the <em>Morrissey </em>test. However, from the undisputed fact that there is a parallel identity of trusteeship and ownership in connection with the holding of title to real estate by a trustee, it may be inferred that the trustee is an agent for her own convenience rather than a trustee in the more familiar fiduciary sense. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>215 Mass. 1, 6 (1913). We may conclude from the probate and tax contexts of the case that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 encompasses the case of a trustee who is trustee for herself in the conduct of business affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">We recognize that identity of ownership and trusteeship may only be a temporary situation, and that the trust declaration itself may not otherwise provide for control by the beneficiary(ies) over the trustee(s). However, other considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>further incline us to conclude that the trusts are entitled to the same step-up in cost basis which Gladys would have been entitled to under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Unlike a corporation, the transferable shares of a closely held business trust have no identity or value outside that of the assets of the trust. See <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>344 Mass. 494, 497 (1962).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As such, liquidation of the trusts amounts to essentially the same transaction as a sale of all the shares. Ownership of the trusts\u2019 assets is transferred, and the cash distribution which the shareholders receive upon liquidation is precisely equal to that which they would receive upon sale of their shares. It would be anomalous, then, to arrive at a different tax outcome for the former transaction than for the latter. If, as all parties agree, Gladys might advance to 1984 as a basis for transferring her shares, the trusts, which as discussed had become pass-through vehicles, were entitled to the same stepped-up basis upon liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is reversed and these matters are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-16\">For a general discussion of business trusts, see 3 Cavitch, Business Organizations \u00a7 43 (1992 ed.); Annot., Modern Status of the Massachusetts or Business Trust, 88 A.L.R. 3d 704 (1978); 13 Am. Jur. 2d Business Trusts (1964); 12A C.J.S. Business Trusts (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Since Gladys liquidated the trusts soon after the settlement of Isadore\u2019s estate, this would essentially mean that one-half of the trusts\u2019 properties would not be taxed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">General Laws c. 62, \u00a7 6F, incorporated the provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 into Massachusetts law.
