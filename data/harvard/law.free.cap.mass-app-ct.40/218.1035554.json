Vezina\u2019s father in 1928 founded the company later called the Vezina Insurance Agency, Inc. (hereafter sometimes called the Gardner Agency), a business with customers largely in the town of Gardner. Vezina worked there continuously after 1964, becoming its sole stockholder. By August, 1984, the Gardner Agency had incurred debts of perhaps $173,000. Vezina discussed the sale of the agency with a number of possible buyers, but the discussions made no headway because Vezina was interested in longtime employment by the agency after the sale, which these persons were loath to ensure. Finally Mahoney &amp; Wright<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> came forward with an offer \u201cto acquire the [Gardner Agency] and the services of its employee Herve Vezina, Jr.\u201d on terms outlined in a \u201cletter of agreement\u201d dated August 27, 1984, which was to be followed by more formal agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">2. Two contracts were entered into as of August 1, 1984.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By the first, a contract of sale between Mahoney &amp; Wright, buyer, and the agency and Vezina, called seller, the buyer acquired all the shares of the agency for a consideration consisting of the assumption by the buyer of the listed debts of the agency not to exceed $200,000 in amount.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Vezina covenanted, provided there was no breach by the buyer of its payment obligations, (i) never to solicit insurance business from the accounts being transferred in connection with the sale, and to keep all information concerning these accounts confidential, and (ii) during the period the seller was receiving payments in the form of payment of debts and for three years thereafter, not to engage in the business of insurance agent or broker within Gardner or a fifteen-mile verge except in conjunction with the buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The second contract, between Mahoney &amp; Wright and Vezina, employed him as vice president and manager-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>salesman of the sold agency at a salary amounting to $39,000 per annum plus certain \u201cdraws\u201d against commissions or production. The agreement ran from September 1, 1984, to December 31, 1986. It contemplated that, if production goals were met, the agency was profitable, and the debts as listed were being retired as planned, a new employment contract would be negotiated, and, further, the plaintiff would be eligible to purchase twenty percent of the stock of the agency corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">3. Although the employment contract mentioned an end date of December 31, 1986, the parties evidently continued under that arrangement through 1989, with Vezina serving throughout as manager-salesman of the agency. Vezina had done well in the job, so a new contract was entered into (as promised) after negotiations between Vezina and Norman Wright, an important officer of Mahoney &amp; Wright. (The negotiations centering in April, 1989, are mentioned at our point 6b below.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The contract, executed on December 12, 1989, \u201cmodified\u201d the terms of the 1984 employment contract. Vezina was to continue in his named capacities; his base salary was increased to $47,000 per year; and he was to participate in an incentive plan after a stated \u201cbase profit\u201d was attained by the business. The incentive plan read thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u201c6. a. Herve Vezina, Jr. shall participate in the following Incentive Plan with Mahoney &amp; Wright Insurance Agencies after a base profit of 20% of gross income is attained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">b. Herve Vezina shall receive 20% of the excess over the base profit due Mahoney &amp; Wright Corporation referred to in Paragraph 6(a) above in the form of a bonus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">c. 50% of the bonus referred to in Paragraph 6(b) for the previous year shall be considered a salary \u2018raise\u2019 and added to Herve Vezina\u2019s base salary for the following year. In the event that Herve Vezina, Jr. fails to generate the base profit referred to in Paragraph 6(a) for two years, Herve Vezina\u2019s salary shall be adjusted accordingly by rescinding the previous year\u2019s raise. In the event that Herve Vezina, Jr. fails to generate the base profit referred to in Paragraph 6(a) above for three years, Herve Vezina\u2019s salary shall be adjusted by rescinding the previous two years\u2019 raises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The agreement touched on the terms of the 1984 sale contract. It noted that Mahoney &amp; Wright owed Vezina a balance of about $16,000 after payments of corporate debts (see note 4, <em>supra)', </em>after adjustment to cover amounts owed by Vezina to Mahoney &amp; Wright, Vezina would be entitled to use the remainder to exercise an option to buy either stock or stock rights in Mahoney &amp; Wright or to take cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Finally, the agreement set out a right of first refusal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201c8. In the event that Vezina Insurance Agency, Inc. is offered for sale, Herve Vezina, Jr. shall have the right of first refusal to purchase following a refusal to purchase by Mahoney &amp; Wright Insurance Agency, Inc. its affiliates and principals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">4. We outline the events leading to Vezina\u2019s being out of work and out of the agency by November, 1990, and his not being provided with first refusal when the agency was sold to another, one Robert Weiss, in spring 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Weiss was a friend from college days of Norman Wright. Weiss had long been a football coach. After receiving a sum in settlement of a dispute (not described in our record) with his last employer, Weiss turned to Wright for assistance in gaining entree to the insurance field, in which he had no prior experience. Weiss in May, 1990, made an \u201cassets only\u201d purchase of the troubled David C. Wells Agency, Inc., in Fitchburg (hereafter the Fitchburg Agency). Around October, 1990, Weiss was introduced to Vezina as the prospective manager of the Gardner Agency. Vezina\u2019s reaction was that Weiss had insufficient experience and that he, Vezina, would not be able to serve under Weiss.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, on November 12, 1990, Weiss was installed by Norman Wright as manager of the agency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There had been hostility between Vezina and Weiss, which intensified.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Vezina considered that he had been wrongly ousted from his agreed post. Norman Wright for Mahoney &amp; Wright \u201cterminated\u201d the plaintiff by letter dated November 28, 1990. In fall 1990 it already appeared that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Weiss might buy the Gardner Agency. In spring 1992 Weiss did so, paying $60,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">After his severance from the Gardner Agency, Vezina engaged in activities in the insurance business that would violate the confidentiality and noncompetition covenants if those remained in force.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">5. The present action resulted from the consolidation of a Worcester Superior Court action by Vezina against Mahoney &amp; Wright and a Suffolk action by Mahoney &amp; Wright against Vezina. Avoiding procedural entanglements, we may say that the set-up of the consolidated action, tried to a jury in Suffolk Superior Court, was in outline as follows. Vezina sued Ma-honey &amp; Wright for breach of the first refusal and employment promises. Mahoney &amp; Wright retorted with three claims, in effect for breach of the plaintiffs negative covenants \u2014 claims for unfair competition, interference with contractual relationships, and trade name violations. The jury brought in verdicts for Vezina for $60,000 for breach of the first refusal provision and $87,479 for breach of the employment undertaking. The jury found against Mahoney &amp; Wright on its claims. These latter findings were responsive to the substance of the judge\u2019s instruction (not objected to) that if Mahoney &amp; Wright had violated their obligations, notably the employment undertaking, then Vezina would be released from his negative covenants. (We note in the margin a difficulty with inconsistent verdicts that was properly overcome.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">6. It remains to consider the support in the evidence for the verdicts on the first refusal and employment matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">a. First refusal. Comment is hardly necessary, for Mahoney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>&amp; Wright\u2019s motions at the close of Vezina\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence were addressed solely to the employment phase of the case, and its motion for judgment n.o.v. was accordingly also so limited. However, we add the following. The first refusal provision quoted above was understood by the parties to mean that the plaintiff could exercise this right if the agency was proposed to be sold to anyone other than Mahoney &amp; Wright or any of its affiliates or principals. Was Weiss an \u201caffiliate\u201d? The word was not defined in the 1989 contract, and the judge properly treated it as ambiguous and subject to elucidation from the circumstances. This conformed to the statement in <em>Robert Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 753-754 (1973): \u201cWhen the written agreement, as applied to the subject matter, is in any respect uncertain or equivocal in meaning, all the circumstances of the parties leading to its execution may be shown for the purpose of elucidating, but not of contradicting or changing its terms.\u201d When the jury, in the course of their deliberations, appreciated the ambiguity, they inquired of the judge, \u201cHow is the word \u2018affiliate\u2019 legally defined and customarily used in contracts?\u201d The judge answered (without objection), \u201cIn the context of this case there is no relevant legal definition of the term affiliate. And so, the question for you is: How was that term used, and what did the parties mean by it? . . . There is no binding legal definition relevant in the context of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The jury could consider that Weiss was manager of the Fitchburg and Gardner Agencies just before the sale of Gardner to him \u2014 not a relationship of affiliate to Mahoney &amp; Wright, or so a jury could well find. Further with respect to the Fitchburg Agency, it appears (although not with certainty<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>) that shares of the Fitchburg corporation were held by Richard Forrest, a Mahoney &amp; Wright man. In May, 1990, Weiss purchased \u201cassets only,\u201d of Fitchburg, not the shares, and indeed he contracted personally with the Fitch-burg company (represented by Forrest) for so-called consult<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ing services. The Fitchburg Agency did not appear in the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated tax returns of Ma-honey &amp; Wright but was treated separately (one reason assigned was that Mahoney &amp; Wright did not want the consolidated picture to be contaminated by this losing agency). Without going further afield, we would hold (had the issue been properly preserved) that the jury did not depart from reason in finding that Weiss was not an \u201caffiliate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">b. Employment. The agreement of December 12, 1989, on its face, raised but left unsettled and unclear whether it promised Vezina employment merely at will, so that he could be dismissed at whim, or employment for a definable period, so that dismissal could be only for cause (which was not shown on this record). The parties acquiesced in the admission in evidence of circumstances that might help the jury resolve the ambiguity .The contract did not fix express beginning and end dates of employment as the 1984 contract had done. But there could be other signs or indicia suggestive of a promised period of employment. Vezina, we know, was interested in a long-term connection (presumably as manager) with his Gardner Agency now owned by Mahoney &amp; Wright. A reading of the contract as being at will, subject to unilateral termination at any moment, would seem at odds with Vezina\u2019s desire for a steady job. So, too, it would seem inconsistent with the negative covenants Vezina had given: suppose a case where he was thrown out of work as manager within a short interval after December 12, 1989, and then had to face a prospect of compliance with his covenants which would in effect disable him to do independent insurance business.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The incentive plan quoted above according to its text was to run for three years. In the case of ordinary salesmen not otherwise assured work for a given period, the existence of a three-year bonus plan might not readily be construed as turning the relationship into firm employment for three years. But a different view could be taken with reason here, where an incentive plan had been tailored for a particular person who had served as manager of the business for five years and in fact had earlier been its owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Thus there was basis for a jury finding of promised employment for three years. There was also basis for a jury finding that Vezina was promised employment to age sixty-two (subject to conditions); and the judge charged, without objection, on both themes.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Vezina had a conversation with Norman Wright in late March or early April, 1989. He testified that Wright \u201csaid to me not to be concerned, that age 62, if I felt well, or longer, would be a proper age of employment for me ... an age to consider working up \u2018til\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Vezina was then forty-eight years old.) A letter from Wright to Vezina dated April 7, 1989, was intended to state the gist of the conversation. Wright wrote that he would be willing to come to an agreement to sell twenty percent of the Gardner Agency at January 1, 1989, value with payment in cash by July 1, 1989 (recall the provision in the 1984 employment contract about eligibility to purchase the twenty percent). He continued: \u201cIf the above offer is not acceptable [in fact there was no follow-up of this], I suggest we consider a package that includes first option for you to purchase the Gardner office and an incentive program that recognizes your efforts in the growth of the agency over the period of time the agency remains independent and your age 62.\u201d With perhaps some equivocation, Wright confirmed this picture in his testimony, adding there could be termination for cause.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Contending under its motion for judgment n.o.v. that the verdict on employment was unsupported in the evidence, Ma-honey &amp; Wright confronts the proposition that the verdict stands if \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff\u201d who garnered the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972). The judge correctly denied the motion. A comparable case is <em>Kravetz </em>v. <em>Merchants Distrib., Inc.., </em>387 Mass. 457 (1982). Kravetz, having owned and operated his tire company in Peabody for twenty-six years, sold it to Merchants, which had a tire business in Boston and in branches in surrounding places. The contract of sale also provided for Kravetz\u2019s employment as manager of the Peabody unit at stated salaries for several successive periods with bonus features. Kravetz subscribed to a five-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>noncompetition clause. He served as manager for fourteen months when Merchants \u201credefined\u201d his work to a position in the warehouse. Kravetz rejected the assignment as in effect an unjustified dismissal and sued for breach of contract. He won a jury verdict. Merchants contended that, as the contract had no fixed end date, it was as a matter of law a contract terminable at will, and the trial judge erred in denying a motion for judgment n.o.v. The court disagreed; it wrote, quoting from <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Royal Worcester Corset Co., </em>200 Mass. 1, 4 (1908), \u201c[wjhether there is a contract for services for a definite period of time . . . depends upon all the attendant conditions surrounding the agreement, as well as upon its terms, when the latter are not specific and clear,\u201d as was the case in the Kravetz contract. Thus it was proper for the jury to refer to \u201cthe nature of the employment, . . . the prior negotiation, [and] the situation of the parties,\u201d quoting from <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Hildreth &amp; Rogers, </em>332 Mass. 496, 498 (1955). \u201cReference in the [Kravetz] contract,\u201d the court said, \u201cto salary payable at a yearly rate, with distinct provisions concerning salary, commissions, profit sharing and bonuses and a provision for noncompetition for five years, set in the context of the sale of a business that Kravetz had managed for twenty-six years, would support a jury finding that the contract provided for employment for a definite time.\" 387 Mass, at 460. The court also held that the jury could have found that the change of duties was a violation of the employment agreement even if there was no reduction in pay or benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>Order denying posttrial motions affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">For purposes of the present appeal we need not mark a distinction between Mahoney &amp; Wright Insurance Agency, Inc., and Mahoney &amp; Wright Corporation, and we speak simply of \u201cMahoney &amp; Wright.\u201d Vezina sued Norman and Mary Jane Wright, personally, on a separate real property transaction which resulted in a judgment not appealed from.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">We describe the salient features of these and a later contract omitting other details.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\">If the debts were liquidated for less than $200,000, Vezina would be owed the balance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Norman Wright testified that he had put Weiss through a cycle of training, but there could be no doubt that he did not match Vezina.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Apparently he was paid no salary or a salary less than Vezina\u2019s.
