The settlement was approved by a Superior Court judge pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>The appellant, Transportation Insurance Co. (TIC),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is the workers\u2019 compensation insurer for the plaintiffs employer and, through it, for the plaintiff Ronald Hultin (Hultin), who on November 27, 1990, sustained serious and disabling injuries in the course of his employment while performing excavation work at a construction site. Hultin received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from TIC under G. L. c. 152. In addition, he and his wife, Dorothy, filed a third-party complaint seeking damages from Francis Harvey &amp; Sons, Inc. (Harvey), the entity that had hired Hultin\u2019s employer to perform the excavation work. Harvey agreed to settle the Hultins\u2019 claims by paying them $650,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Upon execution of the settlement agreement between Harvey and the Hultins, the Hultins filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, with the Superior Court for approval of the settlement. The proposed settlement allocated ninety percent of the total damages to the wife and ten percent to Hultin. TIC, a lien holder for benefits paid and, therefore, an interested party, appeared at the hearing on the petition and objected to the allocation formula.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge rejected the petition, stating that the allocation \u201cis unfair to the workers\u2019 compensation lien holder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In a revised petition for approval of the settlement, Harvey and the Hultins agreed to allocate seventy-nine percent of the proceeds to the wife and twenty-one percent to Hultin. After a second hearing, at which TIC again appeared and objected, the judge approved the petition upon finding that the revised allocation was fair and reasonable under the circumstances. The ensuing two judgments from which TIC now appeals award damages of $136,500 to Hultin and $513,500 to his wife. The judge held and the parties do not dispute that the entire amount allocated to Hultin will be applied to TIC\u2019s lien. TIC claims, however, that its lien against benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>amounting to $469,400 which it has already paid to Hultin should be satisfied <em>in full </em>out of the $650,000 settlement <em>before </em>any of the proceeds are allocated and that a portion of the remainder constitutes an excess recovery under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, which is subject to an offset against future benefits it may pay Hultin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> TIC also contends that a disproportionate amount of the total settlement was allocated to the wife\u2019s consortium claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">1. <em>TIC\u2019s reimbursement and offset rights. </em>General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 15, enables an injured employee such as Hultin, who has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, to seek damages against a negligent third party. \u201cThe sum recovered,\u201d however, \u201cshall be for the benefit of the insurer, unless such sum is greater than that paid by [the insurer] to the employee . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 39.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The cases have uniformly held that, when allocating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>proceeds from the settlement of a third-party tort action brought by an injured employee, an insurer\u2019s right to full reimbursement of benefits it has paid to the injured employee under G. L. c. 152, or to members of his family under \u00a7 31 or \u00a7 35A of G. L. c. 152, may not be compromised, abridged, or equitably allocated to others so as to deprive the insurer of its lien. <em>Eisner </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>381 Mass. 127, 132-133 (1980) (proceeds of third-party settlement allocated to decedent employee\u2019s widow and dependents, who had received death benefits from the insurer under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, were subject to reimbursement of insurer\u2019s lien under \u00a7 15). <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Beacon Sales Co., </em>416 Mass. 14, 17-18 (1993) (proceeds from settlement of employee\u2019s third-party action may not be equitably allocated by the judge between insurer and employee based on relative merits of employee\u2019s claim). <em>Bongiorno </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>417 Mass. 396, 402 (1994) (proceeds from legal malpractice action that stemmed from an injured employee\u2019s third-party tort claim were subject to insurer\u2019s lien under \u00a7 15). <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Trans-Lease Group, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 407-409 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The claims of the spouse of an injured employee for loss of consortium, however, are entirely independent and distinct from the personal injury claims of the employee. <em>Feltch </em>v. <em>General Rental Co., </em>383 Mass. 603, 607-608 (1981). Moreover, a spouse\u2019s loss of consortium is not a compensable injury under G. L. c. 152. <em>Bongiorno </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>417 Mass, at 404 n.9. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Trans-Lease Group, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 405 n.4, citing <em>Eisner </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., supra </em>at 133-134. Hence, TIC\u2019s lien for \u201cbenefits provided under this chapter [G. L. c. 152]\u201d does not extend to that portion of the settlement that has been allocated to a nonemployee spouse for loss of consortium. See <em>Bongiorno </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra; Walsh </em>v. <em>Telesector Resources Group, Inc, ante </em>227, 229 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">TIC urges us, nonetheless, to construe the 1991 amendment to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15 (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>to create, in essence, an absolute right for the insurer to have its lien rights satisfied out of the total available proceeds of a third-party tort action before any allocation has been made. As support, TIC relies on the cases previously cited in this opinion, all holding that, as between the insurer and the insured employee, the insurer\u2019s lien rights may not be compromised. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Those cases are distinguishable for the simple reason that the settlement proceeds were derived exclusively from the insured employee\u2019s third-party tort claims, and not from the spouse\u2019s loss of consortium claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">We also see nothing within the 1991 amendment that points us in the direction TIC would have us travel. Section 15, as amended, requires the court during a hearing on approval of a settlement, to \u201cinquire and make a finding as to the taking of evidence on the merits of the settlement, [and] on the fair allocation of amounts payable to the employee and the employee\u2019s spouse . . . and any other member of the employee\u2019s family.\u201d The 1991 amendment further requires that \u201cthe amount of excess [once the insurer\u2019s lien has been satisfied] that shall be subject to offset against any future payment of benefits. . . shall be determined at the time of such approval\u201d in light of \u201cthe fair allocation of amounts payable to and amongst family members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The 1991 amendment focuses in large part upon an insured employee\u2019s statutory excess recovery and on the insurer\u2019s possible corresponding rights of offset for future benefits against any such excess. Language inserted by that amendment requires that the insurer\u2019s rights to an offset from the statutory excess be determined at the time of the hearing, taking into consideration the \u201cfair allocation\u201d of damages between the injured employee and other family members. Finding nothing in the 1991 language that expands the insurer\u2019s basic lien rights at the expense of the consortium claim of a spouse, we hold that \u00a7 15 does not allow a workers\u2019 compensation insurer to satisfy its statutory lien against past benefits paid out of the total proceeds available in a third-party claim <em>prior </em>to allocation of those proceeds between the insured employee\u2019s personal injury claims and the spouse\u2019s loss of consortium claims. From this, it follows that TIC is entitled to reimbursement of its lien (after proportionate deductions described elsewhere in \u00a7 15 for attorney\u2019s fees and other costs) only from the twenty-one percent portion of the total recovery allocated to Hultin as the insured employee. Moreover, because its lien against benefits already paid remains partially unsatisfied and where the proposed split was a fair one in the circumstances (as we decide, <em>infra), </em>we can safely conclude \u2014 as did the judge \u2014 that TIC has no offset rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">2. <em>Fairness of the allocation. </em>At the hearing for approval of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the Hultins\u2019 settlement agreement, the judge was required to \u201cinquire and make a finding as to the taking of evidence on the merits of the settlement [and] on the fair allocation [of the proceeds].\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. In his memorandum of decision approving the settlement, the judge stated simply that the seventy-nine and twenty-one percent allocation was \u201cfair.\u201d We think that the better course \u2014 and one more in keeping with the statute\u2019s intent \u2014 would have been for the judge to have made subsidiary findings of fact which led him to his conclusion that the allocation was \u201cfair.\u201d Nevertheless, we accept the judge\u2019s over-all finding as it is not clearly erroneous and is supported by evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Attached to the judge\u2019s memorandum, and incorporated therein, is the Hultins\u2019 own memorandum in support of their petition for approval of the settlement. In it, the Hultins describe with particularity Hultin\u2019s and his wife\u2019s injuries. Hultin\u2019s injuries are well known to the parties, and, hence, we need not restate them. Suffice it to say, they are extensive and disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">For her part, the wife has suffered the substantial loss of her husband\u2019s companionship and consort. The couple now have little social life to speak of, whereas, before the accident, they enjoyed an active social life together. They no longer engage in marital relations, and the wife has not been able to return to work as she must provide day-to-day care for her husband, including preparing his meals and assisting him with bathing and dressing. In addition, the wife must now do all of the outside yard work around the couple\u2019s house, where previously that was largely her husband\u2019s domain. Because Huit\u00edn has little control over his hands or his grip, the wife must perform certain basic manual operations for him. As a result of extensive burning over much of Hultin\u2019s body, he is unable properly to adjust to normal room temperatures and, hence, will sometimes turn on the air conditioner in the winter, or the heat in summer, creating obvious and extreme discomfort for his wife. Over-all, Hultin\u2019s frustration, anger, frequent mood swings, and seeming loss of interest in life are difficult for his wife to live with.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The Hultins\u2019 memorandum also makes clear that Hultin\u2019s own conduct was a major contributing cause of the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>at the construction site.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That conduct \u2014 if considered by a jury \u2014 may well have proved fatal to Hultin\u2019s negligence claims against Harvey. Success of the wife\u2019s consortium claim, by contrast, depended solely upon a jury\u2019s finding Harvey causally negligent to some degree for Hultin\u2019s accident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hence, her claim would not necessarily have been defeated because of her husband\u2019s comparative negligence. See, e.g., <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Lalumiere, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 262 (1986). The judge explicitly recognized this point. He observed during the hearing, \u201cThe liability claim is speculative for both the husband and the wife, [but] [i]t\u2019s more speculative for the husband because of comparative negligence.\u201d Likewise, TIC admitted that Hultin\u2019s claim, because of the high degree of his comparative negligence, was weaker than the wife\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Given the statutory language, we conclude that the judge\u2019s inquiry into the \u201cmerits of the settlement\u201d allowed \u2014 indeed, required \u2014 him to consider and weigh the relative merits of the husband\u2019s and the wife\u2019s claims when deciding whether or not the recommended allocation was fair in the circumstances. The judge had before him the fixed and undisputed figure of $650,000 as total damages, and, hence, the sole issue at the hearing, essentially, was how that figure should be apportioned between the two plaintiffs in light of the comparative worth of their respective claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">TIC has argued with some force that the apportionment of damages amounts to a transparent effort by the settling parties to defeat its lien rights and to deny it any offset rights. \u2022 Again, this overlooks the extent to which the husband\u2019s claim was weakened by serious, if not fatal, questions of comparative negligence. In its reply brief, TIC buttresses its point that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the allocation formula \u2014 heavily favoring as it does the consortium plaintiff over the employee \u2014 is quite unusual. This may well be so. See, e.g., <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Telesector Resources Group, Inc., supra </em>at 229-230 (judge \u201caccepted as factual the \u2018belief of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that the \u2018normal expected consortium settlement is in the range of [twenty percent] of the amount set aside for the injured spouse\u2019 \u201d). The judge\u2019s over-all finding that the recommended allocation formula was fair in the circumstances was based on dual considerations, including the relative seriousness of the wife\u2019s own injuries \u2014 as distinct and apart from those of her husband \u2014 and the obvious infirmities of the husband\u2019s case. Given the unique circumstances here presented, that finding is amply supported by evidence in the record pertaining to the settlement and, therefore, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We wish, however, to reemphasize the strong policy underlying the workers\u2019 compensation statute against the sort of double recovery that is possible whenever settlement of a third-party claim involving an injury to an employee and the loss of consortium of a spouse or family member has been so structured as to insulate a significant portion of the proceeds from the insurer\u2019s statutory rights to full reimbursement of compensation benefits it has already paid, and to a possible offset against any excess recovery for future compensation benefits it may have to pay. See <em>DiMartino </em>v. <em>Quality Indus. Propane, Inc., </em>407 Mass. 171, 176-177 (1990). Absent countervailing factors such as are found here (or other equally unusual factors), we think that a settlement agreement of an employee\u2019s third-party tort action that has been submitted to the Superior Court for approval, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, wherein the bulk of the settlement proceeds has been allocated to the loss of consortium claims of the nonemployee spouse or family member, and not to the claims of the injured employee, must be eyed by the court with a healthy dose of skepticism. Moreover, in unusual cases such as this, explanatory or subsidiary findings become particularly critical on the question of \u201cfair allocation\u201d of settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\"> Although TIC was neither a plaintiff nor a defendant, \u201cGeneral Laws c. 152, \u00a7 15, expressly grants the workers\u2019 compensation insurer ... an opportunity to be heard concerning approval of a third-party settlement . . . [and itj, therefore, has sufficient interest to be entitled to appellate review.\u201d <em>DiMartino </em>v. <em>Quality Industrial Propane, Inc., </em>407 Mass. 171, 174 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\"> At the time of the settlement agreement, TIC had paid Hultin $469,400 in weekly incapacity and medical benefits.
