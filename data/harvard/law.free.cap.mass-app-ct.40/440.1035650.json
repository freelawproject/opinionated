App. Ct. 244 (1991), we affirmed the convictions for assault with intent to rape, armed assault in a dwelling, and armed burglary, but we remanded the case to the trial judge for an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 249. The motion had been denied without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">After five days of evidentiary hearings, the trial judge issued his memorandum summarizing and evaluating the evidence. He concluded that counsel\u2019s performance did not fall measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer, and that the defendant was not deprived of a substantial ground of defense. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>filed a timely appeal from the denial of his motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Returning, briefly, to the first appeal: our review of the supporting papers originally presented to the trial judge brought us to the conclusion that trial counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to interview and call material witnesses who were unrelated to the defendant raises a serious question as to the effectiveness of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247. We were also concerned that counsel, in his closing argument, had failed to argue the facts of the defendant\u2019s alibi which he had developed at trial through the defendant and members of his immediate family. That alibi depended in part on the physical injuries suffered by the defendant as the result of an automobile accident in which he was involved on May 8, 1988, eight days before the alleged attempted rape.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, the focus of his summation was an attack on the credibility of the alleged victim. <em>Id. </em>at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The evidentiary hearings before the judge (who was the trial judge) were devoted largely to the testimony of the persons who had not been called as witnesses at the earlier trial. Chief among the new witnesses was Linda K. Schaetske, a chiropractor who treated the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Schaetske first saw the defendant on May 12, 1988, four days before the al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>leged rape.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Her testimony, based upon her notes, included the fact that the defendant was on crutches, and that he \u201cwas experiencing neck and back pain due to an automobile accident\u201d on May 8. There was also pain in his right thigh. The defendant told Dr. Schaetske that he had received no treatment at the hospital, that he was using crutches, that the pain was sharp, that he could not walk on his right leg because he was unable to put any weight on his right leg or foot because of the pain. X-rays, ice packs, bedrest, and chiropractic treatments were recommended. The X-rays revealed \u201ca straining in the curvature of the neck . . . [which] usually indicates muscle spasms which often times can be the result of an injury. It also revealed subluxation[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] in his lower back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The defendant saw Dr. Schaetske again on May 13. Her note of that visit states that \u201cPatient to be out of work seven to ten days.\u201d (Apparently this referred to the recommendation of Dr. Schaetske.) She also recalled that the defendant \u201cseemed to be very uncomfortable and in pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Dr. Schaetske\u2019s next entry is May 16, the date of the assault. Her notes state that the defendant was \u201cno longer using crutches [but his] LB [lower back] and neck [were] sore.\u201d Dr. Schaetske\u2019s notes of May 18 state that the defendant continued to \u201ccomplain of neck, back and right leg pain.\u201d On May 19, she recorded, \u201cthe patient was walking better, but still complains of leg and neck pain.\u201d She recalled that the defendant was limping for about two weeks following the accident on May 8 \u2014 that she expected that he would have problems for \u201ca couple of weeks from the date of the accident\u201d; that is, until around May 22. It was for that reason that Dr. Schaetske concluded he ought to stay out of work during that period. The visits and treatments by Dr. Schaetske continued from June through September, 1988. The details of those later events need not be recorded here, other than to say that the pain and discomfort was largely episodic rather than continuous, and so too, his return to work was intermit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>tent. Finally, Dr. Schaetske recalled that the defendant used an interpreter, and she confirmed that she had never been contacted by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Additional, unrelated persons who testified at the motion hearing and who could have testified to the physical condition of the defendant at or about the time of the assault, but who were not called as witnesses, included (i) Anthony Caprera, defendant\u2019s attorney regarding the accident; he saw the defendant on May 19 and he observed that the defendant \u201cwas in obvious pain and he wasn\u2019t able to sit, and he stood\u201d; (ii) Paul Mason, the defendant\u2019s insurance agent who saw the defendant on May 9, the day after the accident; he observed that the defendant \u201cseemed to be bent over . . . and in pain ... He could [not] stand up too long\u201d; (iii) Lux Collaso and Jose Morales, each of whom lived in an apartment in the same three-family house as the Aviles family; following the accident, each one observed the defendant either using crutches or limping as he walked; (iv) Jose Rivera who was in the car with the defendant when the accident occurred; he observed that the defendant \u201cwas really hurt in the back. He could not walk. He was walking bending over like this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Of this group of potential witnesses, the failure to interview and call Dr. Schaetske was the most serious omission in the preparation and trial of the case, and the consequences were far-reaching. The strength of the defendant\u2019s evidence regarding the alleged disabling consequences of the car accident was, as we shall see, critical to the defendant\u2019s alibi. We now recapitulate what trial counsel achieved in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The only witnesses at the trial who testified to the defendant\u2019s physical condition and his whereabouts on May 16th, were the defendant, his father, his mother, and his thirteen year old sister. All of these witnesses testified through an interpreter. On the direct examination of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>family,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the trial attorney briefly attempted to establish that the defendant was on crutches continuously until around May 22, and that he was continuously at home from the date of the accident to around May 22. The father and mother stood firm on cross-examination, but the sister wavered under a cross-examination which focused on her uncertainty about dates and her uncertainty as to whether the defendant \u201ccould have gone out\u201d more than once between May 8 and May 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The direct examination of the defendant revealed, at the very least, a grossly inadequate preparation of the witness. Through his interpreter, the defendant said that a doctor at the hospital told him he had \u201cpinched nerves,\u201d but that another doctor told him \u201c[t]hat my neck and my hip were fractured,\u201d and that he should put \u201cice bags on them[,] to lie down, to rest.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During the period between May 10 and May 21 the defendant never went anywhere where he didn\u2019t need the crutches and during that period he went to see the doctor \u201cevery day.\u201d After a few more questions about his being photographed at the police station, his having gone to Puerto Rico on May 24 for a brief visit, and his arrest, the direct examination ended. The defendant was never asked whether he was involved in the assault of May 16; he was never asked to describe the course of his recovery from the automobile accident; and he was never asked his whereabouts on May 16. On cross-examination, he was asked the name of the doctor who told him that his neck and hip were fractured; the defendant testified, \u201cI don\u2019t remember her name because it\u2019s in English and I don\u2019t remember.\u201d The prosecutor asked the defendant where he was on the night of the 16th; the defendant said he was home watching the Spanish station on television. There was no redirect examination of the defendant, and there was no additional evidence presented by the defendant regarding his alibi, or the diagnosis, treatment, or symptoms of the defendant\u2019s alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>In his opening statement, trial counsel told the jury that the defendant\u2019s evidence \u201cwill be mainly, first of all, evidence of an alibi,\u201d and that on May 8, 1988, the defendant \u201cwas involved in an automobile accident \u2014 a very serious automobile accident in which he had a dislocated hip, there may have been fractures involved. As a result of that accident, he went to the hospital . . . and was given crutches. He had those crutches . . . from May 8th to May 21st.\u201d In his closing argument to the jury, trial counsel made no mention of the alibi, the automobile accident, or the defendant\u2019s alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In his memorandum following the evidentiary hearings on the motion for a new trial, the judge concluded that \u201cevidence relative to the crutches and the chiropractic treatment would have been contradicted at best, and would not have proved the defendant could not walk. . . . Even if the defendant had a leg injury it would not have been strong or convincing evidence that the defendant could not have committed the assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In our view, the judge misperceived the contribution that could have been made by Dr. Schaetske\u2019s testimony. The issue was not whether the defendant\u2019s physical condition prevented him from committing a violent assault, but whether his condition explained his continuous presence either in his house or in the immediate area surrounding the house, except for obvious events, such as the appointments with Dr. Schaetske. It was in that connection that the X-ray taken by Dr. Schaetske was of critical importance. Unlike the X-ray taken at the hospital (which, as the judge noted, indicated that the hip joints were normal), the X-ray taken by Dr. Schaetske showed, as we have said, a straining in the curvature of the neck and a subluxation, or dislocation, in his lower back. Those conditions \u2014 which called for a careful description and explanation by Dr. Schaetske \u2014 prompted her to conclude that the defendant\u2019s leg and neck pain, and his difficulty with walking, would continue for several weeks, that is, until around May 22. Only Dr. Schaetske was in the position of being able to substantiate, with the objective evidence of an X-ray, exactly what the physical condition of the defendant was following his accident, and only Dr. Schaetske could testify authoritatively regarding the alleged need of the defendant to remain at home, with ice packs and bedrest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>until around May 22. The omission of Dr. Schaetske\u2019s testimony and the testimony of Attorney Caprera, Paul Mason, Lux Collaso, Jose Morales, and Jose Rivera, all of whom saw the defendant\u2019s disabling condition after the accident, left the defendant, for no sound tactical reason or explanation, with the supporting testimony of only his father, mother, and sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Worse still, it left the defendant\u2019s own testimony \u2014 that he had suffered a fractured neck and hip which would be cured with ice packs and bedrest \u2014 in a posture that lacked credibility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is little wonder that trial counsel concluded that the \u201calleged alibi. . . had its problems,\u201d and, therefore, he jettisoned the alibi<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in favor of his attempt to persuade the jury in his closing argument that the victim told the story she did because \u201cshe\u2019s seeking attention, she could be having marital problems, she could be [szc] \u2014 mental problem. I don\u2019t know\u201d \u2014 this, in spite of the fact that he admitted at the hearing on the motion that he had no basis for these statements; it was merely his \u201cintuition.\u201d This attempt to persuade the jury that the alleged attempted rape never happened was overwhelmed by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that the police observed evidence of a forceful entry into the victim\u2019s house, and by the several, detailed fresh complaint statements given by the victim to the police, one immediately after the episode and the other the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">To these obvious difficulties, we add that at the time of the trial, which was about eight months after the assault, the defendant was twenty-three. He testified on cross-examination the he had arrived in the \u201cSouthbridge area\u201d five years earlier, and so between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three he had never been arrested or charged with any crime by the local police. Yet the record is barren of any evidence of the man\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>life or character,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> even from the members of his own family \u2014 a remarkable omission given the sudden, violent, and deliberately cruel assault upon the victim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When placed in the context of the victim\u2019s vulnerable identification of the defendant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 245, character evidence (if only from the defendant) could have had a substantial impact. The cumulative effect of these omissions regarding available witnesses and the defendant\u2019s history and character, as well as the errors in closing argument, probably deprived the defendant of his alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We conclude that the defendant has made a sufficient \u201cshowing that better work [by trial counsel] might have accomplished something material for the defense,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977), see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), and that the probable effect of counsel\u2019s inadequate preparation of this case for trial was prejudicial to the defendant by depriving him of a substantial ground of defense. <em>Id. </em>at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">There must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The progress of this case after the first appeal is noteworthy. The case was argued on June 6, 1991, and our decision was released on August 15, 1991. The hearings on the order of remand began January 28, 1993, and continued through February 3, 1993. Timely notice of appeal was filed on July 2, 1993. Notice of the assembly of the record, including transcripts of the hearings, was sent December 8, 1994, and the appeal was entered in this court on December 12, 1994. After four enlargements of time, the defendant\u2019s brief, originally due January 21, 1995, was filed on May 26, 1995. The Commonwealth\u2019s brief, originally due June 25, 1995, after six enlargements of time, was filed on February 8, 1996. The second appeal was argued in the Appeals Court on March 8, 1996. Meanwhile, the defendant, who was granted a stay of execution by a single justice of the Appeals Court, and then, on appeal, by a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, was unable to post the necessary bail, and has been continuously incarcerated since his conviction on Februaiy 25, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The defendant testified that while stopped at a traffic light, the rear end of his vehicle was hit by the vehicle behind him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">In our original opinion it appears that we erroneously referred to Dr. Richard F. Russell as the attending chiropractor when it fact there was merely a report that issued under his name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Prior to his first visit with Dr. Schaetske, the defendant had been seen twice at a local hospital, once on May 8 and once on May 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\">SubIuxation: \u201can incomplete luxation or dislocation; though a relationship is altered, contact between joint surfaces remain.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 1356 (5th Law. ed. 1982). The accompanying diagrams in the dictionary shows a subluxation to be a \u201cpartial contact of apposing articular surfaces,\u201d in contrast to \u201ca complete loss of contact.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Trial counsel testified that he attempted to reach Dr. Schaetske \u201calmost every day for a couple of weeks. When I had no luck I instructed my secretary to call her every day. And finally I told her to tell her if she didn\u2019t respond, I would summons her in and she would sit there all day until it got to her.\u201d Dr. Schaetske testified on cross-examination that she did not recall that any messages were left from the office of trial counsel; that there were two secretaries and an office manager in her office, and that to the best of her memory, she \u201cnever had any communications with an attorney\u2019s office relative to Anselmo Aviles.\u201d It appears from the text of the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision that he credited the testimony of Dr. Schaetske.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The direct examination of the father occupies five pages of the transcript; that of the mother occupies three and one-half pages; that of the thirteen year old sister, occupies three pages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">As noted earlier, the treatment of ice packs and bedrest was recommended by Dr. Schaetske, and presumably it was she to whom the defendant was referring as the second \u201cdoctor.\u201d Nothing in the record has been brought to our attention which indicates that the defendant\u2019s neck and hip were fractured \u2014 or that the remedy of ice packs and bedrest were the preferred treatments for those injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Obviously Dr. Schaetske\u2019s observation that the defendant was not using crutches when Dr. Schaetske saw him on May 16 contradicts the testimony of the family regarding the defendant\u2019s need for crutches continuously until around . May 22. But that suggests there was a failure of trial counsel to determine the facts and to confront the defendant and the family with those facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor commented on the absence of any reference to an alibi in the defendant\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">It was the prosecutor, on cross-examination, who brought out that during his five years in the Southbridge area he worked as \u201cmachine assistant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>31 Mass.
