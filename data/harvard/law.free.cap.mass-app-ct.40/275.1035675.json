L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s appeal from the order denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty brings up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>questions regarding the sufficiency of the evidence as well as questions regarding the interpretation of \u00a7 13B. He also challenges the judge\u2019s instructions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the jury could have found the following facts.The hostile relationship between the defendant and the victim, Marguerite Puleo (Puleo), began as the result of a dispute about a used car which Puleo\u2019s son Michael purchased from the defendant in 1982. The defendant was the proprietor of a used car dealership. As a result of that dispute, Puleo undertook her own investigation of the defendant and his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In March of 1992, Puleo, still pursuing her investigation of the defendant, contacted Lieutenant J. M. Roach of the Lynn police department, regarding information she had obtained about the defendant\u2019s business. By then, the Lynn police department had been investigating the defendant\u2019s business for three or four months. Puleo told Roach about some of the details of the defendant\u2019s used car business and that the business frequently changed its name while the same people continued to work there. The police confirmed that in excess of twenty different names were used for the business. Through an array of photographs, Puleo also identified Ralph Newton, James Vantresca, George Burt, Jr., Anthony Correo, and Thomas Largano as sales persons involved in the defendant\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Based in part on the information provided by Puleo, Roach obtained a search warrant for the premises at which the defendant conducted his business. Puleo was present during the execution of the search warrant on or about July 5, 1992. She pointed out the location of the dealer plates and various files.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">As a result of the search, and prior to October 7, 1992, po-. lice charged the defendant with altering a motor vehicle identification number. Complaints were also issued at or about the same time against the five individuals previously identified by Puleo. The charges against these men included larceny, receiving stolen property, defrauding an insurer, and changing vehicle identification numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">On October 7, 1992, while the police investigation was ongoing and the criminal cases against the defendant and the other five men were pending, Puleo confronted the defendant in front of the Lynn District Courthouse. She said, \u201cBurt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>George Burt?\u201d \u201cI thought you were in jail.\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cWhere\u2019s your husband?\u201d Puleo said that her husband was not there, at which point the defendant asked Puleo whether she was afraid of him. She said, \u201cNo.\u201d The defendant then asked, \u201cHow old is Michael? He\u2019s going to be 36? Do you think he\u2019ll make it to be 36?\u201d After asking again whether she was afraid of him (Puleo reiterated that she was not), the defendant stated, \u201cAnd you have a daughter Elizabeth? She has Elizabeth S. [Puleo] Insurance in Marblehead? I know what kind of car she drives. Are you afraid of me now?\u201d Again Puleo said she was not afraid. Finally, according to Puleo, the defendant moved closer, at which point she asked someone nearby to get a court officer. The defendant then stated, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask your friends at City Hall to come now? I\u2019m gonna put your son away.\u201d At that point Puleo ran down the courthouse steps and into her car. Two days later, Puleo reported the incident to the Lynn police.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The defendant\u2019s words were sufficient to constitute an \u201cendeavor\u201d to influence Puleo by means of \u201cthreats\u201d or \u201cintimidation.\u201d Nevertheless, the defendant argues that Puleo was not a \u201cwitness\u201d within the meaning of the statute because she admitted that she had no direct knowledge of the charges against the defendant or against the five men associated with the defendant. The defendant also argues, regarding the second branch of \u00a7 13B (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>that \u201cPuleo was [not] a person \u2018furnishing information\u2019 to a criminal investigator <em>on October 7, 1992 . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">A purpose of the statute is the protection of participants in judicial proceedings and thereby the protection of the public interest in the due administration of justice. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>604 F.2d 972, 974 (5th Cir. 1979) (construing a similar Federal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 [1994]). See also <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 323, 333 (1966) (the use of the word \u201cendeavor\u201d in \u00a7 1503 \u201cgot rid of the technicalities which might be urged as besetting the word \u2018attempt,\u2019 and it describes any effort or essay to accomplish the evil purpose that the section was enacted to prevent . . .\u201d). To the same effect is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 55, 59-60 (1989). Thus the statute is available \u201cso long as there is a <em>possibility </em>that the target of the defendant\u2019s activities will be called upon to testify in an official proceeding\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>836 F.2d 1125, 1128 (8th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Cir. 1988). The jury could have credited Roach\u2019s testimony that Puleo was a potential witness regarding the numerous names used in the defendant\u2019s business. Further, Puleo received a \u201cyellow slip of paper\u201d to appear at the defendant\u2019s trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and she in fact appeared. The information possessed by a potential witness need not bear directly on an essential element of the crime (as the defendant argues); it need only be, as here, relevant and material evidence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tedesco, </em>635 F.2d 902, 907 (1st Cir. 1980). The fact that Puleo never testified is of no importance. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shannon, supra </em>at 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We also reject the argument that because Puleo was not furnishing information to the police on the day she allegedly was intimidated, the statute is not satisfied in that regard. The statute is \u201caimed at deterring interference with <em>future </em>communication of information\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>United States, </em>v. <em>San Martin, </em>515 F.2d 317, 320 (5th Cir. 1975) (construing similar provisions appearing in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1510). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>649 F.2d 599, 603 (8th Cir. 1981) (same). Here, the police investigation was ongoing on the date of the alleged intimidation. Based on Puleo\u2019s prior assistance to the police, there was an adequate basis for the jury to infer that additional information regarding the pending criminal complaints against the defendant and his five salesmen would be forthcoming from Puleo in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant violated both the \u201cwitness\u201d branch of \u00a7 13B, as well as the \u201cfurnishing information\u201d branch of the same section.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">We have also reviewed the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. There was no error in the instruction that the word \u201cwitness\u201d included \u201cpotential witness.\u201d See <em>Shannon, supra </em>at 1128. See also <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>400 F.2d 306, 307 (5th Cir. 1968); <em>Tedesco, supra </em>at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-14\">In pertinent part, \u00a7 13B, as amended through St. 1990, c. 369, states: \u201cWhoever, directly or indirectly, willfully endeavors by means of . . . intimidation, force or threats of force to influence, impede, obstruct, delay or otherwise interfere [1] with any witness ... in any stage of a trial or other criminal proceeding or [2] with any person furnishing information to a criminal investigator relating to a violation of a criminal statute of the commonwealth . . . shall be punished . . .\u201d (bracketed numbers added for later reference).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The jury could have inferred from this, and from Roach\u2019s testimony that Puleo was a potential witness, that Puleo received a summons to appear at the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The judge instructed the jury that unanimity among the six jurors was required to convict either as to the \u201cwitness\u201d branch of \u00a7 13B, or as to the \u201cfurnishing information\u201d branch of that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
