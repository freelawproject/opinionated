By the time the judge had done with the witness, it was likely he left the impression with the jury that he thought the witness a liar. It was error on the part of the judge to have conducted the examination because an insufficient basis had been established for it and because the examination exceeded what are generally the limits for judicial intervention in the questioning of witnesses. In the context of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>entire record of the trial, we do not think the error was harmless and we, therefore, reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction of rape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Bryan J. Hassey, the defendant, was charged with the rape of the victim, whom we shall call Myra, in her home on the morning of November 7, 1992. Hassey\u2019s defense was that their sexual encounter was consensual and affectionate, consistent with previous meetings. Myra\u2019s version of the events was that the only consistency was that the defendant had already once \u2014 during the previous August \u2014 forced himself on her, although she had chosen on that occasion not to lodge a complaint against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s case rested primarily on: (a) the testimony of Myra and (b) the observations and fresh complaint testimony of (i) the police officer who responded to a call from Myra, (ii) a nurse on the rape crisis team at South Shore Hospital who treated Myra, and (iii) a rape investigator for the Hull police department. There was physical evidence such as a torn nightshirt and photographs of a seriously disordered bathroom (that was the room in which the sexual act took place) from which the jury could infer that what had occurred between Myra and Hassey had been tumultuous. In response, the defense paraded a series of witnesses who testified to a cordial relationship between the complainant and the defendant. Hassey took the stand in his own behalf to so state and to meet the torn clothing and damaged bathroom evidence with the explanation that it reflected his and Myra\u2019s exuberant passion. Several defense witnesses testified as well to expressions of ire with Hassey on Myra\u2019s part because he had ruined the engine in her car. He had promised to pay for repairs but had failed as persistently to produce any money as he had vowed so to do. The defense strategy was to establish that Myra harbored a bias against Hassey for that reason and to have the jury draw the inference that Myra had contrived the charge of rape as an act of vengeance.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">One of the witnesses called to so testify was Leonard Spurrell, who had worked with both Myra and Hassey and was a friend of Hassey\u2019s of twelve years\u2019 standing. On direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>examination, Spurrell claimed personal knowledge of multiple acts of sexual intercourse between Myra and Hassey and that Myra had told him, Spurrell, that because she had not received any money from him \u201cshe would try to get him any way possible she could.\u201d Cross-examination, redirect examination, and recross-examination that followed was devoted to probing inconsistencies or papering them over, depending on whether the prosecutor or defense counsel was the interrogator. When those rounds of questioning had concluded, the trial judge, over the objection of defense counsel, proceeded on a line of inquiry that the prosecutor had not followed. To convey the flavor of the judge\u2019s examination of Spurrell, we set it out in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\">The Court: \u201cI have a couple of questions, Mr. Spurrell.

App. Ct. 286, 292-293 (1986). In exercising their duty to direct and clarify the evidence, judges may not, however, weigh in, or appear to do so, on one side or the other; the judge must avoid the appearance of partisanship. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, supra </em>at 422. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>371 Mass. 40, 45 (1976). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marangiello, </em>410 Mass. 452, 461 (1991). The rule is one of reason. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra </em>at 45. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, supra </em>at 416. \u201c[Ejxtensive examination of witnesses by the judge during trial is not to be encouraged. [Citation omitted.] The possibility of prejudice arises especially in a criminal case where the judge\u2019s questions may unintentionally have the effect of impeaching the defendant or defense witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>380 Mass. 840, 847 (1980). For ostentatious stepping over the line, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>376 Mass. 867, 867-871 (1978), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ragonesi, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 320, 323-326 and Appendix at 327 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">In comparison with the judicial forays in <em>Sneed </em>and <em>Ragonesi, </em>the judge\u2019s examination of Spurrell was less egregious. Yet it went beyond clarification or straightening out of seemingly errant testimony. The advocates for both sides had finished with what they wanted to ask of Spurrell and the evidence he gave was not confusing. The prosecutor had probed inconsistencies and had done what he could to cast doubt on the trustworthiness of Spurrell\u2019s testimony. The judge\u2019s questioning could be perceived as having the effect of destroying Spurrell\u2019s credibility in the minds of the jurors, producing the very result that the <em>Fitzgerald </em>opinion says ought to be particularly avoided. That it was the judge who may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>caused Spurrell to unravel as a credible witness made that unravelling doubly effective because jurors are likely to pick up signs from the judge about what the judge thinks of the credibility of a witness or party. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanscomb, </em>367 Mass. 726, 732 (1975)(Hennessey, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Sometimes a judge who examines a witness at greater length and more sharply than is prudent can neutralize the damaging effects by instructing the jury that they should draw no inferences, let alone conclusions, from the circumstance that it was the judge who asked certain questions of a witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, </em>369 Mass, at 423; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>371 Mass, at 45. Here, the judge said nothing in his instructions that dulled the sting of his examination of Spurrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Not only was the judge\u2019s examination of the defense witness a too partisan entry on the side of the prosecution, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marzano, </em>149 F.2d 923, 926 (2d Cir. 1945), but the basis for the inquiry of Spurrell was mistaken because the foundation required by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 288 (1981), was not present, or at least had not been established. Although a citizen is not legally bound to make exculpatory evidence known to the police or district attorney, <em>id. </em>at 295, and <em>United States </em>v. <em>New York Tel. Co., </em>434 U.S. 159, 175-176 n.24 (1977), there are circumstances in which the failure to communicate evidence to the police \u2014 an alibi is a good example \u2014 may cast doubt on the credibility of the witness who produces that exculpatory evidence for the first time at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 295-296.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">We said in <em>Brown </em>that the \u201cfailure to go to the authorities\u201d line of inquiry must be handled with caution and we laid down guidelines for doing so. Those guidelines require that the prosecutor first establish: 1) that the witness knew of the pending charges in sufficient detail to realize that he possessed exculpatory information; 2) that the witness had reason to make the information available; 3) that the witness was familiar with the means of reporting the exculpatory information; and 4) that the defendant or the defendant\u2019s lawyer had not asked the witness to refrain from reporting the exculpatory information to the authorities. Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berth, </em>385 Mass. 790-791 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egerton, </em>396 Mass. 499, 507 (1986). The judge\u2019s questions did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>solicit information bearing on points (3) and (4), and it is far from clear that Spurrell would understand that he possessed exculpatory information. The significance of bias as a defense tool is not necessarily common knowledge, and Spurrell may well have neither appreciated the significance of the grievance to which he said Myra had given voice nor known what do do with that information. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bassett, 21 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 713, 716-717 (1986); Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 179, 181-182 (1993). The point of the judge\u2019s examination of Spurrell was not lost on the prosecutor. Thereafter he routinely inquired of defense witnesses why they had not previously spoken to the authorities about the information to which they had just testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">In his summation, the prosecutor said nothing of Spurrell or any other witness not having gone to the authorities before. One needs to ask if, in the end, the judge\u2019s inadequately founded and too partisan questioning may have been harmless. We do not think so. As so often in the trial of a charge of rape, there was a contest of credibility between accuser and accused. No other witnesses observed the event inside Myra\u2019s residence. By damaging the credibility of a moderately important witness for the defense (the jury might not be likely, for example, to give much weight to the exculpatory testimony of Hassey\u2019s mother), the credibility of the over-all defense would have sustained damage. This problem became more acute later in the case when Myra, recalled to the stand, testified that Spurrell had told her that the man who employed him and her was \u201cpaying him money to testify.\u201d To the degree the judge had been successful in undoing Spurrell\u2019s credibility in the eyes of the jurors, the credibility of Myra was reciprocally enhanced. Although the prosecution\u2019s case was substantial, we are unwilling to speculate that the jury were not influenced by the judge\u2019s examination of Spurrell and we conclude that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Should there be a retrial, Myra ought not to be permitted to testify about what her guest Gary Stewart said after she complained to him about Hassey\u2019s forcing himself on her in August. That was hearsay which fit into no category of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AmS\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\"> The judge on June 30, 1994, imposed a sentence of twenty years in M.C.I., Concord. The defendant would be eligible for parole after two years of incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
