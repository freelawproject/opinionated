The employee was denied benefits on the basis of a determination that a lump sum payment to him by his former employer, Digital Equipment Corporation (Digital), was severance pay within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 l(r)(3). Concluding that the lump sum payment was made to the employee in exchange for his release of Digital from any and all claims arising out of his employment and not as severance pay, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>1. <em>Facts. </em>We recite the facts as found by DET\u2019s review examiner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 21, 1993, the employee, a senior software engineer who had been working for Digital for twelve years, was notified that he was being laid off from his employment as of June 25, 1993. Digital had been reducing its work force for several years, and the employee had no expectation of being recalled to work by Digital in the future. Because of the abruptness of the termination notice, Digital continued to pay the employee and provide him with full benefits for seven weeks, that is, up until his termination date of August 13, 1993.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">On July 2, 1993, the employee signed an agreement which Digital had prepared and labelled as a \u201cTRANSITION FINANCIAL SUPPORT AGREEMENT.\u201d Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, the employee was to receive a lump sum payment in the amount of 12.39 weeks of pay and he would be allowed to continue his participation in Digital\u2019s health, life, and dental benefits plan for the twelve-week period of August 13, 1993, through November 6, 1993. The employee was not required to perform any services for Digital after June 25, 1993, nor was he required to repay Digital any part of the lump sum payment if he were to find employment prior to November 6, 1993. Additionally, the employee could avail himself, off premises, of \u201coutplacement services,\u201d which Digital would provide for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Digital did not participate in the DET proceedings. The employee gave a copy of the agreement to the review examiner and testified that had he not signed the agreement he would not have received the lump sum payment nor would Digital have allowed him to participate in its medical and dental plans or to use its \u201coutplacement services.\u201d The employee stated that as he read the agreement, he sold an asset, his right to \u201csue Digital for a lot of things,\u201d including any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>discrimination in separating him from his employment. The agreement recites the rights released by the employee as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201cEmployee on behalf of Employee and Successors accepts the foregoing in full and complete satisfaction of any and all claims of any kind or description that Employee and Successors have, or may have had, or may have against Digital, or its officers, directors, agents, successors, assigns or employees to the date of the execution of this Agreement and releases Digital, and its officers, directors, agents, successors, assigns or employees from any liability for such claims. The effect of Employee\u2019s signing this agreement:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axp\">a. Is to prevent Employee from suing Digital, its officers, directors, agents, successors or assigns under:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u2022 any employment relations laws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u2022 any state, federal or local law, regulation or executive order, prohibiting discrimination on account of age, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, handicap or veterans status;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">\u2022 the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended to the date of this Agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">\u2022 common law, including without limitation, claims arising from any contract or tort law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">\u2022 any law regulating the provision of employee benefits, or under any Digital benefit plan except as noted below;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">\u2022 any public policy, law or equity or claims for expenses, attorney\u2019s fees, or other monetary or equitable relief or any other claim arising out, or related to Employee\u2019s employment with, or termination from Digital;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">\u2022 any contract claimed as a result of a Digital policy, including but not limited to Digital\u2019s Relocation policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\">\u2022 any other claim arising out of Employee\u2019s employment with Digital or termination of employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>with Digital from his or her first employment to the date of this Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Because the amount of the lump sum payment was based upon the employee\u2019s years of service with Digital and because the employee would continue to receive medical and dental insurance during the twelve-week period in issue, the review examiner concluded that the employee had received a \u201cform of severance/dismissal pay,\u201d that is, he had received remuneration which disqualified him from receiving unemployment benefits for the twelve-week period of August 13 through November 6, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7 l(r)(3), as amended through St. 1992, c. 118, \u00a7 4, and as here pertinent, defines \u201cremuneration\u201d as \u201cany consideration, whether paid directly or indirectly, including salaries, commissions and bonuses . . . received by an individual . . . (3) as termination, severance or dismissal pay, or as payment in lieu of dismissal notice . . . or as payment for vacation allowance. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Although the term \u201cseverance payments\u201d is not defined by c. 151 A, it has been discussed in several decisions in respect to its inclusion within or exclusion from the Legislature\u2019s various amendments to the definition of remuneration in \u00a7 l(r)(3). See <em>Kalen </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Sec., </em>334 Mass. 503, 504-505 (1956); <em>Bolta Prods. Div. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>356 Mass. 684, 688-690 &amp; n.3(b) (1970); <em>Itek Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>398 Mass. 682, 683-685 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">These cases discuss the many characteristics of severance pay which resemble the present lump sum payment. As considered in <em>Bolta Prods. Div. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>356 Mass. at 689-690, the usual attributes of severance payments are: \u201cThe total amount paid was directly related to [the employee\u2019s] years of service. It was not subject to limitation or repayment if he obtained other employment before the expiration of three months from [the employer\u2019s] termination of his employment. He was permanently severed from his employment . . . with no provision for being called back or rehired. All of the benefits of his employment terminated with the possible exception of vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>pension rights.\u201d Compare <em>Itek Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>398 Mass, at 685. There the court concluded that certain payments made to employees, at a time when the definition of remuneration did not include severance pay (see \u00a7 1 [r][3], as amended by St. 1976, c. 473, \u00a7 3), were paid \u201cas a salary continuation plan to employees on inactive status.\u201d The court distinguished the payments from severance pay on the basis that the employees \u201ccontinued to receive the full array of benefits that the company provided to active employees, . . . [T]here was no separation from . . . [the company] during the plan\u2019s operation . . . And the salary continuation would cease if the employees were to find other employment within a certain time span.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Although mindful of the similarities between severance pay and Digital\u2019s lump sum payment to the employee, we think the fact that the employee would receive nothing unless he signed the broad release of all claims sufficiently significant to remove the payment from the definition of remuneration, and we accept the reasoning found in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Digital Equipment Corp., </em>868 P.2d 1170 (Colo. App. 1994), a case involving what appears to be an identical or almost identical agreement as well as substantially similar statutory provisions concerning unemployment benefits and severance pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">While noting the features common to both the lump sum payment in issue and severance pay, the Colorado court found the purpose of the payment worthy of consideration. The court determined: \u201c[T]he written agreement between the parties demonstrates that the employer\u2019s primary purpose in making a lump sum payment was, as the referee found, <em>not </em>to provide a salary substitute to secure the employee\u2019s economic well-being during any period of unemployment. While there is self-serving language to this effect in the agreement that was unilaterally prepared by the employer, had this been the employer\u2019s primary purpose for the payment, it would not have been conditioned on the employee\u2019s execution of the written release\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Id. </em>at 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We find support for our acceptance of the District Court judge\u2019s determination of the purpose of the agreement in the fact that the agreement before us also provides that the employee was not to receive the lump sum payment until after the expiration of a waiting period during which he could revoke his acceptance of the terms. Further, we too attach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>little significance to the employer\u2019s characterization of the agreement as one for \u201ctransition financial support.\u201d See <em>Bolta Prods. Div. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>356 Mass. at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Having determined the primary purpose of the agreement, the Colorado court next noted, at 868 P.2d at 1173, that \u201c[a]n employee has no obligation, as a part of the services he or she is to provide to the employer, to renounce legal rights possessed by him or her. See, e.g., [Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 8-4-110 (1986 Repl.Vol. 3B)].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the employee\u2019s consideration for the agreement was not services but the release of any claim that he might have against \u201cthe employer itself or against described third parties,\u201d or, as provided in the agreement before us, its officers, directors, agents, successors, assigns or employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">As we read <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Digital Equipment Corp., </em>868 P.2d at 1173, the decision is limited to the facts and the terms of the agreement there presented. On that same basis, we agree with the court\u2019s conclusion: \u201cUnder these circumstances, therefore, in which the payment is not made in return for services previously rendered by the terminated employee, but is in return for a release of claims, and in which the primary purpose of such payment is to obtain such release, we conclude that the payment is not a \u2018severance allowance\u2019 within the meaning of [c. 151 A, \u00a7 1 (r)(3)].\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\">This case involves a question of law, namely, the effect of an agreement between Digital and the employee upon the latter\u2019s right to unemployment benefits, and the matter is subject to de nova judicial review. See <em>Itek Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Sec., </em>398 Mass. 682, 684 (1986); <em>Ruzicka </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 217 n.4 (1994), quoting from <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. 593, 595 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">There is no issue before us concerning whether these payments were made in lieu of notice and, therefore, remuneration under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 1 (r)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The employee did not surrender any right to entitlements that he might have under benefit plans unrelated to downsizing, such as \u201cDigital\u2019s Pension and SAVE Plans,\u201d and any workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 36, make provision comparable to Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 8-4-110 (1986 Repl.Vol. 3B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
