Answer, a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Wilkinson, </em>J., it appeared that, within thirty days after receiving the injury, the plaintiff served a notice in writing upon the defendant, in which it was stated that on a day named \u201c he was thrown to the ground on Pleasant Street in Fall River, and severely injured in consequence of his foot being caught by a gas pipe marked 6 F. R. Gas Co.,\u2019 which projected two inches above the sidewalk on said Pleasant Street.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\">It also appeared that Pleasant Street is one of the principal streets in Fall River, and is about two miles in length; and that at the place of the injury the street is wrought with sidewalk and curbstone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-9\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that the plaintiff could not recover, for the reason that the notice given by him to the defendant was not sufficient, under the St. of 1877, <em>c. </em>234. The judge declined so to rule; and instructed the jury that it was a question of fact for them, whether or not the plaintiff had given the defendant sufficient notice. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-10\"><em>M. Reed, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-11\"><em>Gf. Marston \u00a7\u2022 J. W. Cummings, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b135-12\">Lord, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALO\">The notice to the city in this case was so like that of <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>128 Mass. 521, that it must necessarily be governed by the decision in that case. The statute requires the notice to state the time, place and cause of the injury. The notice in this case states the place to be \u201c the sidewalk on Pleasant Street.\u201d Pleasant Street is stated in the bill of exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>to be plie of the principal streets of the city, and is about two miles in length. To say that the defect, whether it be gas pipe, or excavation, or obstruction, is in Pleasant Street, is not, within the meaning of the statute, a statement of the place; and the presiding judge should have so ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
