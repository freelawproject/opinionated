It does not set out any offence known to the laws of this Commonwealth; employing a woman or minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>without posting a notice not being a penal offence under the laws of this Commonwealth. 2. It does not aver that Julia Hurley was employed in laboring in a manufacturing establishment belonging to the defendant, or that said defendant was a manufacturing establishment.\" This motion was overruled. The defendant was then tried and found guilty, and appealed to the Superior Court. In that court the motion was seasonably renewed, and was overruled by <em>Bacon, </em>J., who, after a verdict of guilty, being of opinion that -the questions of law arising in the case were so important and doubtful as to require the decision of this court, reported the case for its determination.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-4\"><em>J.

The complaint does not allege that Julia Hurley was employed in laboring in a manufacturing establishment belonging to the defendant. It merely alleges that she was employed in the cloth room of the defendant, a manufacturing company. Every allegation of the complaint would be fully met by proof that the defendant on the day named employed her to sweep the cloth room, or to perform any other occasional and temporary service. Such proof would not make a case within the spirit or letter of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">If any complaint can be maintained against the defendant for its failure to post the notice required by the St. of 1880, <em>e. </em>194, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>without proof that it has employed in laboring minors or women more than ten hours a day or sixty hours a week, which we do not decide, yet this complaint is fatally defective in failing to allege that the said Julia Hurley was employed in laboring within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AlI\">\n<em>Complaint quashed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
