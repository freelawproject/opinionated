When a gift or bequest is made in terms clearly manifesting an intention that it shall be taken in trust, and the trust is not sufficiently defined to be carried into effect, the donee or legatee takes the legal title only, and a trust results by implication of law to the donor and his representatives, or to the testator\u2019s residuary legatees or next of kin. <em>Briggs </em>v. Penny, 3 DeG. &amp; Sm. 525, and 3 Macn. &amp; Gord. 546. <em>Thayer </em>v. Wellington, 9 Allen, 283. <em>Sheedy </em>v. Roach, 124 Mass. 472. 2d. A trust which by its terms may be applied to objects which are not charitable in the legal sense, and to persons not defined, by name or by class, is too indefinite to be carried out. <em>Morice </em>v. <em>Bishop of Durham, </em>9 Ves. 399, and 10 Ves. 521. <em>James </em>v. Allen, 3 Meriv. 17. <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>111 Mass. 267. The cases illustrating the application of these rules, referred to in the able and elaborate arguments of counsel, are so numerous, and each case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>depends so much upon the wording of the particular instrument, that we shall mention those cases only which were most relied on. But it will be convenient first to examine the bequest before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The terms of this bequest clearly manifest the intention of the testatrix to create a trust. The bequest contains no words tending to show that the executors are to take the property, or any part of it, absolutely or for their own benefit; and by our law no such intention is to be implied. <em>Hays </em>v. Jackson, 6 Mass. 149, 152, 153. <em>Winship </em>v. Bass, 12 Mass. 198, 204. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Bowly, 8 </em>Met. 424, 431. Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1208. The bequest is not to the executors by name, but is to them and the survivor of them, and to their successors in the administration of the estate. All the property given to them is \u201c to be by them distributed; \u201d the direction to distribute is as broad as the gift. The property is not \u201cto be disposed of \u201d at the unqualified discretion of the executors, but is \u201c to be distributed \u201d according to their judgment of the deserts of the beneficiaries. The objects of the bounty of the testatrix are not otherwise designated than as \u201c such persons, societies or institutions as they may consider most deserving.\u201d And there is no indication of an intention that the executors shall not be held legally accountable for a proper execution of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The strongest case in favor of the defendants is <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Rumsey, </em>2 V. &amp; B. 294, in which a bequest to the executors named in the will, \u201cto be disposed of unto such person and persons, and in such manner and form, and in such sum and sums of money, as they in their discretion shall think proper and expedient,\u201d was held by Sir William Grant to give the executors a purely arbitrary power of disposition, and consequently a beneficial interest. That case differs from the present one in at least three important particulars: 1st. The bequest was only to the executors named. 2d. Much stress was laid on the fact that the words \u201cin trust\u201d had been used in many other places in the will, and were omitted in this clause. 3d. An authority to those, to whom the legal title is given, \u201c to dispose of \u201d the property \u201c in such manner and in such sums and to such persons as they may think proper,\u201d is more consistent with an arbitrary power of disposition than is a direction \u201cto distribute\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>property \u201c to such persons, societies or institutions as they may think most deserving.\u201d And the decision in <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Rumsey </em>has always been treated by the English courts as not to be extended beyond its special circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In <em>Ralston </em>v. <em>Telfair, </em>2 Dev. Eq. 255, also, the bequest to executors, which was held by the Supreme Court of North Carolina to be for their own use, was in the less restricted form \u201c to be disposed of as my executors think proper.\u201d In the subsequent case of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>6 Ired. 139, the same court held that a residuary bequest to the testator\u2019s wife, \u201cto be divided among my children as she thinks proper,\u201d created a plain trust for the benefit of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Two cases resembling <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Rumsey </em>much more nearly than the present case does were decided by Sir John Leach. One was of a residuary bequest to executors in trust, in default of further directions of the testator, to pay and apply the same to any lawful charitable public purposes, or to any person or persons, and in such shares and proportions, sort, manner and form, as they in their discretion should think fit. <em>Vezey </em>v. <em>Jam</em>son, 1 Sim. &amp; Stu. 69. The other was of a residuary bequest to executors \u201c upon trust to dispose of the same at such times and for such uses and purposes as they shall think fit, it being my will that the distribution thereof shall be left entirely to their discretion.\u201d <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Garlike, </em>1 Russ. &amp; Myl. 232. Each was held to be a plain gift in trust, and therefore not to the executors for their own benefit; but too uncertain for the court to execute, and therefore a resulting trust to the next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">So where a testator gave a fund to his executors upon certain trusts, and declared it to be his will that in the event of the failure of these trusts (which actually happened) his said trustees and the survivor of them, his executors or administrators, should apply the same \u201cto and for such charitable or other purposes as they shall think fit, without being accountable to any person or persons whomsoever for such their disposition thereof,\u201d Lord Chancellor Cottenham held that this was a gift in trust, but too uncertain to be carried into effect. He distinguished the case from <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Rumsey, </em>and approved the decision in <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Garlike, </em>and made these observations, which are quite applicable to the case before us: \u201c If the fund were intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>fur the executors\u2019 own benefit, the testator might have left with them the option of disposing of it; but they are to pay and apply it for certain purposes mentioned in the will. ' Then, again, the direction to the executors to pay and apply the fund to such charitable or other purposes as they should think fit, is very inconsistent with the notion that they were to be absolutely entitled to it.\u201d <em>Ellis </em>v. Selby, 1 Myl. &amp; Cr. 286, 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The omission of the words \u201c in trust \u201d is unimportant where, as in the case before us, an intention is clearly manifested that the whole property shall be applied' by the legatees for the ben efit of others than themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Thus where a sum of money was given to a niece of the testator, \u201cfor the express purpose of enabling her to present to either branch of my family any portion of the interest or principal thereon as she may consider the most prudent, and in the event of her death I empower her to dispose of the same by will or deed to those or either branch of her family she may consider most deserving thereof,\u201d it was held by Lord Langdale, M. R., and by Lord Cottenham on appeal, that the gift was in trust, but that, the trust being too indefinite to be executed, the sum was part of the donor\u2019s general estate. <em>Stubbs </em>v. <em>Sargon, </em>2 Keen, 255, and 3 Myl. &amp; Cr. 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">A like decision was made in <em>Buckle </em>v. Bristow, 10 Jur. (N. S.) 1095, where a testator, after giving bequests and legacies to several charitable institutions by name, gave the residue of his property upon trust for his executors to hold the same for such uses and purposes as he might by codicil or deed direct or appoint, and, in default thereof, then for the same to be expended and appropriated within three years in such way and amounts and for such purposes as they might in their judgment and discretion agree upon. Vice Chancellor Wood (afterwards Lord Chancellor Hatherley) said that, even if the words \u201cin trust\u201d had been omitted, and the word \u201c appropriated \u201d had been used alone, without the word \u201c expended,\u201d the result must have been the same; and that the decision in <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Rumsey </em>went \u201c to the very outside of the doctrine,\u201d and \u201cno case would be decided according to it, where the gift is not precisely and distinctly in the words there mentioned.\u201d See also <em>Yeap Cheah Neo </em>v. <em>Ong Cheng </em>Neo, L. R. 6 P. C. 381, 389, 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>In <em>McCormick </em>v. Grogan, L. R. 4 H. L. 82, the devise was absolute and unqualified of the testator\u2019s whole property to the defendant, who.m he described as \u201c my most sincere and valued friend,\u201d and appointed sole executor; and the instrument relied on as creating a trust was a letter addressed to the defendant, in which the testator expressed his intentions that certain persons should receive certain sums of money, but, besides otherwise signifying that he left it to the defendant to carry out the intentions as he might think best, said, \u201cI do not wish you to act strictly to the foregoing instructions, but leave it entirely to your own good judgment to do as you think I would if living, and as the parties are deserving; and as it is not my wish that you should say anything about this document, there cannot be any fault found with you by any of the parties should you not act in strict accordance with it.\u201d Such was the case of which Lord Hatherley (adopting the words of Lord Justice Christian in the court below) said that, if it were possible to look into the thoughts of the testator when he was inditing the will and letter, he was \u201c persuaded that what we should find there would be a purpose to this effect, toi set up after his decease, not an executor or a trustee, but as it were a second self, whom, while he communicates to him confidentially his ideas as to the distribution of his property, he desires to invest with all his own irresponsibility in carrying them into effect.\u201d L. R. 4 H. L. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In <em>Meredith </em>v. Heneage, 1 Sim. 542, a devise of a testator\u2019s estate to his wife \u201c unfettered and unlimited, in full confidence and with the firmest persuasion that, in her future disposition and distribution thereof, she will distinguish the heirs of my late father, by devising and bequeathing the whole of my said estate, together and entire, to such of my said father\u2019s heirs as she may think best deserves her preference,\u201d was held by the House of Lords, upon the advice of Lord Eldon and Lord Redesdale, not to create a trust, because the words \u201c unfettered and unlimited \u201d precluded the inference of such an intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In <em>Lambe </em>v. Eames, L. R. 10 Eq. 267, and L. R. 6 Ch. 597, the bequest was to the testator\u2019s wife, \u201cto be a.t her disposal in any way she may think best for the benefit of herself and family.\u201d And several of the other cases cited at the bar were of unsuccessful attempts to impose a trust, by reason of mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>precatory words, upon property bequeathed to a wife or child absolutely and without restriction. <em>Sale </em>v. Moore, 1 Sim. 534. <em>Reid </em>v. Atkinson, Ir. R. 5 Eq. 373. <em>In re Bond, </em>4 Ch. D. 238. <em>Spooner </em>v. <em>Lovejoy, </em>108 Mass. 529. Hess v. <em>Singler, </em>114 Mass. 56. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>122 Mass. 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In <em>Stead </em>v. <em>Mellor, </em>5 Ch. D. 225, the testatrix gave her personal estate to her executors upon trust to convert into money, and, after payment of expenses, debts and legacies, to hold the residue in trust for such of two nieces of hers as should be living at her death, \u201c my desire being that they shall distribute such residue as they think will be most agreeable to my wishes; \u201d and Sir George Jessel, M. E. held that the nieces took the residue for their own benefit. To have held otherwise would have been to engraft a trust upon a trust, in a case in which, as the Master of the Eolls observed, the testatrix had used the words \u201c in trust \u201d in the gift to the executors only, and beyond that had merely expressed a desire that the nieces should distribute the residue, not \u201c in accordance with my views and wishes,\u201d or \u201c as they know will be most agreeable to my wishes,\u201d but \u201c as they think will be most agreeable to r\u00f1y wishes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The decision in <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Doane, </em>3 Gray, 201, turned upon the peculiar provisions of the will. The testatrix, after devising and bequeathing the residue of her estate \u201c to my nephew Seth Wells \u201d for life, and at his death to such charities as should be deemed most useful by his executor or administrator, added, \u201c And it is my will and intention that the said Seth Wells may dispose of the furniture, plate, pictures and all other articles now in my house, absolutely, as he may deem expedient, in accordance with my wishes as otherwise communicated by me to him.\u201d Taking the two clauses together, the court concluded that they had the same meaning as if the will read thus: \u201c I give all the residue of my property, except the articles in my house, to Seth Wells for life, and I authorize him to dispose of those articles absolutely, as he may deem expedient.\u201d It is to be observed that the bequest was to the nephew by name, and not as executor, although he was appointed executor in another part of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The decision in <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Hawes, </em>122 Mass. 97, has no bearing upon this case. There the real estate was devised absolutely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the person named in the will as executor, subject to no trust except so far as a trust might be held to be created by a power given in the will to sell the land if necessary to carry out the purposes of a memorandum left with him by the testatrix; and the only point decided or argued was that, there being no evidence either of such memorandum or of such necessity, a conveyance by him without license from the judge of probate afforded no defence to a real action brought by a creditor of his who had attached and levied upon the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Upon a review of the authorities, we find nothing in them to control the conclusion, based upon the intention which appears to us to be clearly manifested on the face of this will, that the executors take the estate, not beneficially, but in trust; and that, the beneficiaries not being described by name or by class, the trust cannot be upheld unless its purposes are such as the law deems charitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The trust declared cannot be sustained as a charity. There is no restriction as to the objects of the trust, except that they must be \u201csuch persons, societies or institutions as they\u201d (the trustees) \u201c may consider0 most deserving.\u201d \u201cDeserving\u201d denotes worth or merit, without regard to condition or. circumstances, and is in no sense of the word limited to persons in need of assistance, or to objects which come within the class of charitable uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">A bequest for the relief of \u201c deserving poor,\u201d or of \u201c indigent but deserving \u201d individuals, is a charitable bequest, not by force of the word \u201c deserving,\u201d but in virtue of the word \u201c poor \u201d or \u201c indigent,\u201d and would be equally charitable if the word \u201c deserving\u201d had been omitted. <em>Kendall </em>v. Granger, 5 Beav. 300, 303. So a bequest \u201c for the education of deserving youths \u201d is charitable, because it is for the promotion of education and learning. <em>Saltonstall </em>v. Sanders, 11 Allen, 446, 454. And, possibly, a bequest for \u201c deserving literary men \u201d might be held upon like grounds to be a charity. <em>Thompson </em>v. Thompson, 1 Coll. 381, 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Bequests for poor relations have been held to be charitable bequests. Boyle on Charities, 31-36, and cases cited. <em>Gillam </em>v. Taylor, L. R. 16 Eq. 581. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Northumberland, </em>7 Ch. D. 745. But for \u201csuch relations\u201d of the testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>as are \u201cmost deserving\u201d (without \u201cpoor\u201d or any equivalent word) is not a charitable use; and includes all relations of the testator within a certain degree, because, as was observed by Sir Joseph Jekyll, M. R., a court of chancery has \u201c no rule of judging of the merits of the testator\u2019s relations.\u201d <em>Doyley </em>v. <em>Attorney General, 4 </em>Vin. Ab. Charitable Uses, C, pl. 16; <em>S.

A testator by his will directed his trustees to pay the following legacies: \u201c To the Cancer Hospital \u00bf6100; to the Brompton Hospital for Diseases of the Chest \u00bf6100; to the Lord Mayor of Dublin for the time being \u00bf6100 for such objects as he shall deem most deserving; to the Blind Asylum New Kent Road \u00bf6100; to Mrs. Gladstone of No. 11 Carlton House Terrace, to be applied as she thinks proper in charity, \u00bf6200; and the residue of my estate I bequeath to my trustees for such objects as they consider deserving, whether in increase of the before-mentioned ones or otherwise.\u201d Yice Chancellor Wickens, a most accomplished equity judge, held that the bequest to the Mayor of Dublin and the residuary gift could not be held to be limited to charitable objects, but failed altogether, on the ground of uncertainty. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Du Pasquier, </em>26 L.

R., and applied for the benefit of the poor of the parish. But that would seem to have been an application in the discretion of the court to one of several uses, all of which were charitable, in accordance with the rule laid down in an earlier case, published in Tothill twenty years before, that when no use is mentioned it shall be decreed to the use of the poor. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>Toth. 95; (2d ed.) 33; <em>S.

But if the trustees are authorized to apply or distribute it to other purposes or persons, it is void. <em>Chamberlain </em>v. Stearns, <em>Vezey </em>v. <em>Jamson, </em>and <em>Ellis </em>v. Selby, before cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The conclusion of the whole matter is, that, the testatrix having given the residue of her property to her executors in trust, and not having defined the trust sufficiently to enable the court to execute it, the plaintiff, being her next of kin, is entitled to the residue by way of resulting trust.</p>\n<p id=\"AOx\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
