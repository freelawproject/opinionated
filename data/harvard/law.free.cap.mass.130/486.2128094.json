Answer, that the services rendered by the petitioner were in his capacity of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>judge of a Municipal Court in the city of Boston, and by the St. of 1877, <em>e. </em>210, \u00a7 2, his salary as such was in full of all compen sation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-3\">Hearing before <em>Lord, </em>J., who reported for the consideration of the full court the following case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\">The petitioner was a judge of a Municipal Court, at the time of rendering the services set forth in the petition. The charges made by him, if authorized by law, were proper and reasonable, and should be allowed. The petitioner in due form presented his bill for these services, both to the city auditor, acting as comity auditor, and to the board of aldermen, acting as county commissioners, requesting them to examine, audit and allow the account; and they refused to allow the account, solely on the ground that, as matter of law, the county was under no legal obligation to pay for the services in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">If the county was liable to pay for the services rendered by the petitioner, the writ prayed for was to issue, if the same was a proper remedy; otherwise, the petition to be dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-6\"><em>O.

If the petitioner is entitled to the fees which he claims, the amount thereof being fixed by statute, and the city of Boston being bound by the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>17, \u00a7 6, to pay them, he is entitled to recover them by action at law against the city in the inferior court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">The St. of 1879, <em>c. </em>256, \u00a7 1, by which it is enacted that \u201cthe auditor of accounts of the city of Boston shall be the auditor of the county of Suffolk; and hereafter all bills for county salaries, expenses and disbursements shall be examined, audited and allowed by said auditor prior to the payment thereof,\u201d is intended to regulate the internal administration of municipal affairs, and does not deprive a creditor of his right of action, at least after his claim has been presented to the auditor, and to the board of aldermen acting as county commissioners, and they have refused to allow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The petitioner having thus a clear, direct and adequate rem edy by action at law, no case is shown for the exercise of thr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>extraordinary jurisdiction of this court to issue the writ of mandamus. <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Mulliken, </em>7 Gray, 280. <em>Boyce </em>v.

But in the present case, if his claim is well founded, he may recover judgment in the ordinary form by action at law against the city, and levy his execution upon the property of any inhabitant. <em>Hill </em>v.
