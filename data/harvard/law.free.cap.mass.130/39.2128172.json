Trial in the Superior Court, before Putnam, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-11\">To prove the assaults, the government offered Wood as a witness, who testified that the defendants made the four different assaults upon her charged in the indictment, and gave the particulars of each; and her testimony was corroborated by other evidence offered by the government. On cross-examination, she testified that she was born in Charlestown, where her parents still lived, and was twenty-three years of age; that about three years ago she left her parents and went to live in Somerville; that she lived there five weeks, when she. went to live with the defendant Kennon; that she lived with Kennon until February 1879, when Kennon sent her to the Tewksbury Almshouse; and that she remained there five or six weeks, when Kennon took her back again, and she lived with her until she was taken rom there by the officers on May 4, 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-12\">For the purpose of affecting her credibility as a witness, and also for the purpose of showing that she had a mania for telling false stories of assaults made upon her by other persons, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>defendants offered to show that she had told false stories of how her parents had assaulted her, made her lie with a goat in the cellar, had scalded her and driven her from home, and how the authorities of the Tewksbury Almshouse had attempted to strangle her with a sheet and kill her with medicine, and had strangled infants there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-4\">The judge ruled that this evidence was incompetent for the purposes claimed, and excluded it.
