Trial in the Superior Court, before Wilkinson, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">The plaintiff put in evidence a transcript of the record, by which it appeared that the summons in the original action was served by the officer delivering a true copy thereof to the defendant; that the defendant did not appear; and that judgment was rendered as alleged. \u201c It was agreed that either party might refer to the statutes of Colorado and the decisions of its courts, and the same were considered in evidence.\u201d The defendant asked the judge to rule that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, because the transcript of the record did not show that service was made upon the defendant in accordance with the laws of Colorado. The judge refused so to rule; ruled that the judgment was conclusive; and directed a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-8\"><em>F. 0.

The bill of exceptions, not showing what statutes or decisions of the State of Colorado were before the court below, does not show that there was any error in the rulings of that curt.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
