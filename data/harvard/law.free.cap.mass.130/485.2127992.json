Answer, a general denial, and payment. Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before <em>Wilkinson, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-10\">The defendant contended that the goods in question were furnished to his sons. This the plaintiffs denied, and produced their books, in which the goods were charged to the defendant. The defendant then called for a note, which was produced, and wa\u00ab for the amount sued on, and was signed by the defendant\u2019s sons. The plaintiffs\u2019 ledger showed that this note had been credited and applied to the defendant\u2019s account, and the book of original entries, the journal, showed the same. The note was deposited in the bank for collection, but was not paid. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 ledger, in balancing the account, the note .was treated as cash paid. The plaintiffs introduced evidence tending to explain or control the effects of these entries in their books; and, on this point, the evidence was conflicting. On cross-examinatian, the plaintiffs admitted that they received the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-4\">The defendant asked the judge to rule \u201c that the taking of the note, it being a negotiable note, and placing it to the credit of the defendant in the journal and ledger, and making no other application of the note, is in law payment.\u201d But the judge refused so to rule, and found for the plaintiffs; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-5\"><em>E.

The question whether the note was taken as payment was a question of fact, on which there was conflicting evidence, and the finding of the judge by whom the case was tried without a jury was conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"AK4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
