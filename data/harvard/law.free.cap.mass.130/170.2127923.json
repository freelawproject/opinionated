And it is the injury to his property, by reason of the construction of such a building, devoted to such a use, for which the owner may recover damages. The statute cannot be construed as meaning damages for maintaining such a urinal in an improper manner, so as to become a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">This is a petition brought under the statute to recover dam ages occasioned by reason of the construction of a urinal near the property of the petitioner. Evidence was introduced on both sides on the question whether the petitioner\u2019s property was injured by its construction; and the petitioner offered to prove that offensive smells came from it after it was used as a urinal, causing a nuisance, and injuriously affecting his tenants. We are of opinion that this evidence was properly excluded. If this urinal, by reason of its management or use, becomes a public nuisance, the city may be liable to indictment for thus maintaining it; or be subject to an action of tort by a person who suffers special damage thereby. <em>Eames </em>v. <em>New England Worsted Co. </em>11 Met. 570. In that case, it was held that, upon a complaint filed by a landowner to recover compensation for injury done his land by a dam, he could not recover damages arising from offensive smells proceeding from the land flowed, when the water was drawn off. <em>Staple </em>v. <em>Spring, </em>10 Mass. 72. The damages which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the petitioner has sufEered are to be ascertained in the same manner as damages occasioned by the laying out of highways; and if a town, after having constructed a highway, fails to maintain it in a proper manner, or keeps it in such condition that it becomes a nuisance, it is very clear that a person, whose land is injured by its Construction, and who seeks damages therefor under the statute, cannot recover damages arising from such want of repair after the way is constructed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b191-5\">J). <em>Q. </em>Linseott, for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b191-6\"><em>T.
