This lot was covered by a brick building several stories high, except for a space in the rear seventeen feet in depth, where the building was only twelve feet high. The walls of the main building were twenty inches thick in the basement, sixteen inches thick to the second floor, and all the other walls, including the walls of that part of the building in the rear of the lot, were twelve inches thick. The boundary line between lots Q and H was coincident throughout its length with the centre line of the side line of the building. Lot H was otherwise vacant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">On said May 26th, the plaintiff made an agreement in writing, under seal, with James W.

The purchaser agrees to put my rear wall in as good condition as it now is at the present time, and pay all damages, if any, to L part of my house; and that I shall not be liable to pay for the ten inches of wall on my land until used by me or my representatives ; one rear wall is hereafter to be partition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>wall, for the use of both parties in common, their hems and assigns.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-4\">Hobbs had no interesL at this time or afterwards in lot M, and he subsequently assigned the agreement to the defendant Morse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">On March 19, 1880, the plaintiff conveyed lot H to Morse, by a warranty deed, which described the boundary line between that lot and lot Q, as \u201c northeasterly by other land of said grantor, by a straight line through the centre of the brick partition wall.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">On June 10, 1880, Morse became the owner of lot M.

This sum Morse paid to the plaintiff; and on June 23, 1880, the plaintiff signed, sealed and delivered to Morse the following instrument: \u201c Know all men by these presents, that I, John Quinn, one of the parties named in a certain agreement made by me with James W. Hobbs, dated May 26,1879, and recorded with Suffolk Deeds, lib. 1461, fol. 255, acknowledge to have received of Asa P.

Col. St. February 13, 1683-4; 5 Mass. Col. Rec. 432. Prov. St. 1692-3 (4 W. &amp; M.) <em>c. </em>13; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 42.\" This provision does not appear to have been repealed, although other sections of the Province law have been modified or superseded by later statutes. Prov. St. 1699-1700 (12 W. III.) c. 24; 1 Prov. Laws, 404. Prov. Sts. 1760-1 (33 G. II.) c. 9; 1760-1 (1 G. III.) c. 32; 1763-4 (4 G. III.) c. 31; 4 Prov. Laws, 378, 431, 686.

In the agreement for the sale by the plaintiff to Hobbs of the adjoining lot, it was covenanted that Hobbs should pay to the plaintiff, for the half of the wall then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>standing on that lot such sum as arbitrators should determine it to be \u201c worth to said Hobbs in building a store on said land.\u201d Hobbs assigned the agreement to Morse; and the plaintiff conveyed that lot to Morse, describing it as bounded \u201c northeasterly by other land of said grantor through the centre of the brick partition wall.\u201d Pursuant to the agreement between the plaintiff and Hobbs, arbitrators were appointed by the plaintiff and Morse, and awarded the sum to be paid by Morse to the plaintiff for the half of \u201c the party wall,\u201d which they further described in their award as owned by Quinn and by Morse, assignee of the agreement with Hobbs. Morse paid that sum to the plaintiff ; and the plaintiff, by formal release, referring to his agreement with Hobbs, acknowledged himself to have received that sum of Morse \u201c in full for the brick wall and all claims for or on account of walls in said agreement mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">As to the rear wall. In the agreement of the plaintiff with Hobbs it was covenanted that the purchaser might build a parti tian wall on the rear end of the plaintiff\u2019s lot, half on the land of the plaintiff and half on the land of the purchaser; that the purchaser should put the plaintiff\u2019s rear wall in as good condition-as it then was, and pay all damages, if any, to the plaintiff\u2019s house; that the plaintiff should not be liable to pay for the half of the wall on his land until used by him or his representatives ; and that \u201c one rear wall is hereafter to be partition wall for the use of both parties in common, their heirs and assigns.\u201d After Morse had become the owner of the lot in the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s lot, the plaintiff, in his aforesaid release to Morse, referring to the agreement with Hobbs, and acknowledging payment in full for \u201c all claims for or on account of walls in said agreement mentioned,\u201d released to Morse, his heirs and assigns, \u201c all the lot or strip of land, if any there be, which lies northwesterly of a line drawn through the centre of the wall built by said Morse across the rear of my homestead lot, so that the division line between our respective estates shall be through the centre of said wall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>129 Mass. 387, cited for the plaintiff, so much of the wall as was carried up by the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s land was not as wide as the original wall, nor was its face, toward the plaintiff\u2019s land, parallel with the centre line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>that wall; and the defendant did not rely on any right to carry up a party wall upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, but on the plaintiff\u2019s want of title in the land itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">As to the thickness of the walls which the defendants are building, no question appears to have been made at the hearing below, or is reserved by the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><em>Bill </em>dismissed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
