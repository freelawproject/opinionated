The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the plaintiff, to this court on appeal, upon an agreed statement of facts, the material parts of which appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-10\"><em>W.

Soule had no interest in or lien upon the property or profits. The fact that the amount of his compensation depended upon the amount of the profits does not make him a partner, either as to his associate or as to persons dealing with him. Soule, therefore, had no property or interest in the goods attached by the defendant, and his attachment was a conversion for which he is liable to the plaintiff, who is the owner. <em>Blanchard </em>v. Coolidge, 22 Pick. 151. <em>Denny </em>v. Cabot, 6 Met. 82. <em>Bradley </em>v. White, 10 Met. 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The facts that goods were bought in the name of \u201c Soule and Partridge,\u201d and that bills were made out to and the goods shipped to \u201cSaule and Partridge,\u201d are immaterial in this case. If the parties held themselves out as partners, and thereby induced any person to give credit to the supposed partnership, they might be liable to such person, by way of estoppel. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>116 Mass. 312. But the debt of the attaching creditor in this case was a private debt against Soule, contracted before the agreement was made; as to him, there is nothing shown in the case which estops the plaintiff from proving that in fact there was no partnership, and that Soule had no interest in the goods attached.</p>\n<p id=\"A4L\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
