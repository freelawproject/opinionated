It was also proved or admitted that, at the date of the order, an action was pending in the Superior Court, in which Coleman was plaintiff and Wilde was defendant, and that Francis was the plaintiff\u2019s attorney; that at September term 1877 of that court, a verdict was returned for the plaintiff in that action; and that the same, by order of court, was continued for judgment, by reason of the present trustee process.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-8\">The claimant also offered to prove that there was a delivery of said order to Lincoln, and an oral acceptance of the same by Francis in Coleman\u2019s presence at the time of the date of the order; and that the action above referred to was on a promis spry note, which was in the hands of Francis when the order was accepted.

And it was so decided when this case was first before us. 127 Mass. 34. It is merely an order on Francis, the attorney of the defendant Coleman, to pay the claimant such sums as should become due Coleman from the Wilde case, \u2014 due him, that is to say, from Francis. It did\u201d not work any change in the relations between Coleman and Wilde, nor lessen the control of Coleman over his pending suit against Wilde. The oral acceptance of the order by Francis did not change the character of the order, so far as relates to its operation on the fund in the hands of Wilde. What obligation it created on the part of Francis it is not necessary for us to consider. The case, therefore, stands precisely on the same principle as when it was first presented to us, and the decision then made was properly adopted by the judge who presided at the trial in the Superior Court, as his guide in ruling upon it. The ruling being correct, the exceptions must be</p>\n<p id=\"AbN\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
