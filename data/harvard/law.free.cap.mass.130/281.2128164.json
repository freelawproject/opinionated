And especially he saith that Daniel J. Goss, a person who acted and served as one of the grand jurors finding said indictment, was not duly and legally drawn, selected, summoned and notified to appear and serve as one of said grand jurors; that George A. Reynolds also acted and served as one of said grand jurors finding said indictment, but that he was not duly and legally drawn, summoned, notified and returned; that the venire on which he was supposed to have been drawn and selected, summoned, notified and returned, was not directed to any or either of the constables of any town or city in said county; and no authority was\" given therein or thereby to any person to draw, select, summon, notify or return said George A. Reynolds as one of said grand jurors; that the service of said George A. Reynolds and said Daniel J. Goss on said grand jury rendered said indictment, found as aforesaid, null and void, and the finding of said indictment illegal. And this the said Dominick Moran is ready to verify. Wherefore he prays judgment if this court now here will or ought to take cognizance of said indictment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-4\">To this plea, the Commonwealth filed this replication: \u201c And hereupon Asa French, the District Attorney for the Southeastern District, who prosecutes for the Commonwealth in this behalf, says, that notwithstanding anything by the said Dominick Moran in pleading alleged, this court ought not to be precluded from taking cognizance of the indictment aforesaid, because he says that the grand jurors from the towns of Randolph and Hyde Park, viz. George A. Reynolds and Daniel J. Goss, as to whom specific objection is taken in said defendant\u2019s plea, were duly and legally drawn, summoned, notified and returned as grand jurors, and presented themselves on the first day of the term of this court at the April term thereof in the present year, and were then duly sworn and empanelled, and that said grand jury was in all respects a legal grand jury. And this the said Asa French is ready to verify. Wherefore he prays judgment, and that the said Dominick Moran may answer to this said indictment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Issue being duly joined on the special plea in the Superior Court, before <em>Colburn, </em>J., the defendant put in evidence the record of the court, showing that Daniel J.

Goss of said Hyde Park was drafted and selected accordingly,\u201d and that he had summoned him to attend \u201cat the time within specified, viz. the twelfth day of April, A. D. 1880.\u201d The defendant objected, 1st. that Goss ap peared by the return to have been summoned to attend on April 12, instead of on April 5, as directed by the venire; 2d. that the indorsement of the name of Goss in the return was not in the handwriting of the town clerk; and he offered evidence of this fact, which the judge excluded as immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">The other venire was addressed 11 to either of the constables of the town of in our county of Norfolk,\u201d and contained a command to notify and warn a meeting in the town of Randolph for the drawing and selection of a grand juror; and a constable of Randolph returned thereon that he had notified and warned such a meeting, and that \u201cGeorge A.

He was not sworn and did not testify at the trial, but, after the evidence on both sides had been put in and the case closed, asked the judge to rule that under the circumstances of the case he was not a competent witness. The judge refused so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>to rule, and instructed the jury that \u201cthe defendant was a competent witness if he saw fit to testify, but that he was under no obligation to testify, and, if he did not testify, the jury could infer nothing against him from that fact, but should treat the case in all respects as if he had no right to testify.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-5\"><em>J.
