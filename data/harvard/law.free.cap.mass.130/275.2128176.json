On the evening of the accident, after the plaintiff\u2019s leg was set, he told one Tiehan and one Carrigan, who had seen him fall and helped him home, and neither of whom was related to him, that he wanted them to notify the police that he had broken his leg on a certain corner (naming it) on the ice, and should look to the city for damages. Tiehan told him that he would attend to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-10\">Tiehan testified that he went home after leaving the plaintiff and went to bed about ten o\u2019clock; that in about an hour two policemen came to his house and aroused him, and said that they had come to make inquiries concerning the accident, as they had learned that he was present; that they asked him where the plaintiff fell; that he thereupon told them when and the particular place where he fell, and that he fell upon ice; that all his statements were made in response to their inquiries; and that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>making these statements, he was acting for the plaintiff, but did not say so, nor did he say anything about damages or why he notified them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-4\">Carrigan testified that the same two policemen called at his house between nine and ten o\u2019clock the same evening, and asked him if the plaintiff had broken his leg; and that he told them that he had; that he fell on the crossing and broke his leg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">Both Tiehan and Carrigan also testified that they told the plaintiff the next day what they had said to the policemen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">The judge ruled that these notices or statements of Tiehan and Carrigan were both of them insufficient to satisfy the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">The plaintiff also offered in evidence the following written notice sent to the clerk of the defendant city within thirty days of the accident: \u201cCambridge, Feb. 24, 1879. Daniel McNulty hereby notifies the city of Cambridge that he fell and broke his leg, Jan. 26, 1879, at the corner of Webster Avenue and Cam bridge Street in said Cambridge, and will claim damages for the above injury from the city of Cambridge. Daniel Mc-Nulty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">The judge ruled that this notice was defective and insufficient, in not defining the place and stating the cause of the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-9\">The plaintiff further offered to prove that, on-March 14,1879, more than thirty days after the injury, he went before the committee on claims of the city, and stated to them the time, place and cause of his injury, and that he should claim damages therefor from the defendant; that he did not know how to write; that this was the first time he was able to leave his bed since the injury ; and that he had to be carried to the place of hearing.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avl\">This case is covered in every particular by previous decisions. There was no evidence that either of the statements made by Tiehan and Carrigan in conversation with the police officers purported or was understood to be a notice to th.e city under the statute. <em>Kenady </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>128 Mass. 318. The written notice was insufficient, because it did not state the cause of the injury. <em>Noonan </em>v. <em>Lawrence, ante, </em>161. The notice given more than thirty days after the injury was too late, there being no evidence that the plaintiff was incapable of giving the notice within the thirty days. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>129 Mass. 525.</p>\n<p id=\"ArO\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
