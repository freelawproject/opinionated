The attestation clause was as follows: \u201c In witness whereof, we, the said Sarah Wetherbee and Nehemiah A. Wetherbee, husband of said Sarah Wetherbee, in token of his relinquishment of his right in the above-named premises, have hereunto set our hands and seals, this fourteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight.\u201d The deed was signed and sealed by the grantor and her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-8\">The land in question had been conveyed by deed from Nehemiah A. Wetherbee (in which his wife Sarah joined in release of dower) to their son, James A. Wetherbee, dated March 1,1858, and James A. conveyed the land to his mother, by deed dated March 2, 1858, which was duly recorded. He paid no consideration to his father and received none from his mother, although in each deed the consideration was stated to be- $500, and no consideration passed between Sarah and Nehemiah A.

The record did not, therefore, disclose the fact, if. it were a fact, that Sarah held the land by gift from her husband. The chain of title was perfectly consistent with the theory that Nehemiah sold to James A. for value, and that James A. sold and conveyed to Sarah for value; and, if that were so, it is clear that the mortgage by Sarah, joined in by Nehemiah, her husband, in token of his relinquishment of his right in the premises, was valid. St. 1857, <em>c. </em>249. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>128 Mass. 269. The mortgage was apparently valid, because the record title was such as would enable the record owner to convey the land in mortgage by a deed executed as this mortgage deed was executed. In this respect the case differs from the cases of <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 Allen, 68, and <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>4 Gray, 432, relied on by the tenant, in which cases the record showed that the wife had not such title to the land as would enable her to convey it except her husband joined with her as grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">As the demandant took in good faith, for value, a mortgage executed in a way sufficient to pass the title, so far as the record showed, we think that she holds by a title which cannot be impeached by a stranger, or by a subsequent grantee of the mortgagor with notice, by paroi proof that the husband of the mortgagor without consideration conveyed the land to a third person, who, in fulfilment of the purpose for which it was conveyed to him, conveyed it without consideration to the mortgagor.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoq\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
