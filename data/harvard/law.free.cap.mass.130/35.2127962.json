H. Galligan, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AiD\"><em>G. Marston, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b56-3\">We are of opinion, however, that the ruling was erroneous, and that the evidence ought not to have been received. It is provided by art. 12 of the Declaration of Eights that no subject shall be held to answer for any crimes or offence until the same is fully and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him. When a statute imposes a higher penalty on a third conviction, it makes the former convictions a part of the description and character of the offence intended to be punished. <em>Tuttle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Gray, 505. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Holley, 3 Gray, 458. <em>Garvey </em>v. Commonwealth, 8 Gray, 382. It follows that the offence which is punishable with the higher penalty is not fully and substantially described to the defendant, if the complaint fails to set forth the former convictions which are essential features of it. That clause of the statute, therefore, which provides that it shall not be necessary, in complaints under it, to allege such previous convictions, is inoperative and void, as being contrary to the provisions of the Declaration of Eights.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The result is, that the defendant is to be sentenced for a single offence of drunkenness.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b56-11\"> See St. 1881, c. 276.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
