The plaintiff must be held to have assented to the assignment, inasmuch as he did not dissent within the time required by the Gen. Sts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>of New Hampshire, <em>c. </em>126, \u00a7 3, and because he voluntarily became a party to the proceeding,\"\"by proving his claim in court and receiving his dividend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-4\">2. The statute under which the assignment was made is not an insolvent law, and was not superseded by the Bankrupt Act of the United States. Under it the court does not take possession of the debtor\u2019s estate to-distribute it among bis creditors; it does not appoint an assignee, nor cause the creditors to choose one; it makes no assignment and grants no discharge. No creditor is bound against his consent. The statute merely provides that, if a debtor chooses to give up his property to his creditors, under such superintendence of a court that it may become a matter of record, a creditor who is not willing to be bound shall express his dissent. <em>Sedgwick </em>v. <em>Place, </em>1 Bankr.
