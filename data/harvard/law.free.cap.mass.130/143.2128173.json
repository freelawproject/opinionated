This suit is brought to recover back said taxes for 1872 and 1873; it cannot be maintained, unless the plaintiff shows that the tax sought to be recovered back was wholly illegal. If the assessment included any property of the firm which was liable to taxation, the plaintiff\u2019s only remedy was an application for abatement under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>11, \u00a7 43. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>8 Cush. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">We assume, for the purposes of the case, that the assessors intended, as the form they used implies, to tax the property of the firm; and that this is to be regarded as a distinct and independent tax, so that the fact that the plaintiff was liable to and was assessed a personal tax at the same time does not prevent his recovery, if the firm tax was wholly illegal.\u2019 <em>Little </em>v. Cambridge, 9 Cush. 298. .</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The statute provides that \u201cpartners in mercantile or other business, whether residing in the same or different places, may be jointly taxed under their partnership name, in the place where their business is carried on, for all the personal property employed in such business, except ships or vessels,\u201d and \u201c when so jointly taxed each partner shall be liable for the whole tax.\u201d Gen. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The dissolution of a firm by the act of the partners does not immediately terminate its existence for all purposes. It still subsists and continues for the purpose of closing up its concerns. Such dissolution does not exempt the firm property from taxation ; it does not work a division or separation of the property so that the share of each partner can be taxed to him, but it continues to be the property of the firm. We are of opinion that, for the purposes of taxation, the firm continues to exist until its affairs are wound up, or until the firm property is disposed of. In the case before us, the statement of facts, which seems to have been carefully drawn, does not state that the affairs of the firm of \u201c Stephen Oliver, Jr. &amp; Co.\u201d have been wound up, or that there is no taxable property of the firm remaining undisposed of. For aught that appears, there may have been at the time the taxes were assessed taxable property of the firm of a value as large as the amount for which the firm was assessed. If so, the taxes assessed were legal and proper; or if there was then any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>taxable property of the firm, though of less value than the amount assessed, his only remedy was by an application for abatement. It follows that the statement of facts upon which the case is submitted to us does not show that the plaintiff is entitled to recover. In other words, the plaintiff fails to meet the burden which is upon him of proving that the taxes of which he complains were wholly illegal. Without such proof he is not entitled to maintain a suit to recover them back.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b165-5\"><em>2). </em>Peabody, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b165-6\"><em>O.
