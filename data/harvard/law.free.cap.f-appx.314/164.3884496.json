We review his issues on appeal in turn, and affirm his convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">Myles first asserts the district court violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment by admitting seized business records from his company, Miles Aviation, and by admitting Agent Timothy Arnold\u2019s testimony regarding the contents of the records. Myles contends the records were testimonial in nature because they contain a description of the events that the customer and the Government believed were criminal. Thus, Myles claims he was denied the opportunity to cross examine the allegedly defrauded customers. Myles concedes he did not raise this Sixth Amendment argument below.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">Where the defendant raises an argument for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Where neither precedent nor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>explicit language of the rule specifically resolves an issue, there can be no plain error. <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. The Confrontation Clause bars the admission of testimonial statements if the declarant has not been, and cannot be, subjected to full cross-examination regardless of the admissibility of statements under the laws of evidence. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1364, 1370, 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The district court did not plainly err in admitting the disputed records and permitting Agent Arnold to testify to their contents. The disputed records consisted of business records in the form of FAA 8130 and ATA 106 forms which were seized from Miles Aviation and were prepared and signed by Myles. Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has held that such business records constitute testimonial hearsay or violate the Confrontation Clause. Moreover, in <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court suggested that business records were not, \u201cby their nature,\u201d testimonial. <em>Crawford, </em>124 S.Ct. at 1367. Because admission of the business records did not contradict precedent or the explicit language of a statute, the district court did not plainly err. <em>See Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Myles next contends the admission of Miles Aviation\u2019s answer to a civil complaint constitutes reversible error because it affected his substantial rights by materially contradicting his trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Garcia-Jaimes, </em>484 F.3d 1311, 1320 (11th Cir.2007). We have held that evidentiary errors \u201cdo not constitute grounds for reversal unless there is a reasonable likelihood that they affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d 1489, 1493 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">As the parties agree, Miles Aviation\u2019s answer was not admissible under Rule SOS\u00ae.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, in light of the evidence presented at trial, any error in admitting the evidence was not grounds for reversal because it did not affect Myles\u2019s substantial rights. At trial, the evidence showed that (1) Myles signed FAA 8130 and ATA 106 forms without proper authority; (2) these forms falsely attested to the inspection, condition, and origination of the aircraft parts he sold; (3) Myles did this despite warning letters from the FAA informing him that he was not authorized to inspect and overhaul parts; and (4) he sold the parts based on his fraudulent certification of the part\u2019s condition. Additionally, two witnesses testified the Eagle NDT testing equipment appeared unused for some time. Thus, the admission of Miles Aviation\u2019s answer, indicating the equipment purchased from Eagle NDT did not work, did not have a substantial influence on the outcome of the trial because there was sufficient evidence that Myles knowingly made false certific\u00e1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>tions regarding the aircraft parts with intent to defraud in violation of \u00a7 38. Therefore, reversal of Myles\u2019s conviction is not required. <em>See Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d at 1493.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Myles further asserts the district court erred in considering uncharged transactions as relevant conduct at sentencing when it enhanced his sentence based on the loss amount and number of victims. Myles contends the uncharged transactions, which substantially increased his Guidelines offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b), were not part of the same course of conduct for which he was indicted and convicted. Additionally, Myles asserts the district court\u2019s findings were not based on reliable and specific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We review whether the district court misapplied the relevant conduct provisions of the Guidelines <em>de novo. See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d 725, 728 (11th Cir.2004). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing, such as loss amount and number of victims. <em>See id. </em>If a defendant fails to raise his objection before the district court, however, we review the issue for plain error. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The district court must correctly calculate the Guidelines range, including consideration of all relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1336 (11th Cir.2006). Relevant conduct may include both uncharged and acquitted conduct that is proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">The Guidelines\u2019 relevant conduct provisions require consideration of the following to determine an offense level:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">(a)(1)(A) all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">(2) solely with respect to offenses of a character for which \u00a7 3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, all acts and omissions described in subdivision[ ](1)(A) ... above that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-14\">(3) all harm that resulted from the acts and omissions specified in subsection[ ](1)(A) ... above, and all harm that was the object of such acts and omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-15\">(4) any other information specified in the applicable guideline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. According to the commentary, offenses constitute a common scheme or plan if they are \u201csubstantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.9(A)). Additionally, offenses are the same course of conduct, \u201cif they are suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ciently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses\u201d after considering \u201cthe degree of similarity of the offenses, the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.9(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In determining whether uncharged conduct is relevant, we evaluate the similarity, regularity, and temporal proximity between the counts of conviction and uncharged conduct. <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d 1006, 1011 (11th Cir.1994). This evaluation includes consideration of \u201c \u2018whether there are distinctive similarities between the offense of conviction and the remote conduct that signal that they are part of a single course of conduct rather than isolated, unrelated events that happen only to be similar in kind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Sykes, </em>7 F.3d 1331, 1336 (7th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We considered whether the sales of car parts stolen at different times from different victims at different locations to <em>bona fide </em>purchasers and co-conspirators were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme to constitute relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Fuentes, </em>107 F.3d 1515, 1524-25 (11th Cir.1997) (determining relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 where some sales provided the basis for state convictions but not the federal convictions for which the defendant was being sentenced). We concluded the federally charged and state charged incidents were part of the same course of conduct and common scheme or plan, because the incidents occurred with regularity within the same time period and shared identical mo-dus operandi and purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 1525-26. Therefore, all the incidents constituted relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 1526.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The district court did not err in including Myles\u2019s uncharged conduct as relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3. Like the state charged conduct in <em>Fuentes, </em>Myles\u2019s uncharged conduct regularly occurred within the same time period as the charged conduct. Specifically, the seized documents showed that Myles completed more than 250 FAA 8130 and ATA 106 forms between March 2004 and February 2006, and the indictment covered fraudulent transactions committed between July 2005 and February 2006. Therefore, the uncharged conduct was part of the same course of conduct. <em>See Fuentes, </em>107 F.3d at 1525. Additionally, all of Myles\u2019s conduct followed the same modus operandi. He received an order, filled it with non-conforming parts, and falsely certified the parts in order to profit from the sales of parts by misrepresenting their condition. Thus, the uncharged conduct was also part of the same common scheme. <em>See Fuentes, </em>107 F.3d at 1525.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Next, Myles contends there was not reliable and specific evidence supporting the enhancements for the relevant conduct. In determining the loss attributable to relevant conduct, the government bears the burden of proving loss with reliable and specific evidence. <em>United States v. Dabbs, </em>134 F.3d 1071, 1081 (11th Cir.1998). However, the loss may be a reasonable estimate of the intended loss. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Contrary to Myles\u2019s assertion, the district court did not rely solely on a cursory review of the binder material to determine relevant conduct, loss, and victims at sentencing. Instead, the Government presented documentary evidence and a witness, Ramirez, who testified to his audit of all the documents seized from Miles Aviation, the contents of the binders, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>summary charts admitted as the Government\u2019s exhibits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ramirez also testified he traced the fraudulent provision of parts to each represented customer beginning with its order. Therefore, Myles\u2019s argument the district court failed to base its findings on specific and reliable evidence is without merit. <em>See Dabbs, </em>134 F.3d at 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The district court did not plainly err in admitting FAA 8130 and ATA 106 forms. Although the district court erred when it admitted Miles Aviation\u2019s answer to a civil complaint under the public records exception, any error did not affect Myles\u2019s substantial rights in light of the other evidence against him. The district court did not err when . it considered uncharged fraudulent transactions as relevant conduct to determine sentencing enhancements based on the loss amount and number of victims because the transactions occurred during the same time period and followed the same course of conduct as the charged transactions. Accordingly, we affirm Myles\u2019s convictions and aggregate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\">. Subsection 8 of Rule 803's hearsay exceptions permits admission of records of public offices or agencies, setting forth: (1) the activities of the office or agency; (2) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report; or is) in civil actions and proceedings and against the government in criminal cases, factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law. Fed.R.Evid. 803(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\">. During sentencing, Myles\u2019s objections focused on whether the uncharged transactions should be included as relevant conduct, as well as the amount of loss and number of victims. On admission of the evidence of the uncharged transactions, Myles did not dispute their accuracy but argued they should not be included as relevant conduct. Later, Myles argued the conclusions drawn from the evidence were based on \"too many assumptions.\u201d Because he did not explicitly object to the reliability and specificity of the evidence underlying the court's findings, Myles\u2019s challenge to the reliability and specificity of the evidence at sentencing should be reviewed for plain error. Thus, whether the uncharged transactions constitute relevant conduct is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>and the reliability and specificity of the evidence is reviewed for plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\">. Rule 1006 permits the contents of voluminous writing to be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation. Fed.R.Evid. 1006.
