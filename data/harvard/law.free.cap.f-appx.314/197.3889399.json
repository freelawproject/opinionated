Salyer, Anne R. Schultz, Joseph B.

The district court denied Dixson\u2019s motion. We vacate that order and remand with instructions to dismiss the motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>443 F.3d 790, 793 (11th Cir.2006). A district court does not have authority to modify a sentence, except to the extent provided by the federal statutory provisions that control sentencing and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). We have stated that federal courts have \u201can obligation to look behind the label of a motion filed by a <em>pro se </em>inmate and determine whether the motion is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">The district court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Dix-son\u2019s motion. Dixson was sentenced in 2000, filed a collateral challenge to his sentence in 2002 that was denied on the merits, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and has not obtained permission from this Court to file a successive motion, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Dixson is not entitled to pursue relief under the savings clause because he did not allege in his motion that a decision of the Supreme Court applies retroactively to establish that he was convicted for a nonexistent offense, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">Even if we construe Dixson\u2019s filing as a motion for modification of his sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, the district court lacked the authority to entertain the motion. The government did not file a motion to reduce Dixson\u2019s sentence and Dixson\u2019s motion was filed more than seven days after sentencing. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3582(b)(2); Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a), (b); <em>United States v. Momson, </em>204 F.3d 1091, 1093 (11th Cir.2000). Dixson did not identify an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that applies retroactively to lower his guideline range, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the Director of the Bureau of Prisons did not move to reduce Dixson\u2019s sentence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">The district court technically erred in its disposition of Dixson\u2019s motion. Because the district court denied, rather than dismissed, Dixson\u2019s motion, we vacate its order and remand with instructions to dismiss the motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
