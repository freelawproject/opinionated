The district court granted summary judgment for employer McWane Inc. (\u201cMcWane\u201d) on the ground that the Plaintiffs were exempt from the FLSA\u2019s overtime-pay requirement. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">McWane operates a foundry where cast iron products are manufactured. The Plaintiffs are current and former \u201cproduction supervisors\u201d at this facility. A production supervisor is responsible for supervising a team of subordinate employees in a particular production unit at the foundry. The Plaintiffs filed suit against McWane for failure to pay overtime wages under the FLSA. McWane moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Plaintiffs were exempt from the FLSA\u2019s overtime-pay requirement under the \u201cexecutive capacity\u201d exemption. The district court granted McWane\u2019s motion, and the Plaintiffs now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-17\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Orient Marine Co. Ltd., </em>505 F.3d 364, 365 (5th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Ml reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the nonmovant. <em>Robinson, </em>505 F.3d at 366. The movant \u201chas the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those parts of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>U.S. v. $92,203.00 in U.S. Currency, </em>537 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.2008). Once this initial burden has been met, the burden shifts to the nonmov-ant \u201cto demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Disputes concerning material facts are \u201cgenuine\u201d if a reasonable jury could find in favor of the nonmovant. <em>Menitt-Campbell, Inc. v. RxP Products, Inc., </em>164 F.3d 957, 961 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-18\">The FLSA requires employers to pay overtime compensation for nonexempt employees. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a). However, this requirement does not extend to em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ployees who are \u201cemployed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1). Under the controlling Department of Labor regulation, this \u201cexecutive capacity\u201d exemption applies to any employee who (1) is paid at least $455 a week, (2) has the \u201cprimary duty\u201d of management, (3) regularly directs the work of two or more employees, and (4) has \u201cthe authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.100(a). The district court found that all of these prongs were satisfied and that McWane was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Appellants contend that there are genuine disputes of material fact as to prongs (2) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The Appellants first contend that their \u201cprimary duty\u201d was not management. An employee\u2019s primary duty is \u201cthe principal, main, major or most important duty that the employee performs.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.700(a). In applying this definition, we look to the aspect of the employee\u2019s job that is \u201cof principal value to the employer.\u201d <em>Dalheim v. KDFW-TV, </em>918 F.2d 1220, 1227 (5th Cir.1990). \u201cFactors to consider when determining the primary duty of an employee include, but are .not limited to, the relative importance of the exempt duties as compared with other types of duties; the amount of time spent performing exempt work; the employee\u2019s relative freedom from direct supervision; and the relationship between the employee\u2019s salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of nonexempt work performed by the employee.\u201d \u00a7 541.700(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Here, McWane presented summary-judgment evidence that the primary duty of the production-supervisor position was management. The Plaintiffs themselves testified that they were each responsible for supervising a team of between ten and thirty employees. For example, lead plaintiff Lonzo Rainey testified that he spent the majority of his time on the production floor \u201c[wjatching, making sure [the employees were] working safe and doing, putting out good work.\u201d This is consistent with McWane\u2019s standard job description for the position, which focused on the supervisors\u2019 responsibility for \u201cthe planning and supervision of subordinate supervisors, hourly and incentive personnel.\u201d McWane further required the supervisors to attend managerial and leadership programs, and focused its performance reviews exclusively on the supervisors\u2019 leadership and supervisory skills. Finally, the salaried production supervisors were paid more than double what the regular workers in their units were paid. This evidence is more than sufficient to establish that McWane principally valued the production supervisors for their management duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">In response, the Plaintiffs attempt to obscure the issue by concentrating on management tasks that the production supervisors did <em>not </em>perform. However, the Plaintiffs fail to provide any argument that the supervisors\u2019 primary duty was non-managerial work; in other words, they fail to negate McWane\u2019s summary-judgment evidence. The depositions offered by the Plaintiffs suggest only that the production supervisors engaged in nonexempt production-line tasks when their units were understaffed. There is no evidence that any plaintiff regularly spent a majority of his or her time on such tasks. In fact, the plant\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement forbids supervisors from performing basic production labor except in narrow circumstances. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence fails to create a genuine dispute of material fact. <em>See Merritt-Campbell, </em>164 F.3d at 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>The Plaintiffs also challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that their \u201csuggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or <em>any other change of status </em>of other employees are given <em>particular weight.\u201d </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.100(a) (emphasis added). An employee\u2019s suggestion may be deemed to have \u201cparticular weight\u201d even if \u201ca higher level manager\u2019s recommendation has more importance and even if the employee does not have authority to make the ultimate decision as to the employee\u2019s change in status.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.105. Here, McWane presented evidence that the production supervisors exclusively evaluate provisional workers and provide recommendations as to their hiring as regular employees. The Appellants have not provided any evidence to contradict this practice or indicate that the these recommendations are not typically followed. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b718-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
