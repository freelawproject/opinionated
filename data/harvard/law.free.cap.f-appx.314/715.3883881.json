He argues that the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of methamphetamine attributable to him was clearly erroneous because it was not based on information having a sufficient indicia of reliability. A district court\u2019s determination of the amount of drugs for which a defendant should be held responsible is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 878 (5th Cir.1998). There is no clear error if the district court\u2019s finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-27\">This court recognizes that a district court may consider estimates in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ing drug quantity for sentencing purposes, provided that the estimates are reasonable and based on reliable evidence. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). In arriving at a drug quantity, the district court may rely upon information provided by codefendants and other witnesses, provided the information bears the minimum indicia of reliability. <em>See United States v. Gaytan, </em>74 F.3d 545, 558 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Shipley, </em>963 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Here, the district court heard testimony from a witness that supported its finding that Martinez was responsible for 350 to 500 grams of methamphetamine. Although the witness may have been unsure of the exact quantities and dates of every transaction, it was not necessary that any witness testify to the exact drug quantity found by the district court because the district court was allowed to estimate the drug quantity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.12). Moreover, the fact that a witness\u2019s testimony regarding ding quantity is \u201csomewhat imprecise,\u201d does not preclude reliance on that testimony for sentencing purposes. <em>United, States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 832 (5th Cir.1998). Because the evidence relied on by the district court had a sufficient indicia of reliability, and because the district court\u2019s factual finding regarding the amount of drugs attributable to Martinez is plausible in light of the record as a whole, <em>see Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b739-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
