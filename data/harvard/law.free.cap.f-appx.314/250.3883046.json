After review, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">I. HENRY\u2019S <em>PRO SE </em>STATUS</p>\n<p id=\"b275-17\">Henry retained attorney Jason Kreiss to represent him in the district court. After the district court entered its judgment and conviction, Henry filed a notice of appeal; Kreiss moved in the district court to withdraw as Henry\u2019s counsel. The district court held a hearing on Kreiss\u2019s motion, and both Kreiss and Henry appeared. After the hearing, the district court granted Kreiss\u2019s motion to withdraw as Henry\u2019s counsel. Also, because Henry informed the court that he still owned multiple properties, the district court determined that he was not indigent and thus declined to appoint new counsel to represent him on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">At the end of the hearing, Henry indicated that he wanted Kreiss to file a notice with this Court voluntarily dismissing his appeal so he could file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. However, Henry later informed this Court that he wanted to withdraw the notice dismissing his appeal. Although this Court has sent Henry multiple letters regarding appointment of counsel, Henry has not filed a motion for appointment of counsel on appeal. Instead, he has filed a <em>pro se </em>appellate brief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, we will address the issues raised in Henry\u2019s <em>pro se </em>appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-19\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b275-20\">First, Henry alleges that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the indictment did not charge him with a federal mail fraud offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Henry pled guilty to one count of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-21\">The indictment alleged that Henry and his codefendants devised a fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>scheme of creating false deeds that conveyed real property from unsuspecting property owners to the defendants or them nominees, caused the deeds to be recorded in the public record, and used the deeds either to sell the property or to secure mortgage loans. The indictment further alleged that they caused documents to be transmitted by the United States Postal Service and private and commercial interstate carriers \u201cfor the purpose of executing the scheme and artifice to defraud.\u201d The mail fraud count, to which Henry pled guilty, charged that he and his codefen-dants caused \u201c[djocuments and cheeks related to the sale of property\u201d in Fort Lauderdale, Florida to be \u201ctransmitted via United Parcel Service, a commercial interstate carrier,\u201d from a Florida title company to a Fort Lauderdale county tax collector\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The federal mail fraud statute encompasses transactions occurring by use of \u201cany private or commercial interstate carrier,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, even if the conduct charged took place entirely intrastate, <em>United States v. Hasner, </em>340 F.3d 1261, 1270 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the mail fraud charges against Henry, and we affirm Henry\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Second, Henry seeks to challenge the loss amount used at sentencing. However, Henry\u2019s written plea agreement contained a sentence appeal waiver that waived his right to appeal his sentence unless he was sentenced above the statutory maximum or the government appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A sentence appeal waiver is enforceable if it is entered into knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1350 (11th Cir.1993). This requirement is satisfied by a showing \u201cthat either (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant concerning the sentence appeal waiver during the Rule 11 colloquy, or (2) it is manifestly clear from the record that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Henry\u2019s sentence appeal waiver is valid and enforceable because the district court specifically questioned Henry about the sentence appeal waiver at the plea colloquy and ensured that Henry understood the full significance of the waiver. In response to the district court\u2019s questions, Henry said that (1) he understood that he normally would have a right to appeal his sentence, (2) he knew that his plea agreement contained a waiver of those appeal rights with two limited exceptions, (3) he had discussed his right to appeal with his attorney, and (4) he agreed to the appeal waiver freely and voluntarily. Because Henry entered into a valid, enforceable sentence appeal waiver and his sentence claim on appeal does not fall within the limited exceptions to the waiver, we dismiss his appeal with prejudice as to his sentencing claim. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>131 F.3d 1005, 1009 (11th Cir.1997) (stating that an appeal presenting claims that fall within an enforceable sentence appeal waiver should be dismissed).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">Finally, Henry seeks to raise several claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on appeal. \u201cWe will not generally consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on direct appeal where the district court did not entertain the claim nor develop a factual record.\u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). Because Henry did not raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>in the district court and did not develop a sufficient factual record for review at this time, we dismiss these claims without prejudice to Henry\u2019s remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 969 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE IN PART, AND DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-14\">. Henry also has filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to supplement the record, which we hereby grant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-22\">. \u201cThe district court's subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Giraldo-Prado, </em>150 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\">.
