On January 19, 1990, Triumph was convicted of writing bad checks in the third degree after pleading guilty in state court in New Jersey, and he was sentenced to one year of probation. On September 29, 1994, Triumph pleaded guilty to first degree larceny in Connecticut state court and received a five-year prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-20\">In July 2002, Triumph traveled to Guyana. Triumph then traveled to Canada, where he was arrested on a United States Marshal fugitive warrant. On December 16, 2004, Triumph was convicted by a jury in federal court of 10 counts of aiding and abetting the preparation of false tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2), and the district court sentenced him to 33 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-21\">On April 6, 2005, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) served Triumph with a notice to appear (NTA), charging that he was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (2) (A) (i) (I) as an alien inadmissible for his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude and under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B) as an alien inadmissible for his conviction of two or more offenses for which the aggregate sentences to confinement imposed were five years or more. The NTA also alleged that Triumph was \u201can arriving alien.\u201d After Triumph submitted documents showing that his 2004 conviction for aiding and abetting false tax returns was on appeal in the Second Circuit, DHS characterized the NTA as \u201cimprovidently issued\u201d with respect to the inclusion of the 2004 conviction as a ground for removal and chose not to rely on that conviction as a basis for removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-22\">The immigration judge (IJ) ruled that Triumph was subject to removal under \u00a7 1182(a) (2)(A) (i) (I) as an alien who committed a crime involving moral turpitude and under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B) as an alien convicted of two or more offenses for which the aggregate sentences to confinement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>were five years or more. Triumph sought relief under former \u00a7 1182(c) pursuant to <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>538 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), but the IJ denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) agreed with Triumph that his 1990 conviction for writing bad checks did not constitute a basis for his removability under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) because the New Jersey statute under which he was convicted did not require proof of any intent to defraud. Nevertheless, the BIA ruled that Triumph remained removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) on the basis of his 1994 conviction for larceny in the first degree and under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B) based on both his 1990 and 1994 convictions because the sum of the sentences imposed for those convictions was five years. Accordingly, the BIA dismissed Triumph\u2019s appeal on August 10, 2006, 2006 WL 3088808. Triumph timely filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Triumph also timely filed a motion for reconsideration with the BIA, but the BIA denied the motion for reconsideration on September 28, 2006, 2006 WL 3088748. Triumph then timely filed a petition for review of this ruling in the Second Circuit on October 5, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">On December 8, 2006, the Second Circuit ordered that Triumph\u2019s petitions for review be transferred to this court. On February 12, 2007, this court received Triumph\u2019s petitions and docketed them under Cause No. 07-60114.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Meanwhile, Triumph filed a \u201cmotion to reopen\u201d with the BIA on November 7, 2006. On January 3, 2007, the BIA construed the motion as a second motion to reconsider and denied the motion as exceeding both time and numerical limitations. The BIA stated that the motion \u201cwould also be properly denied as a motion to reopen.\u201d In June 2007, Triumph filed a motion in this court seeking to file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of this motion to reopen, alleging that he timely filed such a petition for review in the Second Circuit on January 23, 2007 but that the petition for review was not forwarded to this court with the other petitions in January 2007 for unknown reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">On September 5, 2007, Triumph filed yet another motion to reopen with the BIA. The BIA denied the motion on October 11, 2007, stating that it was, \u201clike its predecessor, both untimely and exceeding the numerical limitations for motions to reopen.\u201d Triumph timely filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision, which this court docketed under Cause No. 07-60881.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">Triumph contends that the IJ and BIA lacked jurisdiction over his \u201cexclusion proceedings\u201d because the IJ erroneously classified him as an \u201carriving alien\u201d or \u201capplicant for admission\u201d when he had in fact already been admitted. The Government concedes that Triumph\u2019s challenge to his classification as an arriving alien presents a question of law, which this court retains jurisdiction to decide under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) despite the otherwise applicable jurisdictional bars in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) and (C). However, Triumph did not present this claim to the BIA, and our jurisdiction is therefore unclear. We pretermit these difficult jurisdictional concerns because Triumph\u2019s arguments are without merit. <em>See Madriz-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 321, 327-28 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Triumph\u2019s classification claim is belied by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), which provides that \u201c[a]n alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States shall not be regai'ded as seeking an admission into the United States for purposes of the immigration laws ... unless the alien ... has committed an offense identified in section 1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d Triumph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>does not dispute that his 1994 conviction for larceny was for a crime of moral turpitude under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Therefore, the BIA properly \u201cregarded [Triumph] as seeking an admission into the United States\u201d even though he had previously been \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Triumph contends that the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s finding that he was inadmissible. He argues that his pri- or convictions should not have been used as the basis for finding him inadmissible because they were not final. Under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) and (D), we only have jurisdiction over the questions of law and constitutional claims raised by Triumph. To the extent Triumph makes a challenge to the factual basis for his removal, we dismiss his petition in part for lack of jurisdiction. To the extent we have jurisdiction to address his arguments, Triumph is not entitled to relief because a conviction remains effective for immigration purposes even if a direct appeal is pending. <em>See Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 284, 290 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Triumph contends that his treatment in removal proceedings as an arriving alien violated the terms of the extradition treaty between the United States and Canada, but because he never raised this claim before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir. 2001). Triumph has failed to brief any argument with respect to his petition for review of the the BIA\u2019s September 28, 2006 denial of his motion for reconsideration, and he has thus abandoned the issue. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987)). Triumph argues that the BIA\u2019s October 11, 2007 denial of his motion to reopen was an abuse of discretion because the BIA should have exercised its authority to reopen his case sua sponte under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). We have no jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal sua sponte to exercise its general authority to reopen or reconsider a case under \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir. 2008). Because Triumph has otherwise failed to brief any argument against the BIA\u2019s October 11, 2007 denial of his motion to reopen, he has abandoned any cognizable challenge to this ruling as well. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Because this case does not present exceptional circumstances, we deny Triumph\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Triumph moves this court to file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s January 3, 2007 denial of his second motion to reopen, which he asserts was timely filed in the Second Circuit. However, Triumph has failed to show that such a petition was timely filed. <em>See Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1986). Accordingly, we deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Triumph seeks leave to supplement the administrative record with copies of documents reflecting the IJ\u2019s ruling on his bond motion and challenge to his status as an \u201carriving alien\u201d as well as Triumph\u2019s attempted interlocutory appeal of that motion. However, we must \u201cdecide the petition [for review] only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). Accordingly, we deny this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">We also deny Triumph\u2019s motion to compel production of the supplemental administrative record, his motion for remand for correction of the administrative, his motion for leave to supplement his motion to remand, and his motion to expedite his motion for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
