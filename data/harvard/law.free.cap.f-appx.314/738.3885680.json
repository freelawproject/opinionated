The district court sentenced Vega to two concurrent terms of 30 months of imprisonment. Vega now appeals his sentence. He argues that the district court erred by denying him a two-level adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b) (2007) based upon his status as a minor participant in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Vega\u2019s argument that he qualified for the minor participant adjustment because he was a mere courier of drugs is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 434 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Pofahl, </em>990 F.2d 1456, 1485 (5th Cir.1993). Rather, such a role is \u201can indispensable part\u201d of drug related offenses. <em>See United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989). The district court determined that Vega\u2019s role was essential to the offense and also observed that Vega provided law enforcement officials inconsistent statements. The district court thus rejected Vega\u2019s assertion regarding his offense role in light of the totality of the circumstances presented by Vega\u2019s case. The district court\u2019s determination concerning Vega\u2019s role in the offense is plausible in light of the record and thus is not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 comment. (n.3(C)); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
