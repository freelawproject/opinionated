Because Coleman was sentenced to an applicable statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, resulting in a sentence that ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1, he was precluded from receiving a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In November of 1992, Coleman was indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of distributing, and possessing with the intent to distribute, five grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Counts One and Two) Rl-2. Prior to Coleman\u2019s trial, the government filed an information, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, giving notice that, based on Coleman\u2019s prior state conviction on charges of selling, distributing, and possessing dangerous drugs, it would seek the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 20 years on Counts One and Two, under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(ii). Rl-12. In March of 1993, Coleman was convicted by a jury on both counts of the indictment. R1M4.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) held Coleman liable for 130 grams of crack cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 32. PSI \u00b6 12. Based on a total offense level of 30, and a criminal history category of III, the calculated guideline range was 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 32, 45. However, because a mandatory minimum term of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment applied as a result of Coleman\u2019s prior felony drug conviction, this was determined to be the applicable guideline sentence. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 45. In accordance with the applicable mandatory minimum, Coleman was sentenced to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. Rl-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">On 22 January 2008, Coleman filed the instant \u00a7 3582 motion, seeking a modification of his imposed term of imprisonment. Rl-99. He asserted that he was eligible for a reduction in his sentence based on Amendment 706, which lowered the offense levels in crack cocaine cases by two levels. <em>Id. </em>at 2. He further contended that the district court was required to re-sentence him in accordance with the two-level offense level reduction and consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing an appropriate amended sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The government responded that the motion was premature, as the amendment would not become effective until 3 March 2008. Rl-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">The district court denied Coleman\u2019s motion, finding that the mandatory minimum sentence imposed was greater than the applicable guideline range, and, therefore, Coleman was not eligible for a reduction. R 1-104. Coleman filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that, \u201c[o]nce the authority to re-visit the sentence has been triggered,\u201d the court was required to ensure that his amended sentence was consistent with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements, which were advisory only. Rl-105 at 1-2. He contended that, pursuant to a \u00a7 3582 re-sentencing, the district court first must determine what the guideline sentence would have been if the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>guidelines applied, and then the court must determine whether to exercise its discretion in consideration of \u201call relevant statutory sentencing factors that exist at the time of re-sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. The district court summarily denied Coleman\u2019s motion for reconsideration for the reasons stated in its earlier order. R 1-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">On appeal, Coleman contends that, in the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) re-sentencing, he can seek relief from the mandatory minimum sentence that was applied to him, through 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and (f), as a re-sentencing of this nature \u201cclearly require[s] the court to impose a sentence based upon its evaluation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 4-5. Accordingly, Coleman states that he is seeking to be sentenced under \u00a7 3553(a), as required by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although his argument is difficult to discern, Coleman appears to contend that, because the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements limit the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 as the court can only consider these factors if a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under the amendment, and not all crack cocaine offenders are eligible and will receive the benefit of the court\u2019s consideration of these factors \u2014 it creates a mandatory sentencing system and violates the mandates of <em>Booker. </em>Finally, Coleman states that, not to apply the amendment\u2019s reduction to all crack cocaine offenders\u2014 including those who were sentenced as career offenders or pursuant to a mandatory minimum \u2014 violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). However, where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, review is <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003). Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2) (emphasis added). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">Amendment 706, which reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by two levels, became effective 1 November 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The Amendment was made retroactive as of 3 March 2007, by incorporation into U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the retroactive effect of Amendment 706 allows a defendant whose guideline imprisonment range was determined in accordance with the offense level calculations under \u00a7 2D1.1 to seek a reduction in his sentence, a defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). This occurs where, as here, the defendant was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l) (noting that defendant is not eligible for reduction, even if amendment is listed in subsection (c), if \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment)\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Black, </em>523 F.3d 892, 892-93 (8th Cir.2008) (affirming the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 3582 motion because defendant was sentenced in accordance with the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, and courts are not authorized to sentence below statutory minimum sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In making the determination of whether to apply a retroactive amendment to an eligible defendant, the district court must: (1) substitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range; and (2) consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). If a defendant is not eligible because an amendment is not applicable, however, the district court is not required to engage in this two-step analysis. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.1) (\u201cEligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment listed in subsection (c) that lowers the applicable guideline range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Here, the applicable guideline imprisonment range of 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment was lower than the statutory mandatory minimum term of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment that applied based on Coleman\u2019s prior felony drug conviction. <em>See </em>PSI at \u00b645. Accordingly, the mandatory minimum became the guideline sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b) (\u201cWhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d). The court sentenced Coleman to the mandatory minimum term of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, and, thus, his sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1. Therefore, Coleman is precluded from receiving a reduction in his sentence, and, therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Furthermore, contrary to Coleman\u2019s argument that he was entitled to be resen-tenced in consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, his guideline range \u2014 which, pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.1(b), was 240 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 was not lowered by an amendment, and therefore, he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.1); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b). Accordingly, the district court was not required to engage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>in the two-step analysis through which it would exercise its \u00a7 3553(a) discretion in determining whether or not to reduce his sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l). Coleman\u2019s assertions that the mandates of <em>Booker </em>are violated because the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements create a mandatory sentencing system by limiting the ability of the district court to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, likewise, are without merit. The district court is required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), thus preserving the court\u2019s sentencing discretion, but Coleman was not eligible for this reduction, and therefore, the court was not required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Finally, to the extent that Coleman seeks to challenge the constitutionality of Amendment 706, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not the proper avenue through which to raise these issues, as a motion of this type is limited to seeking a modification of a sentence based on a sentencing range that has been lowered. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Instead, Coleman could raise these claims in a motion to vacate, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the district court properly denied Coleman\u2019s motion brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 for reduction of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-5\">.
