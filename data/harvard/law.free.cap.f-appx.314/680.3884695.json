Parisie filed his \u00a7 1983 suit against various prison doctors, officials, and employees of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, seeking redress for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the injuries he asserts that he suffered as a result of the conditions of his confinement in Unit 32 at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman. Parisie has also filed a motion to dismiss the appellees\u2019 letter brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting a party\u2019s summary judgment motion. <em>Hernandez v. Velasquez, </em>522 F.3d 556, 560 (5th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate if the record discloses \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). In making this determination, we review the evidence and the inferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Hernandez, </em>522 F.3d at 560. If the moving party meets his burden of showing that no genuine issue exists, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to produce evidence or set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Parisie contends that he is entitled to compensatory damages because he \u201cproved conclusively that he developed hypertension as a result of his unconstitutional confinement under inhumane conditions\u201d in Unit 32. Parisie does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he was not entitled to injunctive relief or punitive damages. Moreover, he concedes that he is not entitled to punitive damages. In failing to challenge the district court\u2019s findings or to identify any error in the district court\u2019s judgment regarding his claims for injunctive relief and punitive damages, Parisie has abandoned these claims on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (noting that even pro se appellants must brief arguments to preserve them); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a); <em>see also Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (noting that the failure to identify any error in court\u2019s analysis is the same as if appellant had not appealed the judgment). Parisie also does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he failed to state a cause of action against Dr. Kim Myung for deliberate indifference to his medical needs, and he has also abandoned that issue on appeal. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">As for his claim for compensatory damages, Parisie asserts that he was diagnosed in March 2003 with hypertension, which he contends resulted from the conditions of his confinement in Unit 32. Parisie attached medical records in support of his contention that indicate that \u201chypertension\u201d was noted on his chart in March 2003. However, Parisie admitted in his original complaint that he had taken medication for high blood pressure prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Although this court reviews the evidence and the inferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, <em>see Hernandez, </em>522 F.3d at 560, we have recognized that a district court is, nevertheless, free to grant summary judgment if it concludes that the evidence presented in support of a position is \u201cinsufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the position more likely than not is true.\u201d <em>See Michaels v. Avitech, Inc., </em>202 F.3d 746, 755 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Because the evidence presented by Pari-sie is insufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that his hypertension was caused by the conditions of his confinement, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment. Parisie\u2019s motion to strike the appellees\u2019 brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b705-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
