We require that arguments be briefed in order to be preserved; issues not adequately briefed are deemed abandoned. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003) (issues not raised in alien\u2019s petition for review of decision by BIA deemed abandoned). When an appellant, like Romero-Flores, fails to identify any error in the analysis of the judgment from which he appeals, it \u201cis the same as if he had not appealed that judgment.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Romero-Flores has not argued or briefed the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as untimely filed, the only issue arguably before this court. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b655-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
