We review a summary judgment <em>de novo. Allen v. Bd. of Pub. Educ., </em>495 F.3d 1306, 1310 (11th Cir.2007). Navarro argues that he was individually engaged in interstate commerce because the automotive parts that he transported and used to repair vehicles continued to flow in interstate commerce until they reached the customers of Broney Automotive Repairs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Navarro has not established that he was \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d under the Fair Labor Standards Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). To receive overtime compensation, Navarro had to \u201cparticipate] in the actual movement of persons or things in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Thome v. All Restoration Servs., Inc., </em>448 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2006). Navarro\u2019s responsibilities \u201cmerely affect[ed]\u201d and did not implicate interstate commerce. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Navarro was hired to collect motor parts that had been ordered by the owners of Broney Automotive from local auto parts stores and to use the parts to repair foreign and domestic vehicles. The automotive parts were removed from the flow of interstate commerce when they arrived at the auto parts stores. <em>See id. </em>at 1267 (\u201cWhen goods reach the customer for whom they were intended, the interstate journey ends....\u201d). The later transport and installation of the parts into the vehicles of Broney\u2019s customers by Navarro was purely intrastate activity and \u201cnot covered under the Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">The summary judgment in favor of Bro-ney Automotive is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
