The BIA and the IJ denied the Aguilars\u2019 claim for asylum as time-barred pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Both the BIA and the IJ found that the Aguilars had not met their burden for asylum and, as a result, had necessarily failed to meet the more stringent burden for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">In their petition, the Aguilars argue that the BIA and the IJ erred in making an adverse credibility determination and in finding that they did not meet the burdens for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al-Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt any part of the IJ\u2019s decision, but it affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and agreed with its reasoning in its own opinion. As a result, we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that an asylum applicant filed an untimely application and failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely filing. <em>Fahim v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002). Here, both the BIA and the IJ found that the Aguilars\u2019 applications were untimely and that they had failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimeliness. Accordingly, we decline to review the BIA\u2019s denial of the Aguilars\u2019 claim for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we must affirm the decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weighfing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Lorisme v. I.N.S., </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)). We review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>agency\u2019s decision and may not overturn findings of fact unless the record compels it. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of DHS has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2k\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. An asylum applicant may not show merely that he has a political opinion, but must show that he was persecuted because of that opinion. <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have held that \u201cpersecution,\u201d as used to illustrate that an alien has suffered past persecution, \u201cis an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">If the alien establishes past persecution, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to the country of removal unless the government shows by a preponderance that the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened or that the alien could relocate within the country and it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b), 208.16(b). An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum if he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(2), 208.16(b)(2). To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear,\u201d an applicant must show that he has a fear of persecution in his home country and that \u201c[tjhere is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he or she were to return to that country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i). We have opined that \u201cthe precise contours of the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 inquiry continue to evolve.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. However, we have held that \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn asylum applicant\u2019s voluntary return to his or her home country is a relevant consideration in determining whether the asylum applicant has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1011 (11th Cir.2008). An applicant\u2019s claim of persecution may be weakened or undermined by a voluntary return to a home country. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>When a petitioner fails to \u201cestablish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4. This is because the standard for withholding of removal is significantly higher than the asylum standard. <em>See Al-Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[T]his court may not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818. In order to review a credibility determination, the IJ or BIA must explicitly state that the applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">[T]he IJ [or BIA] must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s [or BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. A credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\"><em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Id. </em>\u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, if an applicant produces evidence other than his testimony, \u201cit is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The record here demonstrates that both the BIA and the IJ explicitly found that Arelis\u2019s testimony was not credible and gave specific, cogent reasons for discrediting Arelis\u2019s testimony. Moreover, because the record shows that much of Arelis\u2019s testimony was vague, implausible, and inconsistent, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s determination that her testimony was not credible. Additionally, because the Aguilars presented only weak evidence, apart from Arelis\u2019s testimony, to support their claims for asylum and withholding of removal, there was substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s determination that the Agui-lars failed to meet the burden for asylum and, accordingly, failed to meet the more stringent burden for withholding of removal. As a result, we cannot say that the record compels reversal of the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s finding that the Aguilars failed to meet the burden for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">For the above-stated reasons, we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-10\">. The Aguilars have not raised the issue of the denial of their CAT claim on appeal. Accordingly, they have abandoned the argument, and we will not review the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
