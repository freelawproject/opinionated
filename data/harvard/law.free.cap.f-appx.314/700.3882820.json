After enhancing Andino-Valenzu-lea\u2019s offense level by 16 levels because of his prior conviction for aggravated battery under Georgia law, the district court sentenced Andino-Valenzulea to 46 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-22\">On appeal he contends that his Georgia conviction was not for a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because it was neither for an offense enumerated in that Guideline nor for an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. Andino-Valenzulea asserts that the relevant Georgia statute requires that the perpetrator achieve certain harmful results but not necessarily through the use of force. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-24(a). Additionally, Andino-Valenzulea disputes the government\u2019s contention that aggravated battery under Georgia law is sufficiently similar to the enumerated offense of aggravated assault as to constitute a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>As Andino-Valenzulea did not object to the enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Dupre, </em>117 F.3d 810, 817 (5th Cir.1997). The determination of whether the district court plainly erred in enhancing a sentence depends on \u201chow this court and other courts interpreted [the Guideline]\u201d at the time of sentencing. <em>United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>415 F.3d 452, 455 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We have not previously decided whether a sentence may be enhanced on account of a prior conviction of aggravated battery under Georgia law or whether the Georgia crime of aggravated battery is sufficiently similar to the enumerated offense of aggravated assault as to constitute a crime of violence. Nor have the parties pointed us to any decisions of this court that compel a particular result in this case, such as decisions construing similar statutes of other states. Accordingly, given that the law of this circuit was uncertain at the time of Andino-Valenzulea\u2019s sentencing, any error in enhancing Andino-Valenzulea\u2019s sentence could not have been plain. <em>Id. </em>at 455-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b724-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
