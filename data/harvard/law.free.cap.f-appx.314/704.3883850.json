He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, seeking a two-level sentencing reduction based on the retroactive Amendment 706 to the crack cocaine guidelines. The district court denied the motion on the ground that Roberts\u2019 offense of conviction did not involve, and his sentence was not based upon, crack cocaine. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-20\">Roberts renews his argument that he was entitled to a sentencing reduction based on the retroactive crack cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>amendments, asserting that his sentence was based on crack cocaine. Although the presentence report (PSR) indicates that Roberts\u2019 offense level was initially calculated based upon quantities of numerous drugs, including crack cocaine, the Addendum to the PSR recalculated his offense level based solely on methamphetamine and powder cocaine, and the sentence imposed was based only on quantities of those drugs. As the district court correctly determined, because Roberts\u2019 guidelines range was not derived from a quantity of crack cocaine, he was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that ha[d] subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Roberts\u2019 claim that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and his post conviction rehabilitative efforts is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201c[Section 3582(c)(2)] only applies to retroactive guideline amendments.\u201d). Roberts\u2019 argument that the sentence imposed is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors is similarly not properly brought in this appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 3682(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Roberts\u2019 motion for the production of the sentencing transcript at Government expense is denied as moot because the district court already granted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b729-12\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
