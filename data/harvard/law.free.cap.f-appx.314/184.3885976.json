Wells, through counsel, appeals from his 60-month sentence for violation of supervised release. On appeal, Wells argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable because: (1) the district court should have considered the policy statements contained in U.S.S.G. Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, even though they are not binding on the district court; and (2) the district court failed to consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-19\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Reasonableness \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cThe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Where a defendant under supervised release possesses a controlled substance, he is subject to mandatory revocation of his supervised release and a prison term not in excess of the statutory maximum. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1). We have previously determined that when revocation of supervised release is mandatory under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g), the statute does not require consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1241 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that where revocation of supervised release is mandatory under 18 U.S.C. 3583(g)(1), the district court is not required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors) (citing <em>United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1095 (5th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Although not mentioned by the district court, Wells\u2019s revocation was mandatory under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1). Thus, to the extent that Wells argues that the district court did not adequately consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in sentencing him, that argument fails because the district court was not required to consider those factors as Wells\u2019s revocation for drug possession was mandatory. <em>Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">However, even if the district court were required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the record reflects that the district court did consider them, and further, that Wells\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable in light of those factors. Prior to imposing sentence, the district court acknowledged the recommended Guidelines range and stated that it had considered the statements of the parties and the information contained in the violation report. Indeed, \u201cthe district court need only acknowledge that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and need not discuss each of these factors in either the sentencing hearing or in the sentencing order.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007) (internal quotation and punctuation omitted); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d). Moreover, the district court made clear that the sentence was intended to deter Wells from future criminal conduct, and to protect the public from Wells. Since the record demonstrates that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>factors prior to imposing Wells\u2019s 60-month sentence, his sentence is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
