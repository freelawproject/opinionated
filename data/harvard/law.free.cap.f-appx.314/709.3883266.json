This enhancement was based on a determination that Perez-Barra\u2019s prior conviction for indecency with a child under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and, thus, a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). We have previously held that a conviction for indecency with a child under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) qualifies as a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Najera-N ajera, </em>519 F.3d 509, 512 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-23\">Perez-Barra also argues that his sentence was unreasonable and that the district court failed to adequately explain his sentence. When, as in this case, a district court chooses to impose a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, that sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and little explanation is required, <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). We conclude that Perez-Barra has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness and that the district court\u2019s explanation was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
