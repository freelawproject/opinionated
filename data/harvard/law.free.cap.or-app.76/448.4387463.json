His appeal assigns error to the admission of testimony concerning two prior incidents, one a crime and the other a noncriminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Defendant telephoned the police at 9:06 a.m. on November 20, 1983, to report that his wife had accidentally been shot in the bedroom of their home. The police arrived at the scene shortly thereafter and discovered the victim on the bed, lying on her back with her head on a pillow. A .38 revolver and four cartridges were on the bed near the victim\u2019s knees. She was taken to the hospital, where she died the next day. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be a gunshot wound to the back of the head. The bullet\u2019s trajectory was almost straight from the back to the front of the head, and it lodged above her left eye. The state\u2019s evidence was that the gun was fired from a distance of about six inches to two and one-half feet from the muzzle to the victim\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Police officers described defendant as upset, in shock, nervous and talkative when they arrived. One officer observed a small drop of blood on his finger and a gray, sparkly substance on his hand. Another officer observed \u201cflat black stains\u201d on defendant\u2019s hands and \u201csome dark gray fine crystalline powder residue on the right index finger area and the area up to the webbing of the thumb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Defendant told the officer that the black stains came from polishing shoes; a pair of black shoes wet with polish was nearby. The officers believed that the gray powder was gunpowder residue. The police did not test the substance on defendant\u2019s hand, because he washed his hands in the restroom at the police station, despite an officer\u2019s direction to him not to wash his hands. No trace of gunpowder residue was found on either defendant\u2019s or the victim\u2019s hands in subsequent testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Defendant described the incident as an accidental shooting. Defendant did not testify, but his version was presented to the jury through his tape recorded statement to the police, his videotaped re-enactments of his story and an officer\u2019s testimony relating statements defendant made soon after the police arrived at the scene. Defendant returned home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>from his graveyard shift as a security guard shortly after 8:00 a.m. He did some things in the apartment before he entered the dark bedroom. As he walked toward the bed, there was a bright flash and a loud bang. He realized it was a gunshot and said, \u201cShit, don\u2019t, it\u2019s me,\u201d and lunged for the gun. He tried to take the gun out of his wife\u2019s hand and, as he landed on the bed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">\u201c* * * her arm just seemed to flop up against the pillow and there was a hell of a bang and she just started to moan and the first finger nearest my thumb on my right hand started to vibrate and she started to quiver and shake and I just grabbed the gun and uh opened the cylinder and just threw it down on the bed and raced around the end of the bed, grabbed the telephone and rang 911. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Defendant said that his hand was on the weapon when it discharged. The police found a bullet in the wall which had passed through a closet door and appeared to have been fired from the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In sum, defendant\u2019s explanation was that his wife shot at him as he entered their bedroom and that, while he was attempting to wrest the weapon from her hand, the gun discharged the fatal shot. The evidence would support an inference either that the victim shot at defendant, thinking he was an intruder, or that she intended to kill him. Defendant\u2019s story is corroborated by the bullet fired into the closet, and his description of the fatal shooting is physically possible. Analysis of the weapon failed to identify fingerprints of either defendant or the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The prosecution presented evidence concerning defendant\u2019s motive to kill his wife and attempted to discredit his explanation of the alleged accident both by arguing that his version was physically implausible and by introducing evidence of prior bad acts to establish intent in this case. Evidence admitted without objection establishes the following. Several witnesses testified that the victim had told them that she was unhappy in her marriage, wanted defendant to move out and desired to terminate the marriage. The victim told one witness that defendant had threatened her with guns about nine months before she died and that she was afraid of defendant. The state introduced letters written by the victim to her paramour within six months of her death, in which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>wrote of her dissatisfaction with her marriage and her frustration due to her inability to get defendant to move out. She wrote that she wanted to end the marriage but was \u201cscared\u201d to do it and afraid to file for divorce, because she feared that defendant would try to take her property. She wrote that defendant had threatened her, that she was living in fear for her safety and was afraid that defendant would try to hurt or kill her. She also wrote that defendant was the only person toward whom she had \u201cviolent thoughts\u201d and whom she had \u201cever thought of hurting.\u201d The prosecution also presented evidence that the victim was afraid of guns and did not like having them in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">One witness for the prosecution testified that defendant had stated three months before the victim\u2019s death, \u201cMy wife\u2019s a liability and not an asset and I got to figure out how to get rid of her.\u201d Another witness testified that defendant had told her that \u201cif he ever found his wife with another man he would kill her,\u201d that he subsequently had said he was positive his wife had a lover but he did not carry out his threat. Another witness testified that defendant had told him he was going to New Zealand around Christmas and would have between $80,000 and $100,000 when he returned, which he would like to invest. There were two policies insuring the victim\u2019s life for a total of $80,000 and naming defendant as beneficiary, for which application was made on June 13,1983. Applications for comparable policies insuring defendant\u2019s life and naming the victim as beneficiary were made on the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Defendant sought to establish that the victim knew how to use guns and was not afraid of them. He stated in a videotape that his wife feared intruders and kept a gun next to the bed and that she sometimes placed it under his pillow when he worked nights. Defendant\u2019s expert testified that evidence of gunpowder residue is very fragile and that his test firing of the weapon produced only one to three \u201cflakes,\u201d which were easily removed by blowing on or shaking the hand. He also attempted to cast doubt on the state\u2019s assertion that the bullet was fired at least six inches from the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denying his motions to limit the introduction of two prior acts. We shall deal with each separately. The first was defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>assault on his former wife, Barbara Johns, not the victim in this case, which took place in New Zealand almost six years before the death in this case. Barbara was allowed to testify to the details of that assault, as well as to describe their marital situation and problems as background. In addition, a police officer from New Zealand, who was also an acquaintance of defendant\u2019s, testified about that incident. Both of the witnesses were flown from New Zealand by the state to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The New Zealand incident occurred on December 25, 1977. Defendant and Barbara had been legally separated for about five months at that time. She testified that their financial situation was never good and that she felt that defendant resented the fact that she was the primary provider. Both of them applied to become traffic officers in May, 1977, and Barbara was accepted; defendant was rejected. She felt that he was \u201cvery bitter\u201d about the rejection. She testified that he made several threats to her over the telephone during their separation, including that \u201cif he couldn\u2019t have me no one else could\u201d and \u201cif we couldn\u2019t be together in life he wanted us to be together in death.\u201d She then testified about the incident which occurred on December 25:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">\u00ab* * * About 8:45 on Christmas morning, Philip came to my flat. He walked in and stood with his back to the door, which he closed. In his hands he had a .22 rifle fitted with a silencer. I could see that the weapon was loaded, it had a full clip on the rifle and the bolt at that stage was open. He didn\u2019t say anything. He just stood with his back to the door shaking his head and biting his lip. And I shouted, \u2018No.\u2019 And he cocked the rifle, he pushed the bolt home. I felt that the only way I could get out was to try and either get the gun off him or get through the door which he was blocking. And I grabbed the rifle and tried to wrestle it off him. I started screaming in hopes that somebody would hear me and he yelled at me to shut up. He started hitting me around the head with the rifle. And as a result of that I received later on a stitch to a cut on the back of my head, several other bruises and cuts on the top of my head, which were bleeding quite badly and bruises to the left hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cAt one stage I noticed that the gun was pointing down towards the floor, at a speaker of my stereo, and I tried to pull the trigger. I thought if I could get the bullets out of the chamber that it would give me time to run away, because by that stage we were slightly away from the door. I pulled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>trigger and nothing happened. And Philip yelled, \u2018Of course the safety catch is on.\u2019 So I pushed him and the rifle away and took off and ran to a neighbor\u2019s place for help. As I ran out the door I heard him yell, \u2018All right, you can shoot me then.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">She testified that she \u201cwas convinced that he had come to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The trial court also admitted a letter which defendant subsequently sent to Barbara in which he apologized and tried to explain his actions. Defendant was convicted of \u201ccommon assault\u201d for the incident, the equivalent of a misdemeanor, and placed on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Pickles, a police officer in New Zealand at the time of the incident, testified that he met with defendant later that day. Defendant had phoned the police department after leaving Barbara\u2019s flat, threatened to kill himself and asked to speak with Pickles, who testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201c* * * He was, as I say, had had a domestic problem with his wife. He was very upset at the time, looked very emotionally fragile inasmuch as I felt he had been crying and perhaps could well have been close to tears again. We spoke for some time and he was very concerned about his wife and the marital situation. He was a person that was having emotional problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">\u201cInitially we wanted to know the incident regarding the defendant\u2019s wife, and he explained that he had been to his wife\u2019s house that morning, Christmas morning, and that he had gone there to discuss the marital problems \u2014 well, the problems they were having. He went there with his rifle. He said it was loaded and cocked. And that he gained entry just by walking into the house, the same as his wife would open the door. There was some discussion about the need for the firearm to be there and he told her that there was \u2014 that he was in a depressed state; that he was very low. And he told the Sergeant that he leveled the firearm, the rifle at her and that she grabbed it and there was a struggle. He didn\u2019t actually admit hurting her with the firearm, but he did say that he thought she had been hit several times on the head. He did say that when he pointed the gun at her initially he wanted to shoot her and himself, um, to end their love. He then made a comment that luckily during the struggle the safety catch was on and the gun did not go off. She then broke free from the fight and fled the house. And he left the house as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u201cHe said that after that incident all he then wanted to do was end his own life. And that\u2019s the situation \u2014 that\u2019s how I got involved because he rang the police to say that he was going to shoot himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The state argues that evidence concerning the 1977 incident was properly admitted under OEC 404(3) to prove defendant\u2019s intent and the absence of mistake or accident in the shooting of his second wife. OEC 404(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The first step in reviewing the admissibility of evidence of a prior act is to determine if it is relevant for a noncharacter purpose which is genuinely in issue in the case. Even relevant evidence may be excluded pursuant to OEC 403:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">In this case, the state argues that evidence of the 1977 incident is relevant to prove defendant\u2019s intent to kill his wife in the present case and to disprove the absence of mistake or accident. In this situation, intent and absence of mistake or accident are really the same issue. Proof of intent eliminates mistake or accident. The relevance of evidence of a prior act to prove intent to commit the crime charged derives from the similarity of the two acts so that the jury may reasonably infer from proof of the prior act that the defendant intentionally committed the charged act. This principle was discussed in a leading case interpreting the corresponding federal rules (FRE 403 and 404(b)), <em>United States v. </em>Beechum, 582 F2d 898 (5th Cir 1978), <em>cert den </em>440 US 920 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">\u00ab* * * where the evidence sought to be introduced is an extrinsic offense, its relevance is a function of its similarity to the offense charged. In this regard, however, similarity means more than that the extrinsic and charged offense have a common characteristic. For the purposes of determining relevancy, \u2018a fact is similar to another only when the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>characteristic is the significant one for the purpose of the inquiry at hand.\u2019 * * * Therefore, similarity, and hence relevancy, is determined by the inquiry or issue to which the extrinsic offense is addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">\u201cWhere the issue addressed is the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the offense charged, the relevancy of the extrinsic offense derives from the defendant\u2019s indulging himself in the <em>same state of mind </em>in the perpetration of both the extrinsic and charged offenses. The reasoning is that because the defendant had unlawful intent in the extrinsic offense, it is less likely that he had lawful intent in the present offense. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">&lt;&lt;* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">\u201cOnce it is determined that the extrinsic offense requires the <em>same intent </em>as the charged offense and that the jury could find that the defendant committed the extrinsic offense, the evidence satisfies the first step under rule 404(b). The extrinsic offense is relevant (assuming the jury finds the defendant to have committed it) to an issue other than propensity because it lessens the likelihood that the defendant committed the charged offense with innocent intent. * * * The probative value of the evidence is a matter to be weighed against its potential for undue prejudice, and the similarity of the physical elements of the charged and extrinsic offenses figures in at this stage. Therefore, we turn to the second step of the analysis required by rule 404(b), whether the evidence satisfies rule 403.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">&lt;&lt;* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">\u201c* * * In measuring the probative value of the evidence, the judge should consider the overall similarity of the extrinsic and charged offenses. * * * The judge should also consider how much time separates the extrinsic and charged offenses: temporal remoteness depreciates the probity of the extrinsic offense. * * *\u201d 582 F2d at 911. (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">In trying to demonstrate its relevance, the state and the dissent assert that many features of the 1977 incident are similar to the circumstances of the charged murder. First, they state points to the fact that \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s marriages to Barbara and [the victim] exhibited parallel problems prior to each respective violent incident.\u201d These include defendant\u2019s financial dependence on his wives and his inability to hold a job. In both instances defendant called the police and said that he was contemplating suicide. Second, it states that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u201cphysical circumstances of the two assaults are also similar. * * * In both instances, defendant, armed with a gun, unexpectedly entered his wife\u2019s premises at about 9 a.m.\u201d That statement is not supported by the evidence. In the later incident, defendant and his wife were still living together, so he did not \u201cunexpectedly enter his wife\u2019s premises.\u201d Neither is there evidence here that he entered the house armed with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The state concludes its argument by stating, \u201cAll of the evidence, taken as a whole, demonstrates that, both in 1977 and in 1983, defendant faced similar circumstances in his marriage and reacted in a similar fashion toward his wife.\u201d The state, in effect, argues that evidence that defendant reacted to a marital separation from his wife in 1977 by assaulting her with a rifle is \u201chighly probative\u201d of his intent to murder his wife six years later when they also were experiencing a period of marital stress. It states that \u201c[t]he most probable inference * * * is that defendant, when faced with a disintegrating marriage, reacts in a life-threatening manner against his wife.\u201d We think that the evidence is only relevant \u201cto prove the character of [defendant] in order to show that [he] acted in conformity therewith.\u201d That is precisely the purpose for which evidence is <em>not </em>admissible under OEC 404(3). <em>See </em>Teitelbaum and Hertz, \u201cEvidence of Other Crimes as Proof of Intent,\u201d 13 N Mex L Rev 423 (1983); Roth, \u201cUnderstanding Admissibility of Prior Bad Acts: A Diagrammatic Approach,\u201d 9 Pepp L Rev 297 (1982). It is not relevant to the issue of his intent to kill his wife in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Evidence of the 1977 incident has no relevance to defendant\u2019s state of mind on November 20, 1983. First, in 1977, defendant did not kill his wife; he was convicted only of assault. Although Barbara testified that <em>she </em>thought defendant had intended to kill her, that is not the only possible conclusion as to defendant\u2019s state of mind. Because it is not clear that defendant possessed the intent to kill in the 1977 incident, the evidence could not be probative of his acting with that intent for the crime charged. Second, the circumstances of the 1977 incident are not really very similar to those in this case. In 1977, defendant was separated from his wife. Legal separation in New Zealand facilitates a divorce. Defendant\u2019s marriage to Barbara was actually ending; the relationship was not simply having problems, as was the case in his marriage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the victim. Defendant came to Barbara\u2019s separate apartment armed with a rifle; in this case the alleged killing took place in defendant\u2019s bedroom, with a revolver. We conclude that the 1977 incident is not probative of defendant\u2019s intent to murder his wife in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Even if there were adequate relevance, it is, as a matter of law, substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, and the evidence should have been excluded. The dissimilarity of the two incidents and the temporal remoteness of the 1977 incident lessen its probative value. The evidence was highly prejudicial in that it suggests an unfair basis for conviction: that defendant is the sort of person who assaults, and tries to kill, his wives. That is the kind of evidence which OEC 404(3) is intended to exclude. <em>State v. Peacock, </em>75 Or App 217, 706 P2d 982 (1985); <em>State v. Parks, </em>71 Or App 630, 693 P2d 657 (1985). We conclude that the ruling was outside the permissible range of discretion. <em>Carter v. Moberly, </em>263 Or 193, 501 P2d 1276 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">There is another factor in the admission of the evidence which troubles us and militates against its admissibility. In this case, evidence that defendant in fact pulled the trigger as well as evidence of his state of mind is circumstantial. It appears that evidence of the 1977 incident could be used to infer defendant\u2019s <em>act </em>as well as his mental state, a use which is also impermissible under OEC 404(3). In <em>State v. Sicks, </em>33 Or App 435, 576 P2d 834 (1978), we held that evidence of the defendant\u2019s similar acts of sodomy were not admissible to prove his intent in the crime charged. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">\u201c* * * Although the state must establish not only that defendant performed the alleged acts, but also that he did so with the requisite culpable mental element, the better view is that evidence of similar acts with other persons will not be admitted for this purpose simply because defendant has pled not guilty. * * * Where the charged acts, if proven, would by themselves strongly indicate the required state of mind, evidence of other similar acts should generally be admitted only if defendant concedes the alleged act but claims that it was inadvertent or innocent. * * *\u201d 33 Or App at 438.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In this case, defendant did not concede that he fired the weapon, and evidence of the prior assault (which is not a very similar act) is not admissible to prove his intent when it could also be used impermissibly to imply that he did the act charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Defendant\u2019s second assignment disputes the admission of evidence concerning another act. Seven months before the victim\u2019s being shot, two women who lived in defendant\u2019s neighborhood went to his home to look at his two handguns, because they were considering buying a gun. They testified that defendant explained how to use a gun. He took the bullets out of the cylinder in their presence. He also made statements to the effect that, if they used the gun against a burglar, they should make sure the burglar was in the house and they should shoot to kill, not maim. The following testimony was also elicited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">\u201cA. After he finished showing us the gun, and he was still explaining about it, I asked him about the importance of a safety. The guns that I had seen prior at one of the retail stores had a safety on it. And I asked him about the safety and rattled off a couple questions why it was important. And the gun at the time was in his hand and pointed towards the floor. And he raised the gun to my face and fired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cQ. And what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\u201cA. It flipped me out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201cQ. What response, if any, did he have after doing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201cA. He seemed to be humored by it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">\u201cQ. How did he seem to be humored by it? What did he express?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t remember what he said. But he thought it was funny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">The witness also testified that defendant had said, \u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d referring to the need for a safety, when he pointed the gun at her and pulled the trigger. The two women stated that defendant\u2019s wife was present in the room during the encounter, sat in a chair without speaking and did not seem to be startled by what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">The state argues, in support of admissibility of this evidence under OEC 404(3), that it was relevant to show, first, defendant\u2019s and the victim\u2019s \u201cstates of mind regarding firearms and, second, the matter [of] firearm safety in the context of their marriage.\u201d Regarding the victim\u2019s state of mind, the state argues that it shows why she would be uncomfortable with firearms in the house. The only aspect of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>state of mind which was in issue was her fear of firearms, which could bear on the credibility of defendant\u2019s story that his wife shot at him. This evidence is not probative of her state of mind in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The state also argues that this evidence shows that defendant \u201cwas a firm believer in shooting someone in the safety of the home\u201d and in \u201cshooting to kill.\u201d It adds that \u201cit is extremely noteworthy that defendant would demonstrate his attitude towards guns by pointing a gun at a woman\u2019s head and pulling the trigger, just as he did to his wife when the revolver was loaded.\u201d The state\u2019s argument reveals that its true, only thinly-veiled purpose in offering the evidence was to show an element of defendant\u2019s character to imply conduct in conformity therewith. The evidence is relevant only to show defendant\u2019s attitude toward guns and his using them to scare women. It is not relevant to any issue properly in this case. The only state of mind in issue was defendant\u2019s intent when he allegedly shot his wife. His attitude towards guns and gun safety was not in issue. The evidence was totally irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial and should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Having concluded that evidence of the two prior acts was erroneously admitted, we must now determine if that can be considered harmless error. Under Article VII (amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution, we are to affirm the judgment despite any errors committed if we are of the opinion \u201cthat the judgment * * * appealed from was such as should have been rendered in the case * * There are two requirements for affirmance despite error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u201c* * * (1) that there was substantial and convincing evidence of guilt; and (2) that the error committed was very unlikely to have changed the result of the trial. * * *\u201d <em>State v. Van Hooser, </em>266 Or 19, 25, 511 P2d 359 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em>See also State v. Miller, </em>300 Or 203, 709 P2d 225 (1985). We also are mindful of the admonition in <em>State v. Pruitt, </em>34 Or App 957, 962, 580 P2d 201, <em>rev den </em>283 Or 235 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\u00ab* * * in deciding if the conviction should be affirmed despite the error, we do not try the case de novo to determine if the defendant was proven guilty absent the challenged evidence; to do so would effectively deny the defendant a right to a jury trial on issues of fact * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">We cannot say that evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>substantial and convincing. Although the state\u2019s case was a strong one, defendant\u2019s explanation was not without support in the record; it could have been believed. All of the inculpatory evidence was circumstantial, and defendant\u2019s explanation was plausible and not overwhelmingly refuted. Neither can we say that the erroneously admitted evidence was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to have affected the result of the trial. Evidence of defendant\u2019s prior acts was highly prejudicial in portraying him as a bad tempered man who reacts to marital stress with violence and who has a cavalier attitude toward the use of firearms. It suggested an improper basis for conviction. The evidence, improperly admitted under OEC 404(3), could very well have been considered by the jury as bearing on defendant\u2019s guilt of the crime charged. The state\u2019s claim that the evidence did not likely affect the outcome of the trial rings hollow when one considers the expense which the prosecution incurred in transporting and hosting two witnesses from New Zealand. Obviously, the state thought that the evidence was very important to its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b501-5\">ROSSMAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Because I believe that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence and that his ruling was well within the reasonable and permissible range, and because I also believe that the admission of such evidence, if error, was harmless and does not require reversal, I would affirm. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Because a finding that any error was harmless would necessarily resolve this case, I will address that issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Even if the majority is correct that the trial judge committed error when he admitted the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence, we need not \u2014 and should not \u2014 reverse this conviction. Under Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution, and under the case law correctly cited by the majority, an appellate court must affirm despite error if two conditions are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">(1) There is substantial and convincing evidence of guilt,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>(2) The error was unlikely to have changed the result of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">This is the doctrine of \u201charmless error.\u201d In the face of the other overwhelming evidence of guilt and the unlikelihood that the exclusion of the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence would have changed the outcome, we should unhesitatingly apply it to this case. If ever there was a clear case for its application, this is it.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The trial resulted in a mountainous record, encompassing the testimony of 60 witnesses, over 190 exhibits, and over 1,700 pages of transcript and involved countless rulings by the trial judge. Perhaps the most salient indication of the eminent thoroughness and fairness of this proceeding is the fact that defendant was able to muster only one complaint about the conduct of the trial \u2014 the admission of the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence, which was a relatively small part of the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The key element in a murder prosecution is <em>intent. </em>Intent is an operation of the mind. It is the equivalent of purpose. Without a confession or admission by the defendant, the only way to determine what is going on in the inner reaches of his mind is to examine his acts, conduct and other <em>circumstances </em>attending the particular act. From that examination, his mind can be read. The fact that such evidence may be <em>wholly </em>circumstantial \u2014 as the majority describes the evidence in this case \u2014 in no way reduces its probative value. It is important to be mindful that murder is not staged. Neither is it a spectator event designed to produce a perfect case for the prosecution. The best witness that the state could present in this case is dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">It is with this backdrop that I will review what I believe to be the substantial and convincing evidence demonstrating defendant\u2019s guilt, keeping in mind that the state\u2019s theory is death by intentional homicide, while defendant\u2019s theory is death by accidental shooting by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Defendant postulates that the victim fired two shots, the first at him, which lodged in the wall and a second, fatal shot into her own head. Although two bullets were found (one through a closet door and one in the victim\u2019s head) experts were unable to determine which of the shots was fired first. Neither the victim\u2019s nor defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>on the gun. The victim\u2019s hands did not have gun powder residue on them. Defendant\u2019s hands did. Two police officers testified that they observed a black powdery substance which they identified as gun powder residue on defendant\u2019s right middle finger, index finger and thumb. One police officer testified that he recognized the gun powder pattern on defendant\u2019s hand as consistent with that on his own hand after he had fired his revolver. The police warned defendant not to wash his hands, but he washed them before tests could confirm the officiers\u2019 observations. The officers handling the gun testified that the gun was very dirty with gun powder residue. A test firing of the gun by the state\u2019s expert left distinctive markings of gun powder residue on the inner surface of the expert\u2019s hand, particularly the index finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Defendant\u2019s forensic expert initially testified on direct examination that test firing of the gun, using ammunition from defendant\u2019s house, left only one or two flakes of residue. However, under cross examination, he stated that, in an earlier test using lab ammunition, \u201csome residue\u201d was deposited on the hands but that it was not black. He was then asked to read his report which stated that \u201csome residue was deposited on the hand, however, the hands were not completely blackened by the residue.\u201d In any event, the question is: Why did defendant\u2019s hands get dirty while those of the victim, who supposedly fired both shots, stayed clean?</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">A pillow found under the victim had distinctive gun powder patterns. Defendant told the police in one version of the shooting that his hand was on the gun when the second, fatal shot was fired. The prosecution\u2019s expert tried to replicate the gun powder pattern by simulating a hand over the barrel of the gun. When he test fired it, a different pattern emerged. Only when the gun was fired uncovered did the gun powder pattern on the test pillow replicate the original.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Those tests also showed that the gun could not have been fired when pressed hard into the pillow, a position of the gun consistent with one of the defense\u2019s theories. Only if the gun was held adjacent to or lightly placed on the pillow did the test shot replicate the actual pattern of gun powder on the victim\u2019s pillow.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Experts testified that the gun was fired with the muzzle from six inches to two and one-half feet from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>victim\u2019s head. The bullet\u2019s trajectory was almost level or straight, back to front, across the top left side of the brain. Defendant\u2019s theory would require the victim to have the gun in her right hand. It seems highly unlikely that the victim\u2019s hand could have been contorted into such a position as to enable her to shoot herself in the back left side of the head with the muzzle at least six inches away.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">There is, of course, the matter of defendant\u2019s gratuitous video \u201creenactment\u201d of the event according to the way he remembered it. Suffice it to say that, in the light of the contrary physical evidence and simple common sense, defendant\u2019s manipulation of the victim\u2019s arm and hand into a self-inflicting position with a resulting lateral wound is too farfetched for even the most fertile imagination. As the state notes in its brief, defendant\u2019s demonstration of how his wife accidentally killed herself is reminiscent of Rose Mary Woods\u2019 demonstration of how she inadvertently erased 18 minutes of White House tapes and is even less credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The state\u2019s theory of an intentional shooting is confirmed by the physical evidence; the defense theory requires that we not only discount the physical evidence but also that we believe that the victim mistook her husband for an intruder and shot at him and missed, at 9 a.m., in good daylight, a few minutes after she had spoken with him and after, as the evidence indicates, he had already been in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Defendant\u2019s multiple accounts of what happened were also inconsistent. In some, he \u201cdove for cover\u201d and \u201chit the floor\u201d; in others, he tripped and fell forward on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Not only does the physical evidence strongly support the theory of an intentional shooting, but the record is replete with defendant\u2019s reasons and motives for the killing. Numerous witnesses testified about defendant\u2019s marital problems and emotional state. He attempted to engage in affairs with at least two other women. He told both of them that he married the victim to get a permanent resident visa. He told one of those women that his wife was sleeping in a separate room and the other that his relationship with her was \u201cpractically nil.\u201d He also told her, \u201cI\u2019m not getting any help from that old bitch anymore so I\u2019m thinking of moving back to New Zealand.\u201d He asserted that he was positive that she was having an affair and that he would kill her if he found her with another man. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>told the other woman that he was afraid his wife would get the house (which was hers from a previous marriage) in the divorce and recalled that his ex-wife had been awarded most of the property in his New Zealand divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Defendant told one friend that he wanted to build a specialty motorcycle shop but that he did not have the funds; he then predicted better times to come. He told an investment counselor that he would have between $50,000 and $100,000 to invest after Christmas. His wife had a $20,000 equity in the house and insurance policies of $80,000 and $110,000 for accidental death, with defendant as beneficiary. One of the policies, which insured both spouses, was obtained in June, 1983, five months before the death. Shortly after the death, defendant said that he was going to start a business with the insurance money. Two witnesses, friends of defendant, recalled specific threats of defendant to kill or \u201cget rid of\u2019 his wife. He also told one of these friends that \u201cmy wife is a liability not an asset and I got to figure out how to get rid of her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Given the actual physical facts of the shooting, the lack of credibility in defendant\u2019s myriad renditions of what happened at the death scene, the outpouring of unequivocal evidence regarding defendant\u2019s reasons and motives for the killing, as well as an abundance of other circumstantial evidence, the conclusion is inescapable that defendant\u2019s guilt has been inexorably established \u2014 independently of any \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. It becomes exceedingly clear that any error was harmless. We should affirm this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">This concludes my discussion of the harmless error question. I have proceeded on the assumption \u2014 for the sake of argument \u2014 that the trial judge did commit error when he admitted the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. Although my proposed resolution of the harmless error question necessarily decides this appeal, I also believe that we should affirm the trial judge\u2019s evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The state contends that defendant <em>intentionally </em>shot and killed his wife; defendant contends that his wife\u2019s death was <em>inadvertent </em>or <em>accidental. </em>These conflicting theories formulate the key issue \u2014 defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of his wife\u2019s demise. It was on this issue that the case was tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>and eventually submitted to the jury. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, his sole argument is that the trial judge was wrong in allowing the state to introduce evidence of two instances, so-called \u201cother acts,\u201d for the jury\u2019s consideration on the issue of his state of mind. Specifically, the admitted evidence concerned (1) the 1977 assault by defendant against his ex-wife in New Zealand and (2) a 1983 incident involving defendant\u2019s explanation and demonstration of the use of firearms to two women in his wife\u2019s presence. The majority accepts defendant\u2019s argument that this evidence should have been excluded. I would reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The question is one of <em>relevance. </em>Under the code, the test for relevance is whether the evidence being offered has some tendency to make the existence of a fact that is of consequence to the proceeding more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. OEC 401. The test is further refined in OEC 404(3), which specifically permits the admission of evidence of other acts if, <em>inter alia, </em>it shows \u201cintent * * * knowledge, * * * or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Applying the test here, it is quite apparent that the evidence of the two \u201cother acts\u201d is relevant to the central issue of defendant\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">However, just because proffered evidence satisfies the test of relevance does not mean that it is admissible. The code recognizes that, under certain circumstances, even evidence of unquestioned relevance may not be admissible. One of the well-defined reasons for exclusion \u2014 and the one on which this defendant relies \u2014 is if the probative value of the evidence is \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d OEC 403. What is the meaning of \u201cprejudice\u201d in this context, and who decides what is and what is not \u201cprejudice\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">It is understandable why defendant contends that the contested evidence was \u201cprejudicial.\u201d To him, the evidence was clearly detrimental; it pointed to his guilt. However, that is not the legal standard for evaluating prejudice. If it were, the more probative the evidence of guilt, the more prejudical it would be, with the illogical result being that the clearest evidence of guilt would be inadmissible in a court of law. <em>The capacity of evidence to prove guilt is not determinative of prejudice. </em>Whether relevant evidence may be inadmissible as prejudicial depends on whether the alleged prejudice is <em>unfair. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>OEC 403 specifies the danger of \u201cunfair prejudice.\u201d Unfairness is the vice. The standard is defined in the legislative commentary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">\u201c \u2018Unfair prejudice,\u2019 in the context of [OEC] 403, means an undue tendency to suggest decisions on an improper basis, commonly although not always an emotional one.* * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">What is the role or responsibility of the trial judge in determining admissibility, when, on the one hand, the evidence being offered has probative value but, on the other, there are considerations concerning on possible prejudice? The judge becomes a weighmaster. It is his task to conduct a balancing test and to determine whether the value of the evidence outweighs or is outweighed by the contrary considerations. Because this process is an exercise of judgment, it is recognized as being subject to judicial <em>discretion. </em>Accordingly, the issue on an appeal from the trial judge\u2019s ruling is whether he abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In <em>Carter v. Moberly, </em>263 Or 193, 200-01, 501 P2d 1276 (1972), the Supreme Court indicated the proper guideline for an appellate court in evaluating abuse of discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">\u201c* * * We simply determine whether, on the facts of the particular case, the trial court\u2019s ruling was within the reasonable or permissible range. We need not determine whether his ruling was the only one possible. It may be that the record will support either admission or exclusion; if so, the trial court\u2019s ruling will be affirmed, regardless of which solution we would prefer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The rule has evolved that, unless the reviewing court can say that \u201cthe relevance of such evidence was * * * completely outweighed by prejudice to the defendant,\u201d the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence. <em>State v. Madison, </em>290 Or 573, 579-80, 624 P2d 599 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Applying this test here, I am satisfied that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion. His ruling was well within the reasonable and permissible range. In support of this conclusion, I turn now to what I believe to be significant portions of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The record shows that the physical aspects of the New Zealand assault, as well as the circumstances surrounding that incident, present a remarkable and chilling similarity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>to the fatal shooting six years later in Beaverton. Both victims were wives of defendant. Both assaults occurred when defendant unexpectedly entered his wife\u2019s premises early in the morning; one on Christmas Day, the other on the Sunday before Thanksgiving. A gun was used in both cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the New Zealand incident, defendant pointed a loaded rifle at his wife, Barbara, and cocked the trigger, apparently intending to kill her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She pushed the gun away and managed to escape after being beaten on the head. Unlike Barbara, rather than being beaten on the head, the victim here was shot in the head. After both incidents, defendant denied any assaultive behavior. On both occasions, he called the police afterwards and talked about committing suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In addition to these physical and on-the-scene similarities, the circumstances leading up to the assaults are strikingly similar. Defendant\u2019s marriages exhibited parallel problems. According to Barbara, defendant was moody and unpredictable and was also \u201cpicking and nagging\u201d at her. He blamed her for everything wrong. He told her that, if they \u201ccouldn\u2019t be together in life, he wanted them to be together in death.\u201d He also said that he would see to it that it would be a long time before she ever trusted another man. She stated that he used these threats as emotional blackmail to get her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>return to him. She found that his threats and criticism caused her to lose self-confidence. She was unable to argue or to fight back.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Letters from the victim to her lover and the testimony of friends show similar marital discord in the Beaverton marriage. The letters described her husband as nagging and abusive. She wrote that he was emotionally unstable and unbalanced and that, for the purpose of hurting her, defendant falsely told her that he had cancer. According to her letters, his threats and abuse left her unable to respond or to fight back. He told her that everything that went wrong was her fault. About nine months before her death, she told a friend that defendant had threatened her with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In both marriages, defendant was financially dependent on his wife and had difficulty holding a job. On the other hand, the record indicates that both wives were quite successful in their employment and community endeavors. That caused defendant to be depressed and bitter.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Clearly, the physical evidence of the assaults, combined with the disintegration of both marriages, shows parallel circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">It is very difficult for me to understand how the majority is able to conclude that the evidence has absolutely no relevance or probative value whatsoever. Clearly, the circumstances of this case are such that the trial judge could reasonably have decided either to admit or exclude the evidence. He conducted the balancing test in the exact manner that the legislature and the appellate courts have prescribed. Now, we are telling him that there was nothing for him to balance. It seems to me that, in effect, the majority has dismantled the balancing test, leaving the trial judge without any judgmental role in these kinds of cases \u2014 except for what I fear may become the mechanical response of routinely excluding evidence where there is any possibility of prejudice. The real vice in the majority\u2019s approach of excluding evidence \u201cas a matter of law\u201d is that we are substituting our judgment for that of the trial judge\u2019s <em>in an area where we do not belong. </em>I would prefer that we honor OEC 403 and the existing case law on this subject and not disturb the ruling of a trial judge when it is within the permissible range of reasonableness, as it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>here. Under the existing test, there is absolutely no basis for saying that the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting this evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">I also believe that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the testimony of the two neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">About seven or nine months before the shooting, defendant invited two women neighbors into his home to see his guns. The victim was present but simply sat in a chair and never spoke. Defendant told the women that, if they were ever to use a gun against someone, to make sure that the person was inside the house and, he added, if they shot, \u201cto make sure to kill, not to maim.\u201d He then showed the women one of his guns, which he unloaded in their presence. Later, when one of the women asked about the need for a safety on a gun, defendant raised the gun to her face, pulled the trigger and said, \u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201d The woman was terrified; defendant thought the incident amusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Here, too, I would hold that the facts present a situation in which the probative value of the contested evidence outweighs any arguable \u201cunfair prejudice.\u201d How defendant and his wife handled and felt about firearms was clearly probative of their states of mind. This incident was a convincing part of that evidence. The only allegedly improper basis for the jury\u2019s use of the evidence was that defendant was careless and trigger-happy but nonetheless serious about the use of his guns. Under the facts of this case, however, those very inferences were directly probative of defendant\u2019s guilt, particularly in the light of the defense\u2019s corresponding claims about Edna\u2019s attitude toward guns. The circumstances again demonstrate one of those areas of reasonable and permissible discretion, as discussed in <em>State v. Madison, supra. </em>The decision to admit the evidence was a proper \u201cjudgment call\u201d by the trial court and should not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>I would hold that the trial judge ruled correctly on the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. We should affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-5\"> As the majority notes, the 1983 shooting was done with a <em>handgun, </em>and the New Zealand weapon was a <em>rifle. </em>The majority argues that this difference in weaponry is important, because it shows a dissimilarity between the two events. First, I would note, as a matter of law, that <em>exact </em>physical similarity is not required when the prior act is used to show absence of accident and not for identity purposes. Second, I would also note, as a matter of common sense, that <em>guns are guns. </em>Rifles are not unlike pistols. Both fire deadly projectiles when their triggers are squeezed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\"> The majority rejects the New Zealand evidence as having any probative value, noting that, because it is not clear that defendant possessed the intent to kill in the 1977 incident, the evidence is not strongly probative of his acting with the intent for the crime charged. Barbara testified that she believed that he intended to kill her. Defendant told a New Zealand police officer that, when he pointed the gun at her initially, he wanted to shoot her and himself to end their love. He then commented that, luckily, during the struggle, the safety was on and the gun did not go off. In a letter defendant later wrote to Barbara, which was shown to the jury, he acknowledged his intent to kill her.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201cOnly I know you and I know what happened on Xmas Day exactly. I could have been charged with attempted murder. * * * When I loaded the gun, you did the right thing to grab it and to scream. At that point I knew I couldn\u2019t do it cold bloodly. * * * as every attempt (to get you back) was being rejected and you made it totally clear you wouldn\u2019t love me again on Xmas morning I woke so lonely for you and your touch and LOVE that if I couldn\u2019t have you in life anymore, we would be together in death.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\"> Moreover, as a further indication of the fairness exhibited by the trial judge, the following cautionary instruction was given to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">\u201cThe State has presented evidence that the defendant was involved in an incident with his former wife in New Zealand. This evidence is only relevant to the issue of absence of mistake or accident in the present case. You may not use this prior event in New Zealand as evidence that Mr. Johns is a bad person or is not a trustworthy person, but simply give it what weight you believe it deserves on the issue of absence of mistake or accident in the present case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
