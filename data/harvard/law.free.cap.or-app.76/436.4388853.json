Defendant Royal Insurance Company is Columbia\u2019s insurer. Plaintiff appeals from the summary judgment in favor of Royal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Before bringing the present action, plaintiff brought an action against Martin. In settling that action, plaintiff and Martin entered into an agreement whereby Martin assigned to plaintiff \u201call his rights of recovery * * * and enforcement of obligations\u201d against Columbia, its insurers \u201cand all other persons having any responsibility or liability for the judgment entered in favor of [plaintiff] against Mr. Martin.\u201d In return, plaintiff promised \u201cnot to enforce said judgment against Mr. Martin by execution or any other manner.\u201d <em>After </em>the agreement was executed, a stipulated judgment was entered in plaintiffs favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Plaintiff then brought this action, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Royal is liable to plaintiff as Martin\u2019s assignee for the amount of the judgment that Martin owes plaintiff. The insuring provision of Royal\u2019s policy provides, as relevant, that it \u201cwill pay all sums the insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court granted Royal\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the apparent basis that, under <em>Stubblefield v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine, </em>267 Or 397, 517 P2d 262 (1973), plaintiffs promise not to enforce the judgment he later obtained against Martin means that Martin is not legally obligated to pay damages to plaintiff and, therefore, plaintiff, as Martin\u2019s assignee, is not entitled to recover from Royal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Policy considerations and the law as the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Court had construed it before it decided <em>Stubblefield, see Groce v. Fidelity General Insurance, </em>252 Or 296, 448 P2d 554 (1968), support plaintiffs position. However, we must agree with the trial judge that <em>Stubblefield </em>is controlling and requires the result he reached. <em>See also Collins v. Fitzwater, 211 </em>Or 401, 409-11, 560 P2d 1074 (1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of plaintiffs efforts to distinguish this case from <em>Stubblefield </em>succeeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\"> Plaintiffs action against Columbia was not resolved by the judgment from which plaintiff appeals. The trial court certified the judgment as final pursuant to ORCP 67B. We <em>assume for purposes of this opinion </em>that Royal\u2019s coverage applied to Martin in connection with the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\"> The policy defines \u201cinsured\u201d to include \u201c[ajnyone * * * using with [the named insured\u2019s] permission a covered auto.\u201d Although plaintiff argues otherwise, Martin\u2019s relationship to Royal was simply that of an \u201cinsured,\u201d <em>if </em>Royal\u2019s coverage was available to Martin at all under the circumstances. <em>See </em>n 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b479-5\"> It is clear under <em>Groce </em>and <em>Collins, </em>as we understand them, that plaintiffs action would not be defeated by <em>Stubblefield </em>if the judgment in plaintiffs action against Martin had been entered <em>before </em>the assignment had been executed. Although there is <em>some </em>logic to that distinction, it seems to us rather unlikely that Martin would have stipulated to the judgment before obtaining plaintiffs promise not to enforce it. The usual sequence of events is for parties to agree to a settlement before they stipulate to a judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
