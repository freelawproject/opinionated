On November 30th, 1925, the appellee had been at the store, which was very well known to her. She had made her purchases and was oil her way out, lust as she was turning from a cross aisle into the right aisle leading to the exit, she slipped and fell, sustaining painful injuries, serious enough to keep her in bed for five weeks and to cause her, according to the testimony of herself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>and members of her family, pain and nervousness to and until the trial, sixteen months after the accident. The appellee testified that, immediately after the fall and before she was lifted and taken to a rest room in the store, she saw that the floor was \u201cdark and mucky and smeary, like an oiled floor would be where the oil was not dried\u201d and that \u201cthe oily condition of the floor\u201d caused her to fall. In answer to a question of the court, \u201cWell, it might have been stained that color,\u201d the appellee said, \u201cHo, it was oiled. My gloves and everything was full of it.\u201d From a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff (appellee), the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">There are three exceptions, two to the evidence and one to the granting of the plaintiff\u2019s three prayers, the overruling of special exceptions to each of them, and to the refusal of the defendant\u2019s A, first, second, third, fourth, eighth, ninth and tenth prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The first exception was to a question to Dr. Hemmeter, the attending physician, as to the probable effect of the injuries testified to on the nervous condition of the appellee and on her ability to perform her household duties, the answers to which were that they would leave her in a nervous condition and lessen her ability to perform her household duties. These were opinions, apparently, from the evidence, based on the personal observation of the attending physician, the value of his opinion to be tested on cross-examination <em>(Jones v. Collins, </em>94 Md. 403; <em>Mitchell v. Slye, </em>143 Md. 418, 427), and the appellant\u2019s objections to the questions asked Dr. Hemmeter were properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The appellant\u2019s A prayer is a variance prayer, wherein it is stated that the proof does not measure up to the allegation of the declaration that the plaintiff \u201cwas caused to slip and fall due to the floor having been freshly oiled and the failure of the said defendant to allow sufficient time to elapse for the proper drying of the oil that had been placed thereon.\u201d The testimony of the appellee herein quoted substantially agrees with the allegation; in fact, she proved a stronger state of facts than she alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The appellant\u2019s first and second prayers asked for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>directed verdict because of lack of evidence of negligence, and likewise the third, because of the \u201cundisputed evidence\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">This court, in <em>Kann v. Meyer, </em>88 Md. 541, 549, quoted with approval from <em>Cooley on Torts, </em>718: \u201cIf one expressly or by implication invites others to come upon his premises, whether for business or for any other purpose, it is his duty to be reasonably sure that he is not inviting them into danger and to that end he must exercise ordinary care and prudence to render the premises reasonably safe for the visit.\u201d See note to 33 <em>A. L. R. </em>181.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">\u201cWhether a woman who, while in a shop where she had no reason to apprehend danger, keeps her eyes fixed upon articles which are put on exhibition to attract purchasers, rather than upon the floor in search of pitfalls, uses the ordinary caution and vigilance which persons of reasonable prudence would be expected to use under the circumstances, is a question of fact for the jury, and not of law for the courts.\u201d <em>Hendricken v. Meadows, </em>154 Hass. 601; <em>Langley v. Woolworth Co., 47 </em>R. I. 165; <em>Brown v. Stevens, </em>136 Mich. 311; <em>Burton v. Abbett Co., </em>120 Ore. 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\u201cThe question of ordinary care on the part of the party injured is not to be determined in an abstract way, but relatively, as it may be connected with, and dependent upon, the duty and obligation of the defendant.\u201d <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. Co. v. Davis, </em>152 Md. 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Applying these authorities to the facts as testified to, there can be no other conclusion than that the case should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The defendant\u2019s fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eleventh prayers submitted to the jury the questions of the contributory negligence of the plaintiff, the burden of proof, and the duties of the respective parties. The rejected eighth, ninth and tenth were simply repetitions of elements contained in other granted prayers which fairly presented the defendant\u2019s case to the jury, and we find no error in the court\u2019s rulings on the defendant\u2019s prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s (appellee\u2019s) first prayer contained a recital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>of the facts testified to upon which she relied for 'a recovery, and submitted the appellant\u2019s contention of contributory negligence as favorably as did its prayers. To this prayer the appellant specially excepted on the ground that there was no legally sufficient evidence \u201cthat said floor had been oiled, and that the said oil applied to the floor was not dry at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s said injury.\u201d The court overruled this exception for the reason that the appellee had testified that immediately after she fell the floor looked \u201cdark and mucky and smeary, like an oiled floor would be where the oil was not dried,\u201d and that this is what caused her to fall. These were facts from which the jury might conclude that the appellant had been negligent. It was not the mere fact that the floor was oiled and the appellee fell that entitled her to recover; it was the condition in which the floor was left as a result of the oiling that was submitted to the jury, and took it out of the rule laid down in the case of <em>Spickernagle v. </em>Woolvorth, 236 Pa. 496, so strongly urged by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s second prayer was specially excepted to and the exception overruled. This is substantially the plaintiff\u2019s third prayer in Hochschild, <em>Kohn &amp; Co. v. Cecil, </em>131 Md. 70. Adopting what Judge Pattison said in that case at pages 77 and 78, there can be no other conclusion than that the ruling of the trial court on this prayer was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The appellee\u2019s third prayer is a damage prayer, to which there was a special exception on the ground that there was no legally sufficient evidence to show that \u201cthe injuries complained of will be permanent in their effect.\u201d In the case of <em>Howard County v. </em>Pindell, 119 Md. 69, wherein the evidence was not unlike that in the instant case, the court said that \u201cif the jury found there had been an injury, the question \u2018whether the same was in its nature permanent and how far, if at all, it was calculated to disable her from engaging in employment for which,1 in the absence of such injury, she would have been qualified\u2019 was properly left to the finding of the jury. The verdict in the case was not excessive, and the defendant could not have been injured by the granting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>this prayer.\u201d And the court said in that case, as we find in this case, that \u201cthe court could not say under the evidence in the case as a matter of law, that there was no evidence of permanent injury.\u201d See also <em>Gordon v. Opalecky, </em>152 Md. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Eor the reasons herein given, the judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
