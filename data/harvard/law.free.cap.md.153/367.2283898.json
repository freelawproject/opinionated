That by the original charter or act incorporating the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, same being chapter 123 of the Acts of the General Assembly of Maryland of 1826, this defendant was expressly authorized and empowered to condemn land for the use of its said road by the method herein sought to be enjoined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">\u201c(c) That the act of the General Assembly of Maryland, chapter 123 of the Acts of 1826 constitutes a contract between the State of Maryland and this defendant not subject to repeal or alteration without the consent of this defendant whereby among other things the right was conferred upon this defendant to condemn land by the method here sought to be enjoined. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>such right is a valuable right which has not and. cannot be without its consent contravened or modified, and that this defendant ought not be hindered or impeded by any person or persons in the exercise of such right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201c(d) That the condemnation of the plaintiff\u2019s property here sought to be enjoined is proposed to be exercised in strict accordance with the terms of the Act of the General Assembly of Maryland passed at its session of 1826, chapter 123, which act of assembly, so far as it affects the right of condemnation so conferred upon this defendant, has not been repealed, altered, or modified either by the Act of 1865, chapter 70, or by any other act of the Legislature of Maryland, nor have same been surrendered or abandoned by this defendant, and that this plaintiff has no right in law or equity to restrain or enjoin or otherwise prevent the exercise by this defendant of the rights so conferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201cAnd for other reasons to be assigned at the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The cause was heard on the demurrer. Whereupon the chancellor, by his order of March 25th, 1927, overruled the demurrer, and from this order the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">As will be seen, the ground of the demurrer relied upon by the defendant is thait the defendant company was incorporated by the act of the General Assembly of Maryland passed at its session of 1826, chapter 123; that under the provisions of said act the defendant was authorized to condemn land by the method sought to be enjoined in this case; that the said charter so granted constitutes a contract between the State of Maryland and the defendant, not subject to repeal or alteration without the consent of the defendant. From an examination of the Act of 1826 it will be found that the method prescribed for the condemnation of land by the defendant was the one in force at that time throughout this state, and applied to the state and all corporations or persons entitled to condemn private property for public use. That method is identical with the one sought to' be used by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>defendant here. As outlined, it provided that the condemnation proceedings should be commenced by application of the party desiring to condemn, to a justice of the peace of the county where the land was located, praying that he should issue his warrant to the sheriff of that county directing him to summon twenty residents of the county, from which the condemnation jury was selected; this selection being made by the plaintiff and defendant each striking, from the list of twenty jurors so summoned, four names, and the remaining twelve constituted the jury of inquest. By chapter 117 of the Acts of 1912, as amended by chapter 463 of the Acts of 1914, now codified as article 33A of the Code, the former method of selecting a condemnation jnry was changed. By the provisions of this article, proceedings, for the acquisition of private property for public use are required to be begun by filing a petition in the circuit court for the county in which the property sought <em>to&gt; </em>be condemned is situated, on the law side thereof. Upon the filing of the petition the court is required to pass an order directing the summons to issue for the defendant, and upon the return of the summons, having all of the parties in interest before the court, the case is forthwith set at an early date to\u2019 be fixed by the court, not less than ten nor more than twenty days from the date of said application. Section 6 of article 33A provides that: \u201cIf the date so fixed by said court shall occur during the regular sittings of any term of said court, at which a regular jury is in attendance upon said court, or can he procured to attend, the said case shall he heard before a jury selected from such regular panel, but if the date for said trial set by the court shall occur at a time when the regular jury drawn for that term has been discharged and cannot be reassembled under the law, then in such case the court shall forthwith select twenty good and lawful men from the names upon the regular jury list of the last jury term of the court to he summoned by the sheriff, to attend as jurors in said court at said time as fixed by the court for the trial of said case, and the summoning of said jurors and the empaneling of a jnry of twelve men from said regular panel or from said list of jurors so summoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>by tbe sheriff, shall proceed as far as practicable in accordance with the rules and practice obtaining in said court for the selection and empaneling \u00a1of jurors in other civil cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">It will thus be seen that the method of selection of the condemnation jury is, under article 3 3A, different from that provided for in the charter of the Baltimore and Ohio Bail-road, granted by the Act of 1826; the selection of the jury being committed now to the court, instead of to the sheriff, as provided for in the Act of 1826. It is undisputed that the charter of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad, as contained in the Act of 1826, constituted a contract, and all obligations contained in that contract are protected by that clause of the Federal Constitution which prohibits a state from passing any law impairing the obligation of a contract (article 1, section 10). .The question therefore is: Does the present method of condemnation, as prescribed in article 3 3A, impair the obligation of the contract between the State and the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad, as contained in its charter granted by the Act of 1826 ? We are of the opinion that it does not. The obligation of the contract was the right of the Baltimore and Ohio- Bailroad to condemn private property for its uses and purposes, while the method to be pursued in thus condemning private property, contained in the charter, was the remedy given to- enforce the right of condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In 1 <em>Cyc. </em>705, it is said: \u201cThe rule is well settled that no one has a vested right in \u00a1any particular remedy, and that remedies can be modified and changed by the Legislature at its pleasure, subject, however, to the qualification, imposed by the organic law of the United States and most of the states of the country, that no law shall impair the obligation of contracts or encroach upon \u00a1or violate other vested rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u2022 \u201cThe obligation may be impaired by a change in the remedy in force at the time when the contract was entered into. If the subsequent law subtracts from the effectiveness of the remedy and provides no substitute substantially equivalent to the former remedy, it is obnoxious to the contract clause. The obligee is not entitled to a remedy of the\u2019same form as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>that in force when the obligation was contracted. The form of the remedy does not enter into his right, which inheres merely in the effectiveness of his remedy, but he is entitled to some remedy, and that remedy must he substantially equivalent in coercive force to that provided by law when the obligation was contracted.\u201d 15 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law </em>(2nd Ed.), 1052. \u201cIt is also generally conceded that the state, under its general power to change and alter remedies, may vary the times of holding courts, shift jurisprudence from one to another, create new courts and abolish old ones without in any wise impairing fhe obligation of contracts.\u201d 6 <em>R. C. L. </em>364.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In the case of <em>Bronson v. Kinzie, </em>1 How. (U. S.) 311, the Supreme Court, speaking through Chief Justice Taney, said: \u201cUndoubtedly, a state may regulate at pleasure the modes of proceeding in its courts in relation to past contracts as well as future. * * * Regulations of this description have always been considered, in every civilized community, as properly belonging to the remedy, to be exercised or not by every sovereignty, according to its own views of policy and humanity. It must reside in every state to- enable it to secure its citizens from unjust and harassing litigation, and to protect them in those pursuits which are necessary to the existence and well-being of every community. And, although a new remedy may be deemed less convenient than the old one, and may in some degree render the recovery of debts more tardy and difficult, yet it will not follow that the law is unconstitutional. Whatever belongs merely to the remedy may he altered according to the will of the state, provided the alteration does not impair the obligation of the contract.\u201d In <em>New Orleans City &amp; Lake R. Co. v. Louisiana, </em>157 U. S. 219, it is said: \u201cModes of procedure in the courts of a state are so far within its control that a particular remedy existing at the time- of the making of a contract may be abrogated altogether without impairing the obligation of the contract if another and equally adequate remedy for the enforcement of that obligation remains or is substituted for the one taken away. <em>Bronson v. Kinzie, </em>1 How. 311, 315; <em>Von Hoffman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>v. Quincy, </em>4 Wall. 535, 552; <em>Conn. Life Ins. Co. v. Cushman, </em>108 U. S. 51, 64; <em>McGahey v. Virginia, </em>135 U. S. 662, 693.\u201d In the case of <em>Miners Bank v. Snyder, </em>100 Md. 66, this Court said: \u201cThe power of a state to modify or change the method of procedure in its own courts for the enforcement of an existing contractual obligation so long as it does not thereby impair the substantial rights secured by the contracts has frequently been upheld by this Court. <em>State, use of Isaac, v. Jones, </em>21 Md. 432; <em>Madigan v. Workingmen's Bldg. Assn., </em>73 Md. 317; <em>Wilson v. Simon, </em>91 Md. 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">From these authorities the law is settled that the Legislature of this state has the right to change the remedy for the enforcement of an existing contractural obligation, even to the extent of abolishing entirely the remedy in force at the time the contract was entered into, provided the method substituted therefor be substantially equivalent in coercive force to that provided by law when the obligation was contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In addition to what we have said, there is another controlling reason why the demurrer of the appellant should have been overruled. The land sought here to be condemned lies in Montgomery County, along what is known as the Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This railroad was not constructed under the authority contained in the original charter of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, but under the authority contained in the special act of the Maryland Legislature, chapter 70 of the Acts of 1865. This fact has been judicially determined by our predecessors in the case of <em>State v. Balto. &amp; O. R., </em>48 Md. 49. One of the questions to be determined in that case was whether or not the gross receipts of the Metropolitan Road were liable to tax. In deciding that question in the affirmative, the Court, speaking through Judge Robinson, said: \u201cThe gross receipts of the Metropolitan Road are also, we think, liable to this tax. The original charter, it is true, authorized the appellee to build lateral roads, and this power is not limited to the construction of roads leading to lime-kilns, factories and distilleries, as was urged in the argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ment by the Attorney General, but authorizes the appellee to build such roads for the transportation of freight and passengers. The Metropolitan Boad was not built, however, under this provision in the original charter, but under the Act of 1865, ch. 70, which authorized the appellee to construct a road between Knoxville and the Monocacy Junction to the boundary of the District of Columbia; and for the purpose, as the act expressly declares, for providing a more direct communication from the West and North-West with the City of Washington. At this latter place it forms a junction with the Washington Branch, thus making a route distinct from, and independent of, the main line of the appellee. In no just sense can this road be considered as a lateral road within the meaning of the original charter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9n\">By section 2 of chapter 70 of the Acts of 1865, provision is made for the condemnation of land by the same method as is authorized by the Act of 1826, the original charter. By section 4 of that act the Legislature expressly reserved the right to alter, amend or repeal the same, at its pleasure. By the Act of 1912, ch. 117, and the Act of 1914, ch. 463, now codified as section 15 of article 33A, it is provided: \u201cThe State, and any municipal or other corporation, commission, board, body or person, which under the laws of this State, has the right to acquire property by condemnation, shall acquire such property, if condemnation proceedings be resorted to in pursuance of, and under the provisions of this article, anything in any other Public General Law or Public Local Law or private or special statute to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that nothing in this article contained shall apply to or change the present law or procedure for the opening, closing, widening or straightening of highways.\u201d By this provision the Legislature modified and amended the procedure to be employed in condemnation proceedings which was in effect at the time of the passage of chapter 70 of the Acts of 1865, under which the Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad was constructed, thereby exercising the expressly reserved right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>contained in the last named act, to alter, amend or repeal the same at its pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We conclude, therefore: First, that the change of method of condemnation prescribed -by article 33A of the Code, as to condemnation, is a change as to the method of enforcing the right, or pertaining to the remedy, only; that the substituted method of condemnation provides a remedy substantially equivalent in coercive force to that originally provided, and does not impair the obligation of the contract contained in the original charter of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Second, that the Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad having been built under the Act of 1865, in which said act there was expressly reserved by the Legislature the right to alter, amend or repeal, the Legislature had the undoubted right to amend the method of condemnation provided for in this act by substituting the method prescribed in article 33A of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs to the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
