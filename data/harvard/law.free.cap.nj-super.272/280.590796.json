Choi. The motion judge concluded, after oral argument, that plaintiff, who sustained soft tissue injuries and a scar five centimeters in length behind her knee on the right calf, had failed to make an adequate showing of objective criteria as to the soft tissue injury to warrant a jury trial and that plaintiffs scar did not constitute \u201csignificant disfigurement\u201d within the purview of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Plaintiff is a twenty-eight year old bookkeeper and the owner of an automobile registered in New Jersey. On September 9, 1989, she was a passenger on a motorcycle owned and operated by defendant, John Kenyon, which was involved in a collision with an automobile owned and operated by defendant, Choi. Plaintiffs complaint for non-economic loss asserted against Kenyon is not affected by this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Plaintiff came under the care of her treating physician, Dr. Frank J. Noonan, on September 15,1989, complaining of limitation of motion as to her cervical and lumbar spine. Her physician noted that plaintiff had sustained a laceration on the right calf which had been surgically repaired by sutures in a hospital emergency room after the collision and had been evaluated by Dr. Gregory E. Rauscher, a plastic surgeon, on September 13, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">The initial orthopedic-type examination revealed \u201ctenderness and muscle spasm of the paravertebral muscles of the lumbar spine. There was tenderness of the cervical spine, there was tenderness and hematoma of the right hip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Dr. Noonan requested x-rays of the cervical and thoracic spine and of the right hip, which were all negative for fracture. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>concluding diagnosis was \u201ccervical sprain, thoracic sprain, post concussion syndrome and a large wide-shaped laceration about three inches long ... transversely on the right calf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Plaintiff continued to see her treating physician quite frequently until May 30, 1990.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although she was not released from Dr. Noonan\u2019s care, she did not return for any additional treatment or evaluation and did not submit any other proof of treatment subsequent to that date. We infer that plaintiff, in fact, received no additional treatment after May 30, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Dr. Noonan\u2019s report of June 11, 1990 indicates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">Based upon the history of this case, my examination and tests performed upon the patient, together with the patient\u2019s present complaints, I have concluded that the patient has suffered a permanent consequential limitation of use of a bodily member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">I have concluded that the patient has suffered a permanent significant limitation of use of body function or system of the neck and lower back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">The only facts utilized by the treating doctor as the basis of this conclusion are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">In my last examination of the patient, the patient complained of pain in the neck and the lower back. My examination of the patient showed she still lacked 10 degrees of flexion of the cervical spine and 10 degrees of extension. She lacked 5 degrees of rotation right and 15 degrees of rotation left. Motion studies of the lumbar spine revealed that she had a 15 degree loss of flexion and 10 degree loss of extension. She lacked 10 degrees of rotation right and 10 degrees of rotation left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">The seminal case analyzing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a is <em>Oswin v. Shaw, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>290, 609 A.2d 415 (1992), which articulated two standards for determining whether an injury meets the statutory threshold, one objective and the other partially subjective and partially objective. <em>Polk v. Daconceicao, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>568, 575, 634 A.2d 135 (App.Div.1993). Under the objective standard, plaintiff must establish her claim by \u201cobjective, credible medical evidence.\u201d Subjective complaints of pain alone will be insufficient to provide this proof. <em>Oswin v. Shaw, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 319-20, 609 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>A.2d 415. As noted in <em>Oswin, </em>the treating physician\u2019s report must be scrutinized for \u201cobjective proof of ... injury and consequent disability.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Even limitations in range of motion are insufficient \u201cunless the restricted mobility is verified by physical examination and observation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320, 609 A.2d 415. The \u201cparroting\u201d of statutory words by the physician as to medical conclusions is not of assistance to the court in analyzing whether a plaintiff has carried her burden of proof. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Were the plaintiffs claim limited to her soft tissue cervical and lumbar injuries, we would have little difficulty in concluding that the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment based on the failure to establish sufficient proof of the objective standard required by <em>Oswin v. Shaw, id. </em>Although plaintiffs brief on appeal argued to the contrary, plaintiff abandoned her arguments on this crucial issue at oral argument and advised the court that she would not attempt to persuade the court that the trial court had improperly construed <em>Oswin v. Shaw, supra. </em>Plaintiff, however, asserted that summary judgment was improvidently granted due to the presence of the permanent scar on her calf behind her right knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The presence of this scar was addressed by the motion judge. The evidence considered consisted of a report of Dr. Gregory E. Rauscher, Chairman of Plastic Surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Dr. Rauscher saw the plaintiff on four occasions: initially on September 13,1989; on September 21, 1989, when her sutures were removed; on October 10, 1989; and on August 27,1990 for a final evaluation. As noted during the final evaluation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">[T]he patient had a permanent sear behind the right knee which measured 5 cm. transversely and varied in width from a minimum of 3 mm. to a maximum of 2 cm. By means of elective excision, revision it is quite likely that improvement in this scar can be obtained. Undoubtedly, the patient will require a splint for 2-3 weeks to prevent any excessive knee movement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>We note that Dr. Rauscher did not opine as to the anticipated degree of improvement of the scar which excision might provide. As of the date of the motion for summary judgment, excision had not been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The motion judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">The medical reports submitted in connection with the motion, viewed in light of <em>Oswin v. Shaw, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>290[, 609 A.2d 415] (1992), are not sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact. The reports refer to contusions, bruises, scrapes and a 5 cm. laceration which apparently resulted in a 5 cm. scar behind her knee. Although the subjects of objective medical findings, these injuries do not, as a matter of law, constitute any of the nine types of injuries described in N.J.S.A. 39:6A-8.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The verbal threshold, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, is established in New Jersey\u2019s no-fault and automobile insurance statute, the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 to-35, originally enacted in 1972. As originally enacted, the statute permitted lawsuits for non-economic losses only where the insured had sustained an injury within one of nine categories of.injuries delineated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, which included \u201cpermanent significant disfigurement,\u201d now commonly designated as \u201ctype three\u201d injury. <em>Oswin v. Shaw, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 295, 315, 609 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The original act was vastly modified by the passage of the New Jersey Automobile Insurance Freedom of Choice and Cost Containment Act of 1984, <em>L. </em>1983, c. 362. Thereafter, the original act was itself specifically amended September 8, 1988, effective January 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The legislative history of the 1988 amendment is encompassed within <em>Senate Labor, Industry and Professions Committee Statement to S-2637 </em>(June 16, 1988). The proposed bill was conditionally vetoed by then-Governor Thomas H. Kean, who issued a statement describing what now constitutes New Jersey\u2019s no-fault insurance law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">The verbal threshold contained in this recommendation is patterned after that in force in New York State. (See New York Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 5102, 5104). This verbal threshold specifically sets forth those injuries which will be considered \u201cserious.\u201d Lawsuits for non-economic injuries, such as pain and suffering, will be allowed for these enumerated \u201cserious injuries\u201d only. It is my intention that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>term \u201cserious injury,\u201d as defined in this recommendation, shall be construed in a manner that is consistent with the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Licari v. Elliot[t], </em>[[52 N.Y.2d 230, 455 N.Y.S.2d 570,] 441 <em>N.E.2d </em>1088 (1982) ]. Whether a plaintiff has sustained a \u201cserious injury\u201d must be decided by the court, and not the jury. Otherwise, the bill\u2019s essential purpose of closing the courthouse door to all lawsuits except those involving bona fide serious injuries will be diluted and the bill\u2019s effectiveness will be greatly diminished. In addition, strict construction of the verbal threshold is essential; any judicial relaxation of this plain language will impede the intent of maintaining the substantial benefits of no-fault at an affordable price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">[Governor\u2019s Reconsideration and Recommendation Statement, Senate No. 2637 at 3-4 (Aug. 4, 1988).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">One change resulting from this amendment was the modification of the third category of exempt injuries. The original statute included the exemption, \u201cpermanent significant disfigurement.\u201d The 1988 amendment changed this language to \u201csignificant disfigurement.\u201d Neither statute defined the word \u201csignificant\u201d; however, it is clear that the word \u201csignificant\u201d is used synonymously with the phrase \u201cserious injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">As pointed out by Justice Clifford in <em>Oswin, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 315-16, 609 A.2d 415:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">[U]nlike the New York statute, which requires \u201cserious injury,\u201d New Jersey\u2019s no-fault statute does not expressly use that term, requiring only that the injury fit one of the specified types. The distinction is of some moment only because the New York statute defines \u201cserious injury\u201d with a list of nine types of injury that is identical to the list used in the New Jersey statute; a plaintiff who sues under the New York statute merely alleges a \u201cserious injury,\u201d often without specifying the type of injury. Because the New Jersey no-fault statute is based on New York\u2019s, we use the standards set in <em>Licari, supra, </em>455 N.Y.S.2d 570, 441 <em>N.E.2d </em>1088, for evaluating plaintiffs injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">In <em>Licari </em>the New York Court of Appeals evaluated only two of the injury types: \u201csignificant limitation of use of a body function or system\u201d and the 90/180-day requirement. In respect of the first category, the court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">[T]he word \u201csignificant\u201d as used in the statute pertaining to \u2018limitation of use of a body function or system\u2019 should be construed to mean something more than a minor limitation of use. We believe that a minor, mild or slight limitation of use should be classified as insignificant within the meaning of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\"><em>[Id. </em>455 N.Y.S.2d at 573, 441 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1091.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">We note that the word \u201csignificant\u201d is only used twice in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, in types three and eight, and the word \u201ctype\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>does not appear in the actual statute but has its derivation in <em>Oswin v. Shaw, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 315-16, 609 A.2d 415.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a restricts the recovery of noneconomic losses to nine types of injuries:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ap-dedup-0\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">Type 3: significant disfigurement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al3\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">Type 8: significant limitation of use of a body function or system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 314-15, 609 A.2d 415.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">As noted, <em>Licari v. Elliott, supra, </em>455 N.Y.S.2d at 573, 441 N.E.2d at 1091, defined \u201csignificant\u201d as meaning \u201csomething more than ... minor.\u201d As that construction of \u201csignificant\u201d was applicable to a \u201ctype eight\u201d injury, we find it appropriate to again refer to the decisions in New York to discern whether the word \u201csignificant\u201d is construed differently in the context of \u201csignificant disfigurement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">In <em>Agudelo v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>118 <em>Misc.</em>2d 186, 460 N.Y.S.2d 416, 418-19 (1983), the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">Although no New York case has discussed or defined the meaning of a \u201csignificant disfiguring\u201d injury in connection with a no-fault case, the word disfigurement is used in our State\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (\u00a7 15, subd. 3, par. t(l) wherein it is provided that the \u201cboard may award proper and equitable compensation for serious facial and head disfigurement\u201d). As used in the context of a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the term \u201cdisfigurement\u201d has been defined as \u201cthat which impairs or injures the beauty, symmetry, or appearance of a person; that which renders unsightly, misshapen, or imperfect, or deforms in some manner....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFp\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-12\">Thus, refining the case law definition of the word \u201cdisfigurement\u201d as used in the workers\u2019 compensation eases, cited supra, \u201can injury is disfiguring (under the \u2018no-fault\u2019 law) if it alters for the worse the plaintiffs natural appearance. A disfigurement is significant if a reasonable person viewing the plaintiffs (face) in its altered state would regard the condition as unattractive, objectionable, or as the subject of pity or scorn\u201d, 1 PJI \u00a7 2:88B, supplement, p. 93.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-13\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">Under our original no-fault statute, the meaning of \u201cpermanent significant disfigurement\u201d was thoroughly analyzed in a compre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>hensive discussion in <em>Falcone v. Branker, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 342 A.2d 875 (Law Div.1975). The court also relied upon the law of workers\u2019 compensation in other jurisdictions and concluded, at 144-45, 342 A.2d 875:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">The apparently now classic definition of the phrase \u201cpermanent <em>serious </em>disfigurement\u201d in a compensation setting was made in <em>Superior Mining Co. v. Industrial Commission, </em>309 <em>Ill. </em>339, 141 <em>N.E. </em>165 (1923):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">* '\u2022 ' The act does not provide compensation for every mark or sear, nor for every disfigurement. A disfigurement is that which impairs or injures the beauty, symmetry, or appearance of a person or thing; that which renders unsightly, misshapen, or imperfect, or deforms in some manner. Before compensation can be awarded under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act there must be a disfigurement, and that disfigurement must be both permanent and serious. It was certainly not intended under this provision to authorize compensation for every trifling mark that could be discovered by the closest inspection. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Z\">[141 <em>N.E. </em>at 166]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In <em>Falcone, </em>Judge Walsh, utilizing this definition, carefully described the scars of the plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">Turning now to the sears which plaintiff asserts are permanent significant disfigurements, the court finds that plaintiff\u2019s facial scar is near, or on the tip of the nose, approximately J4 inch long; extremely thin; the same color as the surrounding skin, and barely noticeable at a three-foot distance, even when one knows where to look. The scar on the doctor\u2019s leg is elliptical in shape, somewhat like a quarter moon, about IK inches long, a quarter inch wide at most, located 2 to <em>Z'k </em>inches below the kneecap, and basically the color of the surrounding skin, although possibly a shade darker and shiny and smooth as in the nature of scar tissue with no hair growing on it. The court also notes that in the surrounding calf area of the 66-year-old plaintiff were varicosities more noticeable and unsightly than the sear, which was just visible from 12 feet if one knew where to look. Neither scar was ever sutured; the leg scar healing naturally after application of cold compresses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\"><em>[Id. </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 148, 342 A.2d 875.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Judge Walsh concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">Applying the case law cited above to the facts at hand, the court holds that although plaintiff has suffered scarring which appears to be permanent in nature (although that is not decided as a fact), the court does not believe that it is of the significant nature needed to override the tort exemption of our No Fault Law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8. This court believes the words of the court in <em>General Motors Corp. v. Shannon, supra, </em>155 A.2d at 238, [ (1959) ], are most descriptive of this court\u2019s attitude towards plaintiffs scars:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">I can think of no form of activity, social, economic, or otherwise, in which the claimant might indulge, and be subject to embarrassment by the presence of [these] small scar[s].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>[Id. at 150, 342 A.2d 875.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In <em>Oswin v. Shaw, supra, </em>the court was not only obliged to determine definitions for the types of injury delineated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, but was also required to articulate the standard to be utilized in determining which injuries would be deemed to meet the tort threshold. \u201cA plaintiff must show a nexus between the injury and the disability. The injury by itself does not fulfill the statutory requirement; rather, the resultant loss and disability are the key.\u201d <em>Id. </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 318, 609 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The court did not articulate this standard for all of the exempt injuries, and in fact recognized that the definition borrowed from <em>Licari v. Elliott, supra, </em>had been developed in <em>Licari </em>only as to type eight and type nine injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In the New Jersey statute, type one (death); type two (dismemberment); type four (fracture); and type five (loss of a fetus) need no definition. These types define themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The need for definition arises only with type three (significant disfigurement); type six (permanent loss of use of a body organ, member, function or system)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; type seven (permanent consequential limitation of use of a body organ or member); type eight (significant limitation of use of a body function or system); and type nine (medically determined injury or impairment of a non-permanent nature which prevents the injured person from performing substantially usual and customary daily activities).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Oftentimes there is a substantial overlap between types six, seven and eight. This overlap is evident in the description of claimed injuries as discussed in <em>Dabal v. Sodora, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 616 A.2d 1297 (App.Div.1992); <em>Phillips v. Phillips, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>305, 631 A.2d 564 (App.Div.1993); <em>Polk v. Daconceicao, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>568, 634 A.2d 135 (App.Div.1993); <em>Foti v. Johnson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 635 A.2d 104 (App.Div.1993). We are satisfied that the definition adopted by <em>Oswin, </em>which specifically applied to a type eight injury and utilized the <em>Licari </em>definition which itself applied to a type eight and nine injury, is the appropriate definition for use in evaluating type six and type seven injuries. The use of the word \u201csignificant\u201d in type three (significant disfigurement), however, does require a different qualitative analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The court conceives that every scar may be perceived subjectively by the scar victim as being \u201cunattractive, objectionable, or the subject of pity or scorn.\u201d <em>Agudelo v. Pan American World, Airways, Inc., supra, </em>460 N.Y.S.2d at 419. However, as noted in <em>Oswin, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 319-320, 609 A.2d 415, the test is \u201cobjective proof of ... injury and consequent disability\u201d; it is not a subjective standard. The court in <em>Falcone v. Branker, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 152, 342 A.2d 875, analyzed this particular issue and concluded, \u201cFrom an objective, empirical standpoint, the appearance, coloration, existence and size of the plaintiffs scars are undisputed matters of fact.\u201d These factors, along with shape, characteristics of surrounding skin, the remnants of the healing process, and the factors which may be developed as being cosmetically important on a case-by-case basis, are all objective factors which may be utilized by the court in considering whether the scar is significant in a summary judgment motion in a verbal threshold case. Presumably many scars will not require judicial analysis, e.g. hypothetically a five inch scar on the face of a twenty-one year old professional model or, as in <em>Falcone v. Branker, id., </em>a one and one-half inch scar below the kneecap of a sixty-six year old physician. Those sears which are subject to judicial analysis on a tort threshold motion must be scrutinized objectively by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In <em>Falcone, </em>Judge Walsh properly articulated a requirement that a plaintiff intending to resist a motion for summary judgment as to a scar injury must appear in court on the return day of the motion. Obviously a personal appearance before the court, either in open court or <em>in camera, </em>will be the optimum. That requirement in particular cases should be relaxed to aceom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>modate geographical, financial or other medical considerations which render an in-court appearance impractical or otherwise prohibitive. In lieu of a personal appearance, professional-quality photographs authenticated as to date or a professional-quality videotape may be sufficiently reliable for submission to the court. The court\u2019s observations, which should in every ease be articulated, as in <em>Falcone, id. </em>at 148, 342 A.2d 875, will serve as the predicate for a determination whether the scar is objectively significantly disfiguring so as to defeat defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. As with the type six, seven or eight injury, the favorable tort threshold determination will not relieve a plaintiff of the obligation to prove at trial, to the trier of the fact, that the scar is a \u201csignificant disfigurement.\u201d <em>Oswin v. Shaw, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 313-14, 609 A.2d 415; <em>Foti v. Johnson, supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 202, 635 A.2d 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In this case, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s scar did not meet the tort threshold. However, the record on appeal does not reflect whether the motion judge actually saw the scar on the return day of the motion, nor does it reflect whether authenticated recent photographs of the scar were submitted to the judge for evaluation. Although the judge did cite <em>Oswin v. Shaw, supra, </em>the court did not refer to <em>Falcone v. Branker, supra, </em>nor <em>Agudelo v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., supra. </em>The absence of a sufficient record prevents appropriate appellate review and accordingly, the order of summary judgment must be reversed and the motion must be reargued on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">At oral argument a question was posed as to the applicability of the concept of partial summary judgment on tort threshold issues where some injuries meet the tort threshold and other injuries, if evaluated separately, do not meet the tort threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel urges that we adopt the holding of <em>Prieston v. Massaro, </em>107 A.D.2d 742, 484 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>104 (App.Div. 2 Dept.1985), and <em>Katzman v. Derouin, </em>109 A.D.2d 1086, 487 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>230 (App.Div. 4 Dept.1985), to the effect that once a <em>prima facie </em>case of serious injury has been established, plaintiff is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>entitled to present its claim as to <em>all </em>injuries sustained in an automobile accident to the trier of fact, including those injuries which alone would not have satisfied the tort threshold requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In <em>Katzman v. Derouin, id., </em>the defendant argued that partial summary judgment should have been granted limiting the plaintiffs proofs as to injuries to the left thumb, hand, and wrist which met the tort threshold but excluding all proof as to injuries to plaintiffs neck, back and urinary tract which did not meet the threshold. The New York court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">There is nothing in the statute, in the policies underlying its enactment, or in the case law giving support to the defendant\u2019s position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 1086, 487 N.Y.S.2d 230.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Noting that the New York statute was in derogation of the right to sue for injuries at common law, the court declared that the statute must be strictly construed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">Had the Legislature intended to permit trial of only those injuries which standing alone can meet the threshold, it would have included language to that effect in the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 1087, 487 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>230.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">We agree with the conclusion reached by the New York courts and find that this conclusion is consistent with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. Our statute exempts tortfeasors from suit for noneconomic loss unless a tort claimant has sustained <em>\u201ca,\u201d </em>personal injury which falls within the nine enumerated types of injury delineated in the statute. The use of the word <em>\u201ca\u201d </em>clearly reflects a legislative intent that a singular injury meeting the tort threshold will permit a claimant to sue for noneconomic loss causally related to all injuries sustained in an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">On remand, if the motion judge determines that plaintiffs scar does not meet the tort threshold, summary judgment shall be entered for defendant. If the court determines that plaintiffs scar does in fact meet the tort threshold, then plaintiff may present proof as to all of her injuries to the trier of fact. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>conclusion is consistent with <em>Oswin v. Shaw, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 313-14, 609 A.2d 415:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">We hold that once a court determines that evidence bearing on a plaintiffs injuries could, if believed by the factfinder, satisfy the statutory verbal-threshold requirement, any disputed issues regarding the nature and extent of those injuries must be decided by the jury. Of course, in the absence of any factual dispute the court shall resolve the question of whether plaintiffs injuries meet the verbal threshold. Therefore, if the plaintiff moves for a partial summary judgment on the verbal-threshold issue and the court resolves that question in the plaintiffs favor\u2014 that is, the trial court determines as a matter of law that under no view of the medical evidence could a factfinder conclude that the plaintiff had failed to meet the requirements of at least one of the verbal-threshold categories \u2014 then the jury\u2019s task (assuming it finds liability in the plaintiffs favor) is limited to a determination of the noneconomic losses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The order for summary judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for appropriate proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-12\"> Plaintiff was evaluated on November 14, 1989 by a neurologist and on November 16, 1989 by an orthopedist.
