No less than its common law precursors, CEPA requires judicial resolution of threshold legal issues respecting existence of a statutory, regulatory or other clear mandate of public policy before the trier of fact determines whether an employee has been retaliated against for acting upon an objectively reasonable belief of the existence of such clear mandate by objecting to or refusing to perform acts in violation of the man-, date. This opinion reverses a Law Division judgment, entered under CEPA following jury trial, in favor of plaintiff, a \u201cPhysician Specialist\u201d, who was terminated from his at-will employment after refusing to provide temporary medical care to residents of the Home other than those to whom he had been initially assigned. We affirm the judgment of dismissal entered in favor of defendant Joseph Cagno.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\n<em>Procedural Setting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Following termination of his at-will employment, plaintiff filed a CEPA complaint in the Law Division against DHS; the Home; Joseph Cagno, its Chief Executive Officer; and Robert J. Brezo, the Assistant Chief Executive Officer. He demanded a jury trial, asserting that his termination constituted unlawful retaliatory action under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(1) and 3c(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to submission to the jury, the complaint was dismissed as to defendants Brezo and Cagno. Also dismissed were plaintiffs demand for punitive damages, and allegations respecting retaliation for his refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>perform certain medication review certifications. The cross appeal challenges some of the dismissals.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Essentially, the jury was asked to determine whether plaintiff was terminated for a refusal to see or treat certain patients in excess of his originally assigned work load or for objecting thereto; and whether such refusal or objection was based upon reasonable belief that the temporary assignment evidenced a general policy or practice of patient care which violated a law or regulation <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>34:19 \u2014 3c(1)) or was incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(3)), inclusive of applicable Department of Health regulations, the Hippocratic Oath, and the American Medical Association Principles of Medical Ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">On motion at the conclusion of plaintiffs case and again after all evidence was presented, the trial judge considered the threshold legal determinations required by <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 417 A.2d 505 (1980), which predated and furnished the underlay for legislative adoption of CEPA, as well as our opinion in <em>Warthen v. Toms River Comm. Mem. Hosp., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 488 A.2d 229 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>255, 501 A.2d 926 (1985). The judge concluded, as a matter of law, that the physicians\u2019 Hippocratic Oath and American Medical Association Code of Ethics, read in conjunction with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:39-23.1, <em>et seq. </em>(mandatory medical services standards for long-term nursing care facilities) could be found to constitute, for CEPA purposes, a regulation <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(1)) or \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(3)) which plaintiff could reasonably<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>believed would be violated were he to provide temporary medical coverage in excess of the one hundred resident caseload to which he was specifically assigned. He then submitted these questions to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">1. Did plaintiff Milton Fineman reasonably believe that the Memorial Home\u2019s activity, policy or practice respecting a physician\u2019s patient responsibilities was: (A) In violation of a law, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law? (B) Incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy governing the public health, safety or welfare?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">If you have answered \u201cyes\u201d to either # 1A or # IB, or both, go to Question # 2. If you have answered \u201cno\u201d to both # 1A and # IB, return to the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">2. Did the plaintiff Milton Fineman object to, either in writing or orally, to the Memorial Home\u2019s activity policy or practice, or did the Plaintiff Milton Fineman refuse to participate in the defendant\u2019s policy or practice respecting patient care?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">3. Was a determinative factor in the defendant\u2019s decision to discharge the plaintiff the result of the action taken by the plaintiff, as described in Question # 2 above, and thus, in retaliation for the action taken by the plaintiff as found in Question #2?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">If the .answer to Question # 3 is \u201cyes,\u201d you have rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and you shall return to the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">If the answer to Question # 3 is \u201cno,\u201d you have rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant and you shall return to the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">The jury answered \u201cyes\u201d to each question. The trial judge then entered judgment ordering plaintiffs reinstatement, a $1,000 fine for violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-5g payable by the Home; and damages in the amount of $273,546 together with pre-judgment interest in the amount of $36,389.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">The Home is a long-term care facility (nursing home) for disabled or elderly soldiers, sailors, marines, and their wives and widows. It is not a hospital. It receives federal subsidies as a state veteran\u2019s facility which is supervised by DHS, but is also inspected by the Veteran\u2019s Administration and the New Jersey Department of Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>On May 1, 1987, plaintiff was hired as a physician specialist at the Home. The medical director, Dr. Zubeda Rajput, provided plaintiff with information outlining his duties and responsibilities, which included covering for other staff physicians when they were absent or on vacation. Plaintiff was assigned as primary care physician for Units One-A and One-B, containing one hundred residents. He was also to provide on-call duties during certain evenings and weekends. Plaintiff\u2019s duties and responsibilities were described in the following fashion at time of hire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">Subject: <em>Duties and/or Responsibilities are as follows but are not limited to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">Assigned to Units 1A and IB. Responsible for total medical care in that unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">Workdays are 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">Share <em>on duty </em>calls with other staff physician. Presently will be every 3rd week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">To make rounds daily on your assigned unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">To visit all nursing stations on weekends and/or holidays, when on call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">Responsible to complete all patient\u2019s medical records in the assigned unit and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">provide coverage for the facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-13\">To accept the responsibilities and duties of other staff physicians when they are on -vacation, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-14\">Directly responsible to the Medical Director and Assistant Chief Executive Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-15\">Patient\u2019s medical records include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-16\">1. Admission History, Physical, Medical Orders and Care Plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-17\">2. Medical Care Plan review every six (6) months or as needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-18\">3. Monthly pharmacy review sheets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-19\">4. Aims \u2014 every three (3) months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-20\">5. Monthly progress notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-21\">6. Annual lab work on members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-22\">7. All verbal orders to be signed the next work day or within 48 hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-23\">All patient visits must be documented each time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-24\">To attend all Monday morning meetings, and all other required meetings, committees, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-25\">To attend case conference on your assigned patients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-26\">[ (emphasis in original) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b642-27\">When plaintiff was hired, Dr. Alan Kulick was assigned as primary care physician in Unit Two and Dr. Rajput was to be the primary care physician for Unit Three. The Home had a total of approximately three hundred residents, divided equally among the three units.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Plaintiff testified that he read a prior memo from Cagno stating that there should always be two physicians attending the institution. He also said he received similar information from Dr. Rajput. The record makes clear that when \u201con-call\u201d, or when on the rotating weekend/holiday duty, a staff physician would ordinarily have temporary responsibility for all three hundred residents, subject to back-up provided by local hospitals and physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Prior to his hire in May, plaintiff was given to understand that a salary adjustment request would be made to raise his starting salary by approximately $9,000 per year. That request had not been acted upon as of the end of July, 1987, when the events leading to plaintiffs termination came to a head.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">After plaintiff was hired, Dr. Kulick took a vacation from May 26 to June 3. Dr. Rajput was granted sick leave from June 2 to June 21, so that for part of June 2 and all day June 3, plaintiff was the only full-time physician present. The Home also regularly utilized local physicians and hospitals as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Shortly after Dr. Rajput returned on June 21, she was granted a six-month leave of absence, leaving two full-time physicians at the Home, but no formal vacancy in the three-physician complement. Cagno promised to try to get another physician on a full-time or part-time basis, but left for reserve military service in early July without completing that effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Plaintiff points out, and we note, that in the course of seeking to achieve a higher level of compensation for staff physicians to facilitate the attraction of candidates such as plaintiff, defendants had previously called to the attention of superiors in DHS the serious condition presented by having only two full-time physicians. We find nothing in the record to suggest that any defendant attempted to prevent plaintiff from seeking additional medical coverage or indeed the additional compensation he repeatedly requested for his higher-than-expected work load. To the contrary, although plaintiff was evidently dissatisfied with the vigor and competence of their efforts, the uncontroverted record sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>gests that defendants were actively engaged in trying to achieve the same goals as plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In early July, plaintiff and Dr. Kulick met with Cagno and Assistant CEO Brezo to discuss securing an additional physician, and additional compensation because of their added workload. Their concerns were brought to the attention of the Department\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr. Epstein. In fact, both Kulick and plaintiff were encouraged to contact Dr. Epstein directly to discuss additional compensation, as well as possible alternatives to the two-doctor situation. Additionally, it was agreed that plaintiffs complaints of negligence would be investigated and an administrative review conducted. In the meantime, Cagno was meeting with some success in arranging for part-time physician coverage, although plaintiff may not have been aware of this. Plaintiff was instructed to provide coverage for the residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Dr. Kulick had asked for a vacation week. He was told that he could go only if plaintiff would give written assurance that he would cover for him. Plaintiff declined to do so because that would leave him as the only staff physician for the three hundred residents. Nonetheless, Dr. Kulick simply departed for a one-week vacation on July 30 without authorization, and plaintiff was involuntarily faced with being the only full-time physician at the Home for the week. On July 30, plaintiff wrote to Cagno detailing the increase in his medical responsibilities. He concluded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">As a month has now gone by without adequate indication that some adjustment of conditions or rewards are to accrue I wish to advise you that starting Monday, August 3, 1987, I will resume my contract obligations ONLY as outlined above. (Keferring to the duties initially outlined.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">At a meeting on July 31, plaintiff told Cagno, Brezo, and Executive Assistant Pikolieky that additional physician coverage should be provided. On August 4, he advised Director of Nurses Barbara Davis that he would not be available for coverage of Units Two and Three except for emergent or life threatening situations. Commencing on August 3, Marva Tiller, a nurse, reported that plaintiff refused to treat anyone outside of Unit One. On August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>5, Director of Nurses Davis notified Brezo of plaintiffs refusal to see three residents in need of immediate medical attention. On August 6, she listed eleven other residents who plaintiff declined to see, even though they required medical attention. Patients in distress were referred to nearby hospitals or seen by \u201cphysicians who agreed to be on call\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Plaintiff had also written that he would be away \u201cwithout beeper\u201d for the weekend of August 7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">By August 4, Cagno was able to secure physicians to serve on-call for the evenings and weekends. Cagno then recommended that plaintiff be terminated for failure to treat patients at the Home. Other people were consulted, including Brezo, Pikolicky, Division Director Leon Cheesman, and individuals in the Department of Personnel, who concluded plaintiff should be fired. Cagno contacted Dr. Epstein, Medical Consultant for the Department, who agreed with the recommendation, and passed it on to the Department\u2019s Office of Employee Relations. On August 10, Cag-no told plaintiff he was fired effective August 7. He received a letter of termination signed by Cagno dated August 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Plaintiff testified that caring for three hundred patients was a violation of his ethical responsibilities based on the Hippocratic Oath, the American Medical Association (\u201cAMA\u201d) Principles of Medical Ethics  , and regulations governing nursing homes. Plaintiff did not know and could not say what specific regulation or statute would be violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">The trial judge recognized and relied upon <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:39-23.1 and 23.2 identified by plaintiffs counsel during the trial. These regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">8:39-23.1 Mandatory structural organization for medical services</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">(a) Each facility with more than 60 beds shall have a medical director who is currently licensed to practice medicine by the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>1.

The medical director shall approve all medical care policies and procedures. These policies and procedures shall be followed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">3. The medical director shall participate in the facility\u2019s quality assurance program through meetings, interviews, and/or preparation or review of reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">4.

Mandatory policies and procedures for nurse staffing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-17\">(a) There shall be a full-time director of nursing or nursing administrator who is a registered professional nurse licensed in the State of New Jersey, who has at least two years of supervisory experience in providing care to long-term care patients, and who supervises all nursing personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-18\">(b) When the director of nursing is not present, there shall be a registered professional nurse or a licensed practical nurse on duty who shall be designated in writing as an alternate to the director of nursing, temporarily responsible for supervising all nursing personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-19\">8:39-25.2 Mandatory nurse staffing amounts and availability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-20\">(a) The facility shall provide nursing services and licensed nursing personnel at all times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-21\">(b) Operative July 1, 1989, registered professional nurses, licensed practical nurses, and nurse aides shall spend the following amounts of time on professional</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>duties (the hours of the director of nursing are not included in this computation except for the direct care hours of the director of nursing in facilities with fewer than 150 beds):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">1.

Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 72, 417 A.2d 505 (1980) which recognized that an employee-at-will may have a cause of action for wrongful discharge when the discharge is contrary to a \u201cclear mandate\u201d of public policy. The sources of public policy include legislation; administrative rules, regulations or decisions; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>judicial decisions; and, in some instances a professional code of ethics. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><em>Pierce, supra, </em>discussed the need to balance the interests of the employee, the employer and the public. <em>Id. </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 71, 417 A.2d 505. The Court considered the special problems of employees who are professionals owing a special duty to/abide, not only by federal and state law, but also by the recognized codes of ethics of their professions which may oblige them to decline to perform acts required by their employers. <em>Ibid. </em>Appreciating that professional codes of ethics, and indeed legislative, administrative and judicial pronouncements do not always \u201cexpress a clear mandate of public policy\u201d, the Court laid down the rule that \u201cabsent legislation, the judiciary must define the cause of action in case-by-case determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 417 A.2d 505. \u201cAn employer\u2019s right to discharge an employee at will carries a correlative duty not to discharge an employee who declines to perform an act that would require a violation of a clear mandate of public policy. However, unless an employee at will identifies a specific expression of public policy, he may be discharged with or without cause.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In <em>Pierce, supra, </em>the employer, Ortho Pharmaceutical, was engaged in human testing of drugs within a regulatory framework which involved supervision and approval by the Federal Food and Drug Administration. <em>Id. </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 62-63, 417 A.2d 505. The Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[rjeseareh on new drugs may involve questions of safety, but courts should not preempt determination of debatable questions unless the research involves a violation of a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, 417 A.2d 505. Thus, absent the employee\u2019s ability to point to such a clear mandate of public policy and its contravention, the extent and methods of the employer\u2019s research are to be governed by government regulation, liability in tort, and corporate responsibility. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Later cases have continued to place the burden upon the professional employee in an at-will setting to identify \u201ca specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>expression\u201d or a \u201cclear mandate\u201d of public policy which would bar his or her dismissal. <em>See e.g., Warthen v. Toms River </em>Comm. <em>Hasp., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 24, 488 A.2d 229 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, 101 N.J. </em>255, 501 A.2d 926 (1985). We have held that CEPA was not intended to provide relief from an employer\u2019s response to objection by sabotage, <em>Haworth v. Deborah Heart and Lung Center, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 638 A.2d 1354 (App.Div.1994); nor from an employer\u2019s response to a refusal to treat based upon the employee\u2019s personal professional objections to a recognized medical procedure. <em>Warthen, supra. </em>In reviewing at-will employee terminations in a regulated setting, courts should give consideration to whether the regulatory scheme contains effective alternate means for the employee to voice concern about a perceived policy violation. <em>See Citizens State Bk. of N.J. v. Libertelli, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 196, 521 A.2d 867 (App.Div.1987) (cited with approval in <em>Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle Point Oil Co., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>81, 91, 609 A.2d 11 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">As the Supreme Court said in <em>Hennessey, supra, </em>\u201c[a] \u2018clear mandate of public policy\u2019 must be one that on balance is beneficial to the public.\u201d <em>Id., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 100, 609 A.2d 11. \u201cDetermining public policy is a matter <em>of </em>weighing competing interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 609 A.2d 11. This often involves considering \u201cthe competing interests of society, the employee and the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 609 A.2d 11 (quoting <em>Burk v. K-Mart Corp., </em>770 P.2d 24, 28 (Okla.1989)). To this we add, in the present case, the need to consider the interests of all Home residents. The balance must take account of the residents\u2019 need for adequate medical and nursing attention, and recognition that membership in a profession may often require an especially high order of commitment and self-sacrifice. This is particularly true in the health professions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Although the legislature has amended CEPA to permit trial by jury, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-5, it continues to remain the function of the trial court to identify the mandate of public policy in each case as a question of law, a function analogous to interpreting a statute or defining a duty in a negligence case. <em>See Warthen, supra, </em>199 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>at 24-25, 488 A.2d 229. More recently, in <em>D\u2019Agostino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>516, 531-532, 628 A.2d 305 (1993), the Supreme Court again recognized the requirement that the trial court determine initially the existence of a clear mandate of public policy and, in doing so, engage in the balancing of competing interests recognized in <em>Hennessey, supra. </em>Frequently, a summary judgment motion would be useful in this respect. Here, motions brought by defendants at the conclusion of plaintiffs case, and at the conclusion of all the evidence, afforded to the trial judge opportunity to consider whether the plaintiff satisfied his burden to establish existence of a specific law, regulation, or other clear mandate of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Where, as here, action is brought under N.J.S.A. 34:19-3c(1) and (3), the judge must first find and enunciate the specific terms of a statute or regulation, or the clear expression of public policy, which would be violated if the facts as alleged are true. When the judge has, as a matter of law, identified such a statute, regulation, or other clear source of expression of public policy, the matter may then go to the jury for determination of any disputed questions of fact, and for a finding as to whether there has been a retaliatory action against the at-will employee for either objecting to or refusing to participate in activity reasonably and objectively believed (1) to violate a statute or regulation or, (2) to be incompatible with a \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Here, the judge found that the \u201cclear mandated public policy is providing generally for the health and welfare of patients within public facilities generally.\u201d He concluded that there was enough evidence to go to the jury, although reserving formal decision on the motion until after the jury verdict. At that time, the judge again rejected the argument that plaintiff had failed to establish what law, regulation or clear mandate of public policy was being violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In ruling on the motions for dismissal, the trial judge construed <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:39-23.1 and -23.2 to preclude the Home\u2019s medical director from utilizing doctors \u201cin consultation with the facility or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>with doctors on the staff of other facilities, geographically situate.\u201d The judge reasoned that, \u201cit is the doctors\u2019 designated as attending doctors or primary doctors on this staff.\u201d This reasoning constituted an interpretation of the State regulation which would have required not merely designation of a primary and alternate physician, but that each alternate physician must also have his or her own back-up staff physician when filling in as the alternate.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We note, however, that the initial description of plaintiffs duties referenced above recognized that, when on call or when on rotating weekend/holiday duty, a staff physician would regularly have temporary responsibility for all 300 residents, subject to back-up provided by local hospitals and physicians. Moreover, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:39-23.2 specifically contemplates that outside physicians may be designated by the medical director to respond to medical emergencies which are not handled by another attending physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Unlike the regulations governing mandatory nurse staffing, the mandatory medical services subchapter does not set forth staffing levels which correspond to the total number of patients. It is required, for example, that a registered professional nurse shall be on duty at <em>all times </em>in long term nursing home facilities with more than 450 licensed beds, but no comparable provision is made for physicians. Further, plaintiffs duty description specifically required that he \u201caccept the responsibility and duties of other staff physicians when they are on vacation, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Nonetheless, the judge concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">[E]very patient has to have a primary physician and every doctor must perform services which in accordance with the Hippocratic Oath will be within a regiment [sic] which is good ... it may be totally reasonable, both from an objective and subjective standard, for a doctor to conceive who is employed to provide services for 100 patients regularly and to provide on-call services and night call services when needed pursuant to a rotating schedule, that to provide full-time services for 300 patients would interfere with the primary responsibility of providing care for the patients [for] which he has [been] designated as the primary physician ... and ... a public policy of providing primary care with a designated doctor was being violated by the nursing home temporary policy ... albeit on a temporary basis____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Based on this reasoning, the judge ruled that \u201cthe plaintiffs case must go to the jury, and the jury must determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>doctor was fired in retaliation for expressing that opinion that the Home was not providing services in accordance with State law.\u201d Accordingly, based upon public policy assertedly established by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:39-23, the Hippocratic Oath, and the American Medical Association Principles of Medical Ethics, he declined to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In amplifying his reasons for denial of the Home\u2019s motion, the judge made it clear that he found that plaintiff was \u201centitled to all the inferences which can flow, that as a matter of public policy there is a definitive public policy to which he has pinpointed and he\u2019s shown through his evidence that he had a reasonable belief that his continued providing services to 300 patients as requested was violative of that policy and, therefore, he had a right to object and, therefore the jury should determine whether or not he was retaliatory [sic] fired because he voiced those objections.\u201d Thus, the reasons expressed by the judge dealt with the case only as retaliation for expressing objections to policy, although the jury was also questioned as to retaliation for refusal to violate law or policy. In this case, plaintiffs asserted refusal to violate law or public policy took the form of refusing to see or treat residents other than those in Unit One at a time when no other staff physician was on the scene. Defendants say it was this conduct which led to plaintiffs termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The State urges that the judgment below must be overturned because the Home was in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and because the court improperly relied upon <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:39-23.1 and 23.2, together with plaintiff\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d interpretation of a physician\u2019s obligations under the Hippocratic Oath and the American Medical Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics, in concluding that there was a clear mandate of public policy sufficient for the jury to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Plaintiff responds that the trial judge correctly held that the regulations, coupled with Plaintiffs reasonable conscientious belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>that his actions were warranted by the Hippocratic Oath and Principles of Medical Ethics, constituted the requisite clear mandate. Plaintiff also reminds us that defendants made no objection to the jury charge or jury interrogatories on the issues considered herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">CEPA is an important expression of legislative policy designed, as its title suggests, to afford protection to conscientious employees. We view the legislation as harmonious with the common law mandate provided in <em>Pierce, supra. </em>In particular, the necessity for judicial evaluation on a case by case basis of the existence of a \u201cclear mandate\u201d, after balancing conflicting interests, remains critical in CEPA cases. <em>See D\u2019Agostino, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 531-32, 628 A.2d 305; <em>Hennessey, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 99, 609 A.2d 11. Our attention to this requirement makes consideration of the litigant\u2019s arguments somewhat more complex than the briefs suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The discrete analysis required by law must, in this case, involve separate consideration of the clear mandate of public policy question in connection with: a) plaintiffs objections to his temporary assignment and to the alleged consequences of inadequate staffing policy at the Home, and b) plaintiffs refusal to participate in the policy, expressed by his openly declining to see any patients other than those to whom he was primarily assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">When a professional employee merely raises an objection, the consequences, and therefore the necessary weighing of competing interests, are apt to differ materially from those produced when the objection is expressed by overt acts such as refusal to give medical assistance. In the present case, Dr. Kulick\u2019s unauthorized one week vacation and Dr. Rajput\u2019s six month leave of absence undoubtedly resulted in a large increase in plaintiffs medical work load. Nonetheless, undisputed proofs showed that a number of patients for whom plaintiff was the alternate physician were refused treatment by him. We cannot determine whether all or none of these were emergent, life-threatening situations, although it appears that in at least several eases residents were in severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>medical distress. Given the advanced age of most residents, it can reasonably be assumed that plaintiffs refusal to see or treat residents whose needs were brought to his attention by the nursing staff, could itself raise competing questions of medical ethics and responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In making their decision to terminate, plaintiffs refusal to see or treat Unit Two and Three patients was appropriately considered by the defendants in light of his assignment \u201cto accept the responsibilities and duties of other staff physicians when they are on vacation, etc.\u201d and his professional obligation as the designated alternate physician. Thus, on the issue of retaliation for plaintiffs refusal to perform professional duties, the judge\u2019s balance should have taken into account not merely a single dimension of the public policy mandate asserted by plaintiff, but the existence of other applicable policies bearing upon clarity of the mandate, and whether it is beneficial to the public. <em>See D\u2019Agostino, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 531, 628 A.2d 305; <em>Hennessey, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 100, 609 A.2d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">, In our view, a balancing of interests test could not here support an objectively reasonable determination that there was a clear ethical and legal mandate of public policy requiring a physician to refuse to treat patients in distress. It was plain error requiring our attention in the interest of justice,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the judge to have submitted to the jury questions respecting the reasonableness of plaintiffs belief that the Home\u2019s policies were incompatible with a clear policy mandate in connection with his refusal (as distinct from his mere objection) and respecting \u201cretaliation\u201d for such refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Members of professions, whether employees or self-employed, are often required to push the limits of endurance in order to fulfill professional responsibilities. School classes may be oversized; crime areas under-patrolled; social care centers over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>worked; needs of disabled persons inadequately addressed; to name only a few instances where legitimate professional frustration may be engendered because of inadequate commitment of public resources or for other reasons. We think it would be a rare ease indeed where the intention of the Legislature in enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c could be read by a court to find that one aspect of public policy was so clear as to override a physician\u2019s professional obligation to render medical treatment to the best of one\u2019s ability in difficult circumstances. When applied to plaintiffs <em>refusal to see patients </em>in Units Two and Three, this consideration alone was sufficient to render unclear the presence of any mandate of public policy. As to the refusal prong, the issue should have been resolved by granting defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In this limited context, we partially resolve the issue reserved in <em>Abbamont v. Piscataway Tp., </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 23 n. 5, 634 A.2d 538 (App.Div.1993) respecting scope of the \u201creasonable belief\u2019 language when there is no actual violation. A terminated physician who seeks relief under this statute from consequences of refusing to treat patients, must be right about existence of a statutory, regulatory or clear mandate violation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An extreme example might be refusal of an order to transfuse a patient with blood discovered to have been secured from a known hepatitis- or AIDS-infected donor, while safe alternative sources were readily available.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">We turn briefly to a problem created by literal use of the disjunctive statutory language in submitting questions to the jury in this case. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c prohibits retaliation because an employee \u201cobjects to, or refuses to participate in any activity, policy or practice which the employee reasonably believes ... etc.\u201d No distinction is drawn between a mere objection (including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>complaints) and the possible consequences of a refusal to participate (e.g., a refusal to carry out a professional responsibility).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In ruling on the motions, the trial judge\u2019s denial was hinged only upon the reasonableness of a belief of violation of a law or regulation, or incompatibility with clear mandate of public policy, sufficient to render unlawful retaliation for <em>making objection </em>to the activity, policy or practice. Nonetheless, the form of the questions presented to the jury technically followed the statutory language but did not permit the jury to distinguish between a mere objection and a refusal to render professional services to more than a given number of patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Given the evidence, it is quite possible, indeed we find it probable, that the jury found plaintiff was terminated because he refused his assignment to see patients outside of Unit One, and not because of his objections. We held above that termination of an at-will physician employee for refusing to treat would not constitute a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3e(1) or (3) on these facts. However, the effect of jury question number three, <em>supra, </em>was to enable the jury to so find. Because jury question two asked whether plaintiff objected to <em>or </em>refused to participate in defendant\u2019s practice of patient care, either could evoke a <em>yes </em>answer to question number three. If the jury found that the termination was occasioned by plaintiffs <em>refusal to treat </em>Unit Two and Three patients, the judgment clearly requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">To the extent the jury might have found that it was plaintiffs <em>objections </em>which triggered termination, however, we must decide whether a remand on this issue is appropriate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This requires us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>to consider: (1) the \u201cobjects to\u201d aspect of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c and sufficiency of basis for a reasonable objective belief of a legal or clear policy mandate violation; and, (2) whether the evidence was sufficient to support a jury verdict that plaintiff was terminated in retaliation for making objection, as distinct from refusing to treat.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We recognize that where an employee harbors an objectively reasonable professional belief that legally and medically requisite levels of physician staffing have been violated, the legislature probably would have wished to protect an employee\u2019s right to make objection, without fear of reprisal, even if it were later found by a court that there was no actual violation. It is likely that recognition of such probable legislative intent motivated the trial judge\u2019s rulings here.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Upon review of the regulations and ethical obligations relied upon by plaintiff, in light of this record, we conclude that the regulations do not establish minimum physician staffing levels keyed to the number of residents in long term facilities. As to the impact of the codes, of medical ethics upon nursing homes medical staffing, these require highly subjective evaluations, which must vary widely with the nature of each facility, the type of disorders being treated, degrees of exigency, and countless other medical factors. In this case, only plaintiffs opinion was submitted in support of his ethical evaluation. Thus, the existence of a clear mandate, even by application of the lesser balancing measure we would apply to the \u201cobjection\u201d prong of the statute, is anything but clear to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Nonetheless, we note that a conscientious physician might reasonably and objectively conclude that the Home required more staff physician assistance, not only during vacation periods, but throughout the year. Indeed, defendants themselves sought to avoid continued reliance upon a two-physician staff which they believed might result in future \u201cproblems\u201d with supervisory agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>cies such as the Department of Health and Veterans\u2019 Administration. The record makes clear defendants\u2019 efforts in this regard, including the hiring of plaintiff in May as a third physician. When Dr. Rajput took an extended six-month leave, physician staffing problems were rekindled.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In our view, it was not error to hold that plaintiff could reasonably and objectively believe that legal and ethical duties to provide competent medical care to residents of the Home were being inadequately served, and so make this view known. Retaliation against a physician-qmployee solely for making such objections known would be redressable under CEPA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">We turn, then, to our second inquiry on the \u201cobjects to\u201d prong\u2014 sufficiency of evidence. Defendants\u2019 motions for judgment N.O.V. and for new trial were denied below.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Upon careful review of the record, we conclude that the jury could not reasonably have determined that defendants terminated plaintiff solely because he objected orally and in writing, either to his temporary workload or to the general problem created by inadequate physician staffing. The evidence, much of it plaintiffs, overwhelmingly suggests that defendants were in agreement with plaintiff\u2019s complaints, were endeavoring to improve conditions, and actively encouraged his efforts to bring about both greater medical staffing and greater \u201crewards\u201d for the medical staff. We find little but speculation to support a jury finding that the termination was not, as defendants have consistently stated, attributable to plaintiff\u2019s refusal to render service to the Unit Two and Three residents during the crisis created by Dr. Kulick\u2019s unauthorized vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">We have found that no statute, regulation or clear mandate of public policy supported an objectively reasonable belief that plaintiffs refusal to treat patients was warranted. Termination for that refusal did not offend <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(1) or (3). Although application of a balancing of interests tests to the plaintiffs medical objections to defendants\u2019 practices might have supported a reasonable objective belief that a clear policy mandate was violated, there was insufficient evidence to support a jury verdict that plaintiffs termination was attributable to retaliation for such objections. It is therefore unnecessary to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">These conclusions render moot other issues posed on appeal and cross appeal. The judgment for plaintiff is reversed. Judgment dismissing the complaint on the merits is awarded to defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">An employer shall not take any retaliatory action against an employee because the employee does any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">********</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">c.
