Petitioner, while employed by respondent, was injured in an automobile accident on her way home from one of respondent\u2019s blood-donor sites. The judge of compensation found that her injuries were compensable according to the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36, because she was receiving travel-time pay for her journey home. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">As a phlebotomist, petitioner traveled to various sites in southern New Jersey on behalf of respondent to draw blood from donors. On July 1, 1988, she left her Atlantic City residence and traveled to a Mount Holly donor site approximately fifty miles away. She worked five hours, and on her way home she was involved in an automobile accident, sustaining multiple injuries. She thereupon filed the present claim petition seeking workers\u2019 compensation coverage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Petitioner and a co-worker testified that when they were hired as phlebotomists they agreed to use their own vehicles to travel to and from the donor sites. In turn, respondent agreed to pay them $8 per hour for an eight-hour day despite the fact that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>worked only five hours at the donor sites. Petitioner stated that payment of the additional three hours was understood by the parties to be \u201ctravel time\u201d pay because she and other phlebotom-ists \u201chad to pay for our own gas and our own upkeep of our car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">William Bailey, respondent\u2019s Director of Human Resources, testified in a deposition given during a related suit and introduced in the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, that respondent had a written policy to pay for travel time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">If [phlebotomists] traveled over ... one half an hour they would be on the clock and paid. That would be an hour, half hour around, come back from the blood mobile bank site.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Bailey stated that the reason for the policy was to give phlebotom-ists travel-time pay and mileage because their willingness to travel substantial distances in their own vehicles benefitted respondent. He explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">[The phlebotomists] would have to travel throughout the regions\u2019 territory and we felt that since we could not provide transportation we would pay the mileage and the salary for the time so that they would not incur the expense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Employees were also given twenty cents per mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">In a January 18, 1989 letter to respondent\u2019s labor counsel, Bailey acknowledged that because petitioner was twelve miles from the Mount Holly donor site when the accident occurred, she was \u201con the clock and was paid ... for hours worked\u201d after leaving the site. However, during the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, Bailey stated that respondent\u2019s written policy was not applicable because employees had to actually work over forty hours per week to receive compensation based on travel time. Respondent\u2019s Director of Donor Services also testified that the policy applied only to the computation of overtime. She further stated that the eight-hour guarantee was not intended to be a payment for travel time, but was simply a \u201cperk\u201d used as a recruiting technique.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Judge Lashman found that \u201ctravel was a part of the wage and all travel was included ... by payment for two or three hours in excess over actual time at the differing daily job sites.\u201d In so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>concluding, the judge determined that the testimony given by respondent\u2019s witnesses was of \u201cdubious credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The 1979 amendment to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act adds a definition of \u201cemployment\u201d (L.1979, c. 283, \u00a7 12), which reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">Employment shall be deemed to commence when an employee arrives at the employer\u2019s place of employment to report for work and shall terminate when the employee leaves the employer\u2019s place of employment, excluding areas not under the control of the employer; provided, however, when the employee is required by the employer to be away from the employer\u2019s place of employment, the employee shall be deemed to be in the course of employment when the employee is engaged in the direct performance of duties assigned or directed by the employer; but the employment of employee paid travel time by an employer for time spent traveling to and from a job site or of any employee who utilizes an employer authorized vehicle shall commence and terminate with the time spent traveling to and from a job site or the authorized operation of a vehicle on business authorized by the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">It has been repeatedly held that the 1979 amendment was intended to sharply curtail compensation for off-premises accidents, and thus has been interpreted, with two pertinent exceptions, \u201cas not allowing compensation for accidents occurring in areas outside of the employer\u2019s control, as when the employee is going to and from work.\u201d <em>Zelasko v. Refrigerated Food Express, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>329, 336, 608 A.2d 231 (1992). The two exceptions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">A \u201cspecial-mission\u201d exception allows compensation at any time for employees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">1. required to be away from the conventional place of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-12\">2. if actually engaged in the direct performance of employment duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-13\">A \u201ctravel-time\u201d exception allows portal-to-portal coverage for employees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-14\">1. paid for travel time to and from a distant job site, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-15\">2. using an employer-authorized vehicle for travel time to and from a distant job site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-17\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-18\">Respondent notes that the legion of cases decided since the 1979 amendment have found no compensability in nearly all cases Involving off-site accidents. <em>See Ibid.; Serrano v. Apple Container, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>216, 220-21, 565 A.2d 417 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>591, 583 A.2d 298 (1990); <em>Manole v. Carvellas, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138, 143, 550 A.2d 1278 (App.Div.1988); <em>Plodzien v. Township of Edison Police Dep\u2019t, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 134, 549 A.2d 59 (App.Div.1988); <em>Mahon v. Reilly\u2019s Radio Cabs, Inc., </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 33-35, 513 A.2d 367 (App.Div.1986), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>79, 526 A.2d 159 (1987); <em>Ohio Cas. Group v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 287-89, 517 A.2d 166 (App.Div.1986); <em>Mangigian v. Franz Warner Assoc., Inc., </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 427-28, 501 A.2d 179 (App.Div.1985); <em>Nebesne v. Crocetti </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>278, 281, 476 A.2d 858 (App.Div.1984). Citing these cases, respondent reasons that there is no <em>coverage </em>for petitioner\u2019s accident because it had \u201cno control\u201d over her while she drove home after completing her assigned task. It points to the fact that petitioner was free to deviate from her traveled course and thus it would be against the letter and spirit of the 1979 amendment to conclude that just because petitioner was guaranteed eight hours pay for only five hours of work her accident was covered. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The cited cases which narrowly construe the definition of employment do not control the present circumstance. Many of the cases finding no compensability pertain to the \u201cspecial-mission\u201d exception. <em>See Mangigian, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 427, 501 A.2d 179; <em>Ohio Cas. Group, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 289-90, 517 A.2d 166. Others involve accidents occurring on parking lots or other properties not \u201ccontrolled\u201d by the employer. <em>Serrano, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 220-21, 565 A.2d 417; <em>Manole, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 143, 550 A.2d 1278; <em>but see Livingstone v. Abraham &amp; Straus, Inc., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>89, 105, 543 A.2d 45 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In contrast, this ease implicates neither the special-mission exception where \u201ccontrol\u201d over the employee may be relevant, nor the concept of \u201ccontrol\u201d over the accident site. Rather, it concerns the \u201ctravel-time\u201d exception to N.J.S.A. 34:15-36, which provides simply that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the employment of employee paid travel time by an employer for time spent traveling to and from a job site ... shall commence and terminate with the time spent traveling to and from a job site----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">This exception affords portal-to-portal coverage for employees \u201cpaid for travel time to and from a distant job site.\u201d <em>Zelasko, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 336, 608 A.2d 231. It is rooted in the concept that the paid-for journey itself is part of the services provided by the employee. 1 Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 16.21 (1990). \u201cWhen the employee is paid an identifiable amount as compensation for time spent in a going or coming trip, the trip is within the course of employment.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also, Nebesne, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 281, 476 A.2d 858 (\u201ca traveling employee is not in the course of his employment and any accident does not arise out of that employment <em>unless the employee is receiving employment wages for the time thus spent traveling </em>\u201d). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Often, such travel-time payment is made to induce the employee to accept employment at a distant location. <em>See Zenith National Ins. Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, </em>66 Cal.2d 944, 59 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>622, 624-25, 428 P.2d 606, 608-09 (1967). The fact that the provision for the travel-time pay is \u201cheld out as an inducement to accept employment is a material factor supporting compensability.\u201d Larson, \u00a7 16.32. Of course, a common difficulty in such cases is whether the added compensation is indeed specially intended for travel time, or represents nothing more than additional remuneration having nothing to do with the employee\u2019s journey made on behalf of the employer. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 16.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">This \u201ccommon difficulty\u201d is the factual issue Judge Lash-man faced here. The question was whether petitioner was receiving an \u201cidentifiable amount as compensation\u201d for travel time. Larson, \u00a7 16.21. Judge Lashman\u2019s finding that petitioner was actually being paid for \u201ctravel time\u201d is supported by substantial credible evidence in the record as whole. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965). Petitioner and a co-worker testified that their arrangement with respondent was that in consideration for the use of their private vehicles they would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>paid as travel time the difference between the time they actually worked at the donor sites and eight hours. This testimony is supported by respondent\u2019s own written policy, as described by Bailey in his deposition testimony, to pay phlebotomists travel time as an incentive to make the daily journeys to the donor sites in their own vehicles if the trips exceeded one-half hour from their respective homes. Judge Lashman\u2019s rejection of respondent\u2019s assertion that this policy applied only to overtime pay is well founded in the record. Thus, the case is distinguishable from <em>Nebesne, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 281, 476 A.2d 858, where we found no compensability because the employee was simply reimbursed for out-of-pocket travel expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Respondent also argues that even if petitioner was receiving the travel-time pay, the exception under the statute applies only when the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">employee has a definite [work place], which is under the control of the employer, and, if at the request of the employer during normal business hours ... the [employee] must leave the conventional place of employment to go somewhere else on the employer\u2019s business or to a distant job site, then compensation is allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Respondent\u2019s argument finds some support in the following language in <em>Mahon, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 34, 513 A.2d 367:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">the travel time criterion is applicable only when the employee\u2019s injury is sustained <em>while going to and from a job site distant from the place of employment </em>and the employee is either paid for the time spent in so traveling or is transported in an employer authorized vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">[(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">It may be argued that this interpretation of the \u201ctravel-time\u201d exception renders the exception superfluous, since an employee who is traveling to or from his \u201cplace of employment\u201d and an employer-designated \u201cjob site\u201d would fall within the \u201cspecial-mission\u201d exception because he is required by his employer to be away from the conventional place of employment and is actually engaged in the direct performance of his employment duties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>Zelasko, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 336, 608 A.2d 231.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In any event, <em>Mahon's </em>travel-time criterion presupposes a conventional place of employment. The statute simply requires paid-for travel time to and from a job site; there is no express condition that the travel be between a place of employment and a job site. Thus, we are convinced that when an employee has no conventional \u201cplace of employment,\u201d the Legislature intended to cover an employee when the parties\u2019 contract of employment provides, as an inducement for employment, for the payment of wages for travel to and from the employee\u2019s residence and the employer\u2019s job site. To hold otherwise would render a body of employees, paid for their travel time, without coverage simply because the nature of their work does not contemplate such a conventional place of employment. So long as the added remuneration is \u201cidentifiable\u201d as travel time, Larson, \u00a7 16.21, the travel directly benefits the employer and the employee is traveling directly to or from his or her home and the designated job site, coverage should be afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Petitioner falls within the travel-time exception. She has no conventional work place. She travels from her home in her own vehicle to various donor sites selected daily by respondent. Travel is thus an essential component of her services upon which respondent relies and derives a direct benefit. Judge Lashman found that respondent recognized this benefit by agreeing to pay petitioner an identifiable amount of compensation, $8 per hour, for the travel time as reflected in both the eight-hour guaranteed payment and respondent\u2019s policy to pay the phlebotomists for travel time beyond one-half hour from their respective residences. Accepting Judge Lashman\u2019s factual findings, we conclude that petitioner\u2019s accident, which occurred while she was proceeding directly home, arose out of and in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-13\"> Petitioner\u2019s Personal Injury Protection carrier, Hanover Insurance Company, intervened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\"> It should be noted that in <em>Mahon, </em>the paid travel-time exception did not apply in part because the employee was simply provided free transportation rather than wages for the travel time. 212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 34-35, 513 A.2d 367.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
