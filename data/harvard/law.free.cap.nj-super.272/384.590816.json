Mrs. Boyce was paid $85 per week by Gregory\u2019s parents (also plaintiffs) for her services. In the declaratory judgment action commenced by the Boyces when Prudential denied coverage, the carrier contends that as Mrs. Boyce was engaged in a \u201cbusiness pursuit,\u201d a policy exclusion applies. Plaintiffs, as assignees pursuant to a settlement of the Boyces\u2019 interest under their policy, contest application of the exclusion, but argue that even if it applies an exception to the exclusion relating to conduct \u201cordinarily incidental to non-business pursuits\u201d requires coverage here. Judge Florence Peskoe held that the policy provides no coverage and granted summary judgment for the carrier. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The Boyces\u2019 homeowners\u2019 policy reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">1. Coverage E \u2014 Personal Liability and Coverage F \u2014 Medical Payments to Others do not apply to bodily injury or property damage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">(a) which is expected or intended by the insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">(b) arising out of <em>business pursuits of any </em>insured____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">This exclusion does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">(1) activities which are ordinarily incident to <em>non-business pursuits;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-e\">....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">\u201cBusiness\u201d is defined to include \u201ctrade, profession or occupation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">To determine whether babysitting is encompassed within the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion, two factors must be considered. The first is whether the pursuit involves \u201ccontinuity, or customary engagement [by the insured] in the activity.\u201d The second involves whether the activity involves a \u201cprofit motive\u201d or whether the insured engages in the pursuit \u201cas a means of livelihood, a means of earning a living, [or] procuring subsistence or profit....\u201d <em>Sun Alliance Ins. Co. of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Soto, </em>836 F.2d 834, 836 (3rd Cir.1988), citing <em>Frankenmuth Mutual Ins. Co. v. Kompus, </em>135 <em>Mich.App. </em>667, 354 N.W.2d 303 (Mich.App.1984); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v.

Johnson, </em>170 <em>W.Va. </em>313, 294 <em>S.E.2d </em>116 (W.Va.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>It is undisputed that Mrs. Boyce was compensated an average of $85 per week from September 1986 through February 1987 to care for Gregory Carroll from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Gregory was between six and ten months old at the time. The \u201ccontinuity\u201d of Mrs. Boyce\u2019s work was clearly established. Plaintiffs contend, however, that \u201cbabysitting a single child in one\u2019s own home, as an accommodation to a neighbor and to provide a playmate for one\u2019s own child\u201d is not a \u201cbusiness.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Mrs. Boyce also cared for another child for compensation during part of that period. In any event, while babysitting on a single occasion, or even occasionally, or without compensation generally does not involve a business pursuit <em>(see Crane v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>14 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>727, 731, 92 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>621, 623 (Cal.App. 1 Dist., 1971), <em>rev\u2019d 5 </em>Cal.3d 112, 95 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>513, 485 P.2d 1129 (1971)), here the compensation was such as to render the exclusion applicable. <em>See Stanley v. American Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>361 So.2d 1030 (Ala.1978) ($3.00 per day held to be sufficient compensation for \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion to apply). <em>See generally Annot. </em>\u201cConstruction and Application of \u2018Business Pursuits\u2019 Exclusion Provision in General Liability Policy,\u201d 48 <em>A.L.R.3d </em>1096, 1099-1102 (1973). \u201c[W]e are not here dealing with a temporary or casual keeping of children, but rather with a more permanent [full-time] arrangement for an agreed upon compensation.\u201d <em>Stanley, supra, </em>361 So.2d at 1031. Additionally, plaintiffs submitted no proof that the compensation was for anything but profit or income, or was all consumed by expenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, the \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d exclusion applies. As the Supreme Court of Alabama concluded in <em>Stanley:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The term \u2018babysitting<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> perhaps is inaptly used to describe the contract for day care for children involved here. In ordinary parlance, the \u2018babysitter\u2019 is one employed as a matter of convenience by parents to stay with a child or children, so that they may for a few hours seek their pleasure, or tend to affairs external to the home. This differs from day-in, day-out child care for an indefinite period, as here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">\u2018Business\u2019 in its broad sense embraces anything about which a person may be busy, and in its usual sense, signifies an undertaking or calling for gain, profit, advantage or livelihood. While \u2018business pursuit\u2019 in some contexts is synonymous with \u2018business,\u2019 it more accurately denotes a continued, extended or prolonged course of business or occupation. Child care for compensation as evidenced in this case was much more than a casual accommodation, and was properly found to be a \u2018business pursuit\u2019 under the terms of the policy exclusion. (Mansfield <em>v. Hyde </em>(1952) 112 <em>Cal.App.2d </em>133, 137-138, 245 P.2d 577; <em>Long v. City of Anaheim </em>(1967) 255 <em>Cal.App.2d </em>191, 197, 63 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>56; <em>cf.

Aurigemma </em>(Sup.Ct.1965) 45 <em>Misc.2d </em>875, 257 N.Y.S.2d 980, 985. These New York trial court cases involve the same exclusionary clause here considered.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\"><em>[Stanley, supra, </em>361 So.2d at 1032, quoting from the California Court of Appeals in <em>Crane v. State Farm and Cas.

In <em>N.J. Property Liability Guaranty Assoc. v. Brown, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>629, 632, 417 A.2d 117 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied 85 N.J. </em>462, 427 A.2d 561 (1980), we considered application of the exception to the accidental shooting of an insured\u2019s social friend at the insured\u2019s office. We held the exception applied, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">[The exclusionary clause] may fairly be read as saying that, as a general proposition, there will be no liability coverage with respect to an insured\u2019s \u201cbusiness pursuits,\u201d but that, as an exception to this broad rule, coverage will be extended to liability which arises, even though connected in some causal manner with the insured\u2019s \u201cbusiness purposes,\u201d out of an act or omission that is ordinarily not associated with or related to the insured\u2019s business pursuits. In other words, to give any meaning at all to the excepting clause, the policy must be read to extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>coverage to certain acts or omissions which are not, by their very nature, tainted by being associated with an insured\u2019s business pursuits, but which, nevertheless, with respect to the insured\u2019s potential liability arising therefrom, may have been causally related to such business pursuits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\"><em>[Brown, supra, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 633, 417 A.2d 117, quoting <em>Gulf Ins.

Tilley, </em>280 <em>F.Supp. </em>60, 64-65 <em>(N.D.Indim) aff'd, </em>393 F.2d 119 (7th Cir.l968).]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Here, plaintiffs allege that Gregory suffered serious injuries resulting either from negligent supervision or intentional wrongdoing. For purposes of the declaratory judgment, of course, \u201can insurer\u2019s duty to defend an action against [an] insured is measured by the allegations contained in the complainant\u2019s pleadings.\u201d <em>Salem Group v. Oliver, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 271, 590 A.2d 1194 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd o.b. </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>1, 607 A.2d 138 (1992).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the exception is inapplicable under either theory advanced in the complaint filed against the Boyces.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">In <em>Stanley, </em>a one-year old child was injured when she fell into a bed of hot coals in the insureds\u2019 home fireplace while the insured was caring for her and receiving $3.00 per day for so doing. The insured was in the kitchen cooking lunch at the time, and the policy contained the same exclusion and exception with which we deal. Despite the small amount of pay the insured received and the fact Ms. Stanley was preparing food for her family at the time of the accident, the <em>Stanley </em>court concluded that the exclusion applied and the exception did not, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">In <em>Tilley, </em>the exclusionary clause was held inoperative where baby care was furnished for consideration, and the baby sustained bums when she overturned a coffee percolator. The district trial court assumed that the child care was a business pursuit, but characterized insured\u2019s coffee brewing for herself and a guest as an activity not connected with baby care, thus ordinarily incident to non-business pursuits. This analysis is questionable. The baby was burned because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the condition on the premises, and the baby\u2019s own activity. The business of child care contemplates the exercising of due care to safeguard a child of tender years from household conditions and activities; and, any activity of the insured in this regard from which injury results cannot logically be called an activity ordinarily incidental to a non-business pursuit. In other words, the activity referred to is a failure to supervise rather than making coffee for a third party. Undertaking the business relation of child care for compensation is certainly not ordinarily incident to the conduct of a household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">[Stanley, <em>supra, </em>361 So.2d at 1031-32.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Stated differently,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">The activity referred to is not preparing lunch, which would ordinarily be incident to a non-business pursuit, but rather to the failure to properly supervise a young child. Supervising children on a regular basis for compensation is ordinarily a business pursuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\"><em>[Stanley, supra, </em>361 So.2d at 1032-33.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-9\"><em>See also Annot. supra, </em>48 <em>A.L.R.3d </em>at 1107-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">We agree and apply the <em>Stanley </em>rationale which embodies the majority, and better considered, view. <em>See U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. v. Heltsley, </em>733 <em>F.Supp. </em>1418 (D.Kan.1990); <em>Rocky Mountain Cas. Co. v. St. Martin, </em>60 <em>Wash.App. </em>5, 802 P.2d 144 (Wash.App.1990), review denied 116 <em>Wash.2d </em>1026, 812 P.2d 102 (1991); <em>Farmers Ins. Co. of Arizona v.

Piper, </em>517 <em>F.Supp. </em>1103 (D.Colo.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">As Mrs. Boyce was engaged in a permanent babysitting arrangement for an agreed upon compensation, she was clearly involved in a \u201cbusiness pursuit.\u201d The very purpose of her business was to care for the infant and to protect him from the dangers of injury. As such, we cannot conclude that a babysitter\u2019s conduct in failing to do so can be considered incident to her non-business pursuits, irrespective of what Mrs. Boyce was doing at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the time and how the injuries occurred. <em>See e.g., McCloskey v. Republic Ins. Co., supra, </em>559 A.2d at 390. The injuries resulted from Mrs. Boyce\u2019s failure to adequately discharge her business pursuit. Therefore, the policy exclusion applies and the exception to the exclusion must be deemed inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The declaratory judgment for the carrier is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-6\"> Given our conclusion we do not have 1o develop the age disparity between Gregory and Ms. Boyce\u2019s children or question whether an infant Gregory's age can be considered a \u201cplaymate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> Plaintiffs suggest that the carrier must prove the profit or profit motive. But given the personal nature of the relevant facts, we disagree. While carriers generally have the burden of proving an exclusion, plaintiffs are more readily able to come forward to show there was no profit or profit motive. <em>See </em>Biunno, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>Current N.J.
