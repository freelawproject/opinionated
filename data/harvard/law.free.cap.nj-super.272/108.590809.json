Shaw, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>290, 315, 609 A.2d 415 (1992). Using a summary-judgment model which is the correct procedure in all verbal threshold cases, <em>id. </em>at 294, 609 A.2d 415, and based on our analysis of the Type 9 injury, we conclude that defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions should have been denied and accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a enumerates nine categories or types of injury which are exceptions to a general prohibition of claims for noneconomic loss attributable to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of an automobile in the State. The statute is drafted in terms of objective gradation of injury severity commencing with Type 1, \u201cdeath\u201d and proceeding in decreasing severity to Type 9 which is applicable to \u201cnonpermanent injury.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The specific categories are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">Type 1: death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">Type 2: dismemberment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Type 3: significant disfigurement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">Type 4: a fracture;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">Type 5: loss of a fetus;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">Type 6: permanent loss of use of a body organ, member, function or system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">Type 7: permanent consequential limitation of use of a body organ or member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">Type 8: significant limitation of use of a body function or system</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">Type 9: a medically determined injury or impairment of a non-permanent nature which prevents the injured person from performing substantially all of the material acts which constitute that person\u2019s usual and customary daily activities for not less than 90 days during the 180 days immediately following the occurrence of the injury or impairment Thereinafter \u201c90/180-day requirement\u201d].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 315, 609 A.2d 415].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-13\"><em>Oswin </em>teaches that the New Jersey verbal threshold statute was modeled after the New York statute. However, unlike New York, which requires \u201cserious injury\u201d as a predicate upon which noneconomic loss claims are assertable, the New Jersey statute does not expressly use the term \u201cserious injury.\u201d Our statute simply requires that an injury fall within one of the nine specified types. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">In <em>Puso v. Kenyon, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 290, 639 A.2d 1120 (App.Div.1994), we indicated that certain categories or types are self-defining, while others require analysis of legislative intent and precedent in other jurisdictions. Illustrative of this analytic method is our Supreme Court\u2019s emphasis, <em>Oswin v. Shaw, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 315-18, 609 A.2d 415, on the decision in <em>Licari v. Elliott, </em>57 <em>N.Y.2d </em>230, 455 N.Y.S.2d 570, 441 N.E.2d 1088 (1982), in formulating a definition of a Type 8 injury, namely \u201csignificant limitation of use of a body function or system.\u201d We employed the same analysis in defining a \u201csignificant disfigurement\u201d or Type 3 injury. <em>Puso v. Kenyon, supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 291-92, 639 A.2d 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">A Type 9 injury does not include the elusive term \u201csignificant\u201d and although the plain language of the description renders a Type 9 injury self-defining, to some extent, we must utilize an analytical approach to determine how a claimant proves a Type 9 injury. A similar approach was utilized in <em>Oswin v. Shaw, supra, </em>as to Type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>6, 7 and 8 injuries, in determining the proofs required to establish \u201cpermanency\u201d and, once the meaning of \u201csignificant\u201d was defined, in delineating the proofs required when a \u201csignificant limitation of use of a body function or system,\u201d a Type 8 injury, is asserted by a claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In our analysis of a Type 9 injury, we conceive that the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion, <em>id., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 315-17, <em>609 A.2d 415, of Licari v. Elliott, supra, </em>is most helpful.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">In <em>Licari </em>the New York Court of Appeals evaluated only two of the injury types: \u201csignificant limitation of use of a body function or system\u201d and the 90/180 day requirement. In respect of the first category, the court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">[T]he word \u201csignificant\u201d as used in the statute pertaining to \u201climitation of use of a body function or system\u201d should be construed to mean something more than a minor limitation of use. We believe that a minor, mild or slight limitation of use should be classified as insignificant within the meaning of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\"><em>[Id. </em>455 N.Y.S.2d at 573, 441 N.E.2d at 1091.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">Although the injuries alleged in <em>Licari </em>were plainly not within the statutory term \u201cserious injury,\u201d that case is helpful in broadly defining the types of injuries that do qualify for compensation under the statute. The plaintiff was a taxi driver who, after an automobile accident, was diagnosed as having \u201ca concussion, acute cervical sprain, acute dorsal lumbar sprain and a contusion of the chest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>455 N.Y.S.2d at 571, 441 N.E.2d at 1089. The hospital released him after two hours, and his family physician told him to rest in bed. Two days later he consulted his physician again, complaining of having coughed up reddish phlegm. Tests revealed that plaintiff had sustained no rib damage and that his lungs were clear. The hospital physician testified that the \u201cplaintiffs lungs were clear, reflexes normal, and * * * he suffered only a \u2018very mild limitation\u2019 of movement in the back and neck areas.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">Twenty-four days after the accident, the plaintiff returned to work, adhering to his pre-accident schedule: twelve hours a day, six days a week. The only limitation he complained of concerning his daily activities was that he was unable to help some fares with luggage and that he could not help his wife with household chores. <em>Id </em>455 N.Y.S.2d at 571-72, 441 N.E.2d at 1089-90.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">The court rejected the plaintiffs claim in respect of the 90/180-day requirement because he had returned to his normal work schedule within twenty-four days and therefore had been able to perform \u201csubstantially all of his daily activities\u201d during the statutory period. <em>Id </em>455 N.Y.S.2d at 574, 441 N.E.2d at 1092.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">The court also found that the plaintiff had not proved that his concussion and bruised chest had wrought a significant limitation of use of a body function or system, or that his occasional headaches and dizziness produced more than temporary discomfort. The court concluded that \u201c[t]he Legislature could not have intended headaches and dizziness of the type experienced by plaintiff to constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>a significant limitation of use of a body function or system.\u201d <em>Id. 455 </em>N.Y.S.2d at 575, 441 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1093.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">To succeed under either statutory category, a New York plaintiff must offer objective evidence of injury-related disability. <em>Id. 455 N.Y.S.2d </em>at 574-75, 441 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1092-93. In rejecting the plaintiffs claim under the 90/180-day requirement the court said, \u201c[S]ubjective complaints of occasional, transitory headaches hardly fulfill the definition of serious injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe do not believe the subjective quality of an ordinary headache falls within the objective verbal definition of serious injury as contemplated by the No-Fault Law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>With regard to the \u201csignificant limitation of use of a body function\u201d daim, the court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apy\">Plaintiff offered no evidence as to the <em>extent </em>of the limitation of movement. * * * No evidence was offered to show that any of these injuries caused a significant limitation of use of a body function or system. * * * No proof was offered to show that these ailments ever went beyond mere temporary discomfort, relieved by aspirin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\"><em>[Id. 455 N.Y.S.2d </em>at 575, 441 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1092-93.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\"><em>[Oswin v. Shaw, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 315-17, 609 A.2d 415.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">We therefore conclude that in analyzing a claim of a Type 9 injury, the court must determine that plaintiff has made a <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>demonstration (a) that the injury, albeit nonpermanent, is based on objective medically-determined medical evidence; (b) that the injury, although nonpermanent, prevented the plaintiff from performing substantially all the material acts which constitute that person\u2019s usual customary and daily activities; and (c) that the limitation of activity existed for not less that 90 days during the 180 days following the occurrence of the injury or impairment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, although a Type 9 injury may be nonpermanent in nature, the injury must be sufficiently serious so as to limit substantially plaintiffs customary activities for the requisite 90/180 day time period, and proof of this substantial limitation cannot be predicated solely on the basis of subjective complaints. <em>Id. </em>at 319, 609 A.2d 415. The two standards articulated in <em>Oswin, id. </em>at 318-19, 609 A.2d 415, \u2014 one objective and the other partially subjective and partially objective \u2014 are therefore applicable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>evaluating a Type 9 injury. <em>See Polk v. Daconceicao, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>568, 575, 634 A.2d 135 (App.Div.1993). Within the parameters of a summary-judgment model, summary judgment should be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2; <em>see also Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67, 74-75, 110 A.2d 24 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">On November 17, 1989, plaintiff Zulema Ortiz was a forty-one year old temporarily unemployed sewing machine operator. She was a passenger in a motor vehicle involved in a two-ear collision. Her host driver, defendant Virginia Perez, collided with the vehicle owned by defendant Lease and Go and operated by defendant George Lytwyn. The interrogatory answers and deposition testimony of plaintiff Ortiz clearly establish that until September 1989, she was gainfully employed in two types of employment. During the day she was regularly employed as a sewing machine operator at a coat manufacturing factory. During the evening, she supplemented her income as a janitorial service worker, cleaning offices. In September 1989, plaintiff was laid off from her regular employment, began to collect unemployment compensation, and to avoid any disqualification, she elected to temporarily discontinue her second night time employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, on November 17,1989, plaintiff, although temporarily unemployed, was a member of the work force.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Plaintiff first consulted a physician after her accident on December 11, 1989. She certified that she self-treated between November 17, 1989 and December 11, 1989, but when her symptoms persisted, she sought medical advice. She complained of severe headaches, severe neck pain with radiation to the left upper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>extremities with occasional paresthesia to the left upper extremity and pains in the chest. She attributed the latter complaint to the fact that she struck her chest against the dashboard of the vehicle in the collision. Her treating physician referred her for diagnostic evaluations including a tomographic evaluation and notably an electromyograph and nerve conduction study. These tests revealed electrodiagnostic signs of radiculitis diffuse at the C5-C6 on the left side. Her treating doctor opined that these objective findings correlated to plaintiffs subjective complaints of shoulder pain on the left side and complaints of tenderness of the para-spinal muscles and trapezius muscles on the left side.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Plaintiffs deposition testimony included her contention that Dr. Colon recommended bed rest, the use of a sling, daily physical therapy and a regimen of prescribed analgesic medication. She indicated that she participated in physical therapy on a daily basis until March 26, 1990 and used a sling for approximately three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">A medical report of plaintiffs treating physician fails to mention any medical advice respecting \u201cbed rest\u201d or advice respecting the use of a sling. However, the report does state, \u201cThe patient was partially disabled during the period of treatment in my office from December 11th, 1989 until March 26th, 1990.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Plaintiff contends that her period of disability was a minimum of 105 days calculated from December 11,1989 to March 26,1990, or 128 days if calculated from the date of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">We perceive that the appropriate question which the trial court should have considered was whether the medical opinion of Dr. Colon of temporary disability for 105 days coupled with plaintiffs certification at depositions that she engaged in physical therapy on a daily basis and used a sling for approximately three months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>were sufficient facts to defeat the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The rational inference which may be drawn from those facts which were unrebutted by any fact proffered by defendants is that plaintiff was prohibited from engaging in substantially all of her usual customary daily activities during her period of temporary disability. A fair inference is a sewing machine operator will be prevented from accepting employment in that capacity while utilizing a sling and while participating each day in physical therapy. The absence of a medical report definitely stating that the plaintiff could not work during the specific 105 day period should not have resulted in a dismissal of her claim on a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, as the party opposing the motion for summary judgment, must be accorded all favorable inferences. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, supra, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>at 75, 110 A.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The trial court on this motion failed to properly analyze plaintiff\u2019s claim as a Type 9 injury. In his letter opinion, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">Plaintiffs chief complaints are pain in left shoulder and chest on left side. Plaintiff alleges confinement to bed for five months, however, it is unclear if this was at the specific direction of a physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">Dr. Colon\u2019s report of 9/28/90 found left shoulder tenderness and decreased rotation; anterior chest wall tenderness and decrease in inspiration. His diagnosis is left shoulder contusion and left side of chest contusion, which are conclusory in nature and unsupported by diagnostic test results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">X-rays of the shoulder were negative (no rib fractures). Thermogram and electromyographic studies revealed radiculitis at C5-C6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">Dr. Colon opines that plaintiff has permanent consequential limitation of use of left shoulder; poor prognosis because such injuries are \u201cusually\u201d precursor to other problems; and patient was partially disabled during treatment. All prognosis (diagnosis [sic] appear conclusory and unsupported by objective, credible evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">Plaintiffs certification and opposition asserts a Type A [sic] injury citing plaintiffs confinement to bed and home for 129 days after the accident combined with Drs Colon and Fishberg\u2019s findings of C5-C6 radiculitis and spasm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">The court finds plaintiffs submissions insufficient to satisfy the threshold requirements. Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the EDS findings <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at C5-C6 is unclear given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>plaintiffs subjective pains to her left shoulder and chest wall. No doctor draws a clear causal link between plaintifl\u2019s complaints, the injured area and the cervical findings at C5-C6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">In the absence of clear objective/eredible evidence, plaintiffs assertions of <em>permanent </em>(serious) injury must fail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The court misread the medical evaluation of the treating physician. In describing the plaintiffs diagnosis, Dr. Colon stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak5\">The patient was placed on a program of physical therapy which included Hydroeollator therapy, interferential current therapy and ultrasound therapy to the affected areas. The patient was also given a prescription for a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication to take for relief of the pain. The patient was seen in follow-up visits in my office with the above complaints. She presented for a fell course of physiotherapy and continued to take the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. She had x-rays of the left shoulder which did not show any evidence of fracture. The examination of the chest did not show any evidence of rib fractures. The patient was evaluated with thermography studies, electromyographic studies and nerve conduction studies which showed electrodiagnostic signs of radiculitis diffuse at the level of C5-C6 on the left side. The radiculitis is a term used to describe an injury to a nerve root at the level of the spinal canal. The symptoms of the shoulder pain of this patient on the left side and the tenderness on paraspinal muscles and the trapezius muscles on the left side correlate very well with the findings on the electromyography. The weakness in the upper extremities is associated with pain and had distribution that correlates with this radiculitis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The balance of Dr. Colon\u2019s report offered his opinion respecting plaintiffs condition on discharge and the permanency of plaintiffs condition. As to the medical opinion on permanency, the court concluded that, \u201c[I]n the absence of clear objective/eredible evidence, plaintiffs assertions of <em>permanent </em>(serious) injury must fail.\u201d That conclusion would have been presumably correct if the court were evaluating a Type 6, 7 or 8 injury. However, on this motion, the court should have focused upon the specific criteria of a Type 9 injury and not upon the viability or insufficiency of proof as to the permanency of which is not an element of a Type 9 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The medical report of Dr. Colon and the diagnostic test results of the electromyographic studies, taken together with plaintiffs certification, answers to interrogatories and deposition testimony, were, as a whole, sufficient to withstand defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions. <em>R. </em>4:46-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The order granting summary judgment to defendants is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-11\"> Plaintiff\u2019s complaint for noneconomic damages attributable to her alleged injuries sustained in this collision was consolidated with an earlier filed complaint of another passenger Nelly Costa. Summary judgments dismissing both complaints were entered on January 8, 1993. A subsequently filed complaint of plaintiff Virginia Perez was also consolidated with Costa v. Perez, et al, but was not considered by the court on January 8, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-12\"> We recognize that a purely subjective analysis might result in a different sequence of prioritization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b143-10\"> We note that in New York when a Type 9 injury claim is evaluated by a jury, each prong of the statutory requirement is submitted to the jury in a separate interrogatory. <em>See Shiner v.
