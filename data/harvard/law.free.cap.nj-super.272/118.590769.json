The claim was held to be non-compensable on the grounds that her accident was an \u201cidiopathic event.\u201d We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">On January 13,1993, petitioner filed claim petition, number 93-001413, alleging that she \u201ctwisted her left knee walking in court house\u201d and suffered a \u201c[p]ermanent orthopedic injury to left leg.\u201d On or about February 8,1993, respondent, County of Morris, filed an answer denying that injury arose in course of employment. Petitioner filed a motion, dated March 16, 1993, for temporary disability and medical benefits, to include arthroscopic surgery on her knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">A hearing on the motion was held on April 30, 1993. At the conclusion of petitioner\u2019s testimony, the judge of compensation refused to hear any further testimony or to permit petitioner\u2019s counsel to be heard as to legal argument. The judge immediately rendered the following decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">This is a Motion for Temporary Disability and Medical Treatment brought by Linda Verge, an employee of Morris County, as a result of an injury to her left knee suffered on December 15,1992, when as a court clerk in the employ of Morris County, she was walking in the lobby of the courthouse and slipped on the rug injuring her left knee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">She testified that she did not fall to the floor. There was no contact between her knee and the floor or any other object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>She received relatively immediate medical attention at the Morristown Memorial Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">The record of the emergency room has been placed in evidence as Exhibit P-1. It gives a description of the accident as follows: \u201cTwisted left knee while walking in lobby of courthouse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">The symptoms were pain in the left knee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">Petitioner additionally testified that she had a long history of prior injury to her left knee beginning in childhood and it included surgery to her left knee joint in 1985 involving cartilaginous damage to her left knee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">She disclaims any problems with the left knee between that period of time and the incident in December of \u201992, when she was walking in the lobby of the courthouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">Petitioner indicates that presently she\u2019s in need of further surgery to her knee and requests the Court to authorize same based upon an alleged accident arising out of and in the course of employment on December 15, 1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">The issue is whether under the circumstances described by the petitioner \u2014 and I accept every word of her testimony as being true \u2014 whether her employment was a contributing cause to her injury; was the event reasonably incident to her employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">I am constrained to find otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">Petitioner describes an idiopathic event and not one that can be found to be an incident of the employment. It was an event which could have occurred anywhere at any time. It was an event that which took place in normal walking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">Under the circumstances her claim is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">According to her testimony, petitioner, a twenty-five-year-old woman, was employed as a court clerk by Morris County and was working on December 15, 1992. She had worked for Morris County for approximately one and one-half months before her accident. Petitioner\u2019s testimony concerning her accident and injury was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">Q. What^-did something happen to you at the Morris County Courthouse that day? Did something happen while, while you were there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-18\">Q. Tell the Court exactly what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-19\">A. In the lobby I slipped on a rug.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-20\">Q. You were in the lobby of the Courthouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-22\">Q. And you, and when you say you slipped on a rug, can you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-23\">THE JUDGE: You don\u2019t have to repeat what she says. It\u2019s in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ake\">Q. I was going to ask you if you can be more specific. What, what slipped, what foot slipped?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>A. My left foot slipped on a rug.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">Q. And when that happened? Did you feel anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">A. Yes, a stabbing pain in my left knee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">After she slipped, petitioner \u201chobbled\u201d into the Sheriffs Office. Present were approximately five persons, including petitioner\u2019s husband who was an employee of the Sheriffs Office. The people in the office \u201csat [petitioner] down\u201d and she explained to her husband what had happened. When petitioner\u2019s counsel sought to present the testimony of petitioner\u2019s husband at trial, the judge stated: \u201cIt\u2019s not relevant. I don\u2019t think we need any corroboration of the petitioner\u2019s testimony. * * * [fit\u2019s not compensable. You can stop at this point and I\u2019ll explain why.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">About an hour later, petitioner was taken to Morristown Memorial Hospital. The hospital record stated that petitioner \u201c[t]wisted left knee while walking in lobby of courthouse.\u201d She was sent to the County\u2019s doctor, who recommended that she see an orthopedic specialist, who sent petitioner for therapy. Petitioner received therapy to her knee from about December 20, 1992, to the beginning of April 1993. Petitioner was also treated by another orthopedic physician, who prescribed a knee brace. Both orthopedists recommended arthroscopic surgery. Petitioner testified that she did not undergo the surgery because of \u201clack of funds.\u201d Since her accident of December 15, 1992, petitioner has not returned to work for the county. By letter dated February 4,1993, petitioner was notified by the court administrator of Morris County that her employment was terminated because of her inability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Petitioner testified that she first had problems with her left knee in the early 1970\u2019s, attributable to growing problems. She had knee surgery in 1978, at age ten, when she was in the fourth grade. Ultimately, she had a total of three surgeries on her left knee, with the last surgery taking place in 1985. Petitioner asserted that she had no problems with her knee since her last surgery, and that she required no further treatments until this incident. She testified that after 1985, the knee was fine and she was able to perform all her work duties when she entered the job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>force. Prior to the present injury, petitioner enjoyed figure skating and playing tennis and basketball, and had no knee problems when she performed these activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The judge of compensation correctly stated that the issue was \u201cwhether [petitioner\u2019s] employment was a contributing cause to her injury\u201d and whether the \u201cevent [was] reasonably incident to her employment.\u201d He stated that he accepted every word petitioner said as true, but nonetheless he found that her \u201cslip\u201d was an \u201cidiopathic event\u201d and not one that could be found \u201cto be an incident of the employment.\u201d He reasoned that \u201c[i]t was an event which could have occurred anywhere at any time\u201d and that \u201c[i]t was an event that which took place in normal walking.\u201d In dismissing petitioner\u2019s claim, the judge pointed out that there had been no contact between petitioner\u2019s knee and the floor and that petitioner had a long history of prior injury to her left knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">On appeal, petitioner asserts that the judge of compensation erred in characterizing her \u201cfall\u201d as an idiopathic event. Petitioner argues that the slip on the courthouse rug represents a \u201cneutral\u201d risk incident to the employment and this satisfies the \u201carising out of\u2019 portion of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">When this court reviews a decision regarding a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, we decide only whether the findings of fact made by the judge of compensation could reasonably have been reached on \u201csufficient credible evidence present in the record,\u201d considering the proofs as a whole. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965). However, if there has been a mistaken application of the law to the facts, we must grant appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The New Jersey\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">[w]hen <em>employer and employee </em>shall by agreement, either ejqaress or implied, as hereinafter provided, accept the provisions of this article compensation for personal injuries to, or for the death of, such employee by accident <em>arising out of and in the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>course of employment </em>shall be made by the employer <em>without regard to the negligence of the </em>employer....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The statutory requirement that a compensable accident arise out of the employment \u201clooks to a causal connection between the employment and the injury.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>285, 290, 520 A.2d 1341 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">We held in <em>Giambattista v. Thomas </em>A <em>Edison, </em>32 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 115, 107 A.2d 801 (App.Div.1954), that it is sufficient if the employment is \u201ca contributing, though not the sole cause of the accident or injury....\u201d An \u201cidiopathic fall\u201d is one which is caused by \u201ca purely personal condition having no work connection whatever....\u201d <em>George v. Great Eastern Food Products, Inc., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>44, 45, 207 A.2d 161 (1965). To bar recovery, the record must substantiate a finding that the event was caused solely by disease or infirmity peculiar to the individual and not a condition of the employment. <em>Spindler v. Universal Chain Corp., </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>34, 39, 93 A.2d 171 (1952). Common examples of \u201cidiopathic falls\u201d are falls brought on by heart attacks or epileptic seizures. <em>Coleman Cycle Transformer Corp., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>285, 292, 520 A.2d 1341 (1986) (citing <em>George, supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 44, 207 A.2d 161; <em>Henderson v. Celanese Corp., </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>208, 108 A.2d 267 (1954); <em>Reynolds v.

Thornton, </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>415 [86 A.2d 117] (1952).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-13\">\u201cInjury by accident is the language of the statute which must be construed and broadly delineated. Considering the words themselves in their context, it is obvious that they exclude injury by disease <em>only </em>as well as injury by design on the part of the petitioner. We have long held the view that an accident is \u2018an unlooked for mishap or untoward event which is not expected or designed,\u2019 or \u2018an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>unintended or unexpected occurrence which produces hurt or loss.\u2019 <em>Bryant v. Fisell, </em>[84 <em>N.J.L. </em>72, 86 <em>A. </em>458 (1913)] <em>supra; Ismay v. Williamson, </em>(1908), <em>A.C. Eng.) </em>437, <em>L.J.P.C.N., </em>and it is clear that the term \u2018accident\u2019 is used and therefore should be considered in its ordinary, popular and accepted sense and that it need not be due to any extraneous event or occurrence.\u201d <em>Bollinger v. Wagaraw Bldg. Supply Co., </em>122 <em>N.J.L. </em>512 [6 A.2d 396] <em>(E. &amp; </em>A.1939).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">Where it is claimed the accident was the result of the physical condition of the employee, \u201cthe burden of proof is on the employer to show such cause.\u201d <em>Atchison v. Colgate &amp; Co., </em>3 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>451 [128 A. 598] <em>(Sup.Ct.</em>1925), affirmed 102 <em>N.J.L. </em>425 [131 A. 921] <em>(E. &amp; </em>A.1925).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">An injury suffered during the course of work does not <em>per se </em>entitle one to the benefits of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act; it must also appear that the injury arose out of the employment. <em>Seiken v. Todd Dry Dock, Inc., </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>469 [67 A.2d <em>131] (1949). The </em>burden of proof, however, may be sustained by circumstantial evidence; direct evidence is not necessary. \u201cProbability, and not the ultimate degree of certainty is the test.\u201d <em>Jochim v. Montrose Chemical Co., </em>3 <em>N.J. </em>5 [68 A.2d 628] (1949). See <em>Ames v. Sheffield Farms Co., </em>1 <em>N.J. </em>11 [61 A.2d 502] (1948). A risk is \u201cincidental to employment\u201d when it belongs to or is connected with what a workman has to do in fulfilling his contract of service. <em>Beh v. Breeze Corp., </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>279 [66 A.2d 156] (1949).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201cIf the employment is a contributing cause to the accident, the statutory requirement is met * * *. The employment need not be the sole or proximate cause of the injury; it is sufficient if it is a necessary faetor leading to the accident.\u201d <em>Sanders v. Jarka Corp., </em>1 <em>N.J. </em>36 [61 A.2d 641] (1948).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">Here the fall resulting in the injury is not disputed. The difference of opinion centers in the cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">If it was occasioned by or was the result of a disease <em>or </em>physical seizure and was not contributed to by \u201cwhat the workman had to do,\u201d it is not compensable. On the other hand, if the fall \u201cwould not have occurred but for the services rendered\u201d in the employment, it is covered by the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\"><em>[Spindler, supra, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>at 38-39, 93 A.2d 171.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">The court went on to note with regard to the condition of the employee that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">The physical perfection of an employee is not a statutory prerequisite to qualification under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. <em>Marshall v. C.F. Mueller Co., </em>135 <em>N.J.L. </em>75 [50 A.2d 158] <em>(Sup.Ct.</em>1946); <em>Bernstein Furniture Co. v. Kelly, </em>114 <em>N.J.L. </em>500 [177 A.554] (Sup.Ct.1935); affirmed 105 <em>N.J.L. </em>500 [180 A. 832] <em>(E. &amp; </em>A.1935).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\"><em>[Spindler, supra, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>at 39-40, 93 A.2d 171.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">New Jersey adheres to the proposition that the employer takes the employee as the employer finds the employee, with all of the pre-existing disease and infirmity that may exist. <em>Kelly v. Alarm</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>tec, Inc., </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>208, 212, 389 A.2d 498 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>340, 395 A.2d 209 (1978). Therefore, the employee is not disqualified under the requirement that the injury arise out of the employment where the pre-existing condition is aggravated, accelerated or combined with the pre-existing disease or infirmity to produce the disability for which compensation is sought. <em>Giambattista, supra, </em>32 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 114, 107 A.2d 801. In <em>Giambattista:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">The rule has long been established that, in cases of injury from accident arising out of and in the course of the employment, the employer takes the employee as he finds him with his existing disabilities and weaknesses, and that the workman is entitled to compensation for all of the consequences flowing freely and naturally from his accidental injury, irrespective of the fact that such consequences may be much more severe by reason of his pre-existing condition or defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><em>Howard v. Harwood\u2019s Restaurant Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>72, 135 A.2d 161 (1957), recognized three categories of risk used in determining the connection between employment and injury. The first category is known as the \u201cbut for\u201d test and this test asks \u201cwhether it is more probably true than not that the injury would have occurred during the time and place of employment rather than elsewhere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83, 135 A.2d 161. <em>Howard </em>adds that the \u201cbut for\u201d test connotes a standard of reasonable probability and includes in its application the nature of the risk that causes the injury to the employee. <em>Id. </em>at 83-84, 135 A.2d 161. <em>Howard </em>provides some examples of risks that are distinctly associated with employment and are clearly compensable when they occur at the place of and during the hours of employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">[a]ll the things that can go wrong around a modem factory, mill, mine, transportation system or construction project \u2014 machinery breaking, objects falling, explosives exploding, tractors tipping, fingers getting caught in gears, excavations caving in and so on \u2014 are clearly in this category and constitute the bulk of what not only the public but perhaps also the original draftsmen of compensation acts had in mind as their concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 84, 135 A.2d 161 (quoting 1 Arthur Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 7.10, at 3-12 (1990)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>A second category of risks causing injury which are said to \u201carise out of the employment\u201d are those which are described as \u201cneutral.\u201d <em>Howard, supra, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>at 84, 135 A.2d 161. \u201cNeutral risks may be defined as uncontrollable circumstances which do not originate in the employment environment but which happen to befall the employee during the course of his employment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>An example of this type of risk is an act of God, such as lightning. <em>Ibid. </em>Other illustrations of this second category of risk are provided in <em>Coleman, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">\u201c[illustrations of [neutral risk] may be drawn from a wide variety of controversial cases. A man hard at work in the middle of a factory yard may be hit by a stray bullet out of nowhere, bit by a mad dog, stabbed by a lunatic running amuck, struck by lightning, thrown down by a hurricane, killed by an enemy bomb, injured by a piece of tin blown from someone\u2019s roof, shot by a child playing with an air rifle, murdered as a result of mistaken identity, felled by debris from a distant explosion, or blinded by a flying beetle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">[105 <em>N.J. </em>at 291 n. 1, 520 A.2d 1341 (quoting Larson, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 7.30).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The third category of risks do not bear a sufficient causative relationship to the employment and, therefore, cannot be said to \u201carise out of the employment.\u201d <em>Howard, supra, 25 N.J. </em>at 84, 135 A.2d 161. These risks are those personal to the claimant. <em>Ibid. </em>And, those personal to the claimant are considered to be \u201cidiopathic.\u201d <em>George, supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 207 A.2d 161. Risks that are personal to the claimant are defined in Larson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">If the time has come for the employee to die a natural death, or to expire from the effects of some disease or internal weakness of which he would as promptly have expired whether he had been working or not, the fact that his demise takes place in an employment setting rather than at home does not, of course, make the death compensable. Or if the employee has a mortal personal enemy who has sworn to seek him out wherever he may be, and if this enemy happens to find and murder the employee while the latter is at work, the employment cannot be said to have had any causal relation to his death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">[Larson, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 7.20.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The judge of compensation found that petitioner\u2019s \u201cslip\u201d was an event that \u201ccould have occurred anywhere at any time.\u201d He, therefore, concluded that it was an \u201cidiopathic event\u201d and found that the \u201cslip\u201d was not an incident of the employment. Here, the judge erred in precipitously declaring, on an inadequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>record, that petitioner\u2019s slip was an \u201cidiopathic event\u201d that could not warrant compensation under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We hold that if petitioner\u2019s \u201cslip\u201d is to be characterized as an \u201cidiopathic event,\u201d it must be found to be one which was caused by \u201ca purely personal condition having no work connection whatever.\u201d <em>George, supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 207 A.2d 161. Petitioner testified that she slipped on a rug in the courthouse lobby while at work. Unless it is proven that this was not the cause of her injury, she must be compensated. Petitioner need not show that the rug was defective or that she was free from fault. Respondent, however, cannot be denied the opportunity to prove by direct or circumstantial evidence that petitioner did not accidently slip, but rather that her knee condition caused the event and, therefore, her injury was caused solely because of her pre-existing or personal infirmity or condition. This is an issue which the judge could not resolve on the limited proofs permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">If petitioner\u2019s \u201cslip\u201d in the courthouse lobby occurred as she described it in her testimony, and if it were a case of her knee twisting or giving-out for reasons personal to her, it would not constitute either an \u201cidiopathic event\u201d or a neutral risk. It would be directly associated with her employment as she slipped on a rug at a place where her job carried her. Petitioner\u2019s work duties required that she move throughout the courthouse, to courtrooms, conference rooms, and offices. It is not revealed in the record exactly what work duty petitioner was performing at the time of her \u201cslip.\u201d However, respondent does not argue that petitioner was not performing her job duties while in the courthouse lobby where walking on the rug allegedly caused her to slip and twist her knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The burden of proof to establish an idiopathic cause is placed on the employer. <em>Spindler, supra, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>at 38, 93 A.2d 171. Here, the employer was precluded from attempting to establish an idiopathic cause. On direct examination, petitioner discussed prior problems and surgeries that involved her left knee. However, she further testified that after her last surgery in 1985, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>she had no problems with her knee. The judge must afford the parties an opportunity to produce all evidence bearing on the issue of whether petitioner twisted her knee because she slipped on the rug while at work or whether her knee twisted or gave-out due to an idiopathic or personal cause. If petitioner sustained an idiopathic injury because there was no slip to cause her knee to twist in the first instance, then she cannot recover, as there was no subsequent fall or impact capable of causing a secondary injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We reverse the dismissal of petitioner\u2019s claim petition. We remand to the Division of Worker\u2019s Compensation for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
