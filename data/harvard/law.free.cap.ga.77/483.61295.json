The non-resident filed a petition to remove the cause as to him to the circuit court of the United States, and this application was granted, and no exception was taken to this ruling. A motion to remand the case was made in the circuit court, and there it was urged that the removal was made under the act of congress of 1866, and that that act had been repealed by the act of 1S75. This motion was refused in 1877, and no exception thereto was taken. In 1883, the case was dismissed from the docket of the circuit.court by the presiding judge for want of prosecution. In 1885, a motion was made to reinstate it and remand it to the State court. Later in the same year, an application was made to the superior court of Richmond county to declare the removal null and void, and to require the case to proceed in the State court, on the ground that the act of 1866 had been repealed by the act of 1875, and that there was no jurisdiction in -the State court to grant the removal, or in the circuit court to accept or act upon it:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>Held, </em>that the judgments of the superior court and of the circuit court of the United States, although they may have been erroneous, were not void, and no exception to them having been taken, they are binding on the parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b502-5\"><em>(a.) </em>If the present motion could have been made at all, it should have been made within three years from the time the judgment was rendered, and is now too late.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b502-6\">November 23, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-7\">Removal of Causes.

Issues were made, or ought to have been made, in each of the courts necessarily involving this very point, and they were determined by each adversely to the claims of the plaintiffs in error, who seem to have acquiesced at the time in the result, for they took no steps, within the time limited by law, to have the action of either court reviewed by the proper tribunals of the State or United States. When the questions were made, they had to be decided, and so far as concerns their adjudication in the United States court in this very case, we are not left to conjecture as to the matters involved in that controversy, as the case is fully reported in 3 Woods R. 397, when Judge Bradley, of the Supreme Court of the United States, presiding on the circuit, passed upon each and every one of them in an elaborate and, as it seems to us, an able opinion, and concluded it by giving j udgment against the motion to remand. When made in the court, such questions must be determined by the judges thereof who were vested with the power, and it is their duty to decide them; if the decision subsequently turns out to be erroneous, although no measures may be taken to correct the errors, yet it is not on that account to be treated as a void judgment, such as has been rendered by a court having no jurisdiction. While it exists, it is as binding as though it had been absolutely free from error, and this is true whether it relates only to the judgment of the State court, or a judgment of a United States court, or of the com t of another State. <em>Smith vs. Hornsby, </em>70 <em>Ga. </em>552 ; <em>Lord vs. Cannon, </em>75 <em>Id. </em>300; <em>Thomas vs. Morrisett, </em>76 <em>Id. </em>3S4, in addition to authorities cited on brief of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>This, then, being an erroneous, though not a void, judgment for the want of authority in the superior court of Richmond to render it, and being final, so far as concerned the action of that court, this motion to vacate it could not be entertained by it, 1st, because the matter had passed from its control, and had never been restored by any competent authority, or any other proceeding known to the law, either State or federal; and 2d, because it came too late. If, under the circumstances, this motion could have been made at all, it should have been made within three years from the time it was rendered.
