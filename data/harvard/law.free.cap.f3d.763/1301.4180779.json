He received a 30-month sentence on the bank robbery count and a mandatory minimum 84-month sentence on the firearm count, with the sentences to be served consecutively. Payne appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights, as interpreted in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), when it sentenced him to the mandatory minimum sentence on the firearm charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-18\">The following facts were recounted at Payne\u2019s plea hearing. On September 13, 2007, Payne served as the getaway driver in an armed robbery of the People\u2019s Bank and Trust in Valley Grande, Aabama. His three accomplices \u2014 Lindera Chapman, Joshua Davis, and Timothy King \u2014 entered the bank that day carrying a shotgun, a revolver, a pistol, and duct tape. They demanded that one of the bank tellers open the vault, and one of the defendants used the shotgun \u201cto divert the [security] cameras.\u201d Payne and his compatriots took $5,826 from the bank and fled. At his plea hearing, Payne admitted those facts and acknowledged that he had \u201cknowingly participated in an armed robbery of a bank.\u201d However, he asserted that he did not enter the bank and could not \u201cadmit to exactly what happened inside.\u201d During the hearing the district court told Payne that if he was convicted of the firearm offense he \u201ccould receive a term of imprisonment of no less than [84 months]\u201d and that the sentence would be \u201cconsecutive to the sentence imposed\u201d on the bank robbery count. Payne pleaded guilty to both counts charged against him in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-19\">The PSR prepared for Payne\u2019s sentencing recounted the facts of the crime as stated at the plea hearing with one differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>ence: It noted that one of Payne\u2019s accomplices had pointed a pistol'at a bank teller during the robbery. Based on that fact, the PSR concluded that Payne was subject to an 84-month mandatory minimum sentence to be served consecutive to his sentence for the bank robbery charge. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (providing that a defendant convicted under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) must be \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than [84 months]\u201d if a firearm is brandished during the crime of violence). Payne objected to the PSR\u2019s determination that he was subject to that 84-month mandatory minimum. Because his indictment had not specifically mentioned the brandishing provision of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) and he had never admitted at his plea hearing that a firearm was brandished, he asserted that sentencing him to the mandatory minimum would violate his Fifth Amendment due process rights and his Sixth Amendment rights, as interpreted in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">In light of Payne\u2019s objection, the district court decided to hear evidence to determine whether a firearm had been brandished during the bank robbery. At the sentence hearing, a bank teller working at People\u2019s Bank and Trust at the time of the robbery testified that one of the defendants had pointed a pistol in her face during the robbery. Payne\u2019s attorney cross-examined that witness. He did not call any witnesses of his own to rebut the teller\u2019s testimony. Based on the evidence presented, the district court concluded that a gun had been brandished during the bank robbery, and it sentenced Payne to the 84-month mandatory minimum sentence on his \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-11\">Payne\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights, as interpreted in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), when it sentenced him to the 84-month mandatory minimum sentence based on its own finding that a firearm was brandished during the robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>the alleged <em>Alleyne </em>error. <em>United States v. King, </em>751 F.3d 1268, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2014). If an <em>Alleyne </em>error occurred, we will vacate Payne\u2019s sentence unless the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 1279 (\u201cWe further hold that <em>Alleyne </em>violations are subject to harmless error review.\u201d). Under harmless error re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>view, we must affirm Payne\u2019s sentence if the brandishing fact \u201cis supported by un-controverted evidence\u201d and the record does not \u201ccontain[] evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding.\u201d <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1308 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Under <em>Alleyne, </em>any fact that increases the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime must be admitted by a defendant or be submitted to a jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. 133 S.Ct. at 2163; <em>cf. Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (\u201cOur precedents make clear, however, that the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant\u201d). </em>In this case, Payne did not admit at his plea hearing that a firearm had been brandished during the bank robbery that he committed. He stated that he did not know \u201cexactly what happened inside the bank\u201d because he had been waiting in the getaway car. Nevertheless, the district court sentenced him to a mandatory minimum sentence after making its own finding that a firearm had been brandished during the robbery. In doing so, the district court erred under <em>Alleyne </em>because it sentenced Payne to a mandatory minimum sentence based on its own conclusion about brandishing, instead of Payne\u2019s admission or a jury\u2019s finding concerning that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As we have explained with regard to <em>Apprendi </em>errors, such errors are harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when there is \u201cuncontroverted evidence\u201d supporting a statutory fact that alters the range of possible sentences a defendant may receive. <em>See Candelario, </em>240 F.3d at 1308 (quotation marks omitted). The same reasoning applies to <em>Alleyne </em>errors because <em>Alleyne </em>is an extension of <em>Apprendi. See King, </em>751 F.3d at 1278-79; <em>United States v. McKinley, </em>732 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir.2013). In this case, the district court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the government presented uncontroverted evidence that a firearm was brandished during the bank robbery in which Payne participated. A teller working at the bank when the crime was committed testified that one of Payne\u2019s codefendants pointed a pistol at her during the robbery. That testimony was unrefut-ed, and therefore \u201cit is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found\u201d that a firearm was brandished.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 829 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(4) (\u201cFor purposes of this subsection, the term \u2018brandish\u2019 means, with respect to a firearm, to display all or part of the firearm, or otherwise make the presence of the firearm known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>regardless of whether the firearm is directly visible to that person.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">. Payne also appears to challenge the sufficiency of his indictment on the ground that it failed to allege that a firearm was brandished during the robbery, and it failed to cite to the specific subsection of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) that provides that an 84-month mandatory minimum applies when a firearm is brandished, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). But that argument does not call into question the district court's jurisdiction. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>752 F.3d 1344, 1349-50 (11th Cir.2014) (noting that an indictment\u2019s failure to allege the drug quantity that triggered a higher statutory maximum sentence was not a jurisdictional defect and stating that an indictment\u2019s failure to allege an essential element of a crime does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction). Therefore, the challenge has been waived by Payne\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Betancourth, </em>554 F.3d 1329, 1332 (11th Cir.2009) (\"A defendant who enters an unconditional plea of guilty waives all nonjurisdictional challenges to the conviction, but challenges to the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts cannot be waived.\u201d). In any event, Payne cannot credibly contend that he had insufficient notice that he would be subject to the mandatory minimum because the penalty page of his indictment stated that that mandatory minimum sentence applied to the \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) count and the district court told him at his plea hearing that he \u201ccould receive a term of imprisonment of no less than seven years\u201d on that count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">. We reject Payne's contention that he could be sentenced under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) only if he admitted or a jury found that he \"knew that the firearm[] would be brandished.\u201d To the contrary, Payne could be found liable so long as he was an \"active participant\u201d in the bank robbery and he \u201ckn[ew] that one of his confederates [was carrying] a gun.\u201d <em>Rosemond v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 1249, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014). He admitted both of those facts at his plea hearing. It does not matter whether Payne knew that one of his codefendants would actually brandish a gun in the bank. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>334 F.3d 1228, 1230, 1232-33 (11th Cir.2003) (upholding 10-year mandatory minimum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) for defendant who participated in bank robbery in which one of his codefendants <em>\u201caccidentally\" </em>discharged his assault rifle during the robbery) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
