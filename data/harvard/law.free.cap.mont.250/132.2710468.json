The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>jury found, by special verdict, that the respondent\u2019s negligence was not a legal cause of the appellant\u2019s injuries. The appellant requests a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The appellant raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">1. Whether the District Court improperly instructed the jury on the State\u2019s duty to maintain its highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">2. Whether the District Court erred in giving Jury Instruction No. 39 regarding practicability and cost of highway repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">3. Whether the District Court erred in refusing the appellant\u2019s challenge for cause of a prospective juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">4. Whether the appellant was denied a fair trial as a result of the District Court\u2019s rulings on the evidence concerning the appellant\u2019s failure to wear a helmet.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">5. Whether the District Court erred in allowing certain testimony of the State\u2019s witness concerning bicycle helmets.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">On July 20,1987, Walden suffered a serious head injury as a result of a bicycle accident. The accident occurred on the northbound entrance ramp to U.S. Interstate 15 near Great Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Interstate 15 is a divided highway running north and south through Great Falls. The portion of the highway on which the accident occurred is located south of Great Falls on Gore Hill. Near the top of the hill, there is an overpass with an exit ramp allowing southbound traffic to exit the interstate and an entrance ramp allowing northbound traffic to enter the interstate. The entrance ramp descends down Gore Hill a distance of approximately 2,150 feet at a 5 percent grade before it merges with the northbound travel lanes of the interstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">The interstate was constructed in 1967. The entrance ramps, exit ramps, and shoulders are made of asphalt; the travel lanes consist of concrete slabs 15 feet long, 8 inches deep and 1 lane wide. Where the non-bonding asphalt and concrete meet, a longitudinal \u201cseam\u201d exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">The concrete is originally poured in one piece. After the concrete sets, \u201ccontraction\u201d cuts 3 inches deep are made across the width of the lanes every 15 feet. The cuts serve to control the cracking of the concrete. When the concrete expands and contracts with temperature change, it cracks along the weakened cuts, as intended, forming the individual slabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">The highway, therefore, is no longer a single structure, and each slab can move independently of the adjoining slab. Heavy truck traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>and natural forces, such as heat, cold, and moisture create \u201cslab faulting.\u201d Slab faulting is the difference in concrete slab elevation that is formed by the shifting of the individual slabs in relation to one another. The movement of the slabs compresses the subgrade material underneath and causes the formation of air pockets. Water eventually fills these pockets and when a heavy vehicle drives over the slab, it exerts inordinate pressure on this water, forcing it to escape. Following the path of least resistance, the water is forced with tremendous energy out of both the contraction cracks between the slabs and the longitudinal seam between the concrete and the asphalt shoulder. In addition to the slab faulting, heavy traffic actually compacts the asphalt on the ramps and shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The result is that the transitional seam between the asphalt and the concrete spreads apart slightly, and, at various points, the concrete edge will be higher than the asphalt. This was the condition of the seam between the asphalt entrance ramp and the concrete travel lane where Walden had his accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">On the day of the accident two friends, John Huotte and Andrew Flaherty, were bike riding near Walden\u2019s home in Great Falls and stopped for a visit. Walden decided to join Huotte and Flaherty on the bike ride. The three men hiked to Tenth Avenue South and then decided to proceed up Gore Hill. They hiked single file on the asphalt shoulder of Interstate 15 and up the southbound exit ramp to the top of Gore Hill. After resting at the top of the exit ramp they crossed the overpass and proceeded down the northbound entrance ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Walden was wearing specially designed cycling shoes that he had strapped on to his pedals before starting down the ramp. Huotte was in the lead, followed by Walden and then Flaherty. Testimony at the trial indicated that Walden and Flaherty were \u201cdrafting.\u201d Drafting is a technique used by cyclists whereby a cyclist tries to ride in the vacuum created behind the cyclist in front of him or her, in order to generate a greater speed with less resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Huotte and Flaherty agreed that the speed of the three bikes as they neared the bottom of the hill was about 30 miles per hour. Huotte also testified that he could hear Walden pedaling behind him as they approached the end of the entrance ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Walden and Flaherty were traveling slightly faster than Huotte and moved out to Huotte\u2019s left in order to pass him. At the same time, Huotte began to move to his left so that he could get farther away from the guard rail and the debris lying on the shoulder to his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The three bikes were virtually side by side as they came to the end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>of the entrance ramp, and Walden and Flaherty were forced to cross the transitional seam between the asphalt shoulder and the concrete travel lane. Flaherty successfully maneuvered his bike over the seam. Walden\u2019s tires slipped into the seam causing him to lose control of his bike. Walden fell, striking his head; he slid down the highway with his bike for about 70 feet and was still strapped into his pedals when he came to a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The first issue on appeal is whether the District Court improperly Instructed the jury on the State\u2019s duty to maintain its highways. Walden contends that the District Court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on his theory of the case. It is the appellant\u2019s theory that the State has a duty to maintain its highways so that they are reasonably safe for bicyclists. To support this theory, the appellant offered Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Jury Instruction Nos. 21 and 51. The District Court refused these instructions and instead gave Instruction No. 30 which was patterned after this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Buck v. State </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 423, 723 P.2d 210. Instruction No. 30 was identical to Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Instruction No. 21, except that it omitted the specific reference to bicyclists and made general reference to \u201cpersons and vehicles.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Instruction No. 21 read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u201cAlthough the State is not an insurer of one who uses the highways, it is under a duty to keep its highways in a reasonably safe condition for ordinary use thereof, <em>including use by bicyclists. </em>The State\u2019s duty extends to the paved portion of the roadway, and to the shoulders and the adjacent parts thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cIt is the further duty of the State to construct and maintain its highways so that no latent nor hidden defect or trap thereon constitutes an unreasonable danger to persons and vehicles, <em>including </em>bicyclists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Instruction No. 30 omitted the emphasized portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">All the given instructions must be read as a whole in determining whether the giving of certain jury instructions constitutes reversible error. If the given instructions, when viewed in their entirety, state the correct law applicable to the case, there is no reversible error. <em>Jacobsen v. State </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 91, 769 P.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The appellant contends that the jury was left to speculate about whether the State has a duty to maintain its highways, where bicycle travel is permitted, in a reasonably safe condition for bicyclists. The appellant insists that the State has such a duty and must make certain the interstate is reasonably safe for bicycles, not just \u201cnormal\u201d vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The question for this Court is whether the instructions given to the jury correctly stated the applicable law. The instructions provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWk\">\u2018You are instructed that Interstate 15 North and South Great Falls was at all times a public highway. [Instruction No. 10.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">\u2018You are instructed that under Montana law a bicycle is defined as a vehicle and that Dirk Walden had the right to be riding his bicycle on Interstate 15 at the time of his accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\u201cWhile the State of Montana Department of Highways may by rule prohibit bicycles from being used on interstates or public highways, the State adopted no such rule prohibiting bicycle use on Interstate 15. [Instruction No. 11.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u2018You are instructed that a person operating a bicycle shall be granted all of the rights and shall be subject to all of the duties applicable to the driver of any other vehicle.\u201d [Instruction No. 12.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa6\">When these instructions are read with Instruction No. 30, no room for speculation exists as to whether the duty to maintain the highways extends to bicyclists. The State\u2019s duty is as stated in Instruction No. 30, to maintain its highways \u201cin a reasonably safe condition for ordinary use thereof.\u201d This duty extends to bicyclists if they are permitted on a specified highway. The jury was properly instructed on this rule of law. Whether or not the State breached this duty and whether or not any such breach was the cause of Walden\u2019s injuries were questions for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The State\u2019s duties with regard to the design, construction, and maintenance of Montana\u2019s highways apply equally to all permitted users, regardless of the user\u2019s status. In other words, automobilists, motorcyclists, bicyclists, pedestrians, and any other permitted users all are entitled to highways that are reasonably safe for ordinary use. Whether or not a given set of circumstances comprises \u201cordinary use\u201d is a determination to be made by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The appellant points to a guide published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual as authority for his argument that the State owes a greater duty to maintain highways for bicycle traffic than the jury instructions reflected. The appellant interprets this literature as mandating that full consideration be given to safely accommodating pedestrian and bicycle traffic on all federal-aid highway projects. However, giving \u201cfull consideration\u201d does not translate into a mandatory duty to bicyclists by the State greater than that upon which the jury was instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The AASHTO guide provides <em>guidelines, </em>not strict standards, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the construction and design of bicycle routes. Furthermore, the purpose of the guide is to \u201cprovide information on the development of new facilities to enhance and encourage safe bicycle travel.\u201d Nowhere does the guide require the duty to bicyclists that is suggested by the appellant. Likewise, the Department of Transportation Manual does not mandate a State duty to maintain its highways for bicyclists. The literature simply provides guidance for enhancing the safety of motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle traffic by planning for the potential conflict of the two types of traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">As we stated in <em>Jacobsen, </em>236 Mont. 91, 769 P.2d 694, a party assigning error to the giving of jury instructions must show prejudice in order to prevail. The appellant has failed to show how the District Court\u2019s failure to give his Proposed Instruction Nos. 21 and 51 has adversely affected his substantial rights. The jury was properly instructed on the applicable law, and Walden was not denied instruction on his theory of the case. The omitted language making specific reference to bicyclists was appropriately covered by the other instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The second issue raised by the appellant is whether the District Corut erred in giving Jury Instruction No. 39 regarding the practicability and cost of highway repair. The instruction read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201cA public entity is not liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property of which it had actual or constructive notice if it establishes that the action taken to protect against the risk of injury created by the condition or the failure to take such action <em>was reasonable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\"><em>\u201cIn determining whether it was reasonable, you shall consider </em>the time and opportunity the defendant had to take action and weight [sic] the probability and gravity of potential injury to persons the defendant should have foreseen might be injured against the practicability and cost of protecting against the risk of such injury.\u201d [Instruction No. 39; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The appellant argues that this instruction provides the State a financial feasibility defense. We disagree. The instruction assists the jury in evaluating the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the State\u2019s actions. The financial feasibility defense would provide the State with a total escape from liability for failing to properly maintain the highways, based solely on a lack of sufficient finances. This defense has been rejected by our Court \u201cwhen cost is the State\u2019s sole excuse for its failure to construct or maintain properly.\u201d <em>Townsend v. State </em>(1987), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>227 Mont. 206, 210, 738 P.2d 1274, 1277. In this case, the District Court also gave the jury the instruction from <em>Townsend </em>clearly negating the financial feasibility defense. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\"><em>\u201cIf </em>you find that Defendant State of Montana was negligent in planning, construction, signing or maintaining the highway in question, <em>you may not excuse the State\u2019s negligence on the ground that proper maintenance or lack of [sic] sufficient employees was beyond the financial means of the State of Montana. </em>Lack of adequate funds or an adequate number of employees is not a factor in the duty of the State to plan, construct, sign or maintain its highways in a reasonably safe condition.\u201d [Instruction No. 27; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The appellant argues that Instruction Nos. 39 and 27 contradict each other and leave the jury to consider a financial feasibility defense. We do not agree. As this Court stated in <em>Modrell v. State </em>(1978), 179 Mont. 498, 501, 587 P.2d 405, 406:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201c[R]eliance on cost as the sole and determining factor would be tantamount to assertion of a financial feasibility defense and therefore impermissible. However, where cost is but one among many factors affecting the State\u2019s choice of a particular method of construction or maintenance, it is relevant evidence on the reasonableness of the alterative taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The appellant\u2019s assertion that the State was provided a financial feasibility defense is without merit. The State was entitled to present evidence to the jury regarding the reasonableness of its actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The third issue is whether the District Court erred in refusing the appellant\u2019s challenge for cause of a prospective juror. The prospective juror in question expressed his opinion of lawsuits as cases where somebody is \u201ctrying to get a quick buck.\u201d He expressed concern regarding the effect of too many lawsuits on the economy of the nation and the State of Montana. He stated that, \u201cI would definitely make it harder on [the appellant] than I would on the State, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Counsel for the State attempted to rehabilitate him by inquiring whether he would be able to set his preconceived opinions aside and follow the court\u2019s instructions. The prospective juror responded, \u201cYes, I think I could do that.\u201d During the voir dire examination, he also stated, in response to an inquiry from the State\u2019s counsel, that he thought the State of Montana should be liable for its negligent acts if its negligent acts cause injury to a person. The District Court denied the appellant\u2019s challenge for cause and the appellant subsequently used one of his peremptory challenges to remove the prospective juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The appellant contends that the prospective juror showed an unqualified opinion or belief as to the merits of the action and that the District Court should have excused him for cause under \u00a7 25-7-223(6), MCA. He argues that the court\u2019s refusal to excuse the prospective juror for cause was prejudicial error in that he was compelled to waste one of his peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The right to peremptory challenges is a substantial right, but not every case of the forced use of a peremptory challenge is grounds for reversal. <em>Abernathy v. Eline Oil Field Services, Inc. </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 205, 216, 650 P.2d 772, 778. In the past, this Court\u2019s practice, in considering the trial court\u2019s refusal to dismiss a prospective juror for cause, has been to reverse only when there is shown an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court. <em>Abernathy, </em>200 Mont. at 214, 650 P.2d at <em>777; Mahan v. Farmers Union Cent. Exchange </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 410, 417, 768 P.2d 850, 855; <em>Tacke v. Vermeer Mfg. Co. </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 1, 7, 713 P.2d 527, 531. It is appropriate at this time to clarify our standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Rule 47(a), M.R.Civ.P., states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u201cExamination of jurors. The court shall permit the parties or their attorneys to conduct the examination of prospective jurors under its supervision. The court may supplement the examination by such further inquiry as it deems proper. <em>Challenges for cause must be tried by the court. </em>The juror challenged and any other person may be examined as a witness on the trial of a challenge.\u201d [Emphasis added.] Under Rule 47(a), whether a prospective juror holds a preconceived opinion as to the merits of the case or is biased or prejudiced against one of the parties is a factual question to be tried by the trial court. Thus, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to deny a challenge for cause, this Court is reviewing a factual determination made by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">\u201cFindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Rule 52(a) itself refers only to findings of fact specially found in actions tried without a jury or with an advisory jury. We have stated that the findings of fact required by Rule 52(a) are \u201cnothing more than a recordation of the essential and determining facts upon which the District Court rest[s] its conclusions of law and without which the District Court\u2019s judgment would lack support.\u201d <em>In re the Marriage of Barron </em>(1978), 177 Mont. 161, 164, 580 P.2d 936, 938. Factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>determinations made by the trial court when entertaining a challenge for cause do not fall squarely within the scope of Rule 52(a). However, <em>because </em>factual determinations are being made by the trial court, the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard contained within the rule is the most appropriate standard for reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to deny a challenge for cause. Therefore, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s refusal to excuse the prospective juror for cause, we will reverse only where it is shown that the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">In applying the clearly erroneous standard to the trial court\u2019s findings, our function is not to decide the factual issues <em>de novo. </em>We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court absent a showing that the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous, even where there is evidence in the record to support contrary findings. <em>Dennis v. Tomahawk Services, Inc. </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 378, 379, 767 P.2d 346, 347. This is especially true when findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses or, as in this case, the credibility of the prospective juror. In such a situation, the trial court must be afforded wide latitude in making its findings because the trial court is in a better position than this Court to determine whether the prospective juror is able to serve impartially. Only the trial court has the opportunity of seeing the prospective juror, hearing the testimony, and noting the manner and demeanor of the prospective juror and the inflections in his or her voice, all of which bear heavily on the determination of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Turning to the particular facts of this case, our review of the \u201ccold record\u201d indicates that certain statements made by the prospective juror, standing alone, could support a finding of bias or prejudice. However, the prospective juror also stated that he thought he could lay his opinions aside and follow the trial court\u2019s instructions. The trial court had the opportunity to observe the prospective juror and to listen to his testimony, and, based on its observations of his manner, demeanor, and tone of voice, found that he could serve impartially. We cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous; thus, we find no clear error on the part of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The fourth issue raised by the appellant is whether he was denied a fair trial as a result of the District Court\u2019s rulings on the bicycle helmet issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The District Court denied Walden\u2019s motion in limine requesting that the State be precluded from presenting evidence that Walden was not wearing a helmet or that such nonuse of a helmet caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>accident. At the conclusion of the evidence, Walden moved for a directed verdict on the issue of helmet nonuse. This motion was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The appellant argues that the District Court\u2019s denial of his motions in limine and for a directed verdict unfairly allowed the jury to conclude that the State\u2019s negligence was not the cause of the appellant\u2019s injuries. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Montana law does not require bicyclists to wear helmets; thus, the failure to wear a helmet ordinarily does not constitute negligence. Our decision in <em>Kopischke v. First Continental Corp. </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 471, 610 P.2d 668, that negligence could not be predicated upon the failure to wear a seat belt at a time when seat belt use was not required, is instructive in this regard. The issue in <em>Kopischke </em>was whether the trial court erred in not allowing the defendant to introduce a seatbelt defense. We affirmed the trial court, holding that where the plaintiff could not have anticipated the defendant\u2019s negligence in causing the accident, the plaintiff\u2019s lack of use of a seat belt was not admissible to show negligence or reduce damages. Under <em>Kopischke, </em>the evidence concerning the appellant\u2019s failure to wear a helmet was not admissible as to negligence. It was not admitted for that purpose. Here, the District Court specifically instructed the jury that the appellant\u2019s failure to wear a helmet was not a legal cause of the accident and did not constitute negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The evidence also was not admissible on the question of damages under our holding in <em>Kopischke. </em>Thus, the District Court erred in admitting the evidence. In rendering its verdict in this case, however, the jury determined that any negligence of the State was not a legal cause of the appellant\u2019s injury; it never reached the question of damages. Thus, any error on the issue of helmet nonuse was harmless, and the appellant was not denied his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The final issue raised is whether the District Court erred in allowing the testimony of Professor Curtis Shirer.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Walden testified in his deposition that he had taken a bicycle safety class at Montana State University. Professor Shirer was the instructor and was called by the State to describe the course material.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The appellant objected to much of Shirer\u2019s testimony on the grounds that it was expert opinion testimony. The State\u2019s response was that Shirer was a fact witness and was \u201cnot going to offer in any way his opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Specifically, Walden objects to four items of Shirer\u2019s testimony. Shirer testified that in his course: he taught the absolute necessity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>wearing a helmet when bicycle riding; he told his students that the effect of falling off a bike without a helmet on is much like taking a cantaloupe and tossing it into the air and letting it hit the ground; he gave examples to his students of friends of his that have had helmets save their lives in bicycle accidents; and he told his students of studies that indicate 75 percent of all bicycle fatalities are head injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">This testimony was offered as a description of course material Walden had taken at college. If, as asserted by the State, Shirer was a fact witness testifying only about what he taught in the bicycle course, then the State must present connecting facts to show that Shirer taught Walden the material in order to establish the relevancy of the testimony. Rules 104(b), 401, M.R.Evid. The testimony indicated, however, that Shirer did not remember Walden; nor did he recognize Walden after he was pointed out in the courtroom. Furthermore, Shirer testified that some of the material may have been taught in optional classes that Walden had not attended. Under these circumstances, the testimony was not relevant under Rule 401, M.R.Evid., and, therefore, was not admissible under Rule 402, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In any event, a nonexpert witness is generally limited to testifying to matters of fact. <em>Estate of Smith </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 140, 749 P.2d 512. Shirer\u2019s testimony had very little factual substance. Shirer\u2019s reference to tossing a cantaloupe into the air and watching it hit the ground is not factual testimony. Simply because this is material Shirer lectured on in his classes does not make it factual testimony. The thrust of the testimony was not the fact that he taught this material, but rather the material itself; and this material was, to a large extent, Shirer\u2019s opinion. A lay witness\u2019 opinion must be helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue. Rule 701, M.R.Evid. The descriptive picture painted by Shirer\u2019s testimony failed to serve either of these purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">For these reasons, we find the District Court erred in allowing Shirer to testify to the extent he did. The error did not prejudice the appellant, however, since the evidence went only to the question of damages and the jury decided the case solely on the question of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES HARRISON, MCDONOUGH, and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b166-9\">JUSTICE HUNT,</author>\n<p id=\"AG2\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>I dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion and would remand this case to the District Court for a new trial. The majority opinion considered five issues on appeal. I would reverse on Issues II, III, and V.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">ISSUE II</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Appellant contends the District Court\u2019s offering, over objection, of Jury Instruction No. 39, regarding the practicability and cost of highway construction and maintenance, constituted reversible error. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The instruction at issue read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201cA public entity is not liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property of which it had actual or constructive notice if it establishes that the action taken to protect against the risk of injury created by the condition or the failure to take such action <em>was reasonable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\"><em>\u201cIn determining whether it was reasonable, </em>you shall consider the time and opportunity the defendant had to take action and weight [sic] the probability and gravity of potential injury to persons the defendant should have foreseen might be injured <em>against the practicability and cost of protecting against the risk of such </em>injury.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">In essence, this instruction provides the State with a financial feasibility defense. This Court has previously held such a defense is not available to the State. <em>State ex rel. Byorth v. District Court </em>(1977), 175 Mont. 63, 572 P.2d 201. <em>Byorth </em>indicated that such a defense was never available to a private party and should not be available to the State. The financial feasibility defense has been before this Court on two occasions subsequent to <em>Byorth. Modrell v. State </em>(1978), 179 Mont. 498, 587 P.2d 405; <em>Townsend v. State </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 206, 738 P.2d 1274. In both decisions, this Court reaffirmed the <em>Byorth </em>holding. The following instruction, which was given in the present case as Instruction No. 27, was approved of by this Court in both <em>Modrell </em>and <em>Townsend:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">\u201cIf you find that Defendant State of Montana was negligent in planning, construction, signing or maintaining the highway in question, you may not excuse the State\u2019s negligence on the ground that proper maintenance or lack of sufficient employees was beyond the financial means of the State of Montana. <em>Lack of adequate funds or an adequate number of employees is not a factor in the duty of the State to plan, construct, sign or maintain its highways in a reasonably safe condition.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Neither <em>Modrell </em>nor <em>Townsend </em>dealt with ajury instruction similar to Instruction No. 39. However, in both cases, the issue of a financial feasibility defense was raised at trial, contrary to our holding in <em>Byorth. </em>First in <em>Modrell, </em>then in <em>Townsend, </em>this Court apparently approved the introduction of evidence concerning the financial feasibility of various alternative courses of action by the State. The Court indicated that although <em>Byorth </em>was still the law in Montana, cost could be considered in the jury\u2019s determination of the reasonableness of the State\u2019s action in constructing and maintaining its highways. It was this language upon which the District Court understandably based its decision to give the respondents\u2019 requested instruction concerning cost and practicability, resulting in the clearly contradictory instructions before the jury. Thus, the jury was told on the one hand that cost or financial feasibility was not a defense to any negligence by the State, while at the same time they were instructed to consider cost in determining if the State\u2019s actions were reasonable, i.e., negligent or not negligent. As Justice John C. Sheehy correctly pointed out in his dissent in <em>Modrell:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">\u201cI am also of the opinion that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the holding in the majority opinion and our holding in the <em>Byorth </em>case. In <em>Byorth, </em>this Court stated if the State failed to discharge its duty to construct reasonably safe highways, and that failure resulted in injury, the State was liable \u2018regardless of [its] personal financial priorities.\u2019 572 P.2d at 203. Yet here we are stating that financial priorities are a \u2018factor\u2019 in determining negligence. Thus we now accord the State what was condemned in <em>Byorth, </em>\u2018a defense a private party never had.\u2019 \u201d 572 P.2d at 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><em>Modrell, </em>587 P.2d at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Faced with these contradictory instructions given by the trial court, there was no way for the jury to determine if cost was or was not a proper factor for their consideration in determining if the State was negligent. I am persuaded this Court\u2019s original analysis set forth in <em>Byorth </em>was correct and that financial feasibility should not be a factor in determining whether the State planned, constructed, or maintained its highways in a negligent manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">ISSUE III</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The third issue considered by the majority concerned the District Court\u2019s refusal of appellant\u2019s challenge for cause of a prospective juror. I accept the majority\u2019s decision that the proper standard of review in this situation should be a clearly erroneous standard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>However, even when reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision under this standard, which requires this Court to defer to the decision below unless clearly erroneous, I would reverse on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The Montana Constitution, art. II, \u00a7 26, guarantees the right to a jury trial, and, as we have previously stated, \u201c[c]oncomitant with that right is the right to a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>Mahan v. Farmers Union Central Exchange </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 410, 418, 768 P.2d 850, 855. A prospective juror who has demonstrated \u201can unqualified opinion or belief as to the merits of the action ...\u201d is subject to a challenge for cause. Section 25-7-223(6), MCA. Additionally, the statute provides that a challenge for cause is proper in light <em>of </em>statements by the prospective juror \u201cevincing enmity against or bias in favor of either party.\u201d Section 25-7-223(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The statements made by the prospective juror in this case clearly fall within the statutory criteria for excluding a juror for cause. Even after attempted rehabilitation, the juror was only able to say that he <em>thought </em>he could be impartial and follow the law. This is clearly insufficient. After appellant\u2019s challenge for cause, the prospective juror continued to demonstrate enmity against appellant\u2019s action and bias in favor of the State. Appellant was entitled to have this juror dismissed for cause in light of the juror\u2019s candid admissions of an unqualified opinion and belief as to the merits of the action. Appellant was forced to use a peremptory challenge to disqualify the juror. Appellant used all of his peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The majority correctly points out that it is reversible error when the trial court, in an abuse of discretion, fails to properly dismiss a juror for cause. <em>Abernathy v. Eline Oil Field Services, Inc. </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 205, 216, 650 P.2d. 772, 778. This principle is unaffected by the majority\u2019s adoption of the clearly erroneous standard in place of the abuse of discretion standard. I would reverse on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">ISSUE V</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">I agree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the testimony offered by respondents\u2019 witness, Shirer, inasmuch as the majority found the testimony was error. However, the testimony in question was extremely prejudicial, and I would, therefore, reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-9\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER concurs with the foregoing dissent of JUSTICE HUNT.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
