Michigan Department of the Treasury </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 803, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891, should be retroactively applied, entitling the plaintiffs to refunds for taxes paid in previous years.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-17\">Plaintiffs are retired federal employees who filed a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>declaratory relief seeking to have \u00a7 15-30-lll(2)(c)(i), MCA (1989), declared unconstitutional. That statute provided that Montana state income tax would be assessed on benefits received under the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement Act in excess of $3,600. In contrast, under \u00a7 19-3-105, MCA (1989), all retirement benefits received under Montana\u2019s Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System were exempt from state and local taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Following the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>in March 1989, the District Court adopted the parties\u2019 stipulation to the effect that \u00a7 15-30-lll(2)(c)(i), MCA (1989), is invalid for tax years commencing after December 31, 1988. The plaintiffs then moved for summary judgment that <em>Davis </em>should be applied retroactively and that they are entitled to refunds for previous tax years, subject to the statute of limitations. (In <em>Davis, </em>the state had conceded that refunds for previous years would be proper if the court found for plaintiffs.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Using the factors set forth in <em>LaRoque v. State </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 315, 583 P.2d 1059, the District Court determined that <em>Davis </em>should not be applied retroactively. The court ruled that the <em>Davis </em>decision was neither predictable nor clearly foreshadowed. It decided that retroactive application of <em>Davis </em>would not promote the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity because it had already required that, in the future, federal and state retirees must be treated the same. Finally, it stated that adding the cost of refunds to Montana\u2019s budget deficit would be inequitable to the citizens of Montana. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Should the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Davis </em>be applied retroactively, entitling the plaintiffs to refunds for taxes paid in previous years?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We will first review the major elements of the opinion of the United States Supreme Court <em>inDavis. </em>In that case, the plaintiffs challenged a Michigan tax scheme which exempted from state taxation all retirement benefits paid by the state to its retired employees but taxed retirement benefits paid by other employers, including the federal government. The Michigan Court of Appeals upheld the tax scheme, ruling that 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 Ill did not apply to retirees and that, under a rational basis test, the taxing scheme was not unconstitutional because it furthered the state\u2019s interest in attracting and retaining qualified employees. The Michigan Supreme Court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>leave to appeal. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed, holding that the Michigan tax scheme violated the concept of intergovernmental tax immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In delivering the Court\u2019s opinion, Justice Kennedy first disposed of the State\u2019s argument that 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 Ill applies only to current employees of the federal government. In relevant part, that statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201cThe United States consents to the taxation of pay or compensation for personal service as an officer or employee of the United States ... by a duly constituted taxing authority having jurisdiction, if the taxation does not discriminate against the officer or employee because of the source of the pay or compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">\u201cWe have no difficulty concluding that civil service retirement benefits are deferred compensation for past years of service rendered to the Government.\u201d [Citations omitted.] And because these benefits accrue to employees on account of their service to the Government, they fall squarely within the category of compensation for services rendered \u2018as an officer or employee of the United States.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\"><em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 808, 109 S.Ct. at 1503-04. The Court then went on to conclude that the nondiscrimination clause applies to retirement benefits because retirement benefits are included in \u201cpay or compensation.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 809, 109 S.Ct. at 1504.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The Court next discussed 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 Ill as a codification of the rule that the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity does not prohibit nondiscriminatory state taxation of federal employees. <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 810-14, 109 S.Ct. at 1505-07. The Court stated that although intergovernmental tax immunity is based on the need to protect each sovereign\u2019s governmental operations from undue influence by the other, private entities or individuals who are subjected to discriminatory taxation on account of their dealings with a sovereign can also receive the protection of the constitutional doctrine. <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 814-15, 109 S.Ct. at 1507.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The Court then stated that the mode of analysis developed in equal protection cases was \u201cinappropriate\u201d in <em>Davis. </em>Instead, the test is whether the inconsistent tax treatment is related to and justified by significant differences between the two classes. <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 816, 109 S.Ct. at 1508.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">The Court concluded that significant differences were not present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>and that therefore the tax act in question violated principles of intergovernmental tax immunity. <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 817, 109 S.Ct. at 1508. The Court remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Plaintiffs also direct the Court\u2019s attention to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia </em>(1991), 501 U.S._, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481. The opinion in <em>Jim Beam </em>was issued on June 20, 1991, after oral argument in the present case. In <em>Jim Beam, </em>the Court held that it is error to refuse to apply a rule of federal law retroactively after the case announcing the rule has already done so. Plaintiffs argue that rule is dispositive and the decision in <em>Davis </em>must be applied retroactively here because it was applied retroactively in that case. Both parties submitted supplemental briefs discussing the application of <em>Jim Beam </em>to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">When <em>Jim Beam </em>was decided, pending before the Court on applications for certiorari were two cases in which retired federal employees in South Carolina and Virginia seek refunds of state income taxes under theories similar to those argued here. After <em>Jim Beam </em>was decided, the Court granted certiorari in both of those cases, vacated the state court decisions denying refunds, and remanded the cases to the state courts for \u201cfurther consideration\u201d in light of <em>Jim Beam. Bass v. State of South Carolina </em>(1991),_U.S._, 111 S.Ct. 2881, 115 L.Ed.2d 1047; <em>Harper v. Virginia </em>(1991),_U.S._, 111 S.Ct. 2883, 115 L.Ed.2d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">The fact that the Supreme Court remanded <em>Bass </em>and <em>Harper </em>rather than simply reversing them indicates the Court\u2019s uncertainty as to whether <em>Jim Beam </em>applies to the issue of <em>Davis\u2019 </em>s retroactivity. We conclude that it does not apply. In <em>Davis, </em>the State had conceded that a refund was appropriate if the Court ruled for the appellants. <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 817, 109 S.Ct. at 1508. Because of that concession, the Court did not consider the issue of whether retroactive application should be granted. We therefore conclude that <em>Davis </em>is not authority for application of its rule retroactively. The underpinnings of the decision in <em>Jim Beam </em>are the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>and the principle of equality to all similarly situated litigants. <em>Jim Beam, </em>111 S.Ct. at 2446. Because <em>Davis </em>did not rule upon the issue of retroactivity, we conclude that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>does not apply. We conclude that the principle of equality or equal treatment to similarly situated litigants does not require that all future litigants, including the litigants in the present case, are bound by the stipulation of the State of Michigan in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">We now consider whether retroactive application of the law set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>forth in <em>Davis </em>is appropriate in this case. In <em>Chevron Oil v. Huson </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296, the United States Supreme Court recognized three factors to be considered before a rule of nonretroactive application of a judicial decision is adopted. Those factors are 1) whether the decision establishes a new principle of law either by overruling established precedent on which litigants have relied, or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not foreshadowed, thereby leading to the conclusion that the decision should not be applied retroactively; 2) whether retroactive application will further or retard operation of the rule in question; and 3) whether substantial inequity will result from retroactive application. <em>Chevron, </em>404 U.S. at 106-07, 92 S.Ct. at 355. Use of these three factors was adopted by this Court in <em>LaRoque, </em>583 P.2d at 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Plaintiffs argue that the result in <em>Davis </em>was clearly foreshadowed under the long-standing principle of intergovernmental tax immunity and as a logical extension of the Court\u2019s decisions in a series of cases. However, as the State points out, the holding in <em>Davis </em>required three extensions of prior law. We will examine all three extensions of prior law to determine if each extension was clearly foreshadowed by previous cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In its first extension, the <em>Davis </em>Court pointed out that while retirement pay is not actually disbursed dining the time an individual is working for the government, the amount of benefits to be received in retirement are based and computed upon the individual\u2019s salary and years of service. The Court \u201chad no difficulty\u201d concluding that civil service retirement benefits are deferred compensation for past years of service and therefore fall within the category of compensation for services rendered as an officer or employee of the United States. As authority for that conclusion, three federal circuit cases were cited. <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 808, 109 S.Ct. at 1503-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In its <em>Davis </em>holding, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the contention that 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 invalidated the Michigan tax, noting that the statute applied only to federal \u201cemployees.\u201d Then the Michigan court determined that the appellants\u2019 status under federal law in <em>Davis </em>was that of an \u201cannuitant,\u201d rather than as an employee, and that, as a result, 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 had no application. The logical determination by the Michigan court together with the action of other states which used tax schemes like Michigan\u2019s and Montana\u2019s, suggest there is a significant question of foreshadowing the application of 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The second extension of prior law took place when the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>established the connection between the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity and the protection against discriminatory taxation of individuals under 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 Ill. Plaintiffs argue that the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity had been extended to protect individuals at least since the decision in <em>Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist. </em>(1960), 361 U.S. 376, 80 S.Ct. 474, 4 L.Ed.2d 384. But the <em>Davis </em>language addressing the relationship between intergovernmental tax immunity and 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 Ill clearly breaks new ground:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">\u201c[I]t is reasonable to conclude that Congress drew upon the constitutional doctrine [of intergovernmental tax immunity] in defining the scope of the immunity retained in \u00a7 Ill .... Hence, we conclude that the retention of immunity in \u00a7 Ill is coextensive with the prohibition against discriminatory taxes embodied in the modern constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 813, 109 S.Ct. 1506. The conclusion that the protection against discriminatory taxation retained under 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 Ill is coextensive with the protection under the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity represented an extension of prior law.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The third extension of prior law made in <em>Davis </em>follows from the first two extensions. In determining whether the state tax discriminated against federal employees, the Court decided that a \u201csignificant difference\u201d standard should be used rather than one of the standards typically applied in equal protection cases. As plaintiffs point out, a \u201csignificant difference\u201d standard had been used in matters involving intergovernmental tax immunity. See <em>Phillips, </em>361 U.S. at 387, 80 S.Ct. at 481. However, in taxation cases in which equal protection is at issue, the Court had used as a standard the reasonableness of the classification. See <em>Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co. </em>(1973), 410 U.S. 356, 359-60, 93 S.Ct. 1001, 1003-4, 35 L.Ed.2d 351, 355. Until the Court determined in <em>Davis </em>that retirement benefits are protected under 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 and that the protections under that statute are coextensive with those provided under the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity, the standard of analysis was not clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The majority opinion in <em>Davis </em>clearly describes the Michigan view which rejected the contention that the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity rendered the Michigan tax unconstitutional as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">\u201cThe Michigan Court of Appeals next rejected appellant\u2019s contention that the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity rendered the state\u2019s tax treatment of federal retirement benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>unconstitutional. Conceding that \u2018a tax may be held invalid ... if it operates to discriminate against the federal government and those with whom it deals,\u2019... the court examined the State\u2019s justifications for the discrimination under a rational-basis test. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court determined that the State\u2019s interest in \u2018attracting and retaining ... qualified employees\u2019 was a \u2018legitimate state objective which is rationally achieved by a retirement plan offering economic inducements,\u2019 and it upheld the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 807, 109 S.Ct. at 1503. Using an equal protection analysis, the Michigan court concluded that the legitimate Michigan objective was a rational reason for the discrimination. That of course is directly contradictory to the conclusion reached in <em>Davis, </em>where the Supreme Court concluded that an equal protection analysis was not applicable and used a different standard. The critical significance of the standard of analysis is plain from the following passage from the Court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cThe State points to two allegedly significant differences between federal and state retirees. First, the State suggests that its interest in hiring and retaining qualified civil servants through the inducement of a tax exemption for retirement benefits is sufficient to justify the preferential treatment of its retired employees. This argument is wholly beside the point, however, for it does nothing to demonstrate that there are \u2018significant differences between the two classes\u2019 themselves; rather, <em>it merely demonstrates that the State has a rational reason for discriminating between two similar groups of retirees. The State\u2019s interest in adopting the discriminatory tax, no matter how substantial, is simply irrelevant to an inquiry into the nature of the two classes receiving inconsistent treatment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 816, 109 S.Ct. at 1508. Thus, while it appears that the State of Michigan\u2019s tax statutes would have been constitutional under an equal protection analysis, the tax statutes could not pass the \u201csignificant difference\u201d test which the Court concluded must be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In his dissent in <em>Davis, </em>Justice Stevens distinguished <em>Phillips, </em>upon which the majority relied as precedent for use of the \u201csignificant difference\u201d standard. In <em>Phillips, </em>the tax was imposed <em>only </em>on lessees of federal property. Justice Stevens stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201cThe States can tax federal employees or private parties who do business with the United States so long as the tax does not discriminate against the United States ... The Court today strikes down a state tax that applies equally to the vast majority of Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>residents, including federal employees, because it treats retired state employees differently from retired federal employees. The Court\u2019s holding is not supported by the rationale for the intergovernmental immunity doctrine and is not compelled by our previous decisions. I cannot join the unjustified, court-imposed restriction on a State\u2019s power to administer its own affairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">\"... When the tax burden is shared equally by federal agents and the vast majority of a State\u2019s citizens, however, the nondiscrimination principle is not applicable and constitutional protection is not necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201cThe Michigan tax here applies to approximately 4V2 million individual taxpayers in the State, including the 24,000 retired federal employees. It exempts only the 130,000 retired state employees. Once one understands the underlying reason for the <em>McCulloch [v. Maryland, 4 </em>Wheat 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819)] holding, it is plain that this tax does not unconstitutionally discriminate against federal employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\"><em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 818-21, 109 S.Ct. at 1509 -11. Injustice Stevens\u2019 view the Court\u2019s holding is not supported by the rationale for the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine and is not compelled by the Supreme Court\u2019s previous decisions. Under the established equal protection analysis, the Michigan tax scheme appeared constitutional, but it failed the \u201csignificant difference\u201d test which the Court applied. Applying the first factor under <em>Chevron </em>to this aspect, it appears that <em>Davis </em>did establish a new principle of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Plaintiffs further argue that the issue of whether the <em>Davis </em>decision was foreshadowed is controlled by this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jenson v. State Dept. of Labor and Industry </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 84, 689 P.2d 1231, <em>aff\u2019d after remand, </em>221 Mont. 42, 718 P.2d 1335. In <em>Jenson, </em>the issue was whether this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Crabtree v. Montana State Library </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 398, 665 P.2d 231, was foreshadowed. This Court held that <em>Crabtree </em>did not create any new law because it simply was stating the plain language of the Veteran\u2019s Preference Act. <em>Jenson, </em>689 P.2d at 1233. Plaintiffs argue that in <em>Davis </em>the Court simply was stating the plain language of 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">However, in <em>Davis, </em>as the State has pointed out, there was an additional step. 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 prohibits discriminatory taxation of \u201cpay or compensation\u201d received from the federal government. The Court held that federal retirement benefits were included in \u201cpay or compensation\u201d so that 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 applied. <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 808. In <em>Crabtree, </em>the Court was not faced with a comparable preliminary issue of whether the statute was applicable to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>We conclude that this Court\u2019s opinion in Jenson does not control as to whether <em>Davis </em>was foreshadowed. Further, because the <em>Davis </em>opinion required at least three extensions of previous law as discussed above, we hold that the result was not clearly foreshadowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The second element of the <em>Chevron </em>test is whether retroactive application will further or retard operation of the rule in question. The District Court stated that it could not \u201csee how a retroactive application of the <em>Davis </em>decision would in any way promote\u201d the concept of intergovernmental tax immunity. Plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe state\u2019s total disregard for 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 would be condoned if <em>Davis </em>is not applied retroactively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Because we have concluded that the decision in <em>Davis </em>was not foreshadowed, the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the tax imposed was illegal is an overstatement. The taxation scheme was not \u201cillegal\u201d until the <em>Davis </em>decision was issued, and the tax has not been imposed since that time. We conclude that refunds, as a result of retroactive application of <em>Davis, </em>would not promote the concept of intergovernmental tax immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In considering the third factor under <em>Chevron, </em>the District Court concluded that equity directed that refunds not be made due to the financial burden on the citizens of the State of Montana. Plaintiffs argue that equity favors making refunds because it is Montana\u2019s public policy to provide refunds of illegally collected taxes. But, as we have discussed above, taxes collected before the opinion in <em>Davis </em>were not illegally collected taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">4 U.S.C. \u00a7 Ill was enacted in 1939. Between that time and the date of the <em>Davis </em>decision, twenty-two other states enacted and used tax plans much like Montana\u2019s, giving tax advantages to state retirees over other retirees. We conclude that, in view of the acceptance and usage of similar tax plans for approximately 50 years, it would be inequitable to provide refunds to federal retirees when those refunds would of necessity be made at the expense of all Montana taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">After considering the three factors set out in <em>Chevron, </em>we conclude that the District Court did not err in concluding that <em>Davis </em>should not be applied retroactively. We therefore hold that the court did not err in ruling that the plaintiffs are not entitled to tax refunds for the years 1983 through 1988.</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES McDONOUGH, L.C. GULBRANDSON, Retired, sitting in for JUSTICE HARRISON, and C.B. McNEIL, District Judge, Retired, sitting in for JUSTICE HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"A-3\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">I concur with that part of the majority\u2019s opinion which holds that <em>James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia </em>(1991), 501 U.S._, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481, is not applicable to the issue of the retroactivity of <em>Davis v. Michigan Department of Treasury </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 803, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891. However, I respectfully dissent from that part of the majority\u2019s opinion which holds that <em>Davis </em>should not be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">I agree with the majority that the determination of whether the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis </em>is to be applied retroactively or only prospectively is governed by the three-pronged test enunciated in <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 and utilized by this Court in <em>LaRoque v. State </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 315, 583 P.2d 1059. However, I disagree with the conclusions reached by the majority under each prong of the test as applied to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis. </em>Furthermore, I believe that the weakness of the majority\u2019s opinion is clearly demonstrated by its heavy reliance on the overturned decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals and the lone dissent of Justice Stevens in <em>Davis. </em>Such reliance by the majority largely ignores the <em>Davis </em>Court majority\u2019s rationale in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">For a decision to be applied only prospectively, the first prong of the <em>Chevron </em>test requires that the decision \u201cestablish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied ... or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>404 U.S. at 106, 92 S.Ct. at 355.. Because <em>Davis </em>did not overrule clear past precedent, this Court\u2019s analysis is properly limited to the consideration of whether the decision in <em>Davis </em>was clearly foreshadowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The majority states that the <em>Davis </em>decision was not clearly foreshadowed on the bases that in order to reach its decision in <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court had to (1) extend 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 Ill to federal retirees receiving pension benefits; (2) extend the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity to employees of the governmental entity, as well as the entity itself; and (3) decide that the proper standard for determining the validity of a state statute where intergovernmental tax immunity is involved is a \u201csignificant difference\u201d standard, rather than a rational basis standard. The majority also states that the fact that twenty-three states, including Montana, had tax schemes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>similar to that of Michigan which the Supreme Court invalidated in <em>Davis, </em>lends support to its conclusion that the holding in <em>Davis </em>was not clearly foreshadowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">It is my view that a plain reading of the <em>Davis </em>decision itself, together with previous United States Supreme Court decisions, leads to the irrefutable conclusion that the <em>Davis </em>decision was clearly foreshadowed. Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, the Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>did not \u201cextend\u201d 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 to federal retirees receiving pension benefits. The Supreme Court made it very clear that \u00a7 111 applies to both current and past employees and to pension benefits <em>based upon the plain language of the statute:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, the State argues that \u00a7 111 applies only to current employees of the Federal Government, not to retirees such as appellant. In our view, however, the plain language of the statute dictates the opposite conclusion. Section Ill by its terms applies to \u2018the taxation of pay or <em>compensation for personal services as an officer or employee of the United States.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201cWe have no difficulty concluding that civil service retirement benefits are deferred compensation for past years of service rendered to the Government.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\"><em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 808, 109 S.Ct. at 1503-04.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\u201cAny other interpretation of the nondiscrimination clause would be implausible at best. It is difficult to imagine that Congress consented to discriminatory taxation of the pensions of retired federal civil servants while refusing to permit such taxation of current employees, and nothing in the statutory language or even in the legislative history suggests this result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\"><em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 810, 109 S.Ct. at 1505. Assuming that the majority of eight Justices of the United States Supreme Court intended the plain meaning of its words, there is no room for doubt that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that federal retirees fall within the protection of \u00a7 Ill was clearly predictable or foreshadowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Furthermore, I believe that <em>Davis </em>is directly on point with <em>Jensen v. State Department of Labor and Industry </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 84, 689 P.2d 1231. As the majority opinion notes, this Court in <em>Jensen </em>held that <em>Crabtree v. Montana State Library </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 398, 665 P.2d 231, did not create any new law because it simply was stating the plain language of the Veteran\u2019s Preference Act. In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Corut did not create any new law because, as the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Court itself stated, the <em>plain language </em>of \u00a7 Ill dictated its holding that the statute applies to both current and past employees and to the pension benefits. <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 808, 109 S.Ct. at 1503-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The majority would have the reader believe that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision <em>in Davis </em>constituted an unforeshadowed, abrupt and fundamental change in the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity through its holding that employees of the governmental entity, as well as the governmental entity itself, come within the protection of the doctrine. The majority states that \u201c[t]he <em>Davis </em>language addressing the relationship between intergovernmental tax immunity and 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 clearly breaks new ground.\u201d At 1260-61. This is simply not the case as evidenced by the Supreme Court\u2019s own observations in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\u201cOn its face, \u00a7 Ill purports to be nothing more than a partial congressional consent to nondiscriminatory state taxation of federal employees. It can be argued, however, that by negative implication \u00a7 Ill also constitutes an affirmative statutory grant of immunity from discriminatory state taxation in addition to, and coextensive with, the pre-existing protection afforded by the constitutional doctrine. <em>Regardless of whether \u00a7 Ill provides an independent basis for finding immunity or merely preserves the traditional constitutional prohibition against discriminatory taxes, however, the inquiry is the same. </em>In either case, the scope of the immunity granted or retained by the nondiscrimination clause is to be determined by reference to the constitutional doctrine. Thus, the dispositive question in this case is whether the tax imposed on appellant is barred by the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.\u201d [Emphasis added.] <em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 813-14, 109 S.Ct. at 1507.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u201cIt is true that intergovernmental tax immunity is based on the need to protect each sovereign\u2019s governmental operations from undue interference by the other. <em>Graves [v. People ex rel. </em>O\u2019Keefe], 306 U.S. [466], at 481 [59 S.Ct. 595, 83 L.Ed. 927]; <em>McCulloch v. Maryland, </em>4 Wheat., at [316] 435-436, [17 U.S. 316, 4 L.Ed. 579], But it does not follow that private entities or individuals who are subjected to discriminatory taxation on account of their dealings with a sovereign cannot themselves receive the protection of the constitutional doctrine. Indeed all precedent is to the contrary. In <em>Phillips Chemical Co., </em>supra, for example, we considered a private corporation\u2019s claim that a state tax discriminated against private lessees of federal land. We concluded that the tax \u201cdiscriminate[d] unconstitutionally against the United States and <em>its lessee,\u201d </em>and accordingly held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the tax could not be exacted. 361 U.S., at 387, [80 S.Ct. at 481] ... . [Emphasis in original.] The State offers no reasons for departing from this <em>settled rule, </em>and we decline to do so.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 814-15, 109 S.Ct. at 1507. Again, assuming the <em>Davis </em>Court intended the plain meaning of its words, there can be no question that it was clearly predictable or foreshadowed that federal retirees fall within the protection of the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Davis </em>was not clearly foreshadowed because the Supreme Court had to decide that the proper standard for determining the validity of the state tax scheme is a \u201csignificant difference\u201d standard, rather than a rational basis standard. The Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>made it clear that the proper standard to be applied when intergovernmental tax immunity is involved was <em>settled under existing authority.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><em>\u201cUnder our precedents, </em>\u00a3[t]he imposition of a heavier tax burden on [those who deal with one sovereign] than is imposed on [those who deal with the other] must be justified by significant differences between the two classes.\u2019 <em>Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist., </em>361 U.S., at 383 [80 S.Ct. at 479.] In determining whether this standard of justification has been met, it is inappropriate to rely solely on the mode of analysis developed in our equal protection cases. We have <em>previously observed </em>that \u2018our decisions in [the equal protection] field are not necessarily controlling where problems of intergovernmental tax immunity are involved,\u2019 because \u2018the Government\u2019s interests must be weighed in the balance.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 385, [80 S.Ct. at 480]. Instead, the relevant inquiry is whether the inconsistent tax treatment is directly related to, and justified by, \u2018significant differences between the two classes.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 383-385, 80 S.Ct. at 479-80.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 815-16. 109 S.Ct. at 1508. The Supreme Court was citing its decision in <em>Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist. </em>(1960), 361 U.S. 376, 80 S.Ct. 474, 4 L.Ed.2d 384, decided nearly thirty years before <em>Davis. </em>Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s application of the \u201csignificant difference\u201d standard in <em>Davis </em>was clearly foreshadowed in light of this existing precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The majority places great weight on the State\u2019s (and other states\u2019) reliance on the previously uncontested nature of 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 Ill with respect to its application to federal retirees. In my view, the fact that twenty-three states, including Montana, had tax schemes similar to the one invalidated in <em>Davis </em>is conclusive of nothing more than that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Davis </em>decided an issue of first impression. It does not follow, as the majority opinion implies, that the <em>Davis </em>decision was not foreshadowed. Where the plain language of the statute involved, together with existing precedent, mandates a particular holding, as was clearly shown in <em>Davis, </em>the prevalence of the wrong is irrelevant to the determination of whether that holding was clearly foreshadowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">In applying the second prong of the <em>Chevron </em>test, the majority concludes that retroactive application of <em>Davis </em>would not promote the concept of intergovernmental tax immunity. I disagree. In my view, the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity can only be furthered by the retroactive application of <em>Davis. </em>Refusing to apply <em>Davis </em>retroactively means that this Court has condoned the State\u2019s total disregard for the plain language of 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 and is akin to a continuation of past discrimination. Such a result does not further and, indeed, retards the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity in that it does not tend to deter future State violations of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">With respect to the third prong of the <em>Chevron </em>test, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the equities in this case favor a non-retroactive application of <em>Davis. </em>In considering the equities of retroactive application of a judicial decision, I am fully aware that great weight must be given to the State\u2019s reliance upon a presumptively valid statute, enacted in good faith <em>and by no means plainly unlawful. See Lemon v. Kurtzman </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 192, 93 S.Ct. 1463, 36 L.Ed.2d 151. However, where the statute in question is plainly violative of federal statutory and case law, as was Montana\u2019s tax scheme in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Davis, </em>the State\u2019s reliance interests are of little or no import. <em>McKesson Corp. v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco </em>(1990), 495 U.S. 18,_, 110 S.Ct. 2238, 2257, 110 L.Ed.2d 17, 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">It is true, as the majority states, that refunds to the federal retirees would result in a financial burden on the other taxpayers of the State; it also is true, however, that those taxpayers have benefited greatly from the federal retirees\u2019 overpayment of taxes over many years. In any event, the State\u2019s and taxpayers\u2019 exposure to the disruptive impact of the tax scheme\u2019s invalidation is limited because of the five-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Furthermore, the State would not necessarily have to refund the unconstitutionally collected taxes. The federal retirees have indicated their willingness to accept a tax credit mechanism in lieu of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>actual refunds as a possible remedy which, in my view, has the potential of softening the impact on the State\u2019s financial stability even more.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Finally, it must be recognized that, notwithstanding the financial impact to the State, substantial inequities have been wrought upon the federal retirees over a period of many years. Retirees who paid the discriminatory tax and have since left Montana or died would receive no remedy even under a proper resolution of this case. Others would receive back only a small portion of the discriminatory taxes they paid, no matter what remedy might be fashioned, because of the applicable statute of limitations. How the majority can conclude that the <em>Chevron </em>\u201cequities\u201d prong favors the State, as opposed to the federal retirees who were wrongfully discriminated against by the State, is simply beyond my understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">I would reverse the judgment of the District Court and hold that under the <em>Chevron </em>test, the <em>Davis </em>decision is to be applied retroactively. Having so held, I would remand this case to the District Court for a determination of the proper remedy to be provided to the federal retirees.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b474-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER,</author>\n<p id=\"AfK\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">I dissent from the majority opinion in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">I concur with that part of Justice Gray\u2019s opinion which concludes that the case of <em>Davis v. Michigan Department of Treasury </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 803, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891, should be applied retroactively based upon the three-prong test set forth in <em>Chevron Oil Company v. Huson </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s argument, the result in <em>Davis </em>was clearly foreshadowed by the plain language of 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 and by the Supreme Court\u2019s prior decisions in <em>Phillips Chemical Company v. Dumas Independent School District </em>(1960), 361 U.S. 376, 387, 80 S.Ct. 474, 481, 4 L.Ed.2d 384, 391-92, and <em>Memphis Bank and Trust Company v. Garner </em>(1983), 459 U.S. 392, 397 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 692, 696 n. 7, 74 L.Ed.2d 562, 567 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">As pointed out by the Supreme Court in <em>Davis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">\u201cWhen the first part of \u00a7 Ill is read together with the nondiscrimination clause, the operative words of the statute are as follows: The United States consents to the taxation of pay or compensation ... if the taxation does not discriminate ... because of the source of the pay or compensation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-12\"><em>Davis, </em>489 U.S. at 809, 109 S.Ct. at 1504, 103 L.Ed.2d at 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Retirement benefits are clearly deferred compensation. Therefore, I cannot comprehend how 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 Ill could be construed any way other than the manner in which it was construed in <em>Davis. </em>As pointed out in Justice Gray\u2019s dissent, we have previously held in <em>Jensen v. State Department of Labor and Industry </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 84, 689 P.2d 1231, that the plain language of a statute is sufficient to foreshadow a judicial decision which applies that statute. I cannot think of a clearer example of that being the case than the United States Supreme Court\u2019s application of 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The majority opinion is a nearly verbatim adoption of the Department of Revenue\u2019s strained rationale that <em>Davis </em>was not foreshadowed because it resulted in three extensions of prior law. However, that same argument was made by the State of Michigan in <em>Davis </em>and in each respect was refuted by the eight out of nine Supreme Court Justices who subscribed to the majority opinion in <em>Davis. </em>The fact that this Court would then ignore the majority opinion and subscribe to the Department of Revenue\u2019s argument on the basis of the lone dissent, is at best a peculiar way to apply controlling United States Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Having pointed out that I agree with Justice Gray\u2019s thorough analysis of the <em>Chevron </em>test for retroactivity, and concluding that that test requires retroactive application of <em>Davis, </em>I do not feel that it is necessary to apply the <em>Chevron </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The United States Supreme Court has recently gone even further to make clear that the result arrived at by the majority in this case is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In <em>James B. Beam Distilling Company v. Georgia </em>(1991), _U.S._, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481, the United States Supreme Court dealt with a similar issue regarding retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">In the <em>Beam </em>case, the Court was asked to decide whether its decision in <em>Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 263, 104 S.Ct. 3049, 82 L.Ed.2d 200, should apply retroactively to claims based on facts which preceded that decision. The effect of the <em>Bacchus </em>decision was to hold that state laws which imposed an excise tax on imported alcoholic beverages at a rate greater than those imposed on alcoholic beverages manufactured within that state violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Following the <em>Bacchus </em>decision, the petitioner in <em>Beam </em>claimed that Georgia\u2019s law amounted to the same violation, and, on that basis, sought a refund of the taxes it had previously paid in the years 1982,1983, and 1984. The state courts in Georgia, however, refused to apply <em>Bacchus </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the years in question based upon their analysis of <em>Chevron Oil Company v. Huson </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296. In other words, the Supreme Court in Georgia applied the same rationale in <em>Beam </em>to deny a refund that the majority relies on in this case to deny a refund to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Beam sought a writ of certiorari. The United States Supreme Court granted Beam\u2019s petition and reversed the Supreme Court of Georgia on June 20, 1991. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In arriving at its decision, the Supreme Court concluded that unless it specifies that its decisions are prospective only, they are to be applied retroactively. It furthermore stated that where its decisions are applied retroactively to one set of litigants, they must be applied retroactively to similarly situated persons who are not barred procedurally from asserting their rights. Particularly relevant to this case was the Court\u2019s holding that its decision limits the possible applications of the <em>Chevron Oil </em>analysis. The Supreme Court stated in part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u201cQuestions of remedy aside, <em>Bacchus </em>is fairly read to hold as a choice of law that its rule should apply retroactively to the litigants then before the Court. Because the <em>Bacchus </em>opinion did not reserve the question whether its holding should be applied to the parties before it... it is properly understood to have followed the normal rule of retroactive application in civil cases ... . Because the court in <em>Bacchus </em>remanded the case solely for consideration of the pass-through defense, it thus should be read as having retroactively applied the rule there decided. See also <em>Williams v. Vermont, </em>472 U.S. 14, 28, 105 S.Ct. 2465, 2474, 86 L.Ed.2d 11 (1985); <em>Exxon Corp. v. Eagerton, </em>462 U.S. 176, 196-197, 103 S.Ct. 2296, 2308-2309, 76 L.Ed.2d 497 (1983); cf. <em>Davis v. Michigan Department of Treasury, </em>489 U.S. 803, 817, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 1508, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989). Beam,_U.S. at_, 111 S.Ct. at 2445-46, 115 L.Ed.2d at 490-91.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">It is significant that the Supreme Comb actually cited <em>Davis </em>for the principle of retroactivity. The Court then went on to add:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\"><em>\u201cBacchus </em>thus applied its own rule, just as if it had reversed and remanded without further ado, and yet of course the Georgia courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>refused to apply that rule with respect to the litigants in this case. Thus, the question is whether it is error to refuse to apply a rule of federal law retroactively after the case announcing the rule has already done so. We hold that it is, principles of equality and <em>stare decisis </em>here prevailing over any claim based on a <em>Chevron Oil </em>analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">\u201c... To this extent, our decision here does limit the possible applications of the <em>Chevron Oil </em>analysis, however irrelevant <em>Chevron Oil </em>may otherwise be to this case. Because the rejection of modified prospectivity precludes retroactive application of a new rule to some litigants when it is not applied to others, the <em>Chevron Oil </em>test cannot determine the choice of law by relying on the equities of the particular case. Once retroactive application is chosen for any assertedly new rule, it is chosen for all others who might seek its prospective application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\"... [W]hen the Corut has applied a rule of law to the litigants in one case, it must do so with respect to all others not barred by procedural requirements or res judicata.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1x\">Beam,_U.S. at_,_, 111 S.Ct. at 2446, 2447-48, 115 L.Ed.2d at 491, 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The majority concludes that <em>Beam </em>is not applicable to this case because the Supreme Court did not apply <em>Davis </em>retroactively. It was applied retroactively, based on the stipulation of the parties to that case. However, that reasoning ignores Justice Scalia\u2019s concurring opinion which was joined in by Justice Marshall and Justice Black-mun to the effect that both \u201cselective prospectivity\u201d and \u201cpure prospectivity\u201d are beyond the power of the Court. The implication, as far as those Justices were concerned, is that <em>Davis </em>could not have been applied prospectively even if the parties had not agreed to apply it retroactively. Beam,_U.S. at_, 111 S.Ct. at 2450-51, 115 L.Ed.2d at 496-97 (Justice Scalia, concurring). The majoritys conclusion ignores Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s dissenting opinion wherein she states that the <em>Beam </em>decision \u201cseriously curtails the <em>Chevron Oil </em>inquiry.\u201d Beam,_U.S. at_ 111 S.Ct. at 2452, 115 L.Ed.2d at 499 (Justice O\u2019Connor, dissenting). Finally, the majoritys reasoning ignores the fact that eight days after <em>Beam </em>was decided, the United States Supreme Court granted petitions for certiorari to retired federal employees in South Carolina and Virginia who sought retroactive application of the <em>Davis </em>decision under circumstances identical to the circumstances in this case. In those cases, the Supreme Courts of South Carolina and Virginia rendered decisions similar to the holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>of the majority in this case. See <em>Bass v. State </em>(1990), 302 S.C. 250, 395 S.E.2d 171; <em>Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation </em>(1991), 241 Va. 232, 401 S.E.2d 868. Both of those decisions were vacated by the United States Supreme Court, and both were remanded to the state courts for \u201cfurther consideration in light of <em>James B. Beam Distilling Company v. Georgia.\u201d Bass v. South Carolina </em>(1991),_U.S._, 111 S.Ct. 2881, 115 L.Ed.2d 1047 (mem.); <em>Harper v. Virginia Dept., of Taxation </em>(1991),_U.S._, 111 S.Ct. 2883, 115 L.Ed.2d 1049 <em>(mem.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">It does not seem to me that the intent of the Supreme Court to apply <em>Davis </em>retroactively could be any clearer. The majority\u2019s opinion merely postpones the inevitable and unnecessarily prolongs the delusion of state government that it can continue to spend money which was illegally collected and which it will ultimately have to repay.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">As far as I am concerned, the issue involved in this case is a simple one. The State took the petitioners\u2019 money illegally. That fact is obvious from the plain language of 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. If a private citizen took someone\u2019s money illegally, he or she would be forced to give it back. The State ought to do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">The majority talks about equity. What is equitable about allowing the State, with all its power, to illegally seize someone\u2019s property and then, after being told what it did was illegal, allowing the State to keep it?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The majority\u2019s strained rationale regarding the foreseeability of <em>Davis </em>is transparent. When the State of Montana establishes a policy of arbitrarily treating one group of taxpayers differently than another group that is similarly situated, it is certainly foreseeable that what the State is doing is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">The majority\u2019s conclusion about how to best effectuate the purpose of the <em>Davis </em>decision is similarly illogical. The purpose of the <em>Davis </em>decision was to assure that federal employees are treated the same as state employees. How can that purpose possibly be furthered by allowing the State to keep the money that was illegally taken from federal employees and spend it for the benefit of citizens who were not similarly taxed?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">The majority\u2019s decision is clearly a result-oriented decision arrived at for the purpose of protecting the State\u2019s coffers. However, the State\u2019s coffers are not the responsibility of this Court. The rights of this state\u2019s citizens are.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">For the reasons set forth above, the State of Montana can take little comfort in the temporary reprieve granted by this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> This case was argued to the Montana Supreme Court on May 7,1991. At the time of oral argument, both parties advised this Court of the pending Beam case and agreed that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in that case could be dispositive of the issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
