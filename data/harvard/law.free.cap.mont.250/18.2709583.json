Anderson filed suit in the District Court seeking to recover from the State damages which he claimed to have sustained as result of (1) the wrongful seizure and suspension of his driver\u2019s license, and (2) the failure of the Department of Justice to timely return his driver\u2019s license to him after having been ordered to do so in a prior judicial proceeding. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment in which Anderson asserted that the issue of the State\u2019s liability was determined in a prior judicial proceeding and that further litigation of that issue was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">On June 24, 1986, Anderson was arrested in Missoula County by Montana Highway Patrol Officer James Wierson on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. Anderson was transported to the Missoula City Police Department for further processing. At the police department Anderson was videotaped performing sobriety tests, advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and requested to take a breathalyzer test. During the course of the booking procedure, Officer Wierson determined that Anderson had refused to take the breathalyzer test as requested and, therefore, he seized Anderson\u2019s driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">On July 3,1986, Anderson filed a petition in district court pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, seeking judicial review of the seizure and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>attendant ninety day suspension of his driver\u2019s license. Missoula Deputy County Attorney Betty Wing represented the Department of Justice in that proceeding, Cause No. 64983. On July 11, 1986, a hearing was conducted before the district court at which time the videotape of the booking procedure at the police department was viewed. Anderson contended that he had not refused to submit to a breathalyzer test but was simply invoking his right to counsel. On August 8,1986, after reviewing briefs submitted by counsel, the court agreed with Anderson\u2019s contention. The court ruled that the State\u2019s treatment of Anderson\u2019s assertion of his right to counsel as a refusal to take a breathalyzer test was \u201cimproper\u201d and issued an order reversing the suspension of Anderson\u2019s license and directing the Department of Justice to return it to him. The State did not appeal the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Apparently, Ms. Wing never notified the Department of Justice of the court\u2019s order requiring that Anderson\u2019s license be returned. His license was ultimately returned to him on September 24,1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">On March 26, 1987, Anderson filed the present action, Cause No. 66629, against the State to recover damages which he claimed to have sustained as a result of (1) the wrongful seizure and suspension of his driver\u2019s license, and (2) the failure of the Department of Justice to timely return his driver\u2019s license after having been ordered to do so in the prior judicial proceeding. Anderson sought to recover attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the prior judicial proceeding and damages resulting from his inability to operate his vehicle during the time in which he did not have his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">During the course of the proceedings in Cause No. 66629, Anderson moved for partial summary judgment and the State subsequently made its own motion for summary judgment. Anderson based his motion on the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The State based its motion on the doctrine of quasi-judicial immunity. The District Court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The case was tried to a jury on November 26 and 27, 1990, based upon a theory of negligence. The jury found that the State was not negligent in seizing Anderson\u2019s driver\u2019s license, but was negligent in failing to return the license after being ordered to do so. However, the jury found that the State\u2019s negligence did not proximately cause injuries to Anderson. The District Court entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict and denied Anderson\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The issue before the Court is whether the District Court erred in denying Anderson\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the issue of the State\u2019s liability based on the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. Summary judgment may be granted on the issue of liability alone, reserving the question of damages, where appropriate. Rule 56(d), M.R.Civ.P. In <em>Smith v. Schweigert </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 54, 58, 785 P.2d 195, 197, this Court made the following observation regarding the doctrine of collateral estoppel:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u201cCollateral estoppel is a form of <em>res judicata. </em>Quite simply, the doctrine \u2018precludes relitigation of issues actually litigated and determined in a prior suit.\u2019 <em>Lawlor v. National Screen Service </em>(1955), 349 U.S. 322, 75 S.Ct. 865, 99 L.Ed. 1122. It differs from <em>res judicata, </em>in that <em>res judicata </em>bars the same parties from relitigating the same cause of action, while collateral estoppel bars the same parties, or their privies, from relitigating issues which have been decided with respect to a different cause of action. <em>Brault v. Smith </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 21, 679 P.2d 236.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Collateral estoppel has three elements. These are: (1) the issue has been decided in a prior adjudication and is identical to the one presented; (2) a final judgment on the merits was issued; and (3) the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication. <em>Smith, </em>241 Mont. at 58, 785 P.2d at 197; <em>In re Marriage of Stout </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 342, 349-50, 701 P.2d 729, 733-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Anderson contends that the three elements of collateral estoppel are satisfied in the present case. Specifically, he argues that the issue present in both cases is whether the State was entitled to, or was justified in, seizing and suspending his license. He argues that because the court in the prior proceeding determined that the State was not entitled to seize his license, the State was estopped in the present proceeding from contesting the issue of liability. We disagree with Anderson\u2019s characterization of the issue presented in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Of the three elements of collateral estoppel, the identity of issues is the most crucial. <em>Stapleton v. First Security Bank </em>(1983), 207 Mont. 248, 258, 675 P.2d 83, 89. In order to satisfy this element, the identical issue or \u201cprecise question\u201d must have been litigated in the prior action. <em>Stapleton, </em>207 Mont. at 258, 675 P.2d at 89. Here, the judicial review proceeding did not involve the \u201cprecise question\u201d presented in the subsequent tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Anderson sought judicial review of the seizure and suspension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>of his driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA. That statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">\u201cSuch court is hereby vested with jurisdiction and it shall be its duty to set the matter for hearing upon 10 days\u2019 written notice to the county attorney of the county wherein the appeal is filed and such county attorney shall represent the state, and thereupon the court shall take testimony and examine into the facts of the case, except that the issues shall be limited to whether a peace officer had reasonable grounds to believe the person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public, while under the influence of alcohol, whether the person was placed under arrest, and whether such person refused to submit to the test. The court shall thereupon <em>determine whether the petitioner is entitled to a license or is subject to suspension as heretofore provided. </em>[Emphasis added.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Under this statute, the judicial review proceeding was limited to three underlying issues. The court\u2019s findings regarding these issues served as the bases on which to make its ultimate determination of whether Anderson was entitled to a license or was subject to suspension. Based on its finding that Anderson did not refuse to take a breathalyzer test, the court ultimately determined that Anderson was entitled to his driver\u2019s license and was not subject to suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In the present action, Anderson moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of the State\u2019s civil liability. Unlike the judicial review proceeding, the issue in the present case did not involve a determination of whether Anderson was entitled to his driver\u2019s license. The issue in the present case was whether the State, having seized and suspended Anderson\u2019s license, was civilly liable for the seizure and suspension of the license. The issue of the State\u2019s civil liability for the seizure and suspension of Anderson\u2019s license was not before the court in the judicial review proceeding, nor, under \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, could it be. The crucial collateral estoppel element of identity of issues, therefore, does not exist in the present case. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Anderson\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES McDONOUGH, TRIEWEILER and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
