Farmers Union appeals this decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The issues raised for our review are restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">1. Was the District Court correct in finding that David Blair (Blair) was a resident of his parents\u2019 household?</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">2. Was the District Court correct in declaring that the policy\u2019s automobile exclusion did not apply to the underlying negligence action?</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">The following facts are not in dispute. On March 6,1989, Mitchell Klindt (Klindt) accidentally shot Osburn with Blair\u2019s gun while attending a party at a Kalispell residence. The night of the shooting, Blair drove Klindt and another friend from one house party to another in his employer\u2019s car. Blair had his loaded revolver in an unlocked compartment of the car. Prior to the shooting, Blair and Klindt were asleep in the car outside the residence where the shooting occurred. Klindt awoke, removed Blair\u2019s gun from the car, placed the gun in his pants and went inside the residence. Once inside the house, Klindt accidentally shot Osburn while removing the revolver from his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">In the underlying negligence action, Osburn filed suit against Blair alleging that Blair proximately caused his injury by negligently providing Klindt access to alcohol and a loaded handgun. Farmers Union filed this declaratory action to determine if they had a duty to defend and indemnify Blair in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">In September 1987, David Blair\u2019s parents, Douglas and Doris Blair, purchased a homeowner\u2019s policy from Farmers Union. This policy was in effect on March 6, 1989, and contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u201cDefinitions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">\u00abH&lt; Hi H&lt; H\u00ab \u2021 * \u2021 H\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201c \u2018insured\u2019 means you and residents of your household who are ... your relatives ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">\u201cExclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">Hi Hi Hi ^ ^ ^ H&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">\u201cPersonal liability and medical payments to others do not apply to bodily injury ... arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of motor vehicles ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">In this case Farmers Union contends that Blair\u2019s alleged negligence is not covered by the policy because Blair is not a resident of his parents\u2019 household. Further, they contend that even if Blair is a member of the household, this accident arose out of the use, loading or unloading of a motor vehicle and is excluded from coverage under this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">In March 1989, Blair was 19 years of age. Sometime prior to the shooting, he had vacated his apartment and moved back into his parents\u2019 Kalispell residence. Three days per week Blair worked as a chauffeur in Darby, Montana, and stayed at his employer\u2019s home. The other four days per week Blair traveled back to Kalispell and stayed at his parents\u2019 home where he shared a bedroom with his younger brother. Blair kept his personal belongings at his parents\u2019 residence and used a suitcase to transport his personal effects from Kalispell to Darby.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Blair received all of his mail at his parents\u2019 address and consistently listed his parents\u2019 address as his residence. Although Blair did not eat or wash clothes at his parents\u2019 house, Blair\u2019s truck was registered in his father\u2019s name in Flathead County, he banked in Kalispell and occasionally gave his parents money to \u201chelp out\u201d with expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">Was the District Court correct in finding that David Blair was a resident of his parents\u2019 household?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">Farmers Union contends that the term \u201cresident of the named insured\u2019s household\u201d is clear and must be strictly construed according to the terms of the insurance policy. Osburn contends that under these facts the language is ambiguous and should be interpreted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>favor of coverage. In this case, we do not conclude that the issue of ambiguity is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">In <em>Iowa Nat\u2019l Mutual Ins. Co. v. Boatright, </em>(1973), 33 Colo.App. 124, 516 P.2d 439, the insurance carrier sought subrogation from the father of the named insured who negligently caused a fire at his daughter\u2019s home. The court examined a number of factors to determine if the insured\u2019s father was a \u201cresident of the household\u201d under the homeowner\u2019s policy. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201cIn ascertaining the meaning of the term \u2018residents of his household,\u2019 a number of factors have been designated as being important. Among them are the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">\u201cThe subjective or declared <em>intent </em>of the individual, <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. v. Home Indemnity Co., </em>241 Cal.App.2d 303, 50 Cal.Rptr. 508 [(1966)]; the <em>formality or informality of the relationship </em>between the individual and the members of the household, <em>Pamperin v. Milwaukee Mutual Insurance Co., </em>55 Wis.2d 27, 197 N.W.2d 783 [(1972)]; the existence of <em>another place of lodging </em>by the alleged resident, <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Holloway, </em>423 F.2d 1281 (10th Cir. [1970]); and the relative <em>permanence or transient nature of </em>the individual\u2019s residence in the household, <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. v. Home Indemnity Co., </em>supra.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\u201cNo one factor by itself is determinative of the ultimate issue. All must be considered in the light of the basic consideration of whether the parties to the insurance contract intended that coverage would extend to the alleged insured. Emphasis added.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-8\"><em>Boatright, </em>516 P.2d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">We adopt the <em>Boatright </em>factors in this case and conclude that Blair was a resident of his parents\u2019 household. First, Blair\u2019s conduct is consistent with an intent to reside with his parents. He consistently listed his parents\u2019 address as his residence. Blair generally stayed at his parents\u2019 home four days per week, received his mail at that address, and kept his personal possessions there.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Next Blair had an informal relationship with the members of his parents\u2019 household. Although he did not launder his clothes or consistently eat meals with the members of the household, they interacted as a family. Blair \u201chelped out\u201d with household expenses, and his truck was registered in his father\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Further, Blair had no other place of lodging. Although he stayed at his employer\u2019s home three days per week, Blair transported his possessions from Kalispell to Darby by suitcase. He conducted his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>banking in Kalispell, registered his truck in Kalispell, and resided in Darby only while working.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Finally, Blair permanently resided at his parents\u2019 home. A few months prior to the shooting, Blair had vacated his Kalispell apartment and moved in with his parents. At the time of the shooting, he had no immediate plans to move and was in fact still residing with his parents in July 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Given the facts presented above, we conclude that the parties to the insurance contract intended that coverage would extend to Blair, the named insured\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Although the lower court found that resident of the household is an ambiguous term, we do not find it necessary or appropriate to analyze the term from that perspective. Under the <em>Boatright </em>analysis, we hold that the District Court was correct in finding that Blair was a resident of his parents\u2019 household.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Was the District Court correct in declaring that the policy\u2019s automobile exclusion did not apply to the underlying negligence action?</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Farmers Union contends that Osburn\u2019s shooting arose out of the use of an automobile, and they cite cases which denied homeowner coverage under automobile exclusions. In <em>Wyoming Farm Bureau Ins. Co. v. Mobile Ins. Co. </em>(10th Cir. 1972), 467 F.2d 990, the court denied homeowner coverage when the passenger injured a pedestrian by throwing a bottle from a moving car. The court held that the injury was incident to the use of the vehicle and that the accident was excluded under the homeowner\u2019s policy. <em>Wyoming Farm Bureau, </em>467 F.2d at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">In another case, as a passenger outside the vehicle was preparing to load, a rifle inside the vehicle discharged. <em>Colorado Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. West American Ins. Co. </em>(1975), 35 Colo.App. 380, 540 P.2d 1112, 1113. That court denied homeowner coverage for resulting injuries. It held that the accident would not have occurred but for the loading of the motor vehicle and therefore fell within the Bureau automobile exception of the homeowner\u2019s policy. <em>Colorado Farm Bureau, </em>540 P.2d at 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">We find these cases dissimilar from the present case. In the present action, the accident occurred inside a house and during a party, after the passenger had left the car. Although Blair had the gun stored in the car prior to the shooting, we find no connection between the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>of the car, the removal of the weapon from the car, and the shooting. Therefore, we conclude that the accident is not excluded from coverage under this homeowner\u2019s policy\u2019s automobile exclusion because it did not arise from the use, loading or unloading of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">We hold that the District Court correctly found that the automobile exclusion in Blair\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy did not apply to this shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b79-6\">JUSTICES GRAY, HARRISON, HUNT and McDONOUGH concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
