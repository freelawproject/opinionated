Grenz, appearing pro se, appeals from the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denying him workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in ruling that the claimant is not permanently totally disabled as a result of his August 22,1984, right elbow injury and that the claimant\u2019s psychological problems are not compensably related to that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">At the time of trial, the claimant was 46 years old, married and living in Whitefish, Montana. His work history includes employment as a laborer, mill worker, driller and miner. The claimant has been a body builder since he was eight years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">On August 22,1984, the claimant bumped his right elbow on a steel hand railing while working for American Stud Company in Flathead County; the claimant had been working as a side edger for his employer since 1979. The elbow became sensitive and inflamed, and the claimant was examined the next day by Dr. Ken McFadden at the Family Physicians Clinic in Whitefish. The injury involved limited medical bills and no lost wages. The claimant\u2019s medical bills were paid by the workers\u2019 compensation insurer, Fire and Casualty of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>On January 29,1985, Dr. Ronald A. Miller, the claimant\u2019s treating physician since 1977, saw the claimant for discomfort in both elbows, both wrists, both hands, and his cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Based on laboratory data, X-rays, the claimant\u2019s personal history and a physical examination, Dr. Miller diagnosed the claimant as having degenerative arthritis which is an inflammatory disease of the joints. Dr. Miller also discussed with the claimant in February 1985 the probability that the claimant\u2019s continued weight lifting activities would make his symptoms worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">On November 18, 1985, Dr. Miller saw the claimant again and diagnosed his condition as degenerative arthritis of his fingers, wrists and shoulders, and recurrent bursitis and epicondylitis of his elbows. That same day, Dr. Miller gave the claimant a note in which he recommended that the claimant not do any lifting or physical use of his elbows and shoulders for several weeks due to a flare-up of bursitis and arthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The claimant gave the note to his employer and reported that his condition at that time was related to his August 22,1984, right elbow injury. The employer then notified the insurer that the claimant would be off work for several weeks due to his 1984 elbow injury. Thereafter, the insurer assumed liability for the injury and paid compensation and medical benefits to and for the claimant. The claimant received temporary total disability benefits. The claimant has not worked since November 18, 1985, due to progressive degenerative problems. The insurer continued to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the claimant through the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Dr. Miller\u2019s deposition testimony was that the claimant\u2019s work activity over a period of time was probably more responsible for the claimant\u2019s degenerative arthritis than his body building. He could not provide any reasonable medical explanation of how the claimant\u2019s left elbow, left thumb, index finger and joint pain could have been the result of bumping his right elbow at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Beginning in April 1986, the claimant, complaining of lower back pain and stiffness, received a series of chiropractic adjustments to his lower back from Dr. Arvin R. Wilson. He had received similar treatments from Dr. Wilson from August 1977 to December 1979 and was directed to return if and when he needed further treatment. At the time the claimant returned for chiropractic treatments in 1986, he was receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits and had been off work for five months. However, the claimant never suggested to Dr. Wilson that his back problem was related to his bumped right elbow. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>When 63 chiropractic adjustments failed to improve the claimant\u2019s lower back condition, he was referred to a pain management specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In February 1988, at the insurer\u2019s request, the claimant was examined by a panel of multi-disciplinary medical specialists assembled and coordinated by Medical Management Northwest. The panel diagnosed the claimant as having lumbar degenerative disease attributable to both work-related injuries and the claimant\u2019s weight lifting avocation. In addition, the panel found X-ray evidence of calcification and abnormal bone formation in the claimant\u2019s right elbow and again traced the condition to his recurrent work-related injuries and aggravation from his weight-lifting activities. The panel felt that the claimant was at \u201cmaximum medical improvement\u201d and further medical treatment was not needed at that time. In relation to psychological difficulties, the panel found that the claimant was suffering from a personality disorder and learning disability but determined that these conditions were not work related.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Subsequent to the panel\u2019s evaluation, the insurer, on August 24, 1988, reduced the claimant\u2019s benefits from temporary total disability to permanent partial disability. The claimant\u2019s total disability status was reinstated on December 15,1988, retroactive to August 24,1988, following mediation of the claimant\u2019s claim. The claimant at this time received permanent total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Dr. John W. Hilleboe, an orthopedic surgeon who was a member of the medical panel, explained in his deposition that the medical panel\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cwork-related injuries\u201d reflected its belief that the claimant\u2019s progressive degenerative problems may have resulted from heavy occupational or vocational activity as well as avocational activity. Dr. Hilleboe testified that the kind of degenerative changes that the claimant has experienced are not likely to result from an acute injury. He further testified that he found no significant difference between the condition of the claimant\u2019s two elbows and that he found no evidence that the claimant\u2019s back problems are related to the claimant\u2019s August 22, 1984, right elbow injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Dr. John V. Stephens, the director of the physical medicine and rehabilitation program at the Kalispell Regional Hospital Rehabilitation Center, was also a member of the medical panel which examined the claimant in February 1988 and he authored the panel\u2019s evaluation summary. Dr. Stephens testified in his deposition that he had no opinion as to whether the 1984 right elbow injury might be responsible for the problems found by the panel. He deferred that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>question to Dr. Hilleboe. Dr. Stephens testified that nothing in his records relating to the medical panel\u2019s evaluation suggested that the 1984 right elbow injury was causally related to the chronic irritation of the claimant\u2019s left elbow or that that injury may have contributed to the claimant\u2019s back problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">Dr. Herbert Gray is a psychiatrist who treated the claimant for major depression requiring hospitalizations in January 1986 and December 1989. Dr. Gray testified in his deposition that the claimant has suffered from chronic depression throughout his life. In a letter dated October 17,1988, addressed \u201cTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,\u201d he agreed with the medical panel\u2019s conclusion that the claimant\u2019s learning disability is not a consequence of his industrial accident. However, Dr. Gray believed that the industrial injury represented a greater insult to the claimant than would otherwise have occurred because the claimant overemphasized his physical ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Dr. Gray noted that due to serious abuse as a child, and perhaps other factors, the claimant had preexisting psychological problems. He further noted that the claimant\u2019s ability to fight with and intimidate people was a way of coping which the claimant learned as a child and continued to use as an adult. Dr. Gray did not testify that the claimant\u2019s hospitalizations or psychotherapy were caused by the claimant\u2019s 1984 right elbow injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Dr. James H. Mahnke, a neurosurgeon, examined the claimant on March 6, 1989. Based on X-rays and scans, Dr. Mahnke diagnosed cervical spondylosis at C6-7 and lumbar spondylosis with herniated discs at L4-5 and L5-S1. Dr. Mahnke testified in his deposition that he did not know what caused the claimant\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">On March 7,1990, Dr. William Stratford, a psychiatrist, examined and tested the claimant on the insurer\u2019s behalf. Dr. Stratford testified in his deposition that the claimant suffered from anxiety and depression due to his loss of physical prowess and inability to work. However, Dr. Stratford could not opine to what extent the claimant\u2019s right elbow injury, as distinguished from the claimant\u2019s other medical complaints, may have contributed to his psychological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In his May 2, 1990, petition to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, the claimant asserted that he was totally disabled as a result of his August 22, 1984, right elbow injury and requested that the insurer be ordered to convert all future benefits into a lump-sum payment, assessed a statutory 20 percent penalty, and ordered to pay costs. The claimant also requested payment of the expenses from his 1989 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>hospitalization for depression and for continuing psychotherapy. The insurer disputed both the claimant\u2019s entitlement to a lump-sum conversion and his disability status.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">After a trial held on September 17,1990, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court ruled that the claimant is not permanently totally disabled as a result of his August 22, 1984, right elbow injury and that his psychological problems are not compensably related to that injury. The claimant\u2019s motion for reconsideration or a new trial was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in ruling that the claimant is not permanently totally disabled as a result of his August 22, 1984, right elbow injury and that the claimant\u2019s psychological problems are not compensably related to that injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that the claimant failed to establish, by a preponderance of the medical evidence, a causal connection between his current degenerative condition and his 1984 right elbow injury and, therefore, concluded that the claimant is not permanently totally disabled as a result of his August 22,1984, right elbow injury. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court also found that the psychological problems that the claimant experiences may have been aggravated by his loss of physical prowess but that no medical evidence was presented showing that the claimant\u2019s loss of physical functioning is related to his 1984 right elbow injury. Based on this finding, the court concluded that the claimant is not entitled to payment for his 1989 hospitalization for depression or for continuing psychotherapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">This Court will not overturn findings of fact of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court if there is substantial credible evidence in the record to support them. <em>Kraft v. Flathead Valley Labor &amp; Contr. </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 363, 365, 792 P.2d 1094, 1095. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law will be upheld if the tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Steer, Inc., v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The claimant raises several arguments challenging the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Initially, the claimant asserts that the court\u2019s determination that he was not permanently totally disabled ignored the first issue in the pretrial order, which was whether the claimant is \u201ctotally disabled.\u201d He argues that disability may be temporary total or permanent total and by limiting its decision to whether he is permanently totally disabled the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court changed the whole intent of the first issue to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>insurer\u2019s advantage. We disagree. The claimant argued before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court that the parties\u2019 stipulation in a prior action that the claimant was at that time \u201cpresently\u201d permanently disabled, is res judicata in the present action. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court rejected the claimant\u2019s position, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-3\">\u201cThe stipulation previously entered only binds the parties for the purposes of that action only, and it has no effect on subsequent litigation. Defendant refused such stipulation and it was agreed by both parties that it is the first issue for determination in this litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">In addition, in his petition to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, the claimant sought a lump-sum conversion of permanent total disability benefits. The issue of whether the claimant is permanently totally disabled necessarily had to be determined in order to reach his lump-sum demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The claimant next asserts that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in finding that his current disabilities were not caused by his employment. He argues that, through his employment, he suffered a series of \u201cmicro-traumas\u201d attributable to constant vibrations of machinery, heavy lifting, and multiple jars and jolts to his joints. The claimant asserts that these \u201cindustrial injuries,\u201d which he suffered after and in addition to this August 22, 1984, injury and which were reported to his employer, caused him to develop bis degenerative joint disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The insurer argues that the claimant\u2019s sole basis for entitlement to benefits was his August 22, 1984, right elbow injury and asserts that the claimant is now arguing a completely different theory on appeal than that which was presented to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. We agree. Our review of the record shows that the claimant admitted at trial that the sole basis for his claim to benefits in that proceeding was his 1984 injury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201cQ. Your injury occurred in 1984?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s the only industrial injury you claim; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">\u201cA. Right</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">The claimant is limited on appeal to those issues which he presented to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. <em>Baldwin v. Orient Express Restaurant </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 373, 376, 791 P.2d 49, 50. Thus, on appeal, we will consider only whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court properly determined that the claimant failed to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>causal connection between his current physical condition and his August 22, 1984, right elbow injury and, therefore, was not permanently totally disabled as a result of the 1984 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Section 39-71-116(13), MCA (1983), in effect at the time of the claimant\u2019s 1984 injury, defines permanent total disability as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201c \u2018Permanent total disability\u2019 means a condition resulting from injury as defined in this chapter that results in the loss of actual earnings or earning capability that exists after the injured worker is as far restored as the permanent character of the injuries will permit and which results in the worker having no reasonable prospect of finding regular employment of any kind in the normal labor market. Disability shall be supported by a preponderance of medical evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Causation is an essential element to an entitlement to benefits and the claimant has the burden of proving a causal connection by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Brown v. Ament </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 158, 163, 752 P.2d 171, 174. After reviewing the entire record in this case, we hold that there is substantial credible evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that the claimant failed to establish a causal connection between his current physical condition and his 1984 right elbow injury. Virtually all of the medical testimony in this case reflects that, while it was possible that prolonged work activity combined with strenuous avocational body building activity caused the claimant\u2019s current degenerative condition, a causal connection between the claimant\u2019s current physical problems and his 1984 right elbow injury is not present. Because no causal connection between the claimant\u2019s current physical condition and his 1984 right elbow injury was shown, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly concluded that the claimant is not permanently totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In the proceedings before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, the claimant requested payment of the expenses from his 1989 hospitalization for depression and for continuing psychotherapy. The responsibility of the insurer to provide medical benefits for treatment which is <em>the result </em>of an injury is set forth in \u00a7 39-71-704, MCA(1983), in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">\u201cPayment of medical, hospital, and related services. (1) In addition to the compensation provided by this chapter and as an additional benefit separate and apart from compensation, the following shall be furnished:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">\u201c(a) After the happening of the injury, the employer or insurer shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>furnish, without limitation as to length of time or dollar amount, reasonable services by a physician or surgeon, reasonable hospital services and medicines when needed, and such other treatment as may be approved by the division for the injuries sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">Both Dr. Herbert Gray and Dr. William Stratford, psychiatrists who examined the claimant, testified that due to serious abuse as a child, and perhaps other factors, the claimant had preexisting psychological problems before his 1984 right elbow injury. In addition, both agreed that the claimant\u2019s emotional problems may have been aggravated by his loss of physical prowess. However, there is no credible medical evidence in the record establishing a relationship between the claimant\u2019s loss of physical prowess and his 1984 right elbow injury. Absent a causal connection between his current psychological problems and the 1984 right elbow injury, the claimant is not entitled to payment for his 1989 hospitalization for depression or continuing psychotherapy treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The claimant also argues that because the insurer assumed liability in this case and paid benefits to him for over five years, the insurer waived its right to deny his claim for benefits. We disagree. Section 39-71-608, MCA (1983), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">\u201cAn insurer may, after written notice to the claimant and the division, make payment of compensation benefits within 30 days of receipt of a claim for compensation without such payments being construed as an admission of liability or a waiver of any right of defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">It is clear that under the particular facts of this case, the insurer accepted liability for the 1984 right elbow injury and paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the claimant. However, under \u00a7 39-71-608, MCA (1983), the insurer, by making such payments, did not waive its right to subsequently assert nonliability for the claimant\u2019s condition insofar as it was not causally related to the elbow injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In conclusion, we hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err in ruling that the claimant is not permanently totally disabled as a result of his August 22, 1984, right elbow injury and that his psychological problems are not compensably related to that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES HARRISON, McDONOUGH, and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
