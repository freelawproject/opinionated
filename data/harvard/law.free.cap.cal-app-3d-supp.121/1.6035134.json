His pretrial motions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to have the prior conviction declared invalid were denied, and a petition for writ of mandate to the superior court was also denied. He then pleaded guilty in each case to the charged violation with a prior conviction and now appeals from the judgment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on each appeal attacking only the constitutional validity of the prior conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 4\">*Supp. 4</page-number>In the 1977 prosecution, Shannon as a pro. per. pleaded guilty to the charge of violating Vehicle Code section 23102, subdivision (a) in the Sacramento Municipal Court. He contends that his waiver of counsel was invalid because he was not advised of the dangers of self-representation. He also argues that his arraignment, which was a mass arraignment using a videotape advisement by the trial judge, was improper, that it was not established that he heard and understood the statement of his rights or that there was a factual basis for his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Shannon\u2019s motions to the Los Angeles Municipal Court trial judges, to have the 1977 prior conviction declared constitutionally invalid, were made upon the grounds that there was: (1) \u201cNo knowing, intelligent, understanding waiver of counsel, specifically no warning regarding dangers and pitfalls of self-representation as required by <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806 or advisement of elements and defenses req. by <em>[In re Tahl </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 122]\u201d and (2) No advisement \u201c.. . of the elements of the offense, possible pleas and defenses available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 288 [110 Cal.Rptr. 329, 515 P.2d 273], the California Supreme Court extended the <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>rule,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that an appellate court may not presume from a silent record that a defendant has voluntarily and intelligently waived the constitutional rights he implicitly relinquished by entering a plea of guilty to proceedings in inferior courts. (10 Cal.3d at pp. 297-299.) It also noted that the requirements of an express and explicit waiver of counsel on the record, by a pro. per. defendant, applies to misdemeanor prosecutions. (10 Cal.3d at p. 301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In determining satisfaction of the <em>Mills </em>requirements, there is a two-part inquiry: (1) whether defendant has been advised of his constitutional rights (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Buller </em>(1979) 101 Cal.App.3d 73, 76 [160 Cal.Rptr. 657] [clerk had checked boxes showing defendant had waived his constitutional rights, but there was no indication he had been advised of them; held: no valid waiver]), and (2) whether he has voluntarily waived them. (Cf. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 731, 734-735 [51 Cal.Rptr. 771] [the record showed defendant had been advised of his rights but did not show he expressly waived them; held: insufficient showing, since a waiver could not be implied from his guilty plea.])</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>The facts of advisement and waiver must appear on the face of the record. <em>(Stewart </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 607, 610 [141 Cal.Rptr. 589]; <em>Ganyo </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 522, 526 [145 Cal.Rptr. 636]; <em>Youkhanna </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 612, 615 [150 Cal.Rptr. 380].) The reasons such showing must be on the face of the record are to avoid having to probe \u201cmurky memories\u201d of counsel and court personnel, to avoid imposition upon the time and resources of the court in having to give testimony in collateral proceedings, and the recognition that it is doubtful that judges and court personnel would have actual recollection of a prior individual case among a multitude of cases processed through our high volume municipal and justice courts. (See <em>Youkhanna </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>at p. 616.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Before the Los Angeles trial judges in the cases on appeal when they ruled upon the motion to strike were certified copies of records of the Sacramento Municipal Court. Included among the records were the traffic citation, a misdemeanor complaint, the traffic docket, a \u201cMisdemeanor Arraignment Minute Order and Docket Entry\u201d and the judgment of conviction. Also before the Los Angeles trial judges were transcripts of May 16, 1977, proceedings in department D of the Sacramento Municipal Court, where a mass arraignment was given, and proceedings in department L, where Shannon\u2019s 1977 plea was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The reporter\u2019s transcript of the arraignment shows that the case of Robert Stevens,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defendant, number 88967T came on for hearing before the Honorable Carol Miller, judge of the Sacramento Municipal Court on Monday, May 16, 1977, at 9 a.m. \u201cThe Defendant, Robert Stevens, was personally present and in attendance upon the Court. He was in Propria Persona.\u201d There followed a statement of \u201cVideo Mass Advisements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Shannon contends that advisement by videotape is a method of advisement not authorized by law. For this contention he relies upon <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 970 [140 Cal.Rptr. 669, 568 P.2d 394]. <em>Bailey </em>is not in point. It involved the issue of whether a civil trial court could order the videotaping of a deposition. In holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 6\">*Supp. 6</page-number>the trial court could not, the Supreme Court pointed out that section 2004 of the Code of Civil Procedure defines a deposition as a written declaration under oath and section 2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the same code makes provision for the deponent to read and correct it. It concluded that videotaping did not meet the statutory requirements for a deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">There is no similar requirement that advisements of constitutional rights be in writing. To the contrary, they are normally given orally. The validity of collective advisements of rights is well established. <em>(In re Johnson </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 325, 336 [42 Cal.Rptr. 228, 398 P.2d 420]; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 307; <em>In re Sheridan </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 365, 368-369 [40 Cal.Rptr. 894]; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>242 Cal.App.2d at p. 734.) And in <em>Mills </em>the Supreme Court recognized that they could be given in a variety of ways, including advisements by the clerk of the court <em>(In re Sheridan, supra, </em>at pp. 368-369) although it expressed a preference for advisements by the judge. We see no constitutional objection to videotaping the judge\u2019s advisements. In our current society, a majority of the populace has grown accustomed to television as a means of communication, and presumably would have little difficulty in following and comprehending the televising of a taped series of advisements. And videotaping them bears the advantage of assuring that all advisements are given correctly and that the presentation is made in a clear and distinct manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Shannon also contends that advisement concerning the right to counsel was inadequate in that it failed to warn of the dangers of self-representation. We reject the contention.  In <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d Supp. 21, this department held that a warning concerning the hazards of self-representation is not constitutionally required to assure that a defendant has made a voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel. <em>White </em>is controlling. Shannon makes no argument that the advisement concerning his right to counsel was defective in any other regard, and examining it, we find no deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Advisements concerning the nature of the charges and the consequences of a guilty plea are not constitutional requirements under <em>Tahl </em>but are \u201ca judicially declared rule of criminal procedure\u201d for noncom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 7\">*Supp. 7</page-number>pliance with which defendant must show prejudice before his plea will be set aside. (In <em>re Ronald E. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 315, 320-321 [137 Cal.Rptr. 781, 562 P.2d 684].) Similarly, a determination of whether there is a factual basis for a plea is not a constitutional right. <em>(Ganyo </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.3d at p. 530.) Moreover, it is questionable whether any such defect serves as a basis, as here, for a collateral attack upon a judgment. (See <em>Ganyo </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>at pp. 530-531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In the present case, Shannon makes no attempt to show prejudice from any claimed defects in the Sacramento Municipal Court proceedings. Under these circumstances, we do not undertake to determine whether the proceedings were deficient in explaining the charges, advising of their consequences and determining a factual basis for them. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Buller, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d at p. 79.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The record<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> before the trial judge in the present case includes a transcript of proceedings in department L of the Sacramento Municipal Court where Shannon\u2019s plea of guilty was taken. It reflects that Shannon was asked if he understood each of his <em>Tahl-Mills </em>rights, that he replied in the affirmative, and that he expressly and specifically relinquished each of them. A reporter\u2019s transcript of the proceedings in which a defendant waives his constitutional rights is a proper method of establishing on the face of the record such a waiver. <em>(Mills </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>10 Cal. 3d at p. 307; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Buller, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d at p. 76 [\u201cWith respect to the third prior\u2014suffered in 1974\u2014the record is more complex in that we have a reporter\u2019s transcript.\u201d]</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Both in the reporter\u2019s transcripts of proceedings and in orders filed in the Sacramento Municipal Court the record reflects that Shannon was duly arraigned; that he was advised of his constitutional rights to counsel, to a speedy and public trial, to trial by jury, to trial by the court, to confront witnesses and cross-examine them, to plead guilty or not guilty, or with the consent of the district attorney and the court, plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 8\">*Supp. 8</page-number>nolo contendere, and to remain silent and not incriminate himself and that he waived such rights; that he was advised of the consequences of a plea of guilty and understood the consequences; that the court found his waiver of his constitutional rights was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made and that he was specifically queried as to each of them; and that there was a factual basis for a guilty plea, defendant understood the nature of the crime and the consequences of a guilty plea and his plea of guilty was freely and voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Shannon argues, however, that it was not established that he heard the mass advisement. There was abundant evidence before the trial judge that he was present.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The traffic citation required him to appear on May 16, 1977, at 9 a.m. in department D, when and where the arraignment and advisements were given. At the end of the advisement all citees were told that some would be sent to department L, their names then being read. Shannon appeared in department L. In the course of the advisement, information was given concerning an alcohol education and traffic safety program entitled \u201cCARE,\u201d and when Shannon was sentenced he asked specifically for the CARE program without any advice concerning it being given in department L. As stated by the Supreme Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">\u201cHere petitioner neither alleges nor shows that he personally failed to hear and understand Judge Erickson\u2019s statement. In the absence of such a showing we must presume, in accordance with common experience, that what is spoken with the intent of being heard by those in the speaker\u2019s presence is in fact so heard, and that what is heard is understood.\u201d (I<em>n re Johnson, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 332; <em>Winton </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.3d at p. 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Fainer, P.
