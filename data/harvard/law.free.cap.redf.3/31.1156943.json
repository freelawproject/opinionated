Ch., </em>607,) the legatee was named as Cornelia Thompson, whose real name was Caroline Thomas, and it appearing that the latter was intended by the testator, she was decreed to be entitled under the will. In the case under consideration it appears in evidence' that Mrs. Elizabeth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Adler, the adopted daughter of the deceased, was the person mentioned in the will as \u201cmy daughter Elizabeth.\u201d There is abundant proof before me that Mrs. Elizabeth Adler is the person intended, and I think that her children are sufficiently described and designated in the codicil, and I am of the opinion that the fact of adoption, in its legal mode, does not affect the validity of the codicil in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">In Hart <em>v. </em>Marks (4 <em>Bradf., </em>161,) it appeared that there was no person to answer the name of an annuitant described in the testator\u2019s will as his cousin Paris Pickard, but paroi evidence was given that his cousin Priscilla Pickard was usually named by him as described in the will, and it was held competent by paroi evidence to point out the person who answered the description of the legatee, and that the person intended may be ascertained by means of extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In the absence of any suggestion that the deceased had a daughter Elizabeth, who would answer the description in the codicil, and it appearing that the person mentioned had been treated as an adopted daughter, there is no doubt of the sufficiency of the description. The will and codicil should therefore be admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Decree entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
