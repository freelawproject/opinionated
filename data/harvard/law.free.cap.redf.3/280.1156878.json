Leslie, executor, found that the executor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>admitted an indebtedness to the estate upon certain promissory notes existing at the death of the testator, July 3, 1873, with interest to that date, amounting to $9,035.41, and that it appeared from the testimony that he was further indebted for sums of money loaned and advanced to him in the life time of the testator; of $300 loaned and advanced November 22, 1869, with interest from that date; for like advance, December 24,1869, $500; December 29, the same year, $300 ; February 25,1870, $200; March 9,1870, $200; December 24,1872, $500; and that he was indebted in the last four sums named, with interest from the dates thereof; that by the will of the deceased the said executor was given a legacy of $10,000 over and above specific legacies, and that he had received and appropriated that sum to his own use, notwithstanding the aforesaid indebtedness to the estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-5\">Thos.

The facts tending to show that intention constitute the material distinction between that case and the present, for in this case there is no evidence tending to show that the legacy was intended to be a release of the indebtedness referred to. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\"><em>Roper on Legacies </em>(vol. 2, p. 1062, 2d American ed.) lays down the rule that where a creditor bequeaths a legacy to a debtor in his' will, and either does not notice the debt, or mentions it in such a manner as to leave his intention doubtful, and after his death securities for the debt are found uncancelled among the testator\u2019s property, courts of equity do not consider the legacy to the debtor as necessarily, or even <em>prima facie, </em>a release, or extinguishment of the debt, but require evidence clearly expressive of the intention to release. If such intention does not appear clearly expressed or implied on the face of the will, evidence from other sources will be admitted, and the. learned author proceeds to examine, with great particularity and research, the numerous authorities sustaining that doctrine. This doctrine is fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>sustained by the authorities cited, and without further examination of the question, I am of the opinion that the auditor\u2019s report should in all things be confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Let a decree accordingly be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
