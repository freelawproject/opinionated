Lawrence, departed this life on the 3d day of August, 1863, and on the 13th of the same month the will was propounded by Andrew Lawrence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>On the return-day of the citation, Chauncey L. Horton appeared and filed objections to the probate of the will, on the ground of undue execution; and alleging that the deceased had during his lifetime a wife; and that there was issue by said wife \u2014 to wit, one daughter, the wife of the contestant, now dead; by which marriage there were three children, now infants, and the grandchildren of the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-5\">The proponents sought to compel the contestants to prove their legitimacy, before admitting them to the status of contestants of the will.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-6\">John C.

As is the practice in this court, citation was accordingly issued to the persons so named; and on the return-day objections were filed on behalf of certain infants, claiming to be legitimate grandchildren of the deceased, who deny the legal execution of the paper propounded as a will, and claim to contest its probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The proponents now insist that the question of the interest of these infant objectors must be first tried and decided; and that in case of a decision favorable to the objectors, on that issue, they must then be brought before the court, like the other next of kin (by a further citation), before they can be considered as on the status of contestants. In other words, they contend that the issue of interest and the issue of due execution must constitute two separate and distinct proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">The practice in this court has not been thus strict. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>proceedings for probate of a will, as in proceedings for an account, to compel the giving of security, &amp;c., a claim of interest, positively sworn to, will make the claimant a contestant before this court, and a party to the proceedings; and his appearance in open court on the return-day waives the service of citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u201c When a person appears before the surrogate to oppose-the probate of a will, he is bound, if the adverse party disputes his interest, to show his interest, as his right to contest the will.\u201d <em>(Dayton on </em>Surrogates, 159.) And it is further held, that \u201cif issue be taken on the allegation of interest, the evidence in relation to that question, and that which relates to the proof of the will, should \u2022 proceed <em>pari passu.\u201d </em>And the proceeding is a single one, and is so conducted here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
