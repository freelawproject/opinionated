The fund of $10,000 was intended to be, until the decease of the parents, a perfect and indivisible fund, and the vesting does not take place until the time arrives when the division is to be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-9\">II. Where the whole gift is contained in a direction to the executors to pay or divide at a future time, or in a certain event, the vesting often does not take place till the time arrives or the event happens. <em>(Leake </em>v. Robinson, 2 <em>Meriv., </em>363, 387.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-10\">III. The most that can be said of the interest of Warren Saxton is, that he was vested with the amount named, $2,500, liable to be divested by his death in the lifetime of his father and mother.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-11\">IY. The fund in question goes to the residuary estate, and should be divided accordingly.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Jeremiah Larocque and William Bliss, <em>for the Petitioner.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The Surrogate. \u2014 I. As to the first point raised by the executor, I believe it to be the general rule of law, that a legacy, payable in the future, and consisting of personal property, or charged upon personal estate, vests from the death of the testator. The law was otherwise as to legacies charged upon the realty, and the chancellor showed the distinction between them, in his remarks in <em>Birdsall </em>v. <em>Hewlett </em>(1 <em>Paige, </em>32). He said, \u201c Legacies charged upon the real estate and payable at a future day, are not vested, and become lapsed, if the legatee dies before the time of payment arrives. This rule was at first adopted without any exceptions, and in direct opposition to that which existed in regard to legacies payable out of the personal estate.\u201d And Williams lays down the rule with precision (2 <em>Will, on Ex., </em>776), as follows: \u201c Where a person bequeaths a sum of money, or other personal estate, to one for life, and after his decease to another, the interest of the second legatee is vested,- and his personal representatives will be entitled to the property, though he die in the lifetime of the person to whom the property is bequeathed for life.\u201d (And see <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>1 <em>Sandf. Ch., </em>131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">H. Nor is this a case where \u201c the whole gift is contained in a direction to executors to pay or divide on a certain event.\u201d Time, in this case, was annexed only to the gift, and not to the substance of the gift; and is not connected with any event to happen to the donee. <em>(Van Wyck </em>v. <em>Bloodgood, </em>1 <em>Bradf., </em>154.) The mere postponement of the actual possession of the legacy affixed no condition to the immediate vesting of the interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">HI. As to the question whether the legacy once vested could be divested by the death of the legatee, I am referred by the executor\u2019s counsel to the dictum of Chancellor Walworth, in <em>Nodine </em>v. <em>Greenfield </em>(7 <em>Paige, </em>544). But that was a real estate case \u2014 a devise of a remainder in fee to such children (nephews of testator) as should be living at the time of the decease of his widow, their aunt, and it was of course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>held that they took subject to be divested by their death during the aunt\u2019s life estate, and subject to open and let in children born during the life estate. The cases of <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lorillard </em>(4 N. <em>Y. </em>[4 Comst.] 257), and <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(32 <em>Barb., </em>328), are of the same nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">IV. It is my judgment that the legacy to Warren, under the will, vested from the death of the testator, and that it now belongs to his representatives. A decree will be- entered as prayed for.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
