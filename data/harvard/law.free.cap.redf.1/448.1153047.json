At the sale under the foreclosure, the guardian, to prevent a sacrifice of the property, bought it in as guardian.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b476-13\"><em>Held, </em>that he must account to such ward for the amount of his hid.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-14\">A citation was issued requiring Walter F.

Brush made a return, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>showing his accounts, and stating that he had commenced proceedings to foreclose a mortgage for part of funds belonging to the three minors, of each of whom he was the guardian, the funds having been invested by him as guardian of all the minors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">A decree was entered by Hr.
