In this action of contract the plaintiff seeks to recover on an account annexed for labor and materials furnished to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>fendant. There was a finding for the plaintiff. A report to the Appellate Division was dismissed and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The report discloses the following: Of the items contained in the account annexed only one, item 14, is in dispute. This was a charge for extra work and material which arose in these circumstances. While the work was in progress it was found necessary to lower the ceilings in some of the rooms so that exposed pipes would be covered with laths and plaster. At a conference held oh November 29, 1949, a representative of the plaintiff stated that this work should be paid for as an extra. The representatives of the plaintiff and the defendant then entered into an oral agreement, the terms of which are in dispute. The defendant\u2019s version was that the \u201cwork should be done at a cost of the labor and materials, not to exceed $1,000.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was that it was to be done at a cost of \u201capproximately $900 or $1,000.\u201d The judge in substance adopted the plaintiff\u2019s version, and found that the plaintiff undertook to do the work for \u201can approximate figure of $1,000\u201d but did not agree that the price would not exceed that amount. He alsp found that the defendant had waived article 17 of the written agreement which provided that there could be no departures from the written agreement unless \u201cupon a written order signed by a properly authorized officer or agent\u201d of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The plaintiff performed the work in question and submitted a bill to the defendant in the amount of $1,759.38. The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,454. The defendant concedes that it ordered the work in question. It further concedes that $1,000 was due, and it appears that this sum has been paid to the plaintiff. The sole question in issue is whether the judge erred in finding for the plaintiff in the amount of $1,454. That question is raised by the defendant\u2019s claim of report of the \u201ccourt\u2019s findings,\u201d which we interpret as challenging the general finding as well as the specific findings. Ordinarily the question of the correctness of a general finding or decision cannot be raised by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>exception or claim of report. <em>Stowell </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>288 Mass. 555. <em>Leshefsky </em>v. <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>293 Mass. 164, 167. <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>318 Mass. 420, 424. The reason is that exceptions or claims of report lie only to questions of law, and where there is a general finding, without more, fact and law are interwoven to such an extent that no question of law is presented. \u201cWhere, however, all material subsidiary facts have been found or are agreed . . . the separation of the questions of fact and of law involved in a general finding based thereon has been largely made and a motion or a request for a specific ruling of law would serve little purpose. In such a case an exception to [or claim of report from] a general finding brings before us the question of law whether it was permissible on the subsidiary facts established.\u201d <em>Leshefsky </em>v. <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co., supra, </em>at page 167. That is the case here. The subsidiary findings are sufficient to demonstrate whether the ultimate finding for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,454 was arrived at by the application of correct principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We are of opinion that this finding cannot stand. Despite the judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had \u201cexpressed an approximate figure of $1,000\u201d the agreement must be taken as an undertaking to furnish the labor and materials for \u201capproximately $900 or $1,000,\u201d as the plaintiff\u2019s representative testified. There was no evidence more favorable to the plaintiff than this and it is bound by it. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>298 Mass. 425, 427. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hanover, </em>314 Mass. 167, 170. <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>318 Mass. 76, 78. Obviously, by employing the words \u201capproximately $900 or $1,000\u201d the parties did not contemplate that the work was to be performed for a precise sum. The judge rightly refused to rule that recovery be limited to $1,000. Some latitude was to be expected, but not so much as to render the contract too indefinite for enforcement. <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>255 Mass. 220, 226. <em>Nickel </em>v. <em>Zeitz, </em>258 Mass. 282, 286. Expressions such as \u201cabout,\u201d \u201cmore or less,\u201d and \u201capproximately\u201d in qualifying quantity, price, and the like are often used in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tracts and they have generally been held to mean a reasonable approximation to the quantity or price specified. <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Winsor, </em>1 Allen, 546, 550-551. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Hedrington, </em>204 Mass. 238, 240. <em>National Wholesale Grocery Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>251 Mass. 238, 249. <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>255 Mass. 220, 226. <em>Nickel </em>v. <em>Zeitz, </em>258 Mass. 282, 286. In the case at bar the amount of $1,454 found by the judge cannot fairly be said to be \u201capproximately $900 or $1,000,\u201d and was excessive as matter of law. In its brief the defendant has asked us to fix the amount. This we decline to do. Essentially the question is one of fact to be determined by the trial judge, within the legal limits discussed above, in the light of all the evidence. We hold only that, in awarding damages which were 45% more than the highest sum specified by the parties, the judge exceeded those limits. :\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\n<em>Order dismissing report reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ACu\">\n<em>Finding for the plaintiff vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"alz-dedup-1\">\n<em>Case to stand for further hearing in the Municipal Court on the issue of damages.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
