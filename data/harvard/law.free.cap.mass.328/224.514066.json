An impartial physician reported that the employee\u2019s condition was causally related to that shock. The single member found that the employee sustained a disabling injury in her left arm that arose out of and in the course of her employment, and that she is entitled to compensation. The reviewing board affirmed and adopted the findings of the single member. But the Superior Court entered a decree that her injury did not arise out of or in the course of her employment, and the employee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">The findings of fact made by the board are final if there was any evidence to support them. The judge had- no power to find facts, or to decide upon probabilities. He could overturn the decision only if the opposite result was required as matter of law. <em>McKeon\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 202, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>203, and cases cited. <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705, 707. We think that the evidence warranted the findings of the board, and that the judge erred in dismissing the claim. Costs under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, shall be allowed by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>Decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>Decree for the employee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
