From orders sustaining demurrers to the declarations the plaintiff appeals. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">The alleged libel appears on page 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">The plaintiff seeks to bring himself within the well established principle that a demurrer to a declaration for libel cannot be sustained unless the words are not reasonably capable of any defamatory meaning. <em>Twombly </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>136 Mass. 464, 469. <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>Publishing Co. </em>304 Mass. 31, 34. <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>306 Mass. 595, 596. <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Sentinel Printing Co. </em>324 Mass. 13, 14. <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>324 Mass. 478, 487-488. In particular, he argues that the publication contains imputations of dishonesty on his part. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Coulter, </em>215 Mass. 566, 570; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Journal Newspaper Co. </em>219 Mass. 486. We, however, are of opinion that the words themselves, taken in their natural sense and without a forced or strained construction, are not' defamatory. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Wakefield Item Co. </em>280 Mass. 451, 453. At most, it is charged that the plaintiff in his public office, at times in matters but vaguely suggested, has acted in accordance with his own interests. It is not even stated that such action was not in accord with a proper regard for the public interests. We do not see how the advertisement, published as it was in the course of a political campaign, could injure the plaintiff\u2019s reputation in the community or expose him to hatred, ridicule, and contempt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clap, </em>4 Mass. 163, 168; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardwell, </em>136 Mass. 164, 169. We think that the advertisement, read as a whole and reasonably interpreted, would not discredit the plaintiff in the minds of a considerable and respectable class of the community. Rightly understood, it is the customary type of hortatory appeal commonly made to voters at election time. The alleged libel is lacking in that kind of statement which in normal understanding could be accepted as defamatory.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-N\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Political Advertisement Political Advertisement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">ATTENTION!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">VOTERS OF WESTFIELD NOV. 8, 1949</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">The questions in this advertisement are asked to arouse the voters of Westfield to the interests of the city.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">DO NOT VOTE FOR LEWIS H.
