The accident occurred in Lebanon, Connecticut, on July 3, 1947. The plaintiff had a verdict. The questions for deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sion arise out of the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict and to a portion of the judge\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The defendant\u2019s answer alleges, in part, that he was an insured person under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152. See <em>Pell </em>v. <em>New Bedford Gas &amp; Edison Light Co. </em>325 Mass. 239. It is' not disputed that the defendant was insured under a workmen\u2019s compensation policy that would cover the plaintiff if she was an employee of the defendant at the time of the accident. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (4), as amended; 25B, inserted by St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 7. The plaintiff concedes that if she was an employee of the defendant then she cannot maintain this action, for she did not reserve her common law rights under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 24. See <em>Adiletto </em>v. <em>Brockton Cut Sole Corp. </em>322 Mass. 110. The defendant on the other hand concedes that if the plaintiff\u2019s rights are at common law and not under c. 152 then she was entitled to recover. Both in the trial court and here the case has been presented on the footing that the applicable compensation act is the Massachusetts act, and we shall deal with the case on that basis. See <em>McLaughlin\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 217; <em>Bauer\u2019s Case, </em>314 Mass. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The following is a summary of the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff: The plaintiff, a woman seventy-one years of age, was a friend of one Mrs. Saffer, a domestic servant employed by the defendant. On two occasions at the defendant\u2019s home in Springfield the plaintiff had assisted Mrs. Saffer to \u201cclean up after dinner\u201d so that she could \u201cget out early.\u201d On one of these occasions, when asked by the defendant\u2019s wife if she owed her anything for what she had done, the plaintiff stated that nothing was due. Whereupon the defendant\u2019s wife handed the plaintiff $1 so that she and Mrs. Saffer could go to the \u201cmovies.\u201d Sometime in June, 1947, Mrs. Saffer learned that the defendant and his family were going to spend the summer in Stonington, Connecticut, and she informed the plaintiff of this. Because they were friendly and liked to be together, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>they discussed the possibility of the plaintiff coming to Stonington to assist Mrs. Saffer for a period of two weeks commencing on July 3. The plaintiff told Mrs. Saffer that she would be willing to go. At different times Mrs. Saffer informed the defendant\u2019s wife of conversations she had had with the plaintiff relative to the latter\u2019s coming to Stoning-ton, and this information was conveyed to the defendant by his wife. Shortly prior to July 3 the plaintiff received a telephone call from the defendant who asked her if she was going to Stonington. The plaintiff told him that she was and the defendant said he would call for her on the afternoon of July 3. In accordance with this arrangement the defendant called for the plaintiff and the accident occurred while she was being transported to Stonington in the defendant\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The plaintiff testified that she was going to Stonington \u201cto have a good time with her friend, Mrs. Saffer\u201d; that Mrs. Carlisle (the defendant\u2019s wife) \u201cdid not hire her to go down there\u201d; that she was going to help Mrs. Saffer; and that she never discussed employment with either the defendant or his wife. The plaintiff also testified that when she left Springfield for Connecticut with the defendant she did not have any thought of work or pay, \u201cbut was merely intent on getting away from home.\u201d In answer to a question whether she expected to be paid for her work in Stoning-ton she replied that \u201cshe did and she didn\u2019t.\u201d When asked if she expected to work while she was in Stonington the plaintiff answered, \u201cI never go anywhere, visiting . . . unless I work.\u201d At one point in her testimony she said, \u201cMrs. Carlisle probably would have paid me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The defendant testified that he paid all the household bills but left all matters relating to the hiring of help to his wife. The defendant\u2019s wife testified that the plaintiff \u201cwas never an employee of mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">1. With respect to the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict the parties are agreed that the \u25a0 only question presented is whether the evidence establishes as matter of law that the plaintiff at the time of the accident was an \u201cem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ployee\u201d of the defendant as that word is used in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152. Section 1 (4) defines \u201cEmployee\u201d as including \u201cevery person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written . . ..\u201d It is familiar law that \u201ca verdict will not be directed for a party unless the evidence when construed most favorably to the opposite party would not warrant a contrary verdict, or unless evidence by which such opposite party is bound would make impossible a verdict in his favor.\u201d <em>Salem Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Deery, </em>289 Mass. 431, 433. <em>Reardon Importing Co. </em>v. <em>Security Trust Co. </em>318 Mass. 304, 307. Applying that test here, it is plain that the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict could not properly have been granted. The evidence fell far short of establishing as matter of law that the plaintiff was an \u201cemployee\u201d within the definition in \u00a7 1 (4). At most the question was one of fact. We are not called upon to decide whether a finding that the plaintiff was an employee would have been warranted on the evidence. It is enough for present purposes to decide that such a finding was not required. This conclusion is not at variance with <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>State Theatre Co. </em>256 Mass. 466, on which the defendant relies. The differences between that case and the present one are so obvious that they need not be pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">2. The defendant\u2019s other exception relates to a portion of the charge. The judge,.subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, charged the jury in part as follows: \u201cGentlemen: this is the plaintiff\u2019s request number seven: \u2018As a matter of law the plaintiff never entered into an express contract of hire with the defendant so as to become an employee within the meaning of the word \u201cEmployee\u201d . . . in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1, as amended.\u2019 That request concerns an express contract, not an implied contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The defendant contends that this instruction was erroneous for the reason that there was some evidence of an express contract. The evidence relied on by the defendant in support of his contention is that the defendant left the matter of hiring domestic help to his wife; that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>wife informed Mrs. Saffer that there would be extra guests at Stonington \u201cover the Fourth of July\u201d; that as a result of this information Mrs. Saffer had a conversation with the defendant\u2019s wife regarding some extra help; that following this conversation Mrs. Saffer asked the plaintiff to come to Stonington to help her and the plaintiff agreed to come; that Mrs. Saffer told the plaintiff that \u201cshe would possibly get as much as she . . . [Mrs. Saffer] received for pay\u201d; that Mrs. Saffer told the plaintiff that she would be in Stonington about two weeks; that the defendant agreed to furnish transportation for the plaintiff; that the substance of each conversation between Mrs. Saffer and the plaintiff was conveyed to the defendant\u2019s wife; and that on the day of the accident the defendant called for the plaintiff and transported her to Connecticut in his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We are of opinion that the foregoing evidence fails to show that the defendant or persons authorized to act on his behalf entered into an express contract with the plaintiff. The word \u201cexpress\u201d as applied to a contract in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4), signifies a contract where the terms are expressly stated in contradistinction to an implied contract where an agreement is inferred from the conduct of the parties and from the attendant circumstances. See <em>W. A. Snow Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>227 Mass. 382, 390; Williston on Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 3. It was not error, therefore, for the judge to instruct the jury as he did. It is to be noted that the judge, after giving the challenged instruction, told the jury that it \u201cconcerns an express contract, not an implied contract.\u201d Thus the possibility of the jury finding that there was an implied contract was not eliminated. That was all the defendant was entitled to. The defendant did not except to any other part of the charge and it is not set forth in the record. It is to be assumed that proper instructions were given on all issues in the case. <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>327 Mass. 287, 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
