L. (Ter. EdO c. 152, as amended. There was evidence before the single member of the Industrial Accident Board substantially as follows. The employee was injured on March 2, 1951, while employed as a \u201cstoker\u201d by L. H. Hamel Leather Company in its plant at Haverhill. It became necessary to change the position of a flywheel on a staking machine in the room where the claimant was working. The flywheel weighed five hundred pounds. A maintenance man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>named Therreault, whose duty it was to make the change, left the room to get a crane with which to move the flywheel. The claimant s\u00faggested to several fellow workers that it would be a joke on Therreault to lift and move the flywheel in the latter\u2019s absence. Thereupon the claimant and three other men proceeded to lift the flywheel and turn it around. In lifting the flywheel the claimant felt a pain in his back a,nd shortly thereafter as he \u201cgrabbed\u201d a pile of leather to prevent it from falling he again felt a severe pain in his back. It was discovered later that his seventh dorsal vertebra had been fractured as a result of \u201cmusculature exertion.\u201d In the opinion of a physician the fracture was caused by the lifting and the subsequent pain experienced in readjusting the pile of leather was due to the grating fragments of bone. The single member found that the injury \u201cdid not arise out of his employment as a s taker but was due to his participation with his fellow employees in the turning of a flywheel on an idle machine, which was being prepared for transfer to another department, as a practical joke on the maintenance man who had advised Mr. Mailloux that he was leaving the room to obtain a crane with which to move the flywheel. Shortly after the first accident the employee was pushing a load of leather which started to slip. As he grabbed it to prevent it from falling he felt pain in his back. With the help of another man he righted the load and pushed it to his machine. I find that this incident did no more than direct his attention to his already severely injured back and was in no way responsible for his subsequent disability. Accordingly, the employee\u2019s claim for compensation is denied.\u201d The reviewing board amended the first sentence of the member\u2019s decision as above quoted to read as follows: \u201cHowever, I further find that this injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment as a stoker but was due to the employee\u2019s assumption of a risk not contemplated by his contract of hire in the turning of a flywheel on an idle machine, which was being prepared for transfer to another department, as a practical joke on the maintenance man who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>had advised Mr. Mailloux that he was leaving the room to obtain a crane with which to move the flywheel.\u201d It then adopted the findings and decision of the single member as so amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The decision of the reviewing board \u201cmust be accepted as final if supported by evidence and not tainted by error of law.\u201d <em>Webb\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 357, 358. <em>Lapinsky\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 13, 15. See <em>Roney\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 732. The evidence was sufficient to warrant the finding of the board that the claimant received his injury while participating in a so called practical joke played on a fellow employee. We held in <em>Moore\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 258, where an employee was injured while \u201cfooling\u201d with another employee, that the board was correct in ruling that the injury to the employee \u201cdid not arise out of his employment.\u201d The principle involved is that which has governed decisions in similar cases arising in this and in other jurisdictions. See <em>Roch-ford\u2019s Case, </em>234 Mass. 93; <em>Roberts\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 316; <em>DiLauro </em>v. <em>Bassetti, </em>133 Conn. 642; <em>Shedlock </em>v. <em>Cudahy Packing Co. </em>134 Conn. 672; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Liberty Motor &amp; Engineering Corp. </em>185 Md. 596; <em>Rothfarb </em>v. <em>Camp Awanee, Inc. </em>116 Vt. 172. An injury does not arise out of the employment when it results from the assumption of a risk not incidental to or connected with such employment. See <em>McNicol\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 497; <em>Hurley\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 357; <em>Babi-neau\u2019s Case, </em>254 Mass. 214; <em>Horton\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 572, 573; <em>Roberts\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 316; <em>Zarba </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>322 Mass. 132, 134, and cases cited; <em>Dillon\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 102, 106-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">This is. not a case where a nonparticipating employee is injured by the \u201cfooling\u201d or \u201chorseplay\u201d of others, see G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 26, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 8; <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Merritt Engineering Co. </em>302 N. Y. 131, but is one where the employee\u2019s injury results from his own voluntary act which in no way pertains to his employment. There was no error in dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
