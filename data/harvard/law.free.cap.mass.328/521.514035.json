Seven indictments containing sixty-five counts for larceny were returned against the defendant by the grand jury of Suffolk County on July 8, 1949. He was arraigned on July 12, 1949, pleaded not guilty, and was admitted to bail. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>In May, 1950, he was notified by the department of mental health to report for a mental examination under the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 100A. He did not report. On May 25 and June 2 at the instance of his counsel he was examined by a psychiatrist, whose report to counsel is annexed to the petitions. The report stated in substance that the defendant had a \"psychosis,\u201d was \"in an extremely disordered mental state,\u201d and required treatment in a mental institution. On June 5, 1950, the defendant pleaded guilty to the seven indictments before a judge of the Superior Court. His counsel did not inform the judge of the psychiatrist\u2019s report. The indictments were continued for disposition and on October 9, 1950, were brought forward before another judge of the Superior Court on motion for sentence. No objection was made to the imposition of sentence by a judge other than the one who had received the pleas of guilty nor was reference made by counsel to the psychiatrist\u2019s report. On indictment numbered 41 the defendant was sentenced to a term of from three to five years in the State prison and on indictment numbered 42 to a like term to be served from and after the expiration of the first ' sentence. The other indictments were placed on file. Execution of the first sentence began immediately. On October 13, 1950, the defendant filed appeals to the Appellate ' Division of the Superior Court under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 28A-28D, inserted by St. 1943, c. 558, \u00a7 1, and amended, \u2022 which appeals, after a hearing at which the defendant was personally present, were (on November 30, 1950) dismissed. The present petitions were filed on September 21, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The defendant alleges that, at the times he pleaded guilty, was sentenced, and appeared before the Appellate Division, he was mentally unsound, unable to understand his position, and incapable of consulting intelligently with counsel; that he was \"rushed into trial\u201d; and that his constitutional rights were violated by the imposition of sentence by a judge other than the one before whom he pleaded guilty. The judge before whom the petitions came for hearing refused to hear testimony as to the defendant\u2019s mental ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>pacity and denied each petition \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d The defendant\u2019s exceptions are to this refusal to hear testimony and to the denials of the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We think the defendant has no just cause of complaint in respect to the proceedings which resulted in the imposition of the sentences. These proceedings were in accordance with the established procedure of our courts and afforded the defendant full opportunity to present any defence which he may have had. There was no lack of due process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coggins, </em>324 Mass. 552, 556-557.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">He was not \u201crushed into trial\u201d and throughout the prosecution had the benefit of experienced and skilful counsel. Although he now contends that the court should have ascertained his mental condition before accepting his pleas and imposing sentence, he refused a mental examination by the department whose duty it was to determine that condition and failed to disclose to the court the report of his own psychiatrist on which he now relies. In the absence of evidence to the contrary the judge could rely on the presumption that the defendant was sane. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>11 Gray, 303, 304. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belenski, </em>276 Mass. 35, 45. While the defendant was not required to submit to a mental examination his refusal did not prevent the Commonwealth from putting him on trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>314 Mass. 96, 104-105. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vallarelli, </em>273 Mass. 240, 249; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belenski, </em>276 Mass. 35, 43. He made no objection to sentence by a judge other than the one before whom he had pleaded. The authority of this judge to impose sentence cannot be doubted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gedzium, </em>261 Mass. 299; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">But apart from the merits of the defendant\u2019s contentions we think the Superior Court was without jurisdiction to act upon the petitions. The point involved was decided in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phelan, </em>271 Mass. 21. In that case and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soderquest, </em>183 Mass. 199, the methods of relief from a final judgment in a criminal case are clearly stated. If these petitions be treated as motions for new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>trial, they were denied rightly because a motion for a hew trial does not lie where there has been sentence on a plea of guilty without trial. After the decision in the <em>Phelan </em>ease, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 278, \u00a7 29, which provided for the granting of new trials in criminal cases, was amended by St. 1939, c. 271, \u00a7 1, by adding to the provision that a new trial may be granted if it \u201cappears to the court that justice has not been done\u201d a further provision for a new trial if it appears to the court that justice \u201ccannot be\u201d done. As this amending clause only states an additional cause for a new trial, it has no application to a case in which there has been no trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The petitions could not be considered as motions for modification of sentence because not filed before the end of the October sitting when the sentences were imposed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phelan, </em>271 Mass. 21, 22. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soderquest, </em>183 Mass. 199, 200-201. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 20; <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>312 Mass. 252, 256-257. The petitions were properly denied. It necesarily follows that there was no error in refusing to take testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
