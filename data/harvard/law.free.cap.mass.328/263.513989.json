The defendant, a wholesale grocer, was the distributor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>but not the manufacturer. The declaration is in tort for negligence. The plaintiff excepted to the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The plaintiff, a housewife, testified that on a day late in December, 1947, she purchased several articles at a grocery store, and carried them home. One of them, the bottle of catsup, she kept in her kitchen cabinet, not near a radiator or stove, until the following January 2. The bottle was \u201cspic and span.\u201d There was nothing to indicate that anything was wrong with it in any way. On that day she pried the cap up slightly with the dull edge of a knife. The cap \u201cpopped up\u201d with an \u201cexplosive sound, a sound like when you open a bottle of champagne,\u201d striking and breaking a lens of her eyeglasses. The contents of the bottle smelt sour and fermented. When buying the catsup, the plaintiff did not ask for any particular brand, and did not notice what brand she received.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">No contention is, or could be, made that there is evidence of negligence in distribution or in any other respect on the part of the defendant. See <em>Kusick </em>v. <em>Thorndike &amp; Hix, Inc. </em>224 Mass. 413; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Yardley &amp; Co. Ltd. </em>319 Mass. 92, 95. The theory of the plaintiff\u2019s case is that there was negligence in manufacture, and that the defendant should be held to the liability of a manufacturer. We are referred to Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 4D0, reading, \u201cOne who puts out as his own product a chattel manufactured by another is subject to the same liability as though he were its manufacturer.\u201d See <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Carpenter-Morton Co. </em>220 Mass. 593; <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Blackwell, </em>84 Fed. (2d) 130 (C. C. A. 4); <em>Burkhardt </em>v. <em>Armour &amp; Co. </em>115 Conn. 249; <em>Fleetwood </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>27 Ga. App. 502; <em>Armour &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Leasure, </em>177 Md. 393; <em>Tiedje </em>v. <em>Haney, </em>184 Minn. 569; <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>174 Miss. 253; <em>Slavin </em>v. <em>Francis H. Leggett &amp; Co. </em>114 N. J. L. 421; 117 N. J. L. 101; <em>Willson </em>v. <em>Faxon, Williams &amp; Faxon, </em>208 N. Y. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">We assume, without deciding, that there is evidence of negligence in manufacture. Without intimating an opinion upon the merits of the rule, at present we need only say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>that the plaintiff does not bring herself within it. The cap on the bottle was marked, \u201c'Vapor-vacuum \u2019 sealed. To open pry up.\u201d A label around the neck read, \u201cDoes not contain artificial coloring or preservative. Packed from fresh ripe tomatoes.\u201d On the main label there was, \u201cJohn Alden Tomato Catsup. Contents 14 oz. avd. Standard Grocery Company Boston <em>&amp; </em>New Bedford, Mass., Providence, R. I. Distributors.\u201d There was no evidence that \u201cJohn. Alden\u201d is a brand of the defendant. \u25a0 There is no similarity in names. It is nowhere stated or intimated that this was the defendant's product. In fact, the inference is that the defendant\u2019s only connection with the bottle was as a distributor. In these circumstances, the defendant did not put the catsup out as its own product.
