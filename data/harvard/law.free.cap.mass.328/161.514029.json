L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 113B, as amended by St. 1935, c. 459, \u00a7 4, to review an order of the respondent commissioner made on December 4, 1950, establishing classification of risks and rates to be charged as premiums by companies for the year 1951 in connection with compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance as defined by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 34A, as amended. A demurrer filed by the commissioner and demurrers filed by two insurance companies that were allowed to intervene were sustained. The answer of these inter-veners setting up special matter in the nature of a plea was sustained by the single justice. The petitioner appealed from decrees entered on these interlocutory matters and from a final decree dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"ALW\">All the material and substantial allegations of the petition may be briefly stated. It is alleged that the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 113B did not intend that the rates for compulsory automobile liability policies should be different for different districts or zones; that the order of the commissioner dividing the Commonwealth into zones and establishing rates for each zone was discriminatory and violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and of arts. 1,10, and 11 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of this Commonwealth; that the commissioner failed to establish just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory rates for 1951 before September 15, 1950; that it is mathematically impossible to establish adequate, fair, and reasonable rates based upon zones; and that the order fixing the \u201cexpense loading\u201d portion of the rates on a zone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>basis is contrary to the provisions of Federal and State Constitutions above mentioned and also \u201cthe provisions of G. L. c. 175 and 113B, and St. 1935, c. 459.\u201d The specific prayers of the petition are for injunctive relief against the enforcement of the order of December 4, 1950, and for an order to compel the commissioner to promulgate a flat rate for compulsory automobile insurance policies and bonds throughout the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">This summary of the contents of the petition demonstrates that it consists of nothing more than a series of general and broad conclusions, unsupported by any definite and specific averments of facts. It does not attack any subsidiary finding of the commissioner or any particular ruling of law made by him. It was said of a similar petition for review that \u201cThese words [of \u00a7 113B as then appearing in St. 1929, c. 166] do not mean that by simple petition without more parties are entitled to ask the court to review the whole field covered by the commissioner and make its own finding,\u201d and also that \u201cThe petition must contain allegations setting out with certainty, brevity and adequate degree of particularity the grounds upon which relief is sought.\u201d <em>Brest </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Insurance, </em>270 Mass. 7, 12. It was said in <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Examiners for Hampshire County, </em>301 Mass. 170, 172, \u201cThese general allegations, stating conclusions as to the conduct of the public officials referred to, without any specification of acts or of facts, do not provide material for a judicial determination. They are not admitted by the demurrer.\u201d See also <em>Wesalo </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Insurance, </em>299 Mass. 495, 498; <em>Comerford </em>v. <em>Meier, </em>302 Mass. 398, 404; <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>School Committee of Somerville, </em>306 Mass. 542, 547; <em>Robichaud </em>v. <em>Owens-Illinois Glass Co. </em>313 Mass. 583, 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The fact that \u00a7 113B provides that the commissioner shall annually on or before September 15 fix and establish fair and reasonable classifications of risks and just and nondiscriminatory premium charges does not render invalid the classification and rates which in the instant case were not established until December 4, 1950. <em>Liberty Mutual </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Acting Commissioner of Insurance, </em>265 Mass. 23, 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The principal object sought by the present petition is to obtain a decision that the commissioner had no authority to establish rates for premium charges for compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance based upon a zoning system in which he divided the Commonwealth into different districts or zones and established a rate for each zone for automobiles where they were principally garaged. All the bald allegations contained in the present petition attacking this method of determining the rates by zones were considered and decided adversely to the petitioner in <em>Brest </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Insurance, </em>270 Mass. 7. We see no reason to doubt the soundness of that decision. The first paragraph of \u00a7 113B providing for the establishment of rates for compulsory insurance as defined in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 34A, is in the identical language now as it was when the judgment was rendered in the <em>Brest </em>case, although its scope was limited by the amendment to \u00a7 34A by St. 1935, c. 459, \u00a7 2, removing guest coverage from compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance. This resulted in merely adding a second paragraph to \u00a7 113B providing for the establishing of premium charges for insurance for guests. St. 1935, c. 459, \u00a7 4. The Legislature must be assumed to have been familiar with the <em>Brest </em>decision, <em>Proprietors of the Cemetery of Mount Auburn </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>301 Mass. 211, 213, <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver General, </em>319 Mass. 672; and leaving unchanged the first paragraph of \u00a7 113B and adding a new paragraph to this section dealing with the establishment of rates for guest coverage furnish persuasive evidence of an intent that the existing provision governing the classification of risks and the fixing, of premium charges for compulsory insurance policies should continue unaffected. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>202 Mass. 379, 388. Guest coverage is not mentioned in the petition and is not here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The interlocutory decrees are affirmed, and the final decree is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ-\">\n<em>So ordered</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
