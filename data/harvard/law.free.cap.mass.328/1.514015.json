The plaintiffs appeal from an order of the Appellate Division sustaining the defendant\u2019s demurrer and reversing a contrary ruling by the District Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">There is no allegation of fraud or misrepresentation. The kernel of the action is negligent concealment or failure on the part of a vendor of real estate to disclose defects known to him which he had reason to believe would not become known to the buyers. There was a simple failure to reveal where there was no duty to speak'. This is a case of bare nondisclosure, and is governed in every essential particular by our recent decision in <em>Swinton </em>v. <em>Whitinsville Savings Bank, </em>311 Mass. 677, with full citation of authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\n<em>Order sustaining demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
