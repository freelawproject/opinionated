G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 113; c. 214, \u00a7 3 (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">The limit of liability in the policy for injury to each person was $25,000. One of the \u201cExclusions\u201d of the policy provided in substance that so much of the coverage as exceeded the $5,000 for the compulsory portion of the policy required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 1A, as amended, and defined in \u00a7 34A, as appearing in part in St.- 1935, c. 459, \u00a7 2, should not apply \u201cwhile the motor vehicle is used as a public or livery conveyance . . . ,\u201d and it was stated in the \u201cDeclarations\u201d that the purposes for which the vehicle was to be used were \u201cPleasure Use.\u201d General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 113A, contains a provision forbidding exceptions or exclusions from the compulsory coverage as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>specified accidents, but this provision had no application to the coverage in excess of the required $5,000. In the Superior Court the trial judge entered a decree in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of the compulsory coverage and costs. The plaintiff appeals, contending that the decree should have been for the entire amount of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The hearing took the form of statements by counsel to which opposing counsel assented.- In substance the following facts were thus developed or could have been inferred: The injury to the plaintiff was caused by the negligen&amp;e of one Lipinski in driving the automobile owned by Bern and registered in her name. Lipinski, who was present at the hearing, would testify, as he had testified in the United States District Court, that he had obtained \u25a0 the automobile \u201cas a rental vehicle for a money consideration from the Bern\u2019s Drivurself System, a concern that operated a rental auto service.\u201d He had signed a printed form of \u201crental agreement\u201d requiring him to return by a certain hour. It was agreed that at the trial of the original cause in the United States District Court the only evidence \u201cof agency or legal responsibility on the part of the defendant Irene Bern in connection with the operation of the vehicle by Lipinski at the time of the accident was through Chapter 231, Section 85A of the General Laws . . ..\u201d That section provides in part that registration of a motor vehicle in the name of a defendant as owner shall be prima facie evidence that it was being operated by and under the control of a person for whose conduct the defendant was legally responsible. Nothing further than as hereinbefore stated appeared as to the course of the trial in the United States District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The insurer contends that these facts show that as to all coverage above the compulsory amount the case falls within the exclusion relative to the use of the vehicle as a livery conveyance, and also that such use was in violation of the provision in the \u201cDeclarations\u201d that the use of the vehicle would be pleasure use. The plaintiff insists that the insurer cannot be permitted to put forward either of these propo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>sitions in the present suit because it must have been decided in the United States District Court as one of the bases of the judgment against Bern that Lipinski was operating as the agent of Bern, the owner, and not as a hirer of the vehicle on his own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It is true that \u201cWhere an action against the insured is ostensibly within the terms of the policy, the insurer, whether\" it assumes the defence or refuses to assume it, is bound by the result of that action as to all matters therein decided which are material to recovery by the insured in an action on the policy.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>291 Mass. 445, 448. <em>Saragan </em>v. <em>Bousquet, </em>322 Mass. 14, 20. We therefore agree with the plaintiff that the insurer cannot deny the fact that Lipinski in driving the automobile was the agent of Bern acting within the scope of his employment. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>298 Mass. 393, 394. But the insurer can still insist upon any defences not necessarily inconsistent with that fact. <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Frew, </em>318 Mass. 595, 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">It seems to us that the defences now insisted upon are not necessarily inconsistent with the implied finding in the United States District Court that Lipinski was driving as the agent of Bern. The relation of the defendant Irene Bern to \u201cBern\u2019s Drivurself System,\u201d if there was any relation, does not appear. It does not appear that Irene Bern operated the \u201cSystem\u201d or had any interest in it. There may have been no relation at all between Irene Bern and the \u201cSystem\u201d beyond a mere bailment of the automobile by her to the \u201cSystem,\u201d with or without consideration. See <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>268 Mass. 407. The \u201cSystem\u201d may have taken possession of the automobile as lessee, mortgagee, or conditional vendor. The general relation between the defendant Irene Bern and Lipinski does not appear. He may have been regularly employed by Bern or he may merely have driven her on the particular occasion at her request and under her direction. He may even have hired the automobile in her behalf. In the various circumstances suggested above it would have been possible for Lipinski personally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>to become the hirer of the automobile from the \u201cSystem\u201d in whose possession it was, and yet to drive it as the agent of the defendant Irene Bern.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Since the judgment in the original action did not prevent the trial judge from finding both that the automobile had been hired \u201cas a . . . livery conveyance\u201d and that it was in use for that purpose and not for \u201cPleasure,\u201d he was justified in reaching the conclusions in these matters to which the facts agreed in the present suit would naturally lead, and so in' holding the insurer liable only to the extent of the compulsory coverage. <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. </em>283 Mass. 511. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Great American Indemnity Co. </em>316 Mass. 155, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs of appeal to the insurer as against the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
