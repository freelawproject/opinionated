The Independent Chair Company was a corporation and an insured subscriber under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. Harry M. Brenner, the plaintiffs\u2019 testator, and the defendant Liner, were employees of said company. On March 18, 1949, both were riding in the defendant\u2019s automobile, operated by the defendant, on the business of said company and in the course of their employment. Brenner was in the exercise of due care and was killed by the negligence of the defendant Liner. Brenner had not reserved his common law rights against the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">Brenner left a widow and two children. By St. 1947, c. 506, \u00a7 1A, revising G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 229, \u00a7 2, a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>who negligently \u201ccauses the death of a person in the exercise of due care who is not in his or its employment or service . . . shall be liable in damages, in an amount not less than two thousand nor more than fifteen thousand dollars, to be assessed with reference to the pecuniary loss sustained by the parties entitled to benefit hereunder and recovered by the executor or administrator of the deceased person in an action of tort . . . and distributed one half to the surviving wife or husband and one half to the children of the deceased dependent upon him for support . . ..\u201d The case stated declares that the children were not dependents under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1, but were dependents under the death act, St. 1947, c. 506, \u00a7 1A.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The widow has claimed and received the benefits due her as a dependent under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, but the children have received nothing under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The defendant, as an employee of the insured company, was not \u201csome person other than the insured,\u201d within G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 15,- as it appears in St. 1943, c. 432. <em>Caira </em>v. <em>Caira, </em>296 Mass. 448, 450. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M. W. Leahy Co. Inc. </em>300 Mass. 565, 569. The law was summed up in <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Miettinen, </em>317 Mass. 633, 635, in these words: \u201cIf at the time the injuries were received the parties were engaged in the course of their common employment, the plaintiff cannot maintain this action [of tort] but must rely upon his remedies under the workmen\u2019s compensation act,\u201d citing the cases from which that proposition is derived, beginning with <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Barre, </em>286 Mass. 593. On its facts <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Miettinen </em>is precisely like the present case, except for the immaterial circumstance that in that case the plaintiff was injured and not killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The plaintiff relies upon <em>Reidy </em>v. <em>Old Colony Gas Co. </em>315 Mass. 631. But in that case the original papers show that the defendant was neither the employer nor a fellow employee of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. The decision in that case has no bearing upon the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">It follows from what has been said that in the present case the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"AyA\"><em>T </em>,7 <em>, , \u00b1 Judgment for the defendant.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
