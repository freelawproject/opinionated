We hold that the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff is sufficient for a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the deputy injured a ten-year-old girl when he violently and without cause jerked her out of a chair in the living room of her home and dragged her across the room by her arm. Accordingly, we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that the deputy used excessive force in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. We therefore vacate the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">I. Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">Plaintiffs Kenneth and Sharon Ikerd, a married couple, brought this action for damages on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor daughter pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The plaintiffs alleged that they sustained injuries as a result of the unconstitutional conduct of several law enforcement officers. The plaintiffs alleged that on October 8, 1992, the defendants falsely arrested Kenneth Ikerd and subjected him to excessive force, intimidation, and harassment. In addition, at the time of the alleged false arrest, the plaintiffs claimed that officer Harold Varnado, Jr., acting under color of state law, used excessive force against Laura Ik-erd in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-19\">A jury trial was commenced before a magistrate judge on November 6, 1995.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of the evidence, the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court submitted the case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>jury without ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After deliberating for approximately eleven hours, the jury returned verdicts in favor of the defendants on the false arrest and excessive force claims asserted by Kenneth Ikerd. The jury, however, remained deadlocked on Laura Ikerd\u2019s claim of excessive force against Deputy Varnado in his personal capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">On November 9,1995, the court declared a mistrial with respect to Laura Ikerd\u2019s claim. The court indicated in a conference with the parties\u2019 attorneys that Deputy Vamado\u2019s pending Rule 50 motion would be denied because of factual conflicts in the record. Nonetheless, the court later reconsidered the evidence and granted Deputy Varnado\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law because \u201cthe defendant\u2019s act could not have amounted to anything more than a de minimis use of force.\u201d On November 15, 1995, the court entered judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims, including Laura Ikerd\u2019s excessive force claim. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo. <em>Garcia v. Woman\u2019s Hosp. of Texas, </em>97 F.3d 810, 812 (5th Cir.1996). We consider all of the evidence \u201cin the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Cramer, </em>6 F.3d 1102, 1109 (5th Cir.1993)). \u201cIf the facts and inferences point so strongly in favor of the moving party that the reviewing court believes that reasonable jurors could not have arrived at a contrary verdict, then we will conclude that the motion should have been granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">III. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">On the morning of October 8, 1992, ten-year-old Laura Ikerd and her eight-year-old brother were at home in their living room watching television. Deputies Harold Vama-do, Jr. and Roy Stephens of the Washington Parish Sheriffs Office arrived at their home dressed in plain clothes. The officers did not identify themselves but asked to speak to the children\u2019s father. Laura woke her father who went to the front door to meet the deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">As Kenneth Ikerd approached the front door to meet the deputies, he asked if he could help the officers. Deputy Varnado responded: \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest for molestation of Jimmy Buras\u2019[s] kids and your two kids.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After hearing these allegations, Laura went into the living room and started to cry. Kenneth Ikerd and the deputies followed Laura into the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">At this time, Deputy Varnado asked Kenneth Ikerd why his children were not in school. Mr. Ikerd told the officers that he had allowed them to stay home as a reward for getting good grades on their report cards. When the officers continued to press Mr. Ikerd on this issue, Laura prepared to say something. Mr. Ikerd told Laura to be quiet, but Deputy Varnado said that Mr. Ikerd should shut up and let her answer. When Deputy Varnado asked Laura why she was not in school, Laura refused to answer and told him to leave her alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">Deputy Varnado approached Laura and violently jerked her out of her chair by her right arm and dragged her into the kitchen. Deputy Varnado told Mr. Ikerd to shut up and get out of the way while he whispered something into Laura\u2019s ear. Mr. Ikerd left the kitchen pursuant to Deputy Varnado\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Laura\u2019s right arm had been broken and surgically repaired about one year prior to this incident. Laura testified that the force used by Deputy Vamado in pulling her out of the chair \u201churt a lot.\u201d Before this incident, Laura\u2019s arm had been healing well and her only complaint to her family was of minor tingling in her fingers. After this incident, however, Laura complained much more frequently about her arm, lamenting that she was experiencing complete numbness in her fingertips and pain in the arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Laura\u2019s physician testified that on October 15,1992, when he first examined Laura after the incident, Laura complained of pain in her forearm and tingling in her fingertips. Laura\u2019s injury was diagnosed as \u201cmild soft tissue injury to the forearm.\u201d Prior to the October 8 incident, Laura had not complained to her doctor of tingling in her fingers. Laura\u2019s doctor testified that such a symptom could have been caused by trauma or damage to the nerves of Laura\u2019s forearm as a result of being grabbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In addition to her physical injuries, a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist both diagnosed Laura as having suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the October 8 incident. After the incident, Laura had difficulty concentrating and her grades in school dropped. Laura frequently cried when she discussed the incident or saw police cars, suffered from recurring headaches and bad dreams, and frequently replayed the incident in her mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Deputy Vamado acknowledged in his testimony at trial that he is a \u201cbig old boy\u201d who weighed close to 300 pounds at the time of trial. Furthermore, Deputy Vamado testified that there was never a need to use any physical force against Laura.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When asked whether there was any need to place his hands on Laura, Deputy Vamado responded, \u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">IV. Legal Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AdG\">Appellants claim that a reasonable jury could conclude that Deputy Vamado used excessive force against Laura Ikerd in the course of arresting her father. The Supreme Court has held that \u201call claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive force ... in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other \u2018seizure\u2019 of a free citizen should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard....\u201d <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cAs in other Fourth Amendment contexts, however, the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 inquiry in an excessive force claim is an objective one: the question is whether the officers\u2019 actions are \u2018objectively reasonable\u2019 in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397, 109 S.Ct. at 1872 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">It is clearly established law in this circuit that in order to state a claim for excessive force in violation of the Constitution, a plaintiff must allege \u201c(1) an injury,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>which (2) resulted directly and only from the use of force that was clearly excessive to the need;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the excessiveness of which was (3) objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Spann v. Rainey, </em>987 F.2d 1110, 1115 (5th Cir.1993) (internal quotations omitted). In gauging the objective reasonableness of the force used by a law enforcement officer, we must balance the amount of force used against the need for that force. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 995, 1000-01, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992), the Supreme Court recognized that \u201c[t]he Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort \u2018repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u2019 \u201d (internal quotations omitted). In granting Deputy Vama-do\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court relied on this language and concluded that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s act could not have amounted to more than a de minimis use of force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The <em>Hudson </em>Court recognized that a constitutional violation does not occur every time an officer touches someone. In just about every conceivable situation, some amount of force or contact would be too nominal to constitute a constitutional violation. When the force used is insufficient to satisfy the legal standard necessary for recovery, the amount of force is de minimis for constitutional purposes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The amount of force that is constitutionally permissible, therefore, must be judged by the context in which that force is deployed. For example, a convicted prisoner clearly does not have a cognizable eighth amendment claim every time he or she is pushed or shoved. <em>See id. </em>at 9, 112 S.Ct. at 1000 (quoting <em>Johnson v. Glick, </em>481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2nd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1033, 94 S.Ct. 462, 38 L.Ed.2d 324 (1973)). Similarly, even in the fourth amendment context, a certain amount of force is obviously reasonable when a police officer arrests a dangerous, fleeing suspect. <em>See Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 3, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 1697, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). On the other hand, in the context of custodial interrogation, the use of nearly any amount of force may result in a constitutional violation when a suspect \u201cposes no threat to [the officers\u2019] safety or that of others, and [the suspect] does not otherwise initiate action which would indicate to a reasonably prudent police officer that the use of force is justified.\u201d <em>Ware v. Reed, </em>709 F.2d 345, 351 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Similarly, we believe that the amount of injury required to prevail in an excessive force action depends on the context in which the injury occurs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nonetheless, this circuit currently requires a plaintiff to have \u201csuffered at least some injury.\u201d <em>Jackson v. R.E. Culbertson, </em>984 F.2d 699, 700 (5th Cir.1993). As the Supreme Court has recognized, however, \u201cthe extent of injury suffered by a [plaintiff] is one factor that may suggest whether the use of force\u201d was excessive \u201cin a particular situation.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at 7, 112 S.Ct. at 999. Therefore, the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>injury necessary to satisfy our requirement of \u201csome injury\u201d and establish a constitutional violation is directly related to the amount of force that is constitutionally permissible under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">We hold that the evidence presented in this case is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Deputy Varnado used objectively unreasonable force against Laura Ik-erd in violation of her rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Deputy Varnado acknowledged that there was no need to use any physical force against Laura. Laura was not under arrest and posed no threat to anyone. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>74 F.3d 562, 566 (5th Cir.1996).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the appellants produced evidence that Deputy Varnado, a 300-pound man, violently jerked Laura, a ten-year-old child, out of her living room chair and dragged her into another room. Furthermore, the alleged force employed by Deputy Varnado resulted in Laura suffering soft tissue injury to her forearm, possible nerve damage, and post-trau-matie stress disorder. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Laura, as required under <em>Boeing, </em>we conclude that the district court erred in granting Deputy Var-nado\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-14\">. An earlier trial in this case resulted in a mistrial because of the unexcused absence of a juror. At the close of the plaintiffs' evidence in the first trial, the court dismissed several of the plaintiffs' claims pursuant to Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See </em>note 2. The dismissed claims are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-20\">. Rule 50 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-21\">If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">. Whenever a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion....</p>\n<p id=\"AZK\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b528-16\">. Kenneth Ikerd was never charged with any crime related to these allegations. On the contrary, the authorities, including Deputy Varnado, concluded that the child molestation allegations against Kenneth Ikerd were not true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">. Deputies Vamado and Stephens both testified at trial that Vamado never touched Laura\u2019s arm at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\">. The <em>Graham </em>Court noted that \"[a] \u2018seizure\u2019 triggering the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections occurs only when government actors have, \u2018by means of physical force or show of authority, ... in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879 n. 16, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). It is undisputed that a seizure occurred in the instant case when Deputy Vamado grabbed Laura Ikerd's arm. <em>See Thomas v. Frederick, </em>766 F.Supp. 540, 553-55 (W.D.La.1991) (concluding that although the police never attempted to arrest a woman, a fourth amendment seizure occurred when the police used excessive force against her).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b529-12\">.At one time, this circuit required a plaintiff to establish a \"serious injury\u201d in order to prevail in an excessive use of force action. <em>See, e.g., Johnson </em>v. <em>Morel, </em>876 F.2d 477 (5th Cir. 1989) (en banc). Proof of serious injury is no longer necessary for claims based on conduct occurring after February 1992, when the Supreme Court invalidated that requirement. <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 4, 112 S.Ct. 995, 997-98, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). <em>See also Knight v. Caldwell, </em>970 F.2d 1430, 1432 (5th Cir. 1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 926, 113 S.Ct. 1298, 122 L.Ed.2d 688 (1993) (\"The Supreme Court\u2019s decision makes clear that we can no longer require persons to prove 'significant injury' ... under section 1983\u201d); <em>Dunn v. Denk, </em>79 F.3d 401, 404 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 61, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (1996) (Barksdale, J\u201e concurring) <em>(\"Johnson v. Morel </em>controlled from early July 1989 until late February 1992, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>its significant injury prong was overruled by <em>Hudson v. McMillian \" </em>(internal citations omitted)). The alleged conduct in the instant case occurred on October 8, 1992, and is therefore controlled by <em>Hudson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\">. In <em>Dunn, </em>79 F.3d at 403, this court held that a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff can recover for \"aggravation of a preexisting injury caused by the use of excessive force.\u201d Thus, although Laura\u2019s injuries were exacerbated by the fact that her arm had previously been broken, this circumstance does not preclude her from recovering damages for any excessive force used against her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\">. In the fourth amendment context, any force exerted by a law enforcement officer that would be objectively reasonable under <em>Graham </em>would also be de minimis under <em>Hudson. </em>Similarly, any force that would be objectively unreasonable under <em>Graham </em>would not fall within the d.e min-imis language of <em>Hudson. </em>In other words, only one inquiry is required to determine whether an officer used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b530-13\">.At least one court has suggested that no physical injury is required to state an excessive force claim when a police officer holds a gun to the head of a nine-year-old child and threatens to pull the trigger. <em>See McDonald, III v. Haskins, </em>966 F.2d 292, 292-95 (7th Cir.1992). We need not address this issue because Laura Ikerd has alleged and presented evidence of physical injuries resulting from Deputy Vamado's conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\">. <em>See also McDonald, III, </em>966 F.2d at 292-95 (holding that the facts that the plaintiff was nine-years-old, was not under arrest, and posed no threat to the officers or the general community were \"the very ingredients relevant to an excessive force inquiry\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
