The jury reasonably could infer that it got into the bread during the process of manufacture, because it was imbedded in the centre or soft part, and the discoloration of the iron and the bad odor indicated that the metal was there while the dough was soft and during a period of fermentation or other chemical change. The trial judge did not apply the doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur, </em>but properly submitted the issue of negligence to the jury. We find no error in the portion of his charge that was excepted to, especially when it is considered in connection with the context. The first and seventh requests were rightly denied. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>J. G. &amp; B. S. Ferguson Co. supra. </em>The defendants were not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>to those numbered 2, 3, 6 and 8, which selected isolated facts for emphasis and comment; and the subject matter was adequately and correctly covered by the charge. <em>Altavilla </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>222 Mass. 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
