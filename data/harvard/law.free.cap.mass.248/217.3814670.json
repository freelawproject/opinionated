August 12, 1920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayj\">Miss Alice Batchelder, Cornetist,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">92 Lake Street, Melrose, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">Can you come to Chicago at once to join my act will pay you forty dollars per week and transportations want you here to rehearse couple of days we leave Tuesday and open in Minneapolis Thursday August Nineteen wire answer at once Union Hotel Chicago Ills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">Gus King \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">\u201c Boston, Mass., August 13,1920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">Gus King,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">Union Hotel, Chicago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-14\">Can you guarantee full season; transportation to Chicago, and fifty dollars a week position here equals that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-15\">Alice Batchelder \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-16\">\u201c Chicago, Ills. August 13, 1920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-17\">Miss Alice Batchelder,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-18\">92 Lake Street, Melrose, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-19\">Have good booking for the season sometime a lay off is forced on an act or two make railroad jump will pay salary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>you mentioned understand you furnish evening gown and double on also saxophone wire answer at once also time you will arrive in Chicago will refund your fare</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">Gus King \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">After receiving the telegram the plaintiff left for Chicago and was met on her arrival by King, who arranged for and superintended a rehearsal of the act. It is agreed the plaintiff commenced to work for the defendant on August 19, 1920, and so continued until February 6, 1921; and that she was paid for her services during that period. On February 6, 1921, the revue closed in New York, the reason given by King being \u201c because it could get no more booking from the Loew people for whom we worked and that week (February 6, 1921,) we knew we could get no more booking. We tried to get other booking but could not and closed it for good and it never played since.\u201d On the same point the defendant in a letter to the plaintiff dated February 17, 1921, wrote: \u201c I am very sorry that the act had to close, but it is just one of those things that we are up against in New York, as it is a mighty hard thing to please everybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Should we assume, as the plaintiff contends, that the word <em>\u201c </em>season \u201d as used in the telegrams meant a period of time commencing on or about August 15 in one year and terminating on or about May 15 of the following year, and that that was the sense in which the word was used in the telegrams, we nevertheless think the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any damages predicated upon an <em>\u201c </em>alleged breach of a written contract \u201d to employ her for the period of time determined by the definition of the word season, for the reason that the plaintiff and defendant never came to an agreement upon the length or period of time the plaintiff was to serve the defendant and the defendant was to employ the plaintiff. The first telegram makes no mention of the time to be covered by the employment. The second telegram recognizes this omission and asks \u201c Can you guarantee full season.\u201d The third and last telegram evades an answer to the question \u201c Can you guarantee full season,\u201d by the adroit reply \u201c Have good booking for the season sometime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>a lay off is forced on an act or two make railroad jump . . . wire.\u201d Instead of wiring or otherwise ascertaining whether the defendant would guarantee a full season, the plaintiff so far as the record discloses dropped the matter of an understanding as to the period to be covered by her contract and entered the service of the defendant for a time measured only by the will of the plaintiff or by that of the defendant. <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>121 Mass. 320. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>238 Mass. 138, 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
