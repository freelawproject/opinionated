She was near the middle of the subway and was proceeding toward \u201c berth 8 \u201d when she \u201c became mixed up in the crowd <em>\u2018 </em>which simply pushed and I had to go right along with the crowd.\u2019 \u201d She testified that at other times she had seen crowds at this subway \u201c similar to this crowd; \u201d that the <em>\u201c </em>crowd was very large; the people were very close together, they were just pushing and pushing; . . .\u201d Mr. Stanley testified that he was accustomed to enter this subway daily in the evening at the same hour his wife was injured. On these occasions \u201c he noticed a crowd of excited people rushing for cars; \u201d that on the night in question <em>\u201c </em>The crowd was hurrying a little more than usual . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">The evidence discloses no negligence on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>defendant. The fact that the subway station was crowded, and that the crowd was pushing and hurrying to enter the cars, is not sufficient to establish negligence. This has been decided in a number of cases. <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>214 Mass. 59. <em>MacGilvray </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>229 Mass. 65. <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>233 Mass. 347. <em>Ritchie </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>238 Mass. 473. <em>Savickas </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>239 Mass. 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">There was no evidence of violence or boisterous conduct on the part of the crowd. The case at bar is to be distinguished from <em>Kuhlen </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>193 Mass. 341, <em>Glennen </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>207 Mass. 497, <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>232 Mass. 549, <em>Franz </em>v. <em>Holyoke Street Railway, </em>239 Mass. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The defendant was not responsible for the construction of the platform, nor for the stopping of the car on a curve. See <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, supra, </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The exceptions are sustained; and in accordance with G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 122, judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
