The answer alleged that the note was without consideration; that it was for the debt of a corporation; and that it was \u201c repudiated by the defendant by written notice to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">There was evidence that the plaintiff became the superintendent of the Summit Hospital on September 1, 1917; that the defendant \u201c personally had hired her \u201d (the plaintiff) ; that she understood Mr. McEttrick \u201c managed and run the hospital; that he was the only person from whom she had ever received any instructions and of whom she inquired when she wanted information or direction; that she had never known of any board of managers or any one else having anything to do with the hospital and that no one else had ever visited it; \u201d that when she left the employment the sum of $411 was due her for wages; \u201c that when she settled up with Mr. McEttrick he paid her $11 in cash and gave her the $400 promissory note\u201d in suit; \u201cthat before he gave her this note he said that if she wanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>have him he would raise the money but that it would be a hardship to do so.\u201d The defendant testified that the plaintiff said <em>\u201c </em>the hospital owed her $400 for her services and she wished something to show that she was owed that amount of money; \u201d that thereupon he gave her the note; that on looking into the 'matter he found that the hospital was not indebted to her to the extent she claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">At the close of the evidence the judge directed a verdict for the defendant, with the stipulation that if this was error judgment should be entered for the plaintiff. The case is' before us on a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">There was evidence that the note was the personal obligation of the defendant. It was a question of fact for the jury to decide whether the defendant <em>\u201c </em>personally had hired \u201d the plaintiff, as she testified; if he did, he was responsible to her for the service rendered. From the fact that the defendant owned \u201c practically all the stock \u201d of the corporation; that he managed the hospital, and the plaintiff as superintendent never knew of a board of managers or of any one except the defendant being in control and direction of its affairs; together with the evidence that the plaintiff took <em>\u201c </em>the position of superintendent of the hospital for Mr. McEttrick \u201d and \u201c continued employment for Mr. McEttrick at his hospital \u201d and he \u201c personally had hired \u201d her, a jury could find that the plaintiff\u2019s services were performed for the defendant and that he was directly responsible to her. The note itself was <em>prima facie </em>evidence that it was issued for a valuable consideration. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 47, 48. <em>Perley </em>v. <em>Perley, </em>144 Mass. 104. The question of consideration of the note was not a question of law. It was one of fact for the jury. <em>Mercantile Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>191 Mass. 141. <em>Indiana Flooring Co. </em>v. <em>Rudnick, </em>236 Mass. 90. As there was evidence of consideration between the parties, a verdict for the defendant could not be ordered. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>9 Gray, 337. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>145 Mass. 156. See <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>158 Mass. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The case should have been submitted to the jury. It is unnecessary to consider the question of a novation, even if it should be found that the corporation was originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>liable for her services. See <em>Kirtley </em>v. <em>C. G. Galbo Co. Inc. </em>244 Mass. 179; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Grat, </em>247 Mass. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">There is nothing in the cases relied on by the defendant in conflict with what is here decided. The want of consideration was for the jury; the judge could not decide that question. There was error in ordering a verdict for the defendant. It was agreed that if this direction was error, judgment for the plaintiff should be entered in the sum of $498.40 with interest. Judgment therefore is to be entered for this sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
