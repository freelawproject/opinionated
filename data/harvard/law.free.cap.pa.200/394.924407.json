L. 440. Subsequently, said corporations having accepted the provisions of the constitution of the said commonwealth adopted December 16, 1878, and the provisions of an act entitled \u201c An act to provide for the incorporation and regulation of certain corporations,\u201d approved April 29, 1874, P.

Said corporation was, by said act of assembly approved April 18, 1856, authorized, among other things, \u201c to bring and convey into the village of Boyertown in the county of Berks a sufficient supply of fresh and pure water,\u201d and to \u201c permit individuals and companies at all times to be supplied with water from the pipes laid by them, for domestic and manufacturing purposes and for the supply of stationary and locomotive engines,\u201d at uniform rates or prices. It was further therein provided that \u201c whenever the citizens of Boyertown either by themselves or by the corporate authorities of Boyertown, should it be hereafter at any time incorporated, shall erect fire plugs, to be used solely for the extinguishment of fires, the said president and manager of the said water company shall permit the same to be connected with their pipes laid in said village and allow the inhabitants thereof to take and use water through said plugs without charge, for the extinguishment of fires, but not otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>3. At the time of the passage and approval of the said act of April 18, 1856, mining operations carried on in the vicinity of the said village of Boyertown had destroyed many of the wells from which the inhabitants obtained their supply of water and threatened the destruction of the remaining wells, and the said water company promptly and within six months from the time of its organization proceeded to bring and did bring into the said village a supply of water, as contemplated by the act of assembly under which it was organized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-4\">4. The said Boyertown Water Company expended thousands of dollars in securing water rights, in laying mains and other pipes for the distribution of the said water, and in enabling itself to comply and in complying with the requirements of its charter and in furnishing the inhabitants of the village of Boyertown with water, and from the time of the introduction of the said supply of water to the time of the incorporation of the said borough, that is, for a period of about ten years, it, the said Boyertown Water Company, permitted individuals and companies to be supplied with water from its pipes for domestic and manufacturing purposes and for stationary and locomotive engines, and permitted the inhabitants and citizens of the said village to use water from the said pipes for the extinguishment of fires, as provided by the act of assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\">5.

The supply of water furnished by said Boyertown Water Company being wholly inadequate for the wants of the borough which was increasing in population, a large number of the citizens of the said borough of Boyertown, on July 20, 1894, presented to the authorities of said borough the following petition :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u201c To the Chief Burgess and Town Council of the borough of Boyertown, Gentlemen: Whereas the water facilities in the lower section of the Borough of Boyertown, below the railroad, are inadequate and the property and lives in said section in imminent danger of fire; therefore, we the undersigned property holders and citizens of the Borough of Boyertown, having the welfare and safety of property and lives of our citizens at heart, respectfully ask your honorable body to devise such plans and adopt such means as will give protection against damage by fire, and we will ever pray,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-3\">After some delay and an unwillingness of the said Boyer-town Water Company to extend its system to the furnishing of a proper water supply for better fire protection, they were induced to do so by a contribution of- $1,900 made by said borough as hereinafter set forth.

There is nothing in the act of April 18,1856, conferring exclusive power upon the water company. A grant of exclusive privileges is not favored by the law. There is nothing in the act to show that the legislature intended any such privileges. Acceptance of the provisions of the constitution and the provisions of the act of April 29, 1874, and supplements, gave the water company no exclusive right as against the rights of the borough, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\"><em>(a) </em>The act of June 2, 1887, P. L. 810, amended the act of April 29, 1874, thereby repealing the exclusive privileges given water companies under said act: Luzerne Water Co. v. Toby Creek Water Co., 148 Pa. 568.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">(5) Said acceptance of the provisions of the constitution and said act of assembly by said water company was not made until June 22, 1898, when letters patent were issued, whereas the borough of Boyertown, under the law, had proceeded to adopt and establish a water system of its own as early as January 6, 1898, and with due diligence were proceeding with the exercise of their power to supply the municipality with water.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">The making of the agreement of April 15, 1895, was not an exercise of the power to supply the municipality with water under the provisions of the borough act of 1851. Under the act of April 18, 1856, it is provided that \u201c whenever the citizens of Boyertown either by themselves or by the corporate authorities of Boyertown, should it be hereafter at any time incorporated, shall erect fire-plugs, to be used solely for the ex-tinguishment of fires, the said water company shall permit the same to be connected with their pipes laid in said village and allow the inhabitants thereof to take and use water through said plugs without charge, for the extinguishment of fires, but not otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-8\">Plaintiffs took their charter knowing that they must, gratuitously permit the erection and attachment of fire plugs, and knowing also, that the future borough would have, under the act of 1851, the express power of providing a supply of water for the use of its inhabitants. Literally construed, it gave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the citizens, or the village authorities, or the borough, the simple right to annex and take water for the limited purpose of the extinguishment of fires regardless of whether the supply was ample or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-3\">It may be urged that if the water supply was not ample for this specific purpose, that the borough authorities might have compelled the water company to increase their supply, and that it was their duty to do so. Be this as it may, they did not perform this duty; they did not furnish a sufficient supply until the borough authorities agreed to contribute a large sum of money for this specific purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-4\">Neither the ordinance nor the agreement recognize the obligation of the company to furnish such sufficient supply. On the contrary, the agreement explicitly sets forth the unwillingness of the water company to fulfill any supposed duty in this respect unless in return for a contribution. Nor does the agreement bind the water company to furnish a sufficient supply. On the contrary, the agreement is \u201c to furnish free of charge all the water that may be necessary in case of fire, provided the company\u2019s supply is sufficient for such emergency.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">The company\u2019s theory of their original charter was the simple right of attachment regardless of quantity of supply, and the agreement made is strictly in accord with this theory. How can it be said that such an agreement permitting the taking of water for fire purposes, a right already granted under their original charter, shall be held to be a contract on the part of the borough to forfeit its right to construct its own works, and to be the execution and carrying out of its full unlimited power to provide a supply of water for the use of its inhabitants ? We agree with the counsel for the defendant that the water neededforthe extinguishment of fires is only an infinitesimal part of the water needed for the use of the inhabitants of a borough. To say, therefore, that when the borough accepts gratis the water for extinguishment of fires, it- forfeits its greater and more comprehensive power to supply water for all purposes of the inhabitants of the borough, is to say something that is altogether unreasonable and which our Supreme Court has never suggested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">The practical effect of the borough constructing waterworks of its own may impair the value of the water company\u2019s fran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>chise, but of this the company have no legal cause of complaint: Lehigh Water Company\u2019s App., 102 Pa. 515. None of tho cases cited by plaintiff seem to us to rule this case. In White v. the City of Meadville, 177 Pa. 643, overruling Howard\u2019s Appeal, 162 Pa. 374, the water company was organized upon and in pursuance of a contract with the city to supply it with water. It was held that \u201c the power having been once exercised to supply the city by contract through another creature of the same sovereign, the municipal function had passed from the city.\u201d Metzger v. Beaver Falls Borough, 178 Pa. 1, was an application of the same principle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-4\">In Wilson v. Borough of Rochester, 180 Pa. 509, the bor. ough had entered into a contract with the company and permitted it to lay its pipes. The contract obligated the supply of the borough with water for fire protection and for domestic use. Having thus contracted, the borough exhausted its power and could not subsequently erect and maintain waterworks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">The present case, however, is practically ruled by Centre Hall Water Co. v. Centre Hall Borough, 186 Pa. 74, wherein the above cases were distinguished and where it was held that the controlling principle was that \u201cin each of those cases the respective municipalities had exercised their charter right to furnish a supply of water through the agency of the several water companies with which they respectively had entered into contractual relations for that purpose.\u201d \u201cThey had been parties to the procuring of the establishment of the said water companies, and by their action encouraged the organization of the companies, and on the strength of which the companies spent large sums of money in constructing their plants, laying their pipes, etc. And the municipal corporations having thus exercised their authority once under their charters to furnish a supply of water, could not exercise it again in a different manner to the hurt or injury of the companies they were parties to.\u201d There, as here, the company was incorporated with no exclusive priviliges prior to the act of April 29, 1874, and it was held the acceptance of the provisions of the constitution and the provisions of the act of April 29, 1874, with its amendments and supplements thereto, gave it no exclusive privileges, and that the borough never having exercised its charter privileges by contract, the water company had a right to build a plant of its own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>DECREE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-3\">And now, to wit: January 27, 1900, this cause came on further to be heard, whereupon it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the bid be dismissed at the costs of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-5\"><em>Cyrus G.

Meadville, 177 Pa. 643; Lehigh Water Co.\u2019s Appeal, 102 Pa. 515; Howard\u2019s App., 162 Pa. 374 ; Metzger v. Beaver Fads, Boro. 178 Pa. 3 ; Wilson v.

We recognize the fact that it is a case of great hardship on the part of the plaintiff, and if it were possible for us to help the plaintiff we would cheerfully do so. But the plaintiff\u2019s works were not erected under a contract with the borough for establishing a supply of water to the borough, and hence no exclusive privilege can be claimed, nor can it be held that the borough had parted with its right to furnish a supply by an exhaustion of its power so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
