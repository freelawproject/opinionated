Bland, 112 Pa. 176; Parry v. Parry, 130 Pa. 94.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-8\">A deed void because of fraud operates as a total revocation of a will: Simpson v.

TJ. Sensei </em>and <em>John A. </em>Bauman, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaNT\">There is no presuznption that one dies izitestate. On the contrary, the law presumes that one dies testate; it favors testacy. The statute regulating the descent of real estate izr Pennsylvania relates only to the property of those who die without having disposed of it by will or otherwise. Before it can be taken by descent it must first appear that it has not been devised by will. The language of the act is unmistakable. \u201c The real and personal estate of a decedent, whether male or female, remaining after payment of all just debts and legal charges which shall not have been sold or disposed of by will, or otherwise limited by marriage settlement, shall be divided and enjoyed as follows,\u201d etc: Act of April 8,' 1833, P. L. 316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-10\">There was no proof that the ancestor, under whom title was claimed, had died izitestate; the admitted fact was that he had made a will, proved for more than three years, without caveat or appeal; and that will, offered by the appellants, showed that he had devised all his real estate to appellees, grantees in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>former deeds. The plaintiffs\u2019 offer of a deed to disprove their own title was properly overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-5\">A will devising real estate does not revoke a deed to the same devisees: Aubert\u2019s Appeal, 109 Pa. 447.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-6\">A will can now only be contested \u201c by caveat and action at law duly pursued,\u201d and the contestant is restricted to the proceeding before the register and an issue devisavit vel non, directed by the orphans\u2019 court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-7\">The probate of a will by the register is a judicial act which cannot be collaterally impeached in action of ejectment, brought in the right of the heir at law, to recover the real estate devised by the will: Cochran v. Young, 104 Pa. 838; Wilson v. Gaston, 92 Pa. 207.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-8\">The probate of a will devising real estate is conclusive on all persons, whether infants, feme covert, non compos mentis or not, unless contested as pointed out by statute: Warfield v. Fox, 53 Pa. 382; McCort\u2019s Appeal, 98 Pa. 33 ; McCay v. Clayton, 119 Pa. 133; Wall v. Wall, 123 Pa. 545; Broe v. Boyle, 108 Pa. 76; Shoenberger\u2019s Estate, 139 Pa. 132; Matthews v.

Cueiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">This was an action of ejectment in which the plaintiffs, failing to establish title or right of possession ,to the property they coveted, were nonsuited. On appeal to this court they filed nine assignments of error, two of which referred to the judgment of nonsuit and the remainder to offers of evidence which were rejected as irrelevant. In our examination of the assignments and the rejected offers, we have found nothing which 'would justify the setting aside of the judgment of nonsuit. We therefore dismiss the appeal and affirm the judgment aforesaid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
