F. Bay Stewart, J., specially presiding, filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-12\">The Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company have filed their petition and bond, and given notice to the supervisors and auditors of Coal township of their intention to apply to the court of quarter sessions for an order requiring the supervisors to enter into contract with it for the maintenance and repair of the public roads in the said township for the fiscal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>year, beginning March 5, 1900, under the terms of the Act'of June 12, 1898, P. L. 451. The supervisors have answered this petition alleging that under the act of assembly, approved April 28, 1899, entitled, \u201c An act to provide for the classification of the townships of the commonwealth with respect to their population into two classes, and to prescribe the form of government for townships of each class,\u201d Coal township is a township of the first class, having a population of 300 to the square mile, and that the commissioners of Northumberland county, by their proclamation, have so declared and designated it; that six commissioners are about to be elected in accordance with said act, and that the act of June 12,1893, is so far modified as no longer to be applicable to said Coal township, and denying the jurisdiction of this court to order or direct the entering into such contract for the making and maintenance of the roads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-4\">To this the petitioner replies that the act of April 28, 1899, classifying townships, is local or class legislation, and therefore unconstitutional, and that the act of June 12, 1893, is still in force. It is admitted that Coal township has a population of 300 to the square mile. This issue raises the question of the constitutionality of the act of April 28, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-5\">The 3d section of the act provides : \u201c Except so far as modified by the provisions of this act, all existing laws relating to townships shall continue in force until changed, modified, or repealed as to either class of townships by legislation expressly relating thereto.\u201d The act provides for the election of a board of five commissioners, and if the population of the townships exceed 5,000, then an additional commissioner for each 2,000 population in excess of 5,000. To this board of commissioners is delegated large legislative powers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-6\">In section 7 it is provided: \u201c All corporate power, authority and franchise of the township shall be vested in and exercised by the board of township commissioners, and the said board shall have particularly the following powers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-7\">\u201c1. To open, grade, construct and repair all public highways, in the township which shall or may be at any time laid out by lawful authority, and to keep the same in good order and repair. To construct footways along said highways, and t\u00f3 establish lights thereon when it may be deemed expedient to do so.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-8\">\u201c To accept the dedication of public highways.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Section 9 provides: \u201c It shall be the duty of the board of township commissioners to cause all public highways within the township now or hereafter laid out by lawful authority, to be effectually opened and constantly kept in repair at all seasons, and clear of all impediments to easy and convenient passing and traveling.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-4\">Section 10 provides: \u201c The board shall have the power to appoint one or more supervisors or engineers of highways, and by ordinance to specify their duties and to fix their salaries. All such officers shall hold office at the pleasure of the board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-5\">\u201c The board shall cause to be employed a sufficient number of workmen, mechanics, and laborers for the proper care of the public roads, and shall have power to purchase all necessary tools, implements, machinery and materials of all kinds which, in their judgment, shall be necessary for the making, paving and repairing of the public highways.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-6\">Section 11 provides : \u201c The board of commissioners shall have power, by their officers and servants, to enter upon any lands or enclosures, to cut, open, maintain and repair all such ditches and drains through the same, as they shall judge necessary, to carry the water from the said roads.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-7\">It will be seen by an examination of the sections recited that full power and authority to open, grade, construct, maintain and repair the public roads is vested in the board of commissioners, and they are authorized to appoint one or more supervisors or engineers of highways, to specify their duties and fix their compensation. The office of supervisor, as elected by the people, is practically abolished, and their substitutes hold their office at the pleasure of the board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-8\">In view of these radical provisions, it cannot be said that the act of June 12, 1898, and all other acts on the subject of the making and maintenance of the public roads and the election, authority and compensation of supervisors in townships of the first class, are not repealed. A method new and repugnant to the old law is provided. This is sufficient to repeal the old law: Blake v. Com., 5 W. N. C. 48; Sifred v. Com., 104 Pa. 179.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-9\">Where all the essential provisions of an act of assembly are supplied by a later act, the former will be deemed to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>repealed by implication, although there be no repealing clause: Martz\u2019s Contested Election, 110 Pa. 502.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-3\">I have no hesitation, therefore, in reaching the conclusion that if the act of April 28, 1899, be constitutional, it repeals the act of June 12, 1893, as to townships of the first class.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-4\">But is the act constitutional ? The presumption is that it is, and unless it falls within the terms local or special legislation, it is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">The constitution provides in article 3, section 7, clause 2: \u201c The general assembly shall not pass any local or special law regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs, or school districts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">This legislation does regulate the affairs of townships. Is it local or special ? It does not purport to be either, but it does not apply to all townships. It applies only to the townships belonging to a class which is to be ascertained, not by population alone, but by population according to area, that is, townships having a population of at least 300 to the square mile.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-7\">It will be seen at once that this is not classification according to population. A township may have 25,000 or 30,000 population, and not be entitled to the benefit of the act, while one having 3,000 population may. So that population is not the only requisite element, nor is it the essential one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-8\">\u201c There can be no proper classification of cities or counties except by population. The moment we resort to geographical distinction, we enter the domain of special legislation, for the reason that such classification operates upon certain cities or counties to the perpetual exclusion of all others : \u201d Patton v. Commonwealth, 88 Pa. 258. This doctrine was repeated with emphasis in reference to a substitute for the act declared unconstitutional in that case, and in which the attempt had been made to escape effect of the reasons assigned in Patton v. Commonwealth : Scowden\u2019s App., 96 Pa. 422.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-9\">The evident purpose of the act is to legislate for some particular locality, although it is shrewdly drawn in what appears to be general terms. The basis of population alone would not answer. The draughtsman of the bill had locality in his mind, and therefore the element of population had to be qualified so as to fit his locality. This was accomplished by the introduction of the square mile,\u2014population per square mile. With this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>modification introduced the law could be fitted to the contemplated locality. This is practically what was attempted in the legislation with reference to Crawford county, and which was condemned in Patton v. Com. and Scowden\u2019s App., and it is that which Chief Justice Paxson denounced as special legislation under the disguise of general law, the most vicious of all legislation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\">Whatever may be the features of a general law contained in this act, it is stamped indelibly with this cast of locality, which renders it obnoxious to the constitutional inhibition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">The preamble of the act recites : \u201c Whereas, in those more populous townships of the commonwealth which are in large measure devoted to residential purposes, there is need of a form of municipal government having greater powers than are now possessed by the local governments of townships under existing laws.\u201d And the act thereupon proceeds to classify townships for the purpose of government. But the township to which it is here attempted to be applied is not a residential one at all, but a coal mining district, populous, but not devoted to residential purposes. In the picturesque language of the counsel for the petitioners, a township of scrub oaks and culm banks; a mining township, where many of the population live most of the time under the ground. And this same condition seems to prevail in all, or nearly all, the anthracite coal mining portions of the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">Of course, the preamble is no part of the law, but it can be used to explain the motive or meaning of the legislature or identify the subject-matter of the legislation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-7\">Commonwealth v. Marshall, 69 Pa., 828. With this definition in view, it is plain that the legislature did not contemplate the application of this law to mining regions as a place devoted to residential purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-8\">It is said that necessity is the only allowable ground for classification : Ayars\u2019s App., 122 Pa. 266, and many other cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-9\">Therefore the preamble recites the necessity for this legislation. But it will occur to any lawyer in a moment that the form of municipal government having greater powers than are now possessed by the local governments of townships under existing laws may be found in our system of borough laws. This system covers practically every power delegated by this act, and is . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ample, flexible, and suited to residential territory. The method of putting a borough government in force is different, however. Under it a majority of the resident lot or landowners must petition for incorporation. If the majority do not want it, they need not have it, but under this act they are obliged to accept this \u201cmunicipal government with greater powers nolens volens whenever the population of the town equals 300 to the square mile. It may be that the real design of this act was to take out of the hands of the people the determination of the question of whether they would have a municipal government with greater powers or not, and oblige them to accept it, whether they would or no.\u201d But whatever may have been the design, it cannot he said there was any necessity for this legislation, as cited in the preamble, and if no necessity existed, then the act is unconstitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-3\">Judging by the long line of decisions, the question of the necessity for classification has become a judicial one, and the courts may declare an act unconstitutional where no such necessity exists: Ayars\u2019s Appeal, 122 Pa., 266 and cases cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\">I may say that the same conclusion was reached in the decision of the learned President Judge Woodward, of the elev-. enth judicial district</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">Being of the opinion for the reasons given, that the act approved April 28,1899, entitled \u201c An act for the classification of the townships of the commonwealth .... with respect to their population into two classes, and to prescribe the form of government for townships of each class,\u201d is unconstitutional, and that the act of June 12, 1893, under which this proceeding was begun, is still in force, the contract is directed to be executed as prayed for, and a formal order to that effect will be drawn. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the Superior Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-7\"><em>S. P. Wolverton, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aht\">No classification is warranted or legal except that which is based upon necessity: Ayars\u2019s App., 122 Pa. 266; McCarthy v. Com., 110 Pa. 243; Scowden\u2019s App., 96 Pa. 422; Randolph v. Wood, 5 Cent. Repr. 345.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-8\">There can he no proper classification of cities or counties except by <em>population; </em>the moment we resort to geographical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>distinction we enter the domain of special legislation : Com. v. Patton, 88 Pa. 260; Scowden\u2019s App., 96 Pa. 425.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-4\">There are 1,522 townships in this commonwealth, and it is safe to say that less than twenty-five are now affected by this act. It is morally certain that the method of classification operates to the perpetual exclusion of more than 1,400 townships, and yet a large number of the excluded townships are more populous than any of those included, and are more consistent in every other respect with the reasons alleged for the necessity requiring such legislation. If this be true, the classification is false.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-5\">The act of April 28, 1899, does not repeal the act of June 12, 1893: Street v. Com., 6 W. &amp; S. 209; City of Erie v. Bootz, 72 Pa. 196; Sifred v. Com., 104 Pa. 179; Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Fricke, 152 Pa. 231; Com. v.

Justice Brown,</author>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Our affirmance of the constitutionality of the act of Apjil 28, 1899, in Com. ex rel. Jones v. Blackley, 198 Pa. 372, disposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>of one of the questions raised on this appeal. In the petition for the allowance of it, one of the reasons given was, that the act had been held to be unconstitutional by a divided court. It is true we were not unanimous; but four of the six members of the court who heard the case, our Brother Dean having been absent, concurred in the opinion filed by our Brother Mitchell, and it stands as the judgment of a majority of the whole court. The other question as to the repeal of the act of J une 12,1893, by that of April 28,1899, is free from difficulty. It seems clear that the two acts are not only repugnant, but that all the essential provisions of the former are supplied by the latter. We can add nothing to what the learned judge, specially presiding below, said upon this question, and, for the reasons stated by him, our judgment is that the act has been repealed. The appeal is dismissed and the decree of the Superior Court affirmed, at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
