He charged that Jacob violated Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(1), (3), (4), (5), and (6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>action was based upon the conviction of Jacob in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland of subscribing to a false federal income tax return for the year 1975 in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We shall disbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Pursuant to Rule BV9 b we referred the matter for hearing to a judge of the Third Judicial Circuit of Maryland. He filed with us a comprehensive opinion with findings of fact and conclusions of law. He found the previously mentioned conviction in the United States District Court. The judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cThe case was submitted to the [United States District] Court in a Stipulation signed by the Respondent (Petitioner\u2019s exhibit 6). The underlying facts are that for the tax year 1975 Respondent failed to report $2,788.32 taxable income when he filed his Return on June 16, 1976. It should be noted that Respondent neglected to claim $3,002.00 in alimony allowances to which he was entitled. Therefore, his actual tax liability, it appears, would have been less than stated on the Return.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The stipulation to which the trial judge referred stated in paragraph 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cDuring the year 1975, in connection with the settlement of cases for the clients listed below, Mr. Jacob caused to be issued, in addition to checks to the clients which were deposited or otherwise utilized by the clients, additional checks which were endorsed by the clients and cashed by Mr. Jacob:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">Name Amount of Cashed Check Date of Negotiation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">Wilbert Holland $ 750.00 4/17/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVN\">Wilbert Holland 1,200.00 4/17/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A87\">Alda Nickens 1,000.00 5/08/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXj\">William Nickens 200.00 5/08/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWJ\">Gene Riddell 560.00 5/26/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUk\">Alice Myles 400.00 6/18/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab6\">Elizabeth Christian 1,000.00 7/30/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFM\">Carolyn Buchoff 3,000.00 8/18/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR9\">William Gordon 200.00 9/02/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At0\">Janet Green 300.00 9/02/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">Grafton Johnson 164.35 10/29/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANE\">Grafton Johnson 379.00 (PIP) 10/30/75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1d\">$11,153.35</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-27\">\u201cIt is conceded that the aforesaid practice was intended to, and resulted in, a reduction in the amount of legal fee income reflected on the books and records of the law firm of Jacob and Goldstein. There is no issue between the Government and Mr. Jacob as to whether the practice resulted in any detriment to clients of the firm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-28\">In his report to us the trial judge stated relative to the evidence offered in mitigation and by way of background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAE\">\u201cRespondent married Gwen Jacob in 1956 and they have an adopted son, Arthur Jacob, who is a C.P.A. and a last year law student at the University of Baltimore. They divorced in 1968 and he married Carole Belaga that same year. She has three (3) children by a previous marriage; Adam, who is now an attorney practicing in Vermont; Anne, who is studying nursing and about to graduate from the University of Maryland; Amy, who is a senior at Goucher College and who plans going on to law school. Respondent has a natural son from this marriage\u2014David, who is age 15 and resides with his mother. By all accounts Respondent has been a devoted father who supported all five children quite adequately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u201cRespondent and Carole Belaga separated in September, 1973 and were divorced in 1975. Apparently the break up of this marriage caused Respondent rather severe emotional and mental distress. Both former wives and his former mother-in-law (Mrs. Belaga\u2019s mother) testified that during this time (1973-1975) Respondent was depressed, unable to sleep without medication, shabbily and inappropriately dressed and behaved uncharacteristically.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Sheldon Kravitz, Respondent\u2019s physician of 25 years, testified that in 1974 and 1975 he noticed changes in him\u2014depression, lack of personal care, slow response. Dr. Kravitz referred him to a psychiatrist, Dr. Bernard R. Shochet, who treated Respondent for a period of time, however the Court did not receive testimony from Dr. Shochet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The trial judge quoted that portion of DR 1-102(A) which we have set forth in footnote 1 and then \u201cconclude[d] by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s conviction amounts to misconduct in that he \u2018engaged in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The trial judge addressed Jacob\u2019s mental state in his conclusion, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cRespondent contends that his mental state was the cause of the misconduct. Although this Court believes the trauma and stress of the break up of his second marriage to be a mitigating factor, this Court does not conclude that the Respondent suffered such an emotionally or mental upset or illness which was substantially and casually [sic] related to the misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Jacob first argues that his case should have been sent to an Inquiry Panel so that he would \u201chave had the opportunity for an evidentiary hearing before his peers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Rule BV6 b 1 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">\u201cAn Inquiry Panel proceeding is not required in a case where either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">\u201c(a) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">\u201c(b) The complaint is either (i) that there has been a final judgment of conviction as defined by Rule BV10 e 1 of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year; or (ii) that the attorney has been adjudged guilty of misconduct by a judicial tribunal in a disciplinary proceeding as defined by Rule BV10 e 1 and that the adjudication of misconduct has become final.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">Rule BV10 e 1 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-13\">\u201cIn a hearing of charges pursuant to this Rule, a final judgment by a judicial tribunal in another proceeding convicting an attorney of a crime shall be conclusive proof of the guilt of the attorney of that crime____ A final adjudication in a disciplinary proceeding by a judicial tribunal or a disciplinary agency appointed by or acting at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the direction- of a judicial tribunal that an attorney has been guilty of misconduct is conclusive proof of the misconduct in the hearing of charges pursuant to this Rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Jacob\u2019s conviction met the terms of Rule BV10 e 1 in that it was final. It was for a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. Hence, it met the criteria of Rule BV6 b 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. McBurney, </em>282 Md. 116, 120-21, 383 A.2d 58, 61 (1978), we reviewed the procedures under the present disciplinary rules. We then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201cIt is the \u2018complaint that an attorney has committed an act of misconduct\u2019 which is referred to the Inquiry Panel. In this instance it was a complaint that McBurney received money on behalf of his client from an insurance company and then failed to pay over to his client that which was due, having issued two checks therefor which were not honored by the bank on which they were drawn by reason of McBurney\u2019s having an insufficient amount on deposit in his account. We regard this procedure as similar to a grand jury presentment. A presentment is said by L. Hochheimer, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 84 (2d ed. 1904), to be \u2018an informal accusation of crime by a grand jury, upon which the prosecuting attorney afterwards frames a bill of indictment.\u2019 42 C.J.S. <em>Indictments and Informations </em>\u00a7 7b (1944) refers to it as being \u2018regarded, in the practice at common law and under some of the statutes, as nothing more than instructions by the grand jury to the public prosecutor for framing a bill of indictment, which, being prepared by him, is submitted to them and found a true bill.\u2019 \u201d 282 Md. at 122, 383 A.2d at 62.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In a case such as Jacob\u2019s where there has been a conviction there is no need for a preliminary finding as to whether there are facts which would be the basis of a disciplinary action. The conviction speaks for itself. The integrity of the criminal conviction cannot be attacked in a disciplinary proceeding by requesting this Court to reweigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>or to reevaluate the respondent\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>Attorney Griev. Commission v. Barnes, </em>286 Md. 474, 479, 408 A.2d 719, 722 (1979); <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Rosenberg, </em>273 Md. 351, 355, 329 A.2d 106, 108 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">We regard this contention of Jacob as without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Jacob next contends that the trial judge \u201cerred in concluding that [Jacob\u2019s] severely depressed and upset mental and emotional state during the period 1973-1975 was not substantially or causally related to his misconduct.\u201d There is no evidence that respondent\u2019s mental problems caused his misconduct. The trial judge noted \u201cthat throughout this relevant period of time Respondent represented clients competently and without complaint, notwithstanding his depression and unusual behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">It was not a single item of income which was omitted from Jacob\u2019s tax return. He engaged in a pattern of conduct similar to that before the Court in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Deutsch, </em>294 Md. 353, 450 A.2d 1265 (1982). In that case Judge Rodowsky said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">\u201cThe falsifying of those returns was admittedly intentional and could only have been for personal gain, even if each respondent\u2019s gain was \u2018minimal.\u2019 ... By signing returns which they had to know could not have included their cash income, they misrepresented their income to the taxing authorities. We do not deal here with a single episode. Rather, it is a pattern of misrepresentation.\u201d 294 Md. at 368, 450 A.2d at 1273.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The trial judge did not err in holding that the evidence did not show Jacob\u2019s mental problems were the cause of his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">We turn to the issue of sanction. We note, as claimed by Jacob and found by the trial judge, that by reason of his unclaimed alimony deduction there may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>been no tax liability on the part of Jacob in excess of that stated in his return. We point out that in <em>Deutsch </em>we indicated that \u201ceach respondent\u2019s gain was \u2018minimal.\u2019 \u201d The amount of tax liability is not the point. The conviction here was not for tax evasion but of having falsely sworn under the penalties of perjury to a tax return. In <em>Deutsch </em>we held, \u201cKnowingly to falsify a tax return by understating income is dishonest. The offense under \u00a7 7206(1) is one involving moral turpitude.\u201d 294 Md. at 366, 450 A.2d at 1271. In addition to the attorneys in <em>Deutsch, </em>we have disbarred in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Lebowitz, </em>290 Md. 499, 431 A.2d 88 (1981), and <em>Attorney Grievance v. Swerdloff, </em>279 Md. 296, 369 A.2d 75 (1977), where attorneys also understated their gross income and were convicted of violations of the same federal statute as in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balto. City v. Siegel, </em>275 Md. 521, 340 A.2d 710 (1975), Judge Digges said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANd\">\u201c[B]ecause \u2018an attorney\u2019s character <em>must remain beyond reproach,\u2019 </em>this \u2018Court has the duty, since attorneys are its officers, to insist upon the <em>maintenance </em>of the integrity of the bar and to prevent the transgressions of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute. Disciplinary proceedings have been established for this purpose, not for punishment, but rather as a catharsis for the profession and a prophylactic for the public.\u2019 \u201d 275 Md. at 528, 340 A.2d at 714 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Jacob could have had but one purpose and one purpose only in his scheme and that was to avoid a part of his tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">What Judge Digges said for the Court in <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 318 A.2d 811 (1974), continues to be relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201c[T]his Court has consistently adhered to the view, both prior to 1970 (when we reviewed disciplinary actions only on appeal at the instance of the respondent-attorney), <em>Balliet v. Balto. Co. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>[259 Md. 474, 270 A.2d 465 (1970)]; <em>Fellner v. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>[213 Md. 243, 131 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>729 (1957)]; <em>In the Matter of Lombard, </em>242 Md. 202, 218 A.2d 208 (1966); <em>In Re Williams, </em>180 Md. 689, 23 A.2d 7 (1941); and since that date (when we assumed original and complete jurisdiction over these proceedings), <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>[269 Md. 510, 307 A.2d 677 (1973)]; <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Cockrell, </em>270 Md. 686, 313 A.2d 816 (1974); <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Callanan, </em>271 Md. 554, 318 A.2d 809 (1974), that when a member of the bar is shown to be willfully dishonest for personal gain by means of fraud, deceit, cheating or like conduct, absent the most compelling extenuating circumstances, not shown to be present here, disbarment followed as a matter of course. To do other than disbar the respondent in this case, therefore, would constitute a travesty of our responsibility.\u201d 271 Md. at 553, 318 A.2d at 817.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">To similar effect <em>see Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Nothstein, </em>300 Md. 667, 687-88, 480 A.2d 807, 817-18 (1984); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Woodward, </em>299 Md. 429, 435, 474 A.2d 208, 211 (1984); <em>Attorney Griev.
