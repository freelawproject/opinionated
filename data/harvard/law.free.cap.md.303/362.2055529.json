Appellant, Milton M. Vane, was employed by H.L. Hartz &amp; Sons (Hartz) as an industrial engineer. In his deposition, appellant explained that his position entailed the regulation of production employees through the establishment of piece rates. Piece rates are incentive rates that compensate employees according to their productivity. In addition to establishing these rates, appellant instituted and applied the rates in the shops, and met with business agents of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers of America (Union) to negotiate settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Sam Nocella, Manager of the Union\u2019s Baltimore Regional Joint Board, participated in the negotiation of piece rates at Hartz. Nocella and the Union objected to these rates because they considered them unjust. Discussion between Nocella, as Union representative, and appellant\u2019s immediate supervisor allegedly led to a demand by Nocella and the Union that Hartz dismiss appellant or else run the risk of having the Union considerably increase its wage demands. In response, Hartz dismissed appellant on June 16, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Appellant filed a two count declaration in the Superior Court of Baltimore City (now Circuit Court for Baltimore City) against Nocella and the Union, alleging that they \u201cintentionally and willfully coerced the employer into terminating\u201d appellant\u2019s employment. In his declaration appellant sought both compensatory and punitive damages. In accordance with former Md. Rule 323 a 10 (now Md. Rule 2-322(b)(l)), appellees filed a Motion Raising Preliminary Objection on the basis that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit. The trial court granted this motion on October 11, 1983, ruling that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board) had exclusive jurisdiction over the action. Appellant filed an order of appeal with the Court of Special Appeals, but we granted certiorari prior to decision by that Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Federal labor law preemption is a complex and evolving body of law which this Court has had few occasions to analyze. <em>See, e.g., Memco v. Maryland Employment Security Administration, </em>280 Md. 536, 375 A.2d 1086 (1977) [hereinafter cited as <em>Memco]; Baltimore Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v. Maryland Port Authority, </em>238 Md. 232, 208 A.2d 564 (1965). In light of the significant increase in Supreme Court decisional law in this area since <em>Memco </em>and in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s refinement and modification of the basic federal labor preemption doctrine since its formulation over a quarter of a century ago in <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959) [hereinafter cited as <em>Garmon], </em>we find it useful to provide a brief overview of this doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The enactment of the NLRA in 1935 marked a fundamental change in this Nation\u2019s labor policies. Congress expressly recognized that collective organization of segments of the labor force into bargaining units capable of exercising economic power comparable to that possessed by employers could produce benefits for the entire economy. Congress determined that those benefits would eventually outweigh the occasional costs of industrial strife associated with the organization of unions and the negotiation and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements. The previous notion that union activity was a \u201cconspiracy\u201d and that strikes and picketing were examples of unreasonable restraints of trade was replaced by an unequivocal national declaration of policy establishing the legitimacy of labor unionization and encouraging collective bargaining. <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. San Diego County District Council of Carpenters, </em>436 U.S. 180, 190, 98 S.Ct. 1745, 1754, 56 L.Ed.2d 209, 221 (1978) [hereinafter cited as <em>Sears]; </em>R. Gorman, <em>Basic Text on Labor Law </em>1-6 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Through the NLRA Congress sought to protect the collective bargaining activities of employees and their representatives. To that end, Congress created a regulatory scheme to be administered by a federal agency (NLRB) that would, in Congress\u2019s view, develop experience and expertise in the labor relations area. As Justice Stevens explained in <em>Sears, </em>\u201c[t]he interest in uniform development of the new national labor policy required that matters which fell squarely within the regulatory jurisdiction of the [NLRB] be evaluated in the first instance by that agency.\u201d <em>Sears, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 191, 98 S.Ct. at 1754, 56 L.Ed.2d at 222. Thus, to achieve uniform as well as effective enforcement of the national labor policy, Congress vested the NLRB, not federal or state courts, with primary jurisdiction over activities subject to regulation by the Board. <em>Local 926, International Union of Operating Engineers v. Jones, </em>460 U.S. 669, 681, 103 S.Ct. 1453, 1461, 75 L.Ed.2d 368, 379 (1983) [hereinafter cited as <em>Jones]. </em>In this respect, the \u201canimating force\u201d behind the federal labor law preemption doctrine \u201chas been the recognition that nothing could more fully serve to defeat the purposes of the Act than to permit state and federal courts, without any limitation, to exercise jurisdiction over activities that are subject to regulation by the [NLRB].\u201d <em>Sears, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 218, 98 S.Ct. at 1768, 56 L.Ed.2d at 238 (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">This congressional scheme thus comports with the constitutional principles of preemption, which are designed to avoid conflicting regulation of conduct by various official bodies that might have some authority over the subject matter. <em>Amalgamated Association of Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, </em>403 U.S. 274, 285-86, 91 S.Ct. 1909, 1917, 29 L.Ed.2d 473, 482 (1971) [hereinafter cited as <em>Lock-ridge]. </em>Justice Jackson, writing for a unanimous Court in a 1953 decision involving the Labor Management Relations Act, succinctly articulated the rationale underlying the federal labor law preemption doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">Congress did not merely lay down a substantive rule of law to be enforced by any tribunal competent to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>law generally to the parties. It went on to confide primary interpretation and application of its rules to a specific and specially constituted tribunal and prescribed a particular procedure for investigation, complaint and notice, and hearing and decision, including judicial relief pending a final administrative order. Congress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtain uniform application of its substantive rules and to avoid these diversities and conflicts likely to result from a variety of local procedures and attitudes toward labor controversies____ A multiplicity of tribunals and a diversity of procedures are quite as apt to produce incompatible or conflicting adjudications as are different rules of substantive law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\"><em>Garner v. Teamsters Union, </em>346 U.S. 485, 490-91, 74 S.Ct. 161, 165-66, 98 L.Ed. 228, 239-40 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The doctrine of preemption in labor law has also been shaped by a competing consideration. <em>See Memco, supra, </em>280 Md. at 551, 375 A.2d at 1095. In enacting the NLRA, Congress never determined the precise extent to which state law must be displaced to achieve the unifying ends sought by the national legislature. \u201cThis has, quite frankly, left the Court with few available options.\u201d <em>Lockridge, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 289, 91 S.Ct. at 1919, 29 L.Ed.2d at 484. Consequently, a major difficulty with labor law preemption analysis is that \u201cthe aims and social policy\u201d Congress was implementing \u201cwere drawn with broad strokes while the details had to be filled in, to no small extent, by the judicial process.\u201d <em>Garmon, supra, </em>359 U.S. at 240, 79 S.Ct. at 777, 3 L.Ed.2d at 780; <em>see also New York Telephone Co. v. New York State Department of Labor, </em>440 U.S. 519, 527, 99 S.Ct. 1328, 1334, 59 L.Ed.2d 553, 561 (1979) (plurality opinion) (courts relegated task of determining \u201cthe extent to which Congress has placed implicit limits on the \u2018permissible scope of state regulation of activity touching upon labor-management relations.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Sears, supra, </em>436 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>U.S. at 187, 98 S.Ct. at 1752, 56 L.Ed.2d at 219). As the Supreme Court put in <em>Lockridge:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">The principle of pre-emption that informs our general national labor law was born of this Court\u2019s efforts, without the aid of explicit congressional guidance, to delimit state and federal judicial authority over labor disputes in order to preclude, so far as reasonably possible, conflict between the exertion of judicial and administrative power in the attainment of the multifaceted policies underlying the federal scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\"><em>Lockridge, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 286, 91 S.Ct. at 1918, 29 L.Ed.2d at 482-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Judicial experience with numerous approaches to the federal preemption issue eventually led the Supreme Court to articulate two distinct doctrines for determining whether state regulations or causes of action are preempted by the NLRA. <em>See Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. -, -, 105 S.Ct. 2380, 2394, 85 L.Ed.2d 728, 746 (1985) [hereinafter cited as <em>Metropolitan Life]) Belknap, Inc. v. Hale, </em>463 U.S. 491, 498, 103 S.Ct. 3172, 3176-77, 77 L.Ed.2d 798, 806-07 (1983); <em>see also Memco, supra, </em>280 Md. at 551-55, 375 A.2d at 1095-97. The particular preemption doctrine that is the focus of this litigation is the so-called <em>Garmon </em>rule, which had its genesis in <em>Garmon, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>At its most basic level, the <em>Garmon </em>rule provides that state and federal courts must yield exclusive jurisdiction to the NLRB whenever the conduct the state seeks to regulate is in an area subject to NLRB jurisdiction and is also either protected or arguably protected by \u00a7 7 of the Act, or is prohibited or arguably prohibited by \u00a7 8 of the Act. <em>See </em>Cox, <em>Recent Developments in Federal Labor Law Preemption, </em>41 Ohio St. L.J. 277, 277 (1980). Justice Frankfurter, writing for the <em>Garmon </em>Court, \u201cmade two statements which have come to be accepted as the general guidelines for deciphering the unexpressed intent of Congress regarding the permissible scope of state regulation of activity touching upon labor-management relations.\u201d <em>Sears, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 187, 98 S.Ct. at 1752, 56 L.Ed.2d at 219. The first statement, set forth below, relates to activity that is clearly protected or prohibited by the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFN\">When it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by \u00a7 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield. To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><em>Garmon, supra, </em>359 U.S. at 244, 79 S.Ct. at 779, 3 L.Ed.2d at 782. The second statement went on to articulate a more sweeping prophylactic rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">When an activity is <em>arguably </em>subject to \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 245, 79 S.Ct. at 780, 3 L.Ed.2d at 783 (emphasis supplied). This rule displaces state jurisdiction when the activity is actually or arguably \u201cwithin the compass of \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the Act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 246, 79 S.Ct. at 780, 3 L.Ed.2d at 784, and \u201cprotects the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB to determine in the first instance what kind of conduct is either prohibited or protected by the NLRA.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Life, supra, </em>471 U.S. at -, 105 S.Ct. at 2394, 85 L.Ed.2d at 746 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that preemption under the <em>Garmon </em>rule involves a balancing process. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at - n. 26, 105 S.Ct. at 2394 n. 26, 85 L.Ed.2d at 746 n. 26; <em>Belknap, Inc. v. Hale, supra, </em>463 U.S. at 498-99, 103 S.Ct. at 3177, 77 L.Ed.2d at 807. Specifically, a court must balance the state\u2019s interest in controlling or remedying the effects of the conduct in question against the interference with the NLRB\u2019s ability to adjudicate controversies committed to it by the NLRA, and the risk that the state will sanction the conduct that the Act protects. <em>Metropolitan Life, supra, </em>471 U.S. at -, 105 S.Ct. at 2394 n. 26, 85 L.Ed.2d at 746 n. 26. This balancing process is in concert with the Court\u2019s admonition that the <em>Garmon </em>guidelines are not to be applied \u201cin a literal, mechanical fashion.\u201d <em>Sears, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 188, 98 S.Ct. at 1753, 56 L.Ed.2d at 220 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">The same doctrinal considerations that form the basis of the <em>Garmon </em>rule have led the Supreme Court to recognize exceptions in appropriate classes of cases. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>these judicially developed exceptions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a state regulation or cause of action may be sustained if the behavior to be regulated is behavior that is of only peripheral concern to the federal law (\u201cperipheral concern\u201d exception) or touches interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, the Court could not infer that Congress had deprived the states of the power to act (\u201cdeeply rooted in local feeling\u201d exception). <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 188-89 n. 13, 98 S.Ct. at 1753 n. 13, 56 L.Ed.2d at 220 n. 13; <em>Farmer v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters, </em>430 U.S. 290, 296-97, 97 S.Ct. 1056, 1061, 51 L.Ed.2d 338, 348 (1977) [hereinafter cited as Farmer]. In accordance with these considerations, the Supreme Court has held that the NLRA does not preempt state actions for intentional infliction of emotional distress, <em>see Farmer, supra, </em>libel, <em>Linn v. United Plant Guard Workers, </em>383 U.S. 53, 86 S.Ct. 657, 15 L.Ed.2d 582 (1966), the enforcement of laws concerning violence, <em>Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., </em>355 U.S. 131, 78 S.Ct. 206, 2 L.Ed.2d 151 (1957), and obstruction of access, <em>Automobile Workers v. Russell, </em>356 U.S. 634, 78 S.Ct. 932, 2 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In 1978, the Supreme Court in <em>Sears </em>further refined the <em>Garmon </em>rule by identifying different criteria to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>sidered in determining whether a state court\u2019s jurisdiction is preempted by the NLRA. These criteria depend upon whether the activity at issue is arguably prohibited under \u00a7 8 of the NLRA or arguably protected under \u00a7 7 of that Act. Under the arguably prohibited prong of the <em>Garmon </em>rule, a court must first determine whether a significant state interest exists in protecting the citizen from the challenged conduct. Once the court makes this determination, it must then decide whether the exercise of state jurisdiction entails \u201clittle risk of interference with the regulatory jurisdiction of the Labor Board.\u201d <em>Sears, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 196, 98 S.Ct. at 1757, 56 L.Ed.2d at 225. According to the <em>Sears </em>Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">The critical inquiry, therefore, is not whether the State is enforcing a law relating specifically to labor relations or one of general application but whether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to (as in <em>Garner) </em>or different from (as in <em>Farmer) </em>that which could have been, but was not, presented to the Labor Board. For it is only in the former situation that a state court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction necessarily involves a risk of interference with the unfair labor practice jurisdiction of the Board which the arguably prohibited branch of the <em>Garmon </em>doctrine was designed to avoid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 197, 98 S.Ct. at 1757-58, 56 L.Ed.2d at 225-26 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Under the arguably protected prong of <em>Garmon, </em>the <em>Sears </em>Court adopted a different analytical framework because \u201c[considerations of federal supremacy ... are implicated to a greater extent when labor-related activity is protected than when it is prohibited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 98 S.Ct. at 1759, 56 L.Ed.2d at 227. This aspect of the <em>Garmon </em>rule is principally concerned with the danger of state interference with federally protected conduct. After noting \u201cthe relative unimportance in this context of the \u2018primary jurisdiction\u2019 rationale articulated in <em>Garmon[,]\u201d </em>the Court explained that \u201c[t]he primary-jurisdiction rationale justifies preemption only in situations in which an aggrieved party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>has a reasonable opportunity either to invoke the Board\u2019s jurisdiction himself or else to induce his adversary to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200-01, 98 S.Ct. at 1759, 56 L.Ed.2d at 227-28. To shed light onto the application of these analytical models, it is useful to review the factual circumstances in <em>Sears.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Upon determining that carpentry work in Sears\u2019s store was being done by carpenters who had not been dispatched from the union\u2019s hiring halls, the union established picket lines on Sears\u2019s property. Sears sought a preliminary injunction in state court against the continuing trespass when the union refused to remove the pickets from Sears\u2019s property. The trial court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the union from picketing on Sears\u2019s property. The Court of Appeal of California affirmed, but the State Supreme Court reversed, holding that because the picketing was both arguably protected by \u00a7 7 of the NLRA and arguably prohibited by \u00a7 8 of that Act, state jurisdiction was preempted under the <em>Garmon </em>guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The United States Supreme Court reversed. Although the union\u2019s activities were arguably prohibited under \u00a7 8 of the NLRA as having a recognitional or work reassignment objective, the <em>Sears </em>Court found that the controversy that Sears might have presented to the NLRB was not the same as the controversy presented to the state court. Had Sears filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB, the issue before that agency would have been whether the picketing had a recognitional or work reassignment objective. By contrast, in the state court Sears only challenged the location of the picketing. Because the issues were sufficiently different, the <em>Sears </em>Court held that permitting the state court to adjudicate Sears\u2019s trespass claim could create no realistic risk of interference with the NLRB\u2019s primary jurisdiction to enforce the statutory prohibition against unfair labor practices. <em>Id. </em>at 198, 98 S.Ct. at 1758, 56 L.Ed.2d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">With respect to the arguably protected prong of <em>Garmon, </em>the Supreme Court indicated that the union\u2019s activities were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>arguably protected under \u00a7 7 of the NLRA as having the objective of securing Sears\u2019s compliance with area standards. The <em>Sears </em>Court, however, found that the arguably protected character of the union\u2019s picketing did not provide a sufficient justification for preemption of the state court\u2019s jurisdiction over Sears\u2019s trespass claim when, as in <em>Sears, </em>the party who could have presented the protection issue to the NLRB had not done so and the other party to the dispute had no acceptable means of doing so. The Court went on to explain that permitting state courts to evaluate the merits of an argument that certain trespassing activity is protected does not create an unacceptable risk of interference with conduct that the NLRB, and a court reviewing the NLRB\u2019s jurisdiction, would find protected. <em>Id. </em>at 205, 98 S.Ct. at 1761, 56 L.Ed.2d at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In light of the <em>Garmon </em>rule and its multifaceted aspects, appellant advances two basic arguments in support of his contention that the trial court erred in granting the appellees\u2019 Motion Raising Preliminary Objection. First, appellant contends that he is not subject to NLRB jurisdiction because, as a managerial or supervisory employee, he is not covered by the Act. Second, in an alternative argument, appellant argues that the conduct the state is asked to regulate is neither protected nor prohibited by the NLRA so as to confer jurisdiction upon the NLRB. Our examination of the federal labor law preemption doctrine leads us to conclude that the trial court did not err in granting the appellees\u2019 Motion Raising Preliminary Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">We do not, of course, write on a clean slate in analyzing the issue presented in this case. The Supreme Court has considered on several occasions whether a common law tort action for interference with a contract of employment is preempted by the NLRA. <em>See Jones, </em>supra; <em>Iron Workers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>Union v. Perko, </em>373 U.S. 701, 83 S.Ct. 1429, 10 L.Ed.2d 646 (1963) [hereinafter cited as Perko]. In these cases the Court found that the NLRA preempted the state causes of action. Because we consider <em>Jones </em>and <em>Perko </em>dispositive of the issue presented in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we examine those cases in greater detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Perko, a member of the Iron Workers Union (Union), worked sometimes as a regular ironworker, sometimes as a foreman, and sometimes as a superintendent. While working as a superintendent on a particular project, the Union suspended his membership because he had violated a union rule. Union representatives then informed Perko\u2019s employer that because of Perko\u2019s violation Union members would no longer take orders from him. Several weeks later the employer discharged Perko because of his dispute with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Perko filed a complaint in state court against the Union and certain of its officers alleging that the defendants had tortiously interfered with his employment relations. Perko eventually secured a jury verdict of $25,000, and the Court of Appeals of Ohio affirmed. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that the case fell squarely within the preemption principles declared in <em>Garmon. Id. </em>at 705-06, 83 S.Ct. at 1431-32, 10 L.Ed.2d at 649. In so holding, the <em>Perko </em>Court assigned \u201ctwo independent and conclusive\u201d reasons. First, because Perko had been employed at various times as a regular ironworker, foreman, and superintendent, difficult problems of definition of status arose.

Specifically, the Union arguably violated \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act, because causing the discharge of a supervisor might coerce employees, who would fear being discharged, into foregoing their \u00a7 7 rights to engage in concerted action. In addition, and more important for our purposes, the Union\u2019s conduct in <em>Perko </em>might have violated \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B), which prohibits unions from restraining or coercing \u201can employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ment of grievances [.]\u201d According to the <em>Perko </em>Court, whether Perko had sufficient grievance-handling responsibilities was in any event a question for initial determination by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Twenty years after its decision in- <em>Perko, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a state court action brought by one who is a supervisor within \u00a7 2(11) of the NLRA for interference by a union with his contractual relationships with his employer is preempted by the Act. <em>See Jones, supra. </em>Factually, Jones accepted a supervisory position with the Georgia Power Company (Company) and reported to work on June 12, 1978. Jones, however, was discharged less than two weeks later. Jones thought that the bargaining agent for Local 926 of the International Union of Operating Engineers (Union) had persuaded the Company to discharge him because years earlier Jones had worked for a nonunion employer. Jones subsequently filed a charge with the Board\u2019s Regional Director against the Union on the basis of the latter\u2019s violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(b)(1)(A) and 8(b)(1)(B) of the NLRA. In particular, Jones alleged that the Union had \u201cprocured\u201d his discharge, \u201cand thereby coerced [the Company] in the selection of its supervisors and bargaining representative, because [Jones] had not been a member in good standing of said labor organization.\u201d The Regional Director would not issue a complaint, and Jones did not appeal to the General Counsel in accordance with then 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.19 (1982). Instead, Jones sued both the Union and the Company in state court, alleging that the Union had interfered with the contract between him and the Company. Specifically, Jones alleged that the business agent and representative of the Union had \u201cmaliciously and with full intent, intimidated and coerced Georgia Power Company, or caused Georgia Power Company to be intimidated and coerced, into breaching its employment contract with [Jones].\u201d The remaining count in Jones\u2019s complaint sought relief against the Company and alleged that the Company had breached its employment contract. .</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The trial court dismissed the complaint on the basis that the NLRA preempted the common law tort action insofar as the subject matter of the complaint was arguably within the NLRB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals of Georgia reversed the dismissal of the case against the Union, holding that the cause of action was not preempted by the NLRA because it fell within the exceptions to the <em>Garmon </em>rule. The Supreme Court of Georgia denied review, and the Supreme Court granted Jones\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In holding that Jones\u2019s state court action was preempted by the NLRA, the Court, referring to <em>Perko, </em>observed that \u201c[n]ot only is this case a variant of a familiar theme, but we have heard this same tune before.\u201d <em>Jones, supra, </em>460 U.S. at 677, 103 S.Ct. at 1459, 75 L.Ed.2d at 376. As in <em>Perko, </em>it was clear that the Union\u2019s conduct in <em>Jones </em>was arguably prohibited by \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B), which forbids a union to coerce an employer in the choice of his bargaining representatives. In addition, although there was some doubt whether Perko was a supervisor within the meaning of the NLRA, there was no such doubt in <em>Jones. </em>The <em>Jones </em>Court, however, carefully indicated that not every supervisor is a representative for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances for purposes of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B). Justice White, writing for the <em>Jones </em>Court, nevertheless found that Jones arguably had collective bargaining responsibilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahx\">But in this case, Jones was to occupy the position of equipment supervisor; it is enough if in this position he would be authorized or expected to deal with grievances arising under the collective-bargaining agreement, <em>American Broadcasting Cos. v. Writers Guild, </em>437 U.S. 411, 427, n. 25 [, 98 S.Ct. 2423, 2432 n. 25, 57 L.Ed.2d 313, 326 n. 25] (1978); and Jones\u2019 complaint filed with the Regional Director indicated that he would have collective-bargaining responsibilities. It is at least arguable that this was the case, and it was for the Board, not the state courts, to decide whether Jones was the kind of supervisor who could invoke \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B). We thus agree with the Union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>and the Board that the Union, if it was responsible for Jones\u2019 discharge, arguably coerced the Company in the choice of its collective-bargaining representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><em>Jones, supra, </em>460 U.S. at 679-80, 103 S.Ct. at 1460-61, 75 L.Ed.2d at 378 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The Court rejected Jones\u2019s reliance on <em>Sears </em>for the proposition that there should be no preemption because his state cause of action and the unfair labor practice charge were not sufficiently alike. Jones argued that for his state cause of action he need only show that the Union caused, either coercively or noncoercively, the employer\u2019s selection of a supervisor. By contrast, he asserted that a \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B). unfair labor practice claim is established only by proving coercion of an employer in the selection of its bargaining representative. On the basis of this reasoning, Jones concluded that the unfair labor practice charge was distinct from the state cause of action because federal law does not forbid noncoerced discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The <em>Jones </em>Court rejected this argument for several reasons. First, Jones\u2019s argument necessarily conceded that his state cause of action was preempted to the extent that it covers coercive influence on the employer. Indeed, Jones\u2019s state court complaint averred that the Union had \u201cintimidated and coerced\u201d the Company into breaching its contract with Jones. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 103 S.Ct. at 1462, 75 L.Ed.2d at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Second, the NLRB, not the state courts, should resolve in the first instance whether the Union\u2019s conduct was coercive. If coercive, the NLRB has the power to impose a sanction because of such conduct. If, however, the NLRB determines that the Union\u2019s conduct was noncoercive, the action is the proper subject of state suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Third, assuming Georgia law reaches noncoercive interference with contractual relationships, it remains that in both the unfair labor practice charge and the state cause of action the discharge must be shown to be the result of Union influence. As a result \u201cthe federal and state claims are thus the same in a fundamental respect[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>103 S.Ct. at 1462, <em>75 </em>L.Ed.2d at 380. Finally, the Court stated that the \u201cperipheral concern\u201d and \u201cdeeply rooted in local law\u201d exceptions to the federal labor law preemption doctrine did not apply in <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Our reading of <em>Perko </em>and <em>Jones </em>leads us to conclude that the NLRA preempts appellant\u2019s state cause of action. As in those two cases, it is clear in this case that the Union\u2019s conduct was arguably prohibited by \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B), which forbids a labor organization or its agents to restrain or coerce an employer in the choice of its representative for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances. Although we recognize that whether appellant had sufficient collective bargaining or grievance-handling responsibilities to bring \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) into play is a question for initial determination by the Board, <em>see Perko, supra, </em>373 U.S. at 708, 83 S.Ct. at 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d at 651, it is apparent that appellant may well have had sufficient responsibilities in these areas \u201cto come within the realm of supervisors whose selection the Union could not seek to dictate.\u201d <em>Jones, supra, </em>460 U.S. at 677, 103 S.Ct. at 1459, 75 L.Ed.2d at 377. Appellant indicated in his deposition that he was involved in negotiations with Union representatives, and Nocella stated in his affidavit that appellant in fact had collective bargaining and grievance-handling responsibilities. According to <em>Jones, </em>the criterion is not whether the plaintiff actually had these responsibilities; rather, \u201cit is enough if in this position he would be <em>authorized or expected </em>to deal with grievances arising under the collective-bargaining agreement^]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679, 103 S.Ct. at 1460, 75 L.Ed.2d at 378 (emphasis supplied). It is therefore at least arguable that the appellant would have collective bargaining responsibilities. As a result, it is for the NLRB, not for Maryland courts, to decide in the first instance whether appellant was the kind of supervisor or managerial employee who could invoke \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B). Similar to the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusions in <em>Perko </em>and <em>Jones, </em>we too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>agree with the Union that if it was responsible for appellant\u2019s discharge, it arguably coerced Hartz in the choice of the latter\u2019s collective bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Appellant seeks to distinguish <em>Jones </em>on several base's, none of which is persuasive in our view. First, appellant makes much of the fact that Jones initially filed his complaint with the NLRB, while appellant did not file a complaint with the Board but instead filed a declaration in state court. The short answer to this argument is that the Supreme Court did not view this procedural distinction as significant or controlling in <em>Jones. </em>Moreover, appellant ignores the procedural history in <em>Perko, </em>a case upon which the <em>Jones </em>Court placed heavy reliance. In <em>Perko, </em>as here, the plaintiff brought his cause of action in state court in the first instance. We therefore reject appellant\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Jones </em>on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Second, appellant asks us to distinguish <em>Jones </em>on the ground that Jones had been a union member, while appellant had never been a member of a union. The <em>Jones </em>Court placed no significance on this factual distinction, and neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Despite our refusal to distinguish <em>Jones </em>on the bases suggested above, appellant nonetheless argues that because managerial employees are exempt from the Act\u2019s coverage under <em>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974), he had no standing to file a complaint with the Board. This argument necessarily presupposes that appellant is a managerial employee, a fact that is not clearly borne out by the record. Neither does the record clearly indicate whether appellant is a supervisor. In any event, we find relevant the observation in <em>Jones </em>that \u201cthe notion that supervisors do not have a cause of action in any circumstance ... is contrary to Board cases and to <em>Perko.\u201d Jones, supra, </em>460 U.S. at 680, 103 S.Ct. at 1461, 75 L.Ed.2d at 378. Thus, on our view of the case, appellant is incorrect in asserting that he is precluded from filing a complaint with the Board. Indeed, federal labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>law regulations provide that \u201c[a] charge that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice affecting commerce may be made by <em>any </em>person.\u201d <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.9 (1984) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The controversy in this case arguably involves the \u201carguably prohibited\u201d prong of the <em>Garmon </em>rule. Under this prong the critical inquiry is whether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to or different from that which could have been, but was not, presented to the NLRB. <em>See Sears, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 197, 98 S.Ct. at 1757, 56 L.Ed.2d at 225. Under both the state cause of action and the unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) of the Act, an element that must be proved is that the discharge be shown to be the result of union influence. <em>See Jones, supra, </em>460 U.S. at 682, 103 S.Ct. at 1462, 75 L.Ed.2d at 380. It is not without interest that appellant\u2019s declaration in the state court alleged that the Union had \u201ccoerced\u201d Hartz into terminating appellant\u2019s employment. The <em>Jones </em>Court made clear that a coerced discharge and breach of contract are preempted by the NLRA. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the federal and state claims are the same in a fundamental respect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Appellant does not specifically argue that his cause of action\u2019 is of only peripheral concern to the federal labor policy, nor does he expressly contend that such action is so deeply rooted in local law that this state\u2019s interest in enforcing the law overrides the interference with the federal labor law that prosecution of the state action would entail. In light of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Perko, </em>the appellant would indeed encounter difficulty in suggesting that these exceptions apply. Consequently, appellant does not come within the ambit of these exceptions to the <em>Garmon </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Finally, appellant raises a host of arguments that are, in our view, unconvincing. First, appellant refers us to <em>Sears </em>for the proposition that \u201c[t]he primary-jurisdiction rationale justifies pre-emption only in situations in which an aggrieved party has a reasonable opportunity either to invoke the Board\u2019s jurisdiction himself or else to induce his adversary to do so.\u201d <em>Sears, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 201, 98 S.Ct. at 1759, 56 L.Ed.2d at 228. In light of this proposition, appellant argues that \u201cas a member of management, [he] had no right to invoke the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d The flaw with this argument is that the above-quoted passage is simply irrelevant to the instant case. The <em>Sears </em>Court made this statement in the context of discussing the \u201carguably protected\u201d prong of the <em>Garmon </em>rule, not the \u201carguably prohibited\u201d prong of the rule that is the focus of inquiry in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Second, for reasons that elude us, appellant contends that the Union\u2019s conduct is not of concern to the federal labor law regulatory scheme. Our response to this contention is that Congress considered such conduct to rise to the level of an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Third, <em>Garmon </em>squarely rejected appellant\u2019s argument that he should be permitted to go forward in the state court because the remedies sought (punitive damages) could not be awarded if his complaint had gone before the Board. <em>See Garmon, supra, </em>359 U.S. at 246-47, 79 S.Ct. at 780-81, 3 L.Ed.2d at 783-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We conclude that a Maryland court\u2019s jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s cause of action involves an intolerable risk of interference with the unfair labor practice jurisdiction of the NLRB. Consequently, we hold that the trial court did not err in holding that the NLRA preempts appellant\u2019s state cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-10\">. The other preemption doctrine, referred to as the Machinists preemption doctrine, <em>see Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>427 U.S. 132, 96 S.Ct. 2548, 49 L.Ed.2d 396 (1976), protects against state interference with policies implicated by the structure of the NLRA itself, by preempting state law and state causes of action concerning conduct that Congress intended to be unregulated. <em>See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. -, -, 105 S.Ct. 2380, 2394, 85 L.Ed.2d 728, 746 (1985); <em>New York Tel. Co. v.

This doctrine was designed, at least initially, to govern preemption questions that arose concerning activity that was neither arguably protected against employer interference by \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8(a)(1) of the NLRA, nor arguably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>prohibited as an unfair labor practice by \u00a7 8(b) of the Act. More recently, the Machinists preemption doctrine has been used to determine the validity of state rules of general application that affect the right to bargain or to self organization. <em>See New York Tel. Co. v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Labor, supra. </em>This doctrine involves an analysis of the structure of the federal labor law to determine whether certain conduct was meant to be unregulated, not a balancing of federal and state interests in the first instance. An appreciation of the state\u2019s interest in regulating a certain kind of conduct, however, may still be relevant in determining whether Congress in fact intended the conduct to be unregulated. <em>See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, </em>471 U.S. at- &amp; n. 27, 105 S.Ct. at 2394 &amp; n. 27, 85 L.Ed.2d at 746 &amp; n. 27.
