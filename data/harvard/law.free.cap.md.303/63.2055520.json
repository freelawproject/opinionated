Ms. Rafferty was a passenger in an automobile driven by Laura Berg and insured by State Farm; her estate sought recovery of uninsured motorists insurance proceeds from the driver\u2019s insurer and from Maureen\u2019s own insurer. The issue before us is whether, under these facts, the Insurance Code, Md.Ann.Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 543(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> bars any recovery from Allstate Insurance Company, Maureen\u2019s insurer. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The State Farm policy provided uninsured motorist coverage up to $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. After some negotiation, State Farm split the proceeds of the policy equally between Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate and the estates of the two other women killed in the collision. Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate thus collected $33,333.33 from State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">In addition, Ms. Rafferty was insured under the uninsured motorist provision of a policy issued by Allstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Insurance Company (Allstate) to her father, James Rafferty. Three automobiles were covered under this policy, and for his uninsured motorist coverage Mr. Rafferty paid a premium of $4.40 per car. In turn he received the statutory m\u00ednimums of uninsured motorist coverage\u2014$20,000 per person and $40,000 per accident. <em>See </em>Md.Ann.Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2), <em>and </em>Md. Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.), Transportation Article, \u00a7 17-103(b)(1). Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate seeks recovery under this policy, claiming that the statutory minimum of $20,000 per person applies to each car and should be added together, thereby giving her estate $60,000 uninsured motorist coverage. This $60,000 would be set off by the $33,333.33 recovered from State Farm, and Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate would then recover $26,666.67 from Allstate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate first presented this excess coverage claim to Allstate and it denied coverage. The estate then brought a declaratory judgment action against Allstate in Montgomery County Circuit Court. Judge Miller granted Allstate\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the estate appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. While the appeal was pending, the estate filed a petition for certiorari and Allstate filed a cross-petition. We granted both certiorari petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The questions raised on certiorari by Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">\u201cI. Whether \u00a7 543(a) of Title 48A of the Annotated Code of Maryland applies at all to the appellant\u2019s claim for relief insofar as \u00a7 543(a) applies only to supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>payments \u2018from more than one motor vehicle policy\u2019 and appellant\u2019s claim seeks payments from only one policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">II. Assuming that \u00a7 543(a) of Title 48A of the Annotated Code of Maryland does apply to the appellant\u2019s claim for relief, is the payment sought by plaintiff \u2018supplemental\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 543(a)?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Allstate posed a single, albeit lengthy, question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\u201cI. Does the decision of this Court in <em>Yarmuth, et al., v. Government Employees Insurance Company, </em>286 Md. 256, 407 A.2d 315 (1979), effectively overrule the decision of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Langston, et al. v. Allstate Insurance Company, </em>40 Md.App. 414, 392 A.2d 561 (1978), as to the correct interpretation of the statutory language, i.e., \u2018supplemental\u2019 and \u2018duplicative\u2019, of Section 543(a) of Article 48A of the <em>Annotated Code of Maryland, 1979 Replacement Volume, </em>and, therefore, prohibit the adding or \u2018stacking\u2019 of insurance coverage [under more than one policy of insurance] for damages arising out of the same occurrence?\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We believe the issue is more simply stated: Does \u00a7 543(a) of the Insurance Code prohibit recovery under more than one insurance policy of uninsured motorist benefits in excess of the statutory minimums. Inasmuch as we hold that it does, we need not address the issue (raised by the estate) of whether the $20,000 coverage on each car may be added together.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">We begin by reviewing the two decisions by this Court in which \u00a7 543(a) has been discussed. The first decision is <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Benton, </em>278 Md. 542, 365 A.2d 1000 (1976). In <em>Benton, </em>the insured, Ms. Benton, was a passenger who was riding in an automobile owned and operated by Henry Leland. Mr. Leland was insured by the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF). Ms. Benton claimed Personal Injury Protection (PIP) benefits from MAIF and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>received the policy limits of $2,500. <em>Id. </em>at 543-44, 365 A.2d at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Ms. Benton\u2019s medical bills were in excess of $5,000, so she sought to recover another $2,500 in PIP benefits under her own policy issued by Travelers Insurance Company. We held her recovery was barred by \u00a7 543(a). We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATF\">\u201cThe coordination of benefits provision contained in \u00a7 543(a) specifies that recovery shall be under one, but not both policies; it says in no uncertain terms that no person shall recover PIP benefits \u2018from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 365 A.2d at 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In <em>Yarmuth v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>286 Md. 256, 407 A.2d 315 (1979), we addressed two questions of law certified by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Question No. 2 directly concerned section 543(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u201c(2) Does \u00a7 543(a) of Art. 48A, Ann.Code of Md., prohibit the recovery by an insured of uninsured motorist benefits under one policy where the insured\u2019s claim admittedly exceeds $40,000 and where the insured has already recovered the sum of $40,000 under the uninsured motorist coverage of another insurance policy?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The facts of Yarmuth indicate that Albert, Elizabeth, and Jay Starr, three of the four Starr family members, were killed in a collision with a tractor trailer operated by Fred Kile, an uninsured motorist. Albert Starr, the father, had uninsured motorist benefits with Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) of up to $20,000 per person and up to $40,000 per accident, the statutory minimum. <em>Id. </em>at 258-59, 407 A.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Starr\u2019s employer owned and insured the vehicle Starr was operating at the time of the collision. The employer\u2019s insurance coverage limits were the same statutory minimum as those of Starr\u2019s GEICO policy. <em>Id. </em>The Starr family estate and the guardian of the surviving Starr family member recovered the $40,000 policy limit from Zurich Group Insurance Companies, the employer\u2019s insurer, and then attempted to recover the $40,000 policy limit from Mr. Starr\u2019s insurer, GEICO. <em>Id. </em>at 259, 407 A.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">We held there could be no recovery over and above the $40,000 recovery from Zurich. In so doing, we applied the principles of <em>Benton, </em>\u201cbecause \u00a7 543(a) expressly governs the recovery of both PIP [as in <em>Benton </em>] and uninsured motorist [as in <em>Yarmuth </em>] benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 407 A.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We noted that in <em>Benton,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201c[w]e observed that the coordination of benefits provisions contained in \u00a7 543(a) specified that recovery shall be under one, but not both policies; that the statute said in no uncertain terms that no person shall recover PIP benefits from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis____ In so concluding, we did not expressly elaborate on the meaning of the \u2018duplicative or supplemental\u2019 language contained in \u00a7 543(a). It is nevertheless clear from the opinion that we did not view \u00a7 543(a) as simply a device to prevent recovery on a second policy that would thereby result in a claim in excess of total damages.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\"><em>\u201cIn light of Benton, therefore, \u00a7 541(c) must be read to have the purpose of providing minimum protection to individuals injured by uninsured motorists. </em>But such benefits may be obtained under \u00a7 543(a) in the circumstances here involved only through the primary policy. In prohibiting recovery of uninsured motorist benefits from more than one policy or insurer on a duplicative or supplemental basis, \u2018duplicative\u2019 means payment in full twice or more for the same claim. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>term \u2018supplemental\u2019 is, we think, more encompassing, and refers to attempts to fill the deficiencies in the uninsured motorist coverage of the primary policy by claiming under a second policy. <em>Under either term, after a claim for policy limits has been paid under the primary policy, recovery under a second policy is prohibited.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u201c____ The interpretation of \u00a7 543(a), as urged by appellants, would result in an unwarranted judicial enactment of an amount of uninsured motorist coverage that is greater than the minimum statutory limits as specified by the General Assembly. This would give a victim of an uninsured motorist greater insurance protection than would be available if he had been injured by an insured motorist having only the minimum required liability insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264-65, 407 A.2d at 319 [footnote omitted] [emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\"><em>Yarmuth </em>holds that \u00a7 543(a) precludes recovery of proceeds from more than one policy when the amount of total recovery exceeds the statutory m\u00ednimums. In other words, when the insured has recovered from the primary insurer an amount equal to or greater than the statutory minimum, he cannot look to the secondary insurer for any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">This holding comports with the General Assembly\u2019s primary purpose in enacting uninsured motorists benefits: that is, \u201cto assure financial compensation to the innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents who are unable to recover from financially irresponsible uninsured motorists.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 157, 416 A.2d 734, 737 (1980). Moreover, it furthers the specific legislative goal in enacting section 543(a), in that it avoids any duplication of uninsured or PIP benefits. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r of Maryland, </em>283 Md. 663, 675, 392 A.2d 1114 (1978). We believe that allowing recovery under the second policy in excess of the statutory minimum would be the type of \u201cunwarranted judicial enactment\u201d we sought to avoid in <em>Yarmuth. See also Parsons v. Erie Ins. Group, </em>569 F.Supp. 572, 581 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>(D.Md.1983) (Under \u00a7 543, combined coverage shall be no greater than the minimum coverage required by statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">In this instance, Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate has recovered $33,333.33 from the primary insurer. This recovery exceeds the statutory minimum of $20,000. Assuming, <em>ar</em>guendo, that Mr. Rafferty was entitled to the $60,000 coverage which he claims as his due, if we allowed the estate to recover under the policy we would be giving the estate greater protection than if Ms. Rafferty had been hit by an insured motorist whose coverage was merely the minimum required by statute. <em>Yarmuth, supra, </em>286 Md. at 265, 407 A.2d at 319. While we comprehend the estate\u2019s theory that it is entitled to $60,000 coverage because Mr. Rafferty paid premiums for $20,000 coverage on each of his three cars, we believe \u00a7 543(a) requires us to hold that when more than one insurance policy is at issue, as is clearly the case here, recovery must be limited to the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate attempts to distinguish <em>Benton </em>and <em>Yarmuth </em>based on the fact that in both appeals the amount of insurance provided by the primary and the secondary insurer were the same. In this appeal, they contend, the coverage amounts are not equal; the primary coverage amounted to $33,333.33, while the secondary coverage is $60,000.00. Inasmuch as we read <em>Yarmuth </em>to hold that only the statutory m\u00ednimums need be met in order to preclude coverage under more than one policy, the estate\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The estate contends that \u00a7 543(a) is \u201cnot a <em>per se </em>prohibition against recoveries under more than one policy.\u201d With this we agree, but we believe the instances in which more than one policy may be utilized are limited to those in which the primary insurer\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage is less than the statutory minimum. For example, given the facts of this appeal, had the primary insured been from out of state and purchased coverage for less than the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>statutory m\u00ednimums, then Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate could have recovered from Allstate up to the $20,000 minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Finally, Allstate\u2019s petition for certiorari requested that we specifically overrule <em>Langston v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>40 Md.App. 414, 392 A.2d 561 (1978), as to the correct interpretation of the statutory language of \u00a7 543(a), <em>i.e., </em>recovery on a \u201csupplemental\u201d and \u201cduplicative\u201d basis. We need not address this, as in <em>Yarmuth, </em>in footnote 3, we expressed our \u201cdisagreement with a contrary construction placed upon \u00a7 543(a) in dicta by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Langston v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>...\u201d <em>Yarmuth, supra, </em>286 Md. at 265 n. 3, 407 A.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We hold that \u00a7 543(a) prohibits recovery of uninsured motorist benefits in excess of the statutory m\u00ednimums from more than one insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-11\">. \u201c(a) <em>Recovery where more than one </em>policy.\u2014Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, no person shall recover benefits under the coverages required in \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541 of this article from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\">.
