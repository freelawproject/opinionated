In late 1982, a Prince George\u2019s County laundromat was broken into, and certain property was stolen, damaged, or de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>stroyed. Shortly thereafter, police apprehended the sixteen year old appellant, Herbert B., along with two other juveniles. On March 21, 1983, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, sitting as a juvenile court, conducted an adjudicatory hearing. The court at this hearing found that appellant had been involved in \u201cstorehouse breaking, $5 or upward,\u201d petty theft, and destruction of private property. That court ordered the Juvenile Services Administration to conduct an investigation, imposed court costs, and directed that a restitution hearing be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">On April 20, 1983, less than a month after the adjudicatory hearing, a restitution hearing was held before a master who, in her report and recommendation, assessed restitution at $228.50. Later that same day, the circuit court conducted a disposition hearing, at which time the court determined that appellant was not in need of treatment or guidance, and therefore was not a delinquent child despite his commission of a delinquent act. The court, however, directed that appellant and his mother pay $228.50 restitution to the proprietor of the laundromat.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, appellant raised the issue of whether a court could enter a judgment of restitution and impose court costs after the case has been dismissed. The intermediate appellate court discussed the matter of restitution but made no mention of the court costs aspect of appellant\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court held that the criteria for the entry of a judgment of restitution are a finding that the child committed a delinquent act and that the property of another was stolen, damaged, or destroyed. Because appellant met these criteria, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the decision of the lower court. <em>In re Herbert B., </em>58 Md.App. 24, 472 A.2d 95 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">To place the issue in this case in proper perspective, a brief overview of the three types of hearings (adjudicatory, disposition, and restitution) here involved is necessary. An adjudicatory hearing is \u201ca hearing to determine whether the allegations in the petition, other than allegations that the child requires the court\u2019s assistance, treatment, guidance or rehabilitation, are true.\u201d Md.Code (1984 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-801(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article [hereinafter cited as one Courts Article]. As may be gleaned from this definition, the primary purpose of this particular hearing is to ascertain the merits of the allegations in the petition. <em>See, e.g., In re Ernest J., </em>52 Md.App. 56, 60, 447 A.2d 97, 100 (1982); <em>In re Roberts, </em>13 Md.App. 644, 649, 284 A.2d 621, 624 (1971) (quoting <em>In re Wooten, </em>13 Md.App. 521, 526, 284 A.2d 32, 34 (1971)). Stated differently, an adjudicatory hearing is held to determine whether the child<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> committed the \u201cdelinquent act\u201d alleged in the petition. A delinquent act, as defined in \u00a7 3-801(k), is \u201can act which would be a crime if committed by an adult.\u201d Finally, \u00a7 3-819 sets forth the various burdens of proof in an adjudicatory hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>If the court at the adjudicatory hearing determines that the child committed the delinquent act alleged in the petition, a separate disposition hearing must be conducted unless all parties waive their right to that hearing in writing. Courts Article \u00a7 3-820(a);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>see Parojinog v. State, </em>282 Md. 256, 261, 384 A.2d 86, 88 (1978); <em>In re Dan D., </em>57 Md.App. 522, 528, 470 A.2d 1318, 1321 (1984). Section 3-801(n) defines a disposition hearing as \u201ca hearing to determine: (1) [wjhether a child needs or requires the court\u2019s assistance, guidance, treatment or rehabilitation; and if so (2) [t]he nature of the assistance, guidance, treatment or rehabilitation.\u201d In turn, \u00a7 3-801(0 defines \u201cdelinquent child\u201d as \u201ca child who has committed a delinquent act and requires guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u201d A fair reading of these statutes indicates that a child can be classified as a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d only after the court at the adjudicatory hearing finds that the child has committed a delinquent act and the court at the disposition hearing determines that the child is in need of the court\u2019s assistance, guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation. <em>See In re Ernest J., supra, 52 </em>Md.App. at 61, 447 A.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">A third proceeding, a restitution hearing, is required under \u00a7 3-829(a) where the victim seeks restitution against the parent of a child or the child. Section 3-829(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac6\">(a) The court may enter a judgment of restitution against the parent of a child, or the child in any case in which the court finds a child has committed a delinquent act and during the commission of that delinquent act has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adn\">(1) Stolen, damaged, or destroyed the property of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>(2) Inflicted personal injury on another requiring the injured person to incur medical, dental, hospital, or funeral expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Although this hearing is distinct in function and purpose from the adjudicatory and disposition hearings, it may be held \u201cas part of\u201d or \u201ccontemporaneously with\u201d either the adjudicatory or disposition hearing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-829(e); Md. Rule 918 a; <em>see In re Dan D., supra, </em>57 Md.App. at 528, 470 A.2d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">With this brief overview in mind, we turn to appellant\u2019s argument. Appellant contends that the court at the disposition hearing erred in entering a judgment of restitution after it had dismissed the matter. In support of this contention, appellant directs our attention to the following comments made by the court at the disposition hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adq\">[THE COURT]: Okay. Well, very frankly, after reviewing the report [of the Juvenile Services Administration], it seems to me that he really doesn\u2019t need any particular care and treatment. The court is going to find as a fact that he does not need care and treatment. <em>Therefore, the matter will stand dismissed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">And now there is a minor problem here in that restitution was ordered in the amount of $228.50, which I note from [the] face of the order he wants to appeal. If I dismiss the case I am not even sure that the court has jurisdiction to order restitution. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASF9\">After a brief exchange among the court, the State, and appellant\u2019s counsel, the court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">I think the court will reiterate what I said before. I will find as a fact he is not in need of care and treatment, and the matter will be dismissed. However, at the same time, there is a restitution order here in the amount of $228.50 recommended by the master.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">Was there any question about the dollar amount? MRS. BAGARIA [Appellant\u2019s counsel]: No, your Honor, that was an agreement of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The record indicates that the court then signed a restitution order in the amount of $228.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Unfortunately, the court used the word \u201cdismiss.\u201d Appellant urges us to interpret this word as if the court were concluding the proceeding and thereby dismissing the petition. As we see it, this is not the context in which the court used the word \u201cdismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">It had already been decided at the adjudicatory hearing that the child had committed the delinquent acts alleged in the petition. The court had ordered a hearing to determine if the child and his parent should be required to make restitution. Obviously, the court at the disposition hearing felt the need to determine for the record whether the child was delinquent and thereby required further supervision by the court or the Juvenile Services Administration. The court flatly decided that the child was not delinquent, and then declared that \u201cthe matter will stand dismissed.\u201d In our view, this \u201cdismissal\u201d was an indication for the record and the parties that the child was not delinquent, and hence that issue was resolved (dismissed). Thus, the court in no sense was acting upon the petition itself, but only determining the fundamental issue involved in a disposition hearing. The court made that much clear when it reiterated that \u201cI will find as a fact [appellant] is not in need of care and treatment, and the matter will be dismissed.\u201d We therefore reject appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Despite our analysis of what the court meant in its colloquy with the parties, appellant maintains that the court at the disposition hearing had to find him a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d before it could enter a judgment of restitution under \u00a7 3-829(a) of the Courts Article. In our view, the plain language of this statute provides a clear answer to this question. Section 3-829(a) establishes two unambiguous criteria for the entry of a judgment of restitution. First, the court must find that the child has committed the \u201cdelinquent act\u201d alleged in the petition. Second, the court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>also find that during the commission of the delinquent act the child has stolen, damaged, or destroyed the property of the victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Once the court makes both findings, it can proceed to enter a judgment of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The structure and purposes of the Juvenile Causes subtitle likewise support the view that \u00a7 3-829(a) does not require that a child be adjudicated a. delinquent child as a predicate for ordering restitution. As an initial matter, \u00a7 3-829(e) states that a restitution hearing may be held as part of an adjudicatory or disposition hearing for the child. As noted previously, the court at an adjudicatory hearing does not sit to determine whether a child is a delinquent child; rather, this determination is made by the court at a disposition hearing. Manifestly, because Maryland law authorizes the entry of a judgment of restitution at an adjudicatory hearing, there is no statutory requirement that a child be adjudicated a delinquent child as a predicate for ordering restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Moreover, a stated purpose of the Juvenile Causes subtitle is to provide for a program of rehabilitation consistent with the child\u2019s best interests and the protection of the public interest. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-802(a)(l). Section 3\u2014820(b) reinforces this purpose by mandating that \u201c[t]he priorities in making a disposition are the public safety and a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation best suited to the physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child consistent with the public interest.\u201d In concert with this legislative purpose, restitution is rehabilitative in several important respects. For example, restitution impresses upon the child the gravity of harm he has inflicted upon another, and provides an opportunity for him to make amends. In addition, restitution makes the child accountable for his acts by leading him to realize the seriousness of such acts and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>accept responsibility for them. Finally, an obvious purpose of restitution is that it compensates the victim for the child\u2019s delinquent act. <em>See Charles S. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, </em>32 Cal.3d 741, 653 P.2d 648, 187 Cal.Rptr. 144 (1982) (discussing purposes of restitution in juvenile cases). Properly viewed, restitution is beneficial to both the child and to his victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Here, the court at the adjudicatory hearing found that appellant had committed a \u201cdelinquent act\u201d as that phrase is defined in \u00a7 3-801(k). Later, at the disposition hearing, the court found that appellant was not a delinquent child. Nevertheless, because appellant was found to have committed a delinquent act and during the commission of that delinquent act had stolen, damaged, or destroyed the property of another, the court properly ordered restitution. We therefore agree with the Court of Special Appeals in this case that the court at the disposition hearing did not err in ordering the appellant and his mother to make restitution to the proprietor of the laundromat for the damage that had been done. <em>See In re Herbert B., supra, </em>58 Md.App. at 30, 472 A.2d at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\">. The reason, it seems to us, is obvious. Not only were the court costs imposed at the adjudicatory hearing, but they were paid by appellant prior to the disposition hearing. The issue of court costs was not an issue to be resolved but had been settled without objection before the April 20, 1983 disposition hearing. We therefore do not address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\">.
