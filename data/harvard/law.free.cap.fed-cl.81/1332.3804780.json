United States, 73 </em>Fed.Cl. 780 (2006). Because we hold that USA Choice\u2019s incoming-only phone lines meet the definition of \u201clocal telephone service,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252(a), and because none of the lines at issue fall within the \u201cprivate communication service\u201d exception, \u00a7 4252(d), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">USA Choice is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that provides \u201cdial-up\u201d Internet access to residential and business customers in Pennsylvania. <em>See generally Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Brand X Internet Servs., </em>545 U.S. 967, 974-75, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (contrasting \u201cdial-up\u201d Internet access with \u201cbroadband\u201d service, and noting that \u201c[t]he traditional means by which consumers in the United States access the network of interconnected computers that make up the Internet is through \u2018dial-up\u2019 connections provided over local telephone facilities. Using these connections, consumers access the Internet by making calls with computer modems through the telephone wires owned by local phone companies\u201d (internal citations omitted)). USA Choice provided network access servers equipped with modems at several locations throughout Pennsylvania known as Points of Presence (POPs).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">During the relevant time period, customers would connect to USA Choice\u2019s servers by using computer modems to dial a local telephone number or \u201caccess number\u201d associated with one of these POPs. One of the network server modems would answer this incoming call and establish a connection between the computers; this connection required telephonic quality to successfully facilitate communication. USA <em>Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 783. Subsequent to establishing a telephonic quality connection between a USA Choice network server modem at the POP and a dial-up customer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>computer modem, the following communication took place: USA Choice\u2019s server requested a username and password; the response was compared to USA Choice\u2019s records; and if the user could be confirmed, USA Choice provided a connection to the Internet through its network. Upon several failed authentication attempts, however, USA Choice\u2019s modem would instead disconnect the call. <em>Id. </em>Because neither USA Choice nor the telephone companies blocked incoming calls from subscribers who were not USA Choice\u2019s customers, anyone could dial one of the ISP access numbers and connect at least briefly to one of USA Choice\u2019s POPs. If the caller used a regular telephone instead of a modem, however, he or she might hear a set of electronically-generated beeps before being disconnected. <em>Id. </em>This accessibility allowed USA Choice\u2019s customers to connect to its servers from any telephone number, provided they used valid usernames and passwords.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Dial-up customers connect to the local telephone company, known as a local exchange carrier (LEC), through a standard analog phone line known as \u201cPOTS,\u201d an acronym for \u201cPlain Old Telephone Service.\u201d By comparison, USA Choice\u2019s POPs connected to the LECs via dedicated circuits consisting of a group of digital communications channels purchased by USA Choice from telephone companies including ALLTEL, Sprint, Verizon, and Verizon\u2019s predecessor entities GTE and Bell Atlantic. <em>Id. </em>at 781. The majority of these digital lines were generally known as Primary Rate Interface (PRI or PRA) circuits. These lines could carry 28 simultaneous communications, which could all be associated with a single local telephone number. <em>Id. </em>at 784. Other services purchased by USA Choice included Digital Channel Services (DCS) and Basic Rate Interface (BRI or BRA) circuits. <em>Id. </em>at 786-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">At issue in this case are excise taxes levied on these lines connecting USA Choice\u2019s POPs to the local telephone companies. <em>Id. </em>at 782-83. Section 4251(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a three percent excise tax on \u201ccommunications services,\u201d which include \u201clocal telephone service.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4251(b)(1)(A). Section 4252(a) defines \u201clocal telephone service\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201caccess to a local telephone system, and the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone or radio telephone stations constituting a part of such local telephone system.\u201d \u00a7 4252(a)(1). \u201cLocal telephone service\u201d excludes \u201ctoll telephone service\u201d and \u201cprivate communication service,\u201d which are defined in subsections (b) and (d) respectively. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4252(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">USA Choice filed a refund request with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on May 24, 2002. After the IRS disallowed this request, USA Choice filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims on May 5, 2005. USA Choice argued that the services at issue fall outside the scope of \u00a7 4251(a)(1) because incoming-only lines do not meet the definition of \u201clocal telephone service\u201d in \u00a7 4252(a)(1), and, alternatively, because they meet the \u201cprivate communication services\u201d exclusion from taxation as defined in \u00a7 4252(d). It also presented argument pertaining to excise taxes on long distance service not relevant to this appeal. The Court of Federal Claims held a trial in July 2006 and also considered post-trial briefing and argument. The Court of Federal Claims ultimately issued an opinion granting USA Choice the majority of the refund it desired, holding that USA Choice\u2019s incoming-only lines were not \u201clocal telephone service\u201d under \u00a7 4252(a)(1) and that nearly all of the remaining contested lines met the \u201cprivate communication service\u201d exception of \u00a7 4252(d). <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 802. The govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>ment timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ava-dedup-0\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">\u201cIn reviewing a final decision of the Court of Federal Claims after a trial, we review legal conclusions de novo, and we review factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard. A finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Am. Pelagic Fishing Co. v. United States, </em>379 F.3d 1363, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2004) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cStatutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo.\u201d <em>Wesleyan Co. v. Harvey, </em>454 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2006). Additionally, \u201c[t]he proper application of the tax laws to an undisputed set of operative facts is a question of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. v. United States, </em>210 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">1. Local Telephone Service</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">The Court of Federal Claims held that those lines that were incoming-only\u2014 i.e., lines that did not permit outbound calls\u2014did not meet the definition of local telephone service and thus were taxed improperly. <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 795. Not all of USA Choice\u2019s fines were found to be truly incoming-only, however, and these other fines were analyzed under the \u201cprivate communication service\u201d provision, discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">On appeal, the government argues that the statutory text does not preclude treatment of incoming-only lines as local telephone service and that the self-imposed restrictions placed by USA Choice on communications over these fines were irrelevant to its \u201cprivilege\u201d to use the underlying service, which is subject to the excise tax. The government also urges us to defer to various IRS Revenue Rulings under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). USA Choice argues that the Revenue Rulings do not bind us and responds to the government by asserting that its incoming-only lines could not provide it with \u201caccess to a local telephone system,\u201d nor the privilege of \u201ccommunication with\u201d substantially all other subscribers, because it could not affirmatively initiate calls. It further contends that because it disconnected calls from subscribers without modems and from persons who are not customers, it did not communicate with \u201csubstantially all\u201d subscribers in the local system.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">a. Access to a Local Telephone System</p>\n<p id=\"AVB\">The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-12\">(a) Local telephone service.\u2014For purposes of this subchapter, the term \u201clocal telephone service\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-13\">(1) the access to a local telephone system, and the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone or radio telephone stations constituting a part of such local telephone system, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-14\">(2) any facility or service provided in connection with a service described in paragraph (1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-15\">The term \u201clocal telephone service\u201d does not include any service which is a \u201ctoll telephone service\u201d or a \u201cprivate communication service\u201d as defined in subsections (b) and (d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252(a). \u201cIn construing a statute, we begin with its literal text, giving it its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Hawkins v. United States, </em>469 F.3d 993, 1000 (Fed.Cir.2006). We begin with the requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>that local telephone service provide \u201caccess to a local telephone system.\u201d \u00a7 4252(a)(1). The Court of Federal Claims found this \u201caccess\u201d prong unhelpful and thus did not rely on it. <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 791-92. It found that dictionary definitions of \u201caccess\u201d could be read in multiple ways and that our prior decision in <em>Trans-Lux Corp. v. United States, </em>696 F.2d 963 (Fed.Cir.1982) (interpreting \u201caccess\u201d in the context of teletypewriter exchange service, which is also subject to the communications excise tax and is defined in section 4252(c)), did not address the \u201cdirectionality of messages.\u201d <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">On appeal, USA Choice argues that this prong presents an alternative ground for affirmance. It argues, as it did to the Court of Federal Claims, that \u201caccess\u201d connotes the right to enter, and that because USA Choice can only passively receive incoming calls, it cannot \u201caffirmatively enter\u201d the local telephone system. USA Choice also relies on our observation in <em>Trans-Lux </em>that a particular device providing access to the Telex network allowed subscribers to \u201cdirect-dial any other network subscriber.\u201d 696 F.2d at 964. The government responds that another common definition of \u201caccess\u201d is \u201cthe ability to obtain or make use of.\u201d It also asserts that <em>Trans-Lux </em>stands for the opposite proposition by citing the following discussion of the technological meaning of the word access in that opinion: \u201cFrom the weight of the credible evidence, the trial judge determined that the word <em>access </em>was recognized in the communications field in general, and with respect to the Telex network in particular, <em>as meaning the interface or connection </em>between the Telex network\u2019s transmission lines (and the central exchange) and the [customer terminal].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 965 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">We agree that general dictionary definitions of \u201caccess\u201d provide little insight. Definitions contemporaneous with the introduction of this statutory language include restrictive language implying a right to enter as well as broad language merely requiring the ability to make use of something. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>11 (1961) (defining \u201caccess\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cpermission, liberty, or ability to enter, approach, communicate with, or pass to and from,\u201d \u201cfreedom or ability to obtain or make use of,\u201d and \u201ca way by which a thing or place may be approached or reached\u201d). Our decision in <em>Trans-Lux, </em>however, which involved a very similar and related subsection of the same statute, informs that the \u201ctechnological meaning of the word access ... in the communications field in general ... mean[s] the interface or connection between ... the central exchange and the [customer terminal].\u201d 696 F.2d at 965. Because this provision is so closely related to the definition at issue, and because the language of this prong is so similar, <em>compare </em>\u00a7 4252(a)(1) (\u201cthe access to a local telephone system\u201d), with \u00a7 4252(c) (\u201cthe access from a teletypewriter or other data station to the teletypewriter exchange system\u201d), we find this interpretation of \u201caccess\u201d persuasive in concluding that \u201caccess\u201d simply means connectivity. <em>See Finnegan v. Leu, </em>456 U.S. 431, 438 n. 9, 102 S.Ct. 1867, 72 L.Ed.2d 239 (1982) (\u201cCertainly one would expect that if Congress had intended identical language to have substantially different meanings in different sections of the same enactment it would have manifested its intention in some concrete fashion.\u201d). We recognize that the <em>Trans-Lux </em>opinion ultimately addressed a different legal issue, but this broad recognition of general industry understanding likely indicates that the \u201cdirectionality of messages\u201d bears no relation to the term \u201caccess\u201d in the statute. We turn then to the second prong of the statutory definition of local telephone service.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>b. The Privilege of Telephonic Quality Communication</p>\n<p id=\"aon-dedup-0\">The Court of Federal Claims held that USA Choice did not enjoy \u201cthe privilege of telephonic quality <em>communication with </em>substantially all persons having ... telephone stations constituting a part of such local telephone system,\u201d \u00a7 4252(a)(1) (emphasis added), on its incoming-only lines because it could not choose to initiate communications with whomever it chose to call, <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 795, and because \u201cwith\u201d does not encompass \u201csingle-direction communications,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 792.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government devotes the majority of its appeal to arguing that this language is consistent with incoming-only service and that the Court of Federal Claims erred by holding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">USA Choice argues that Congress must have intended \u201cwith\u201d to require the ability to communicate \u201cto and from\u201d other telephone subscribers based on the contrasting statutory language used in an adjacent subsection. Specifically, the definition of \u201ctoll telephone service,\u201d requires \u201cthe privilege of an unlimited number of telephonic <em>communications to or from </em>all or a substantial portion of the persons having ... telephone stations in a specified area which is outside the local telephone system area.\u201d \u00a7 4252(b)(2) (emphasis added). USA Choice contends that without the ability to initiate calls, it did not enjoy the \u201cprivilege of communicating with\u201d other local subscribers, and that construing this language to encompass incoming-only lines would impermissibly import the allegedly broader language of subsection (b)(2). <em>See O\u2019Neill v. Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>220 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2000) (\u201cIn light of Congress\u2019 choice of different language in subsections of the same statute, it would be inappropriate to construe the narrower language that Congress chose for the prohibition as if it were equivalent to the broader language that Congress chose for the exemptions.\u201d). It further argues that Congress must have intended to impose these directional restrictions in the statute because subsection (b)(2) was amended specifically to include Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS), which at the time could only be used to make outbound calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The Court of Federal Claims agreed with USA Choice and held that while \u201c[t]he words \u2018to or from\u2019 capture single-direction communications ... the word \u201cwith\u2019 connotes reciprocity.\u201d <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 792 (citing Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 1026 (1970) (indicating that \u201cwith\u201d is \u201cused as a functional word to indicate one to whom a usu[ally] reciprocal communication is made\u201d (alteration in original))). Even if we accept this conclusion, however, it does little to resolve the underlying dispute. After all, most telephone calls, including communications negotiated by computer modems, involve reciprocal communication once a connection has been established. For example, \u201cI spoke <em>with </em>Jane on the phone\u201d does not indicate who initiated the conversation. As another Court of Federal Claims decision dealing with nearly identical facts correctly observed, interpreting this statute \u201crequires [us] to recognize that \u2018inward dialing\u2019 and \u2018one-way communication\u2019 are not synonymous phrases; that ... once a call was initiated, two-way communication occurred over lines that supported telephonic quality communication.\u201d <em>Comcation, Inc. v. United States, </em>78 Fed.Cl. 61, 72 (2007). While the \u201caccess\u201d prong of the statute is focused on connectivity, the \u201ccommunication with\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>prong refers to what happens after that connection is established. The issue therefore is whether two-way communication existed on USA Choice\u2019s incoming-only lines after a call was initiated. Here, even the authentication process demonstrates that two-way communication occurred during connections to USA Choice\u2019s network servers because a server communicated requests for usernames and passwords, which were communicated back to the server by the subscribers who dialed the access number.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Nor does Congress\u2019 use of different prepositions in subsection (b)(2) compel the narrow reading of subsection (a)(1) advanced by USA Choice. A more natural reading of the statute indicates that this distinction likely relates to grammatical\u2014 rather than substantive\u2014context. Subsection (a)(1) refers to \u201ccommunication [singular] with\u201d in the abstract, while subsection (b)(2) is framed in terms of \u201can unlimited number of ... [individual] communications [plural] to or from.\u201d Even accepting USA Choice\u2019s argument, however, would not compel a different result. Because the privilege of \u201ccommunication with\u201d another party requires only the possibility of two-way communication after a call is initiated, as discussed above, the distinction USA Choice reads into the use of \u201ccommunication with\u201d instead of \u201ccommunications to or from\u201d is irrelevant to the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">A review of the legislative history behind this language further supports our conclusion that Congress did not intend for local telephone service to turn on the ability to make outbound calls. Congress first levied excise taxes on telephone services as part of the Spanish War Act of 1898, and since that time has updated, modified, repealed, and extended the communications excise tax numerous times. <em>See generally OfficeMax, Inc. v. United States, </em>428 F.3d 583, 585-86 (6th Cir.2005). The language at issue in this case originates in Congress\u2019 1965 amendment to sections 4251 and 4252 as part of the Excise Tax Reduction Act of 1965, Pub.L. No. 89-44, \u00a7 302, 79 Stat. 136,145^16 (1965), which created the \u201clocal telephone service\u201d category as a successor to the \u201cgeneral telephone service\u201d category defined in 1958 as part of the Excise Tax Technical Changes Act of 1958, Pub.L. No. 85-859, \u00a7 133, 72 Stat. 1275, 1289-90 (1958). <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 89-324 (1965), <em>as reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1690, 1725 (\u201cThe definition[] of local telephone service (previously general telephone service) ... ha[s] been updated and modified to make it clear that it is the service as such which is being taxed and not merely the equipment being supplied.\u201d); H.R. Rep. 89-433 (1965), <em>as reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1645, 1676 (same). As we observed in <em>Trans-Lux, </em>one of the primary motivations for this amendment was the creation of the \u201cprivate communication services\u201d exemption. <em>See </em>696 F.2d at 967. Another motivation was the aforementioned desire to shift the focus of the tax to the services rather than the equipment being provided. Additionally, as observed in <em>Comcation, </em>the definition of general telephone service was redesignated \u201clocal telephone service,\u201d and the definition of \u201ctoll telephone service\u201d was updated to clarify that WATS was included in toll telephone service and excluded from local telephone service. 78 Fed.Cl. at 71-72 (and cites therein). USA Choice argues that this change indicates a desire to exclude services that could be initiated only by one party from the \u201clocal telephone service\u201d category.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">First, there is no indication that the pre-1965 definition of \u201cgeneral telephone service\u201d was in any way related to the ability to make outgoing calls. Prior to 1965, section 4252 defined \u201cgeneral telephone service\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>any ... telephone service furnished in connection with any ... telephone station which may be connected (directly or indirectly) to an exchange operated by a person engaged in the business of furnishing communication service, if by means of such connection communication may be established with any other ... telephone station.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252(a) (1964). The legislative history surrounding the creation of this previous language indicates that the ability to originate calls was not essential. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 85-2090 (1958), <em>as reprinted in </em>1958 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4395, 4440 (\u201cIf the existing facilities may be so connected [as described in section 4252(a) ], it is immaterial that the practice of the subscriber is not to make such connections, or that the person engaged in the business of furnishing communication service denies permission to the subscriber to make such connections\u201d). Because the definition of local telephone service was designed to track the earlier definition of \u201cgeneral telephone service\u201d with the exceptions noted, and because the services purchased by USA Choice are neither WATS nor private communication services as discussed <em>infra, </em>we see no reason to infer that Congress meant to impose other new limitations on local telephone service related to call initiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Second, although USA Choice argues that the amendment of the toll telephone service definition to include WATS indicates an intent to remove any incoming-only or outgoing-only lines from the definition of local telephone service, we find no support for this argument. The House and Senate Reports clarify that WATS is included in toll telephone service, but their description of this service notably excludes any mention of restrictions on incoming or outgoing calls. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 89-324 (1965), <em>as reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1690,1725 (\u201cThis is a long-distance service whereby, for a flat charge, the subscriber is entitled to make unlimited calls within a defined area (sometimes limited as to the maximum number of hours).\u201d); H.R. Rep. 89-433 (1965), <em>as reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1645, 1677 (same). These reports also discuss local telephone service without even mentioning the allegedly critical \u201ccommunication with substantially all persons\u201d language. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 89-324 (1965), <em>as reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1690, 1725 (\u201c[I]n the case of local telephone service, the definition makes it clear that it is the right of access to a local telephone system and the privilege of telephonic quality communication which is taxed together with facilities or services provided with this service.\u201d); H.R. Rep. 89-433 (1965), <em>as reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1645, 1676-77 (same). Moreover, the inclusion of \u201cwith\u201d in the 1965 amendments cannot be accorded any significance as it relates to the prior statutory text because the replaced text similarly recited <em>\u201ccommunication </em>may be established with any other ... telephone station.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252 (1964) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the more logical reading of the statutes and legislative histories indicates that the purpose of the 1965 amendments with respect to WATS related to the flat-rate long distance characteristics of the service rather than to any limitations related to directionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">As previously mentioned, the Court of Federal Claims also held that USA Choice did not enjoy the privilege of communication with \u201csubstantially all persons having ... telephone stations,\u201d because its POP servers could only \u201ccommunicate\u201d with subscribers who used a modem. <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 793-94. The Court of Federal Claims further held that even if substantially all of the relevant subscribers used modems to call USA Choice, there would be no \u201ccommunication\u201d with non-customers before they were disconnected by USA Choice\u2019s servers because \u201c[t]he transmission of the identification request is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>so limited that it cannot be considered to be a \u2018telephonic quality communication\u2019 in the ordinary sense of those words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 794-95. USA Choice presents several arguments defending these determinations, while the government responds that USA Choice\u2019s position improperly focuses on actual use instead of the \u201cprivilege\u201d of use specified in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">USA Choice\u2019s arguments ignore evidence that these use restrictions relate solely to USA Choice\u2019s own self-imposed limitations. USA Choice\u2019s decision to connect these lines to modems in its network servers rather than to telephones through equipment \u201csuch as a multiplexor or PBX,\u201d see <em>id. </em>at 794 n. 24, \u201cthough perfectly understandable for a commercial ISP\u2014 resulted in self-imposed limits that did not fundamentally alter the nature of the services that [USA Choice] had the \u2018privilege\u2019 to use,\u201d <em>Comcation, </em>78 Fed.Cl. at 65. USA Choice\u2019s configuration decision no more limited the underlying service\u2019s capabilities than would a subscriber\u2019s choice to connect a facsimile machine rather than a telephone set to his or her telephone line.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, as the Court of Federal Claims found in this case, a successful connection between one of USA Choice\u2019s server modems and another subscriber\u2019s modem required telephonic quality. <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 783. This telephonic quality connection was established even where authentication ultimately failed and USA Choice consequently disconnected the call. <em>Id. </em>at 795 n. 26. As with its choice to utilize modems, USA Choice cannot alter the inherent capabilities of the communication services it purchased merely by establishing a system for disconnecting calls with subscribers other than its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">It is undisputed that \u201cprivilege\u201d implicates either a \u201cright\u201d or \u201clegal freedom\u201d rather than actual use. <em>See id. </em>at 792; <em>see also Comcation, </em>78 Fed.Cl. at 65 (\u201cNothing about the word \u2018privilege\u2019 connotes that the service purchased must actually be used by the taxpayer in the fashion covered by the excise tax.\u201d). The Court of Federal Claims noted that \u201cUSA Choice agrees \u2018that it is a line\u2019s actual capabilities, not its use, that govern ... taxability.\u201d <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 795 (quoting USA Choice\u2019s post-trial reply brief) (alteration in original); <em>see also Comdata Network, Inc. v. United States, </em>21 Cl.Ct. 128, 131 (1990) (holding that the toll telephone tax applied because the plaintiff had \u201cthe right to utilize the telephone lines to communicate [in accordance with \u00a7 4252(b)(2) ]. That the service may not, in fact, be so used by plaintiff is irrelevant to the existence of the privilege\u201d); <em>accord </em>Rev. Rul. 79-245,1979-2 C.B. 380 (\u201cWhere a telephone service provides the subscriber the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all other subscribers to the local telephone system, it is immaterial whether the subscriber exercises the privilege.\u201d). This focus on the nature of the service comports with the legislative history of the Excise Tax Reduction Act of 1965, which indicates that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>def\u00ednition[ ] of local telephone service ... ha[s] been updated and modified to make it clear that it is the service as such which is being taxed and not merely the equipment being supplied.\u201d S. Rep. 89-324 (1965), <em>as reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1690, 1725. Here, it is undisputed that <em>anyone </em>could call USA Choice\u2019s access numbers and at least briefly connect, and that it was USA Choice\u2019s decision to implement modems and to enforce user logins to trigger disconnects that precluded further reciprocal communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that neither the inability to place outgoing calls, nor the choice to communicate using computer modems, nor the password authentication scheme employed by USA Choice excludes the communication services it purchased from the definition of \u201clocal telephone service\u201d subject to the communications excise tax of section 4251(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We note that our holding does not conflict with revenue rulings in which the IRS has held incoming-only lines subject to the communications excise tax. <em>See, e.g., </em>Rev. Rui. 77-196, 1977-1 C.B. 343 (\u201cIn defining taxable local telephone service, section 4252(a)(1) makes no distinction between systems that provide access to a local telephone network only by receiving calls and systems that both receive and originate calls.... Accordingly, the fact that ... [the system at issue] can only receive incoming calls from a local telephone system is not material to the tax determination.\u201d (citing Rev. Rui. 75-102,1975-1 C.B. 351)). Thus, we need not address the extent of deference\u2014if any\u2014properly accorded to these rulings. <em>See generally W. Co. of N. Am. v. United States, </em>323 F.3d 1024, 1032 (Fed.Cir.2003) (noting that \u201crevenue rulings merely represent the position of the United States and do not bind this court,\u201d but that we \u201cmay refer to ... revenue rulings for guidance and accept that reasoning in whole or in part to assist [our] understanding of the language of the revenue code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Nor do our interpretations of the \u201caccess\u201d and \u201ccommunication with\u201d prongs render either prong of section 4252(a)(1) superfluous or redundant. <em>See, e.g., Walters v. Metro. Educ. Enters., Inc., </em>519 U.S. 202, 209, 117 S.Ct. 660, 136 L.Ed.2d 644 (1997) (\u201cStatutes must be interpreted, if possible, to give each word some operative effect.\u201d). The words \u201caccess\u201d and \u201ccommunication\u201d must be viewed within the context of the statute. <em>See, e.g., Davis v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>489 U.S. 803, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989) (\u201cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d). The second prong is not rendered superfluous because the \u201ccommunication\u201d prong requires \u201ctelephonic quality,\u201d whereas the \u201caccess\u201d prong only requires connectivity. Nor is the connectivity connoted by \u201caccess\u201d encompassed within the \u201ccommunication\u201d requirement of the second prong. The statute requires \u201caccess <em>to a local telephone system\u201d </em>and \u201ctelephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having ... telephone stations constituting a part <em>of such local telephone system.\u201d </em>\u00a7 4252(a)(1) (emphases added). We need look no further than the next subsection of the statute to find an example of services providing \u201ccommunication with\u201d subscribers to a local telephone system but not \u201caccess\u201d to that local system. Section 4252(b) explicitly provides that toll telephone service \u201centitles the subscriber ... to the privilege of an unlimited number of telephonic communications to or from all or a substantial portion of the persons having ... telephone stations in a specified area which is outside the local telephone system area in which the station <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>provided with this service is located.\u201d \u00a7 4252(b)(2). Thus, toll telephone service provides \u201ccommunication with\u201d members of a local telephone system despite not having direct access to that local system. As another example, in the recent <em>Vonage </em>case, we described how \u201c[s]ince 2002 Vonage has provided telephone service to its subscribers through Voice over IP (VoIP\u2019) technology----Vonage\u2019s system uses the internet to transmit telephone signals, rather than using the traditional public switched telephone network (\u2018PSTN\u2019). When Vonage subscribers place calls to non-subscribers on the PSTN, Vonage\u2019s system transmits the signals through the internet, and then relays them to the PSTN.\u201d <em>Verizon Servs. Corp. v. Vonage Holdings Corp., </em>503 F.3d 1295, 1298 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Although toll telephone services and VoIP technology can be said to indirectly access at least the local telephone network of the recipient, arguments that this qualifies as \u201caccess\u201d under section 4252(a)(1) have been consistently rejected by other courts. For example, in <em>OfficeMax, </em>\u201cthe government argue[d] that OfficeMax\u2019s plan must be a service provided in connection with a local telephone service because all long-distance services eventually require access to local telephone systems.\u201d 428 F.3d at 599-600. The court rejected this argument and held that \u201cthe definition of local-telephone service requires \u2018access to a\u2019 local telephone system, not \u2018access to every\u2019 local telephone system included within the boundaries of a long-distance plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600; <em>accord Reese Bros., Inc. v. United States, </em>447 F.3d 229, 241 (3d Cir.2006); <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Group v. United States, </em>408 F.3d 1328, 1338 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Am. Online, Inc. v. United States, </em>64 Fed.Cl. 571, 582-83 (2005). Thus, in at least some circumstances, one can have \u201cthe privilege of telephonic quality communication with\u201d persons in various local telephone systems without having \u201caccess\u201d to those systems under the statute. Accordingly, this prong of the definition retains independent meaning under our interpretation of \u201caccess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Finally, we are mindful of the principle that \u201cif doubt exists as to the construction of a taxing statute, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.\u201d <em>Xerox Corp. v. United States, </em>41 F.3d 647, 658 (Fed.Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Hassett v. Welch, </em>303 U.S. 303, 314, 58 S.Ct. 559, 82 L.Ed. 858 (1938)). However, this is not such a case. \u201cHere doubts which may arise upon a cursory examination of [the statutory provisions at issue] disappear when they are read, as they must be, with every other material part of the statute, and in the light of their legislative history.\u201d <em>White v. United States, </em>305 U.S. 281, 292, 59 S.Ct. 179, 83 L.Ed. 172 (1938) (internal citation omitted); <em>see also Irwin v. Gavit, </em>268 U.S. 161, 168, 45 S.Ct. 475, 69 L.Ed. 897 (1925) (noting that although \u201cthe tax laws should be construed favorably for the taxpayers ... that is not a reason for creating a doubt or for exaggerating one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">2. Private Communication Service</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Having concluded that USA Choice\u2019s lines provided \u201clocal telephone service,\u201d we must now turn to the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 decision that even the \u201clocal telephone service\u201d lines were nonetheless exempt from the communications excise tax of \u00a7 4251(a)(1) because they met the requirements of a \u201cprivate communication service.\u201d <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 798. Section 4252(d)(1) defines \u201cprivate communication service\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-12\">(1) the communication service furnished to a subscriber which entitles the subscriber\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-13\">(A) to exclusive or priority use of any communication channel or groups of channels, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>regardless of whether such channel, groups of channels, or intercommunication system may be connected through switching with a service described in subsection (a) [local telephone service], (b), or (c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">The statute also requires that \u201ca separate charge is made for such service.\u201d \u00a7 4252(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The Court of Federal Claims\u2019 analysis and the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal focus on the statutory requirement that a private communication service must \u201centitle [USA Choice] to exclusive or priority use of any communication channel or groups of channels.\u201d \u00a7 4252(d)(1)(A). The parties debate the similarity between the \u201cprivate communication service\u201d defined in the statute and industry definitions related to \u201cprivate lines.\u201d USA Choice also argues that the statutory language clearly contemplates private communication systems connected to a local telephone exchange, that it did not have to share its lines to the local exchange\u2014i.e., those hnes only allowed calls to or from USA Choice\u2019s POPs, and that the legislative history indicates Congressional intent supporting a broad interpretation of this provision. The government\u2019s principal argument is that while an exempted private communication service may be connected with an LEC, the exemption does not extend to the very fines making that connection. Additionally, the government again contends that we should defer to IRS Revenue Rulings and makes various arguments based on the legislative history and a prior private communication service exemption. We conclude that the Court of Federal Claims erred in applying the private communication service exemption to the lines at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The most significant shortcoming in the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 analysis is that it failed to recognize that USA Choice\u2019s fines did not serve to provide a distinct <em>\u201ccommunication service </em>... regardless of whether [that service] may be connected through switching with a [local telephone service].\u201d \u00a7 4252(d)(1) (emphasis added). This statutory language requires that the system at issue provide a \u201ccommunication service\u201d beyond that of mere local telephone service, not just connectivity to the local telephone system <em>itself. </em>Dedicated fines that, alone or in combination with other privately owned or publicly shared equipment, do no more than furnish a subscriber with the ability to obtain local telephone service do not constitute the statutorily defined \u201cprivate communication service\u201d entitled to the exemption of \u00a7 4252(d)(1). As contrasted with typical private fines, PBX systems, Centrex systems, and answering service switchboard systems in existence at the time this statutory provision was enacted, all of which could be characterized as having communication channels that facilitated communications services beyond mere local telephone service, the lines at issue in this case served <em>only </em>to provide connectivity to the LEC and not to facilitate or provide any \u201ccommunication service\u201d that can be fairly characterized as \u201cprivate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">The legislative history further supports our conclusion. The recommendations from the President accompanying the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>posed legislation leading to the enactment of the language at issue stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avp\">the tax on local and long-distance telephone service ... will no longer apply to amounts paid for private communications systems even where the private system is linked with the general telephone network. This service is almost exclusively a business cost item and competes with nontaxable business communication services. <em>Charges for service on the general telephone network originating or terminating in the private system would be taxable </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE21\">Recommendations Relative to Excise and Fuel Taxes, H.R. Doc. No. 173, at 5 (1965) (emphasis added). Nothing in the subsequent legislative history indicates any disagreement by Congress with this recommendation, and the relevant language proposed in this document was substantively identical to the text as enacted. <em>See id. </em>at 16 (defining \u201cprivate communication service\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe communication service furnished to a subscriber ... which entitles the subscriber to exclusive or priority use of any communication channel or groups of channels (regardless of whether such channel or groups of channels may be connected through switching with a [local telephone service] for which a separate charge is paid)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">More generally, \u201cCongress enacted the private communication services exemption in order to correct the imbalance that had developed between telephone company-furnished services and subscriber-owned equipment,\u201d and in response to \u201ctelephone companies ... losing business to companies that provided ... equipment that could be purchased and operated by the users themselves.\u201d <em>Trans-Lux, </em>696 F.2d at 967. This equipment comprised either \u201cexclusive or priority use of any communication channel or groups of channels,\u201d \u00a7 4252(d)(1)(A), or an \u201cintercommunication system,\u201d \u00a7 4252(d)(1)(B), but clearly excluded any connection to the LEC for the provision of local telephone service. Connection to the LEC was provided exclusively by the local telephone company in 1965. The local telephone company faced no competitive disadvantage as to connectivity with subscribers, and there was no competitive imbalance in that regard that cried out for legislative eoiTection. Thus, while Congress clearly intended to remove \u201ca severe handicap to the expanded use of ... new and varied services,\u201d S.Rep. No. 89-324 (1965), as <em>reprinted </em>in 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1690, 1726, it chose to do so <em>only </em>by removing \u201cthe tax on private communication systems,\u201d <em>id., </em>not by exempting <em>any </em>new or varied telecommunication service that might be connected to the local telephone system\u2014by dedicated lines or otherwise\u2014from taxation. Accordingly, such services may qualify as \u201cprivate communication services\u201d only if they meet the explicit definition provided in the statute. <em>See, e.g., Luben Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>707 F.2d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201cThe general rule for construing tax statutes is that any doubt in the application of the statute is to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. However, where the taxpayer attempts to bring itself within a tax exemption, as Luben is attempting to do in this case [involving contested federal excise taxes], doubt is to be resolved in favor of the Government.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">USA Choice contended before the Court of Federal Claims and argues again on appeal that notwithstanding the fact that its lines served only to provide connections to the local telephone system, the \u201c \u2018specially configured\u2019 high-speed digital circuits\u201d it chose to purchase necessarily provided the \u201cexclusive or priority use\u201d required by \u00a7 4252(d)(1)(A). Appellee Br. 56-57 (arguing that \u201cUSA Choice purchased dedicated line capacity for its sole use ... [and that] no other telephone sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>scriber could use USA Choice\u2019s dedicated lines to establish a circuit terminating somewhere else\u201d (emphasis omitted)). The Court of Federal Claims agreed, noting that \u201c[t]hese were not lines where multiple telephone subscribers would share the same loop on an equal basis. USA Choice was not required to yield to anyone in its use of these communication channels.\u201d <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 800 (internal citation omitted). We disagree. While these statements may accurately describe aspects of USA Choice\u2019s dedicated multi-channel connections to the LEC, the fact remains that anyone else on the PSTN was free to dial USA Choice\u2019s access numbers and necessarily made use of USA Choice\u2019s dedicated lines to connect with its POPs. \u201cUSA Choice concedes ... that <em>anyone, </em>whether in the local calling area or not, can \u2018call\u2019 the [access numbers] and USA Choice\u2019s modem bank will \u2018answer\u2019 the call.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Post-Trial Br. 21 (emphasis added). The fact that USA Choice did not have to share its digital connections to the LEC with other local subscribers did not entitle USA Choice to exclusivity or priority over the competing use of its communication channels by anyone dialing USA Choice\u2019s access numbers, even if USA Choice\u2019s lines were deemed a separate \u201ccommunication service\u201d under the statute\u2014a conclusion with which we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">USA Choice\u2019s lines fail not only the statutory requirement of \u201cexclusive or priority use,\u201d but also the statute\u2019s definition of private communication service as \u201cthe communication service furnished to <em>a subscriber </em>which entitles <em>the subscriber </em>... to exclusive or priority use.\u201d \u00a7 4252(d)(1) (emphases added). The Court of Federal Claims held that because the dial-up customers used USA Choice\u2019s lines only \u201cby dint of their relationship with USA Choice,\u201d the statutory requirement was met. <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 801. We disagree. Under the reasoning of the Court of Federal Claims, <em>any </em>business telephone line could be considered a private communication service if the subscriber chooses to use it exclusively to communicate with its customers. Closer questions may involve the use of lines connecting multiple offices or locations of a single subscriber through an LEC, <em>see generally Comcation, </em>78 Fed.Cl. at 75, but we are not faced with that situation today. Here we consider lines that USA Choice admits provided access to its network servers from <em>any </em>telephone number, <em>see </em>Ap-pellee Br. 9, and which we have held permitted at least limited communication with <em>any </em>subscriber. Accordingly, these lines fail to meet the statutory definition of \u201cprivate communication service\u201d even if we were to assume that \u201cthe subscriber\u201d constructively included USA Choice\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The Court of Federal Claims further erred in accepting USA Choice\u2019s argument that \u201cby terminating a call when a caller fails to properly authenticate that he or she is a USA Choice customer, USA Choice demonstrates its priority of use.\u201d <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 800. Under this definition, <em>any </em>line could be construed as providing priority use. USA Choice\u2019s termination of calls upon failed authentication attempts does not meaningfully differ from the choice of any telephone subscriber to \u201chang up\u201d upon receiving an unwanted call. Because we must focus on the inherent capabilities of the services provided to USA Choice as discussed <em>supra, </em>which indisputably allowed anyone to dial the telephone numbers associated with USA Choice\u2019s POPs and thus communicate with USA Choice\u2019s network servers through the local telephone system, USA Choice\u2019s unilateral decision to terminate calls received from non-customers cannot establish its \u201cexclusive or priority use\u201d of these services.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">In light of this analysis, we need not address arguments related to \u201cprivate lines\u201d or prior tax exemptions, neither of which we find particularly helpful. Finally, we note that\u2014as with our \u201clocal telephone service\u201d analysis\u2014our conclusions present no conflicts with the revenue ruling relied upon by the government. <em>See </em>Rev. Rui. 78-487, 1978-2 C.B. 266 (holding that where a communication system meeting the definition of section 4252(d), \u201cin addition to providing private communication between each of the stations in the system, also provides direct access from each station to local telephone service,\u201d the \u201ccharge for the lines that give access to the local telephone service ... is not within the exemption provided by section 4252(d) of the Code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">We therefore hold that the communication services purchased by USA Choice do not meet the statutory definition of a \u201cprivate communication service\u201d and for that reason are not exempt from the communications excise tax of section 4251(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">For the above reasons, we conclude that the Court of Federal Claims erred in holding that USA Choice\u2019s incoming-only lines were not subject to the communications excise tax as local telephone service and in holding that USA Choice\u2019s lines were exempt as private communication services, and thus its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-5\">. The Court of Federal Claims also held that USA Choice\u2019s use of computer modems and password authentication limited its ability to communicate with other subscribers, <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 793-95, which we discuss infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-6\">. The Court of Federal Claims observed that if USA Choice wished to use its lines for voice communications, its \"channel or circuit would also have to be configured by the provider to allow use of\" voice-capable equipment. <em>USA Choice, </em>73 Fed.Cl. at 794 &amp; n. 24. However, in this case, uncontradicted testimony offered by the government indicates that such provision of equipment by USA Choice would be the only configuration necessary. <em>See id. </em>This conclusion is further supported by the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 finding that in order for USA Choice\u2019s modems to function, \"[tjelephonic quality\u201d\u2014i.e., \"a communication channel over which it [i]s possible to have a two-way conversation with the use of telephones\u201d\u2014\"is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 783 &amp; n. 7 (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">Regardless, USA Choice bore the burden to show that its lines were not appropriately configured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b887-6\">. The Court of Federal Claims held that USA Choice\u2019s non-incoming-only services met the statutory exception for private communication services with the exception of specific Verizon and Sprint services, which failed the \"separate charge\u201d requirement. USA Choice has not appealed the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 determination regarding these services. An affirmance of this ruling would require a remand for a determination of whether the various incoming-only services met this requirement as well. Because we reverse, however, no such inquiry is necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b890-10\">DYK, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AREx\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">I join the majority opinion with the exception of Part II.B.2.b. For the reasons stated by the majority, the services at issue constitute \u201clocal telephone service\u201d within the definition of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252(a)(1). They are not within the \u201cprivate communication service\u201d exemption of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252(d) because they do not meet the basic requirement of providing a distinct \u201ccommunication service\u201d in addition to local telephone service. However, the majority alternatively holds that the \u201cprivate communication service\u201d exemption does not apply here because USA Choice does not have \u201cexclusive or priority use\u201d of its lines as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252(d)(1)(A). I respectfully disagree with this alternative holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">In reaching this alternative holding, the majority properly rejects the reasoning of the Court of Federal Claims that USA Choice\u2019s customers are \u201csubscribers\u201d within the language of the statute. USA Choice\u2019s customers may subscribe to the internet services offered by USA Choice, but they do not \u201csubscribe\u201d to the relevant telephone company services at issue in this case. The only subscriber is USA Choice itself. However, USA Choice, as the subscriber, does have \u201cexclusive or priority use\u201d of its lines. In my view, USA Choice has \u201cexclusive use\u201d of its lines, because the lines cannot be used to direct calls to any other party. When a caller dials one of the telephone numbers associated with USA Choice\u2019s POPs, the call is routed at the central office over the dedicated circuits and to the POPs. Any call routed onto these circuits can only reach USA Choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">The majority suggests that USA Choice does not enjoy exclusive or priority use of those lines because \u201canyone else on the [Public Switched Telephone Network] was free to dial USA Choice\u2019s access numbers and necessarily made use of USA Choice\u2019s dedicated lines to connect with its POPs.\u201d Maj. Op. at 1346. I disagree. The statute focuses on the <em>subscriber\u2019s </em>entitlement, and here the subscriber is the only party who can be reached by a call routed over the lines at issue. PBX service, the very service for which the exemption was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>signed, similarly can enable the general public to reach the subscriber. A PBX system connected to the local exchange allows anyone to call in to and access the telephone stations within the system. Thus the exemption cannot be denied <em>on </em>the basis that the subscriber\u2019s use is not exclusive or priority use where the general public can use the lines to reach the subscriber.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">While I believe that the \u201cexclusive or priority use\u201d requirement was satisfied, I nonetheless agree that the majority reaches the correct result in holding the exemption unavailable. In my view, the exemption is unavailable for the reasons stated in Part II.B.2.a of the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
