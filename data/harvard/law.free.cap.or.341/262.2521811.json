PGE contends, among other things, that the circuit court lacks jurisdiction to hear the actions because the cases necessarily involve rate-setting, a function that the legislature has delegated exclusively to the Oregon Public Utility Commission (the PUC). Although we reject PGE\u2019s contention that the actions must be dismissed, we conclude that they should be abated, at least until the PUC responds to certain remands from the Marion County Circuit Court in related cases, because the PUC\u2019s disposition of those remanded cases may negate some of or all the damages that plaintiffs now claim. We issue a writ of mandamus accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The actions arose out of a longstanding controversy over one of PGE\u2019s former generating facilities, the Trojan nuclear power plant. When Trojan first went into service in 1976, the PUC set PGE\u2019s rates in a way that allowed it to recover its investment in Trojan over a 35-year period. However, the plant was plagued with technical problems and breakdowns, and PGE finally closed it in 1993 \u2014 long before PGE had recouped its investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">By the time that Trojan was shut down, the legislature had enacted a statute that allowed utilities to charge rates that included their \u201cundepreciated investment\u201d in a retired plant \u2014 if the PUC found the closure to be in the public interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> PGE sought to take advantage of that provision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>therefore argued to the PUC that closing Trojan (and replacing it with power purchased from outside sources) was in the public interest because it was the \u201cleast cost\u201d alternative for providing power to PGE\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">In 1993, the PUC issued an order finding that PGE\u2019s decision to close Trojan under a \u2018least cost\u201d theory was \u201creasonable.\u201d PUC Order No. 93-804. However, it reserved for a later proceeding the question of how to adjust PGE\u2019s rates to deal with the closure. Shortly thereafter, PGE filed a request with the PUC pursuant to ORS 756.450 (1993),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> asking that body to issue a declaratory ruling as to the propriety of charging the undepreciated portion of its Trojan investment to PGE\u2019s ratepayers. The PUC opened a proceeding to consider that question, and two public interest groups \u2014 the Citizens\u2019 Utility Board of Oregon (CUB) and the Utility Reform Project (URP) \u2014 intervened. Relying on ORS 757.355 (1993), a statute that Oregon voters had approved in 1978 as a ballot initiative,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> CUB argued that PGE could <em>not </em>include a return <em>on </em>its Trojan investment in its rate base, even if ORS 757.140(2) permitted it to recover its undepreciated investment in the plant in its rates. URP argued further that ORS 757.355 (1993) barred PGE from including <em>any </em>aspect of its Trojan investment in its rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>At the end of that proceeding, the PUC issued PUC Order No. 93-1117. The order rejected both CUB\u2019s and URP\u2019s arguments and declared that, \u00bf/PGE met certain conditions and could show certain \u201cassumed facts\u201d to be true in a rate case or similar forum,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> then PGE could set rates to obtain both a \u201creturn of\u2019 and a \u201creturn on\u201d its Trojan investment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The PUC also announced that it considered its decision to be binding and that, in any future PGE rate case, it would consider <em>only </em>whether PGE had proven the \u201cassumed facts\u201d that it had identified. CUB and URP unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of the ruling and then sought review in the Marion County Circuit Court. After the circuit court summarily affirmed, CUB and URP appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Shortly thereafter, the PUC conducted a rate case in which PGE submitted evidence to prove the \u201cassumed facts\u201d that the PUC had identified and to show that it had met the required conditions. CUB and URP both intervened in that case, arguing, respectively, that PGE could not include a return on its investment in its rate base and that PGE could not include <em>any </em>aspect of its Trojan investment in its rate base. After a hearing, the PUC issued PUC Order No. 95-322, which generally allowed PGE to include in its rate base (and amortize, through its rates, over the next 16 years) the amount that it had identified as the unrecovered portion of its original Trojan investment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The PUC also allowed PGE to include a return on that investment in its new rates. Consistent with its comments in PUC Order No. 93-1117, the PUC refused to consider any argument that ORS 757.355 (1993) barred \u201creturn of\u2019 or \u201creturn on\u201d investments in a retired plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The rates approved in PUC Order No. 95-322 went into effect immediately \u2014 even as CUB and URP filed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>action against the PUC in Marion County Circuit Court, seeking to \u201cmodify, vacate or set aside\u201d the order pursuant to <em>former </em>ORS 756.580 (1993).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After hearing the evidence and arguments, the circuit court adopted CUB\u2019s position that PGE was not entitled to include a \u201creturn on\u201d its Trojan investment in its rates, and reversed. This time the PUC appealed, and that appeal was consolidated with CUB\u2019s and URP\u2019s earlier appeal from PUC Order No. 93-1117, which raised similar, if not identical, issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board v. PUC, </em>154 Or App 702, 962 P2d 744 (1998), the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision against the PUC in the rate case and reversed the circuit court\u2019s decision affirming the PUC in the declaratory ruling case. The court rejected the theory advanced by PGE and the PUC \u2014 that ORS 757.355 (1993) is inapplicable to retired plants and therefore has no relevance to the issue of the rate treatment of Trojan. The court also rejected PUC\u2019s and PGE\u2019s position that ORS 757.140(2) supersedes the earlier statute. <em>Id. </em>at 708-13. The court concluded, instead, that ORS 757.140(2) and ORS 757.355 (1993) must be read together, that ORS 757.140(2) permits rates necessary to compensate utilities for the <em>principal </em>amount of their undepreciated investment in a retired facility in some circumstances, but that ORS 757.355 (1993) absolutely precludes utilities from including in their rates a return on their investment in unused or retired property. <em>Id. </em>at 716.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201c(1) A party to any proceeding before the Public Utility Commission, when aggrieved by any findings of fact, conclusion of law or order, including the dismissal of any complaint or application by the commission, may prosecute a suit against the commission to modify, vacate or set aside such findings of fact, conclusions of law or order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>After thus losing in the Court of Appeals, PUC and PGE sought review in this court. This court granted the petition for review in 1999. 328 Or 464, 987 P2d 513 (1999). However, the court held the case in abeyance when certain events occurred that appeared to have some potential for resolving the controversy without the court\u2019s participation. First, the PUC sought express authorization from the legislature (in House Bill (HB) 3220 (1999)) to structure rates to allow utilities a return on investments in plants retired in the public interest. The bill passed in the legislature, but was referred to the people, who rejected it in the November 2000 election. Second (and before the fate of HB 3220 was decided in the election), PGE and CUB entered into a settlement agreement that purported to \u201cput an end to the controversial \u2018return on\u2019 Trojan by wiping the unrecovered Trojan balance off the books.\u201d The settlement involved offsetting PGE\u2019s remaining Trojan investment balance (by then, $180.5 million) and certain tax liabilities relating to Trojan, against certain existing balances running in favor of PGE\u2019s ratepayers.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After CUB agreed to the settlement, PGE applied to the PUC for an accounting order and revised rate schedules implementing the settlement. PUC approved PGE\u2019s request on September 29, 2000 (PUC Order No. 00-601), and the new rates went into effect immediately. Thus, as of October 1, 2000, PGE\u2019s rates no longer purported to include any amount relating to the utilitys former Trojan investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">After the PUC approved the settlement and the new rate schedules implementing it, PGE moved this court to dismiss the petition for review in <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board </em>and to vacate the decisions below. PGE argued that the settlement rendered the controversy moot. URP, however, objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the motion. This court ultimately denied PGE\u2019s motion to dismiss and vacate, but nevertheless chose to dismiss the petition for review on its own motion. 335 Or 91, 58 P3d 822 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The foregoing procedural history left the Court of Appeals 1998 decision in <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board </em>as the ultimate decision in the case. The Court of Appeals issued an appellate judgment in accordance with that decision on January 8, 2003. The Marion County Circuit Court received that appellate judgment in the fall of 2003 and remanded to the PUC at that time \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with the opinion and orders of the Court of Appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In the meantime, URP had initiated a proceeding in the PUC to challenge PUC Order No. 00-601, described above. URP argued that the CUB/PUC settlement that PUC Order No. 00-601 implemented was unsatisfactory in that it provided only <em>prospective </em>relief to ratepayers \u2014 that is, it provided no mechanism for returning to ratepayers money that PGE had collected unlawfully between 1995 and 2000 as a \u201creturn on\u201d its Trojan investment. URP also argued, in a related vein, that, even if the settlement <em>formally </em>removed Trojan from the accounting/ratemaking process, it still provided PGE with the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a return on its Trojan investment \u2014 an outcome that the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board </em>prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The PUC rejected those arguments in PUC Order No. 02-227. The PUC responded, first, that it lacked authority to order refunds or otherwise to restore to ratepayers the part of PGE\u2019s earlier rates that provided a return on PGE\u2019s Trojan investment. The PUC relied, in that regard, on a principle known as the \u201cfiled rate doctrine\u201d and on a corollary rule against retroactive ratemaking.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The PUC also argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>nothing in <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board </em>precluded the solution that PGE and CUB had settled upon and that, in any event, the proposed rates were in the public interest and resulted in \u201cjust and reasonable rates.\u201d Notably, the PUC appeared to acknowledge that the settlement \u201cpreserved] the outcome\u201d approved in PUC Order No. 95-322, the order that specifically was overturned in <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">After an unsuccessful bid for reconsideration of the order approving and implementing the CUB/PGE settlement, URP filed an action against the PUC in Marion County Circuit Court, seeking review of the order pursuant to ORS 756.580. URP argued, as it had before the PUC, that the new rates were unlawful in that they failed to account for amounts that ratepayers already (and illegally) had been required to pay to PGE, in part as a return on the PGE\u2019s Trojan investment. In a decision issued on November 7,2003, the circuit court agreed, holding that there was no logical or legislative support for the PUC\u2019s view that the \u201cfiled rate doctrine\u201d absolutely precludes the PUC from in any way refunding to ratepayers amounts collected by a utility pursuant to a rate that a court later declares unlawful on judicial review. The circuit court concluded that \u201cPGE should have been required to account for all refunds due to rate payers for these unlawfully collected rates as a matter of law.\u201d Accordingly, the circuit court reversed and remanded to the PUC</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201cwith directions to immediately revise and reduce the existing rate structure so as to fully and promptly offset and recover all past improperly calculated and unlawfully collected rates, or alternatively, to order PGE to immediately issue refunds for the full amount of all excessive and unlawful charges collected by the utility for a return on its Trojan investment as previously determined to be improper by both this Court and the Court of Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The PUC responded to the circuit court\u2019s decision and remand on two fronts. First, the PUC appealed, arguing that, contrary to the circuit court\u2019s decision and remand, (1) the statutes do not authorize the PUC to order refunds or otherwise engage in retroactive ratemaking; (2) the remand in <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board </em>did not require and could not authorize the PUC to order a refund or otherwise engage in retroactive ratemaking; and (3) the rates approved in PUC Order No. 02-227 were reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. That appeal presently is pending in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Secondly, the PUC decided immediately to respond to the circuit court\u2019s remand in a hybrid proceeding that would consider both that remand and the remand that it recently had received from the circuit court in the <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board </em>case. Over URP\u2019s objection, the PUC decided to proceed with the two remands together, but in two phases, with the first phase devoted to determining \u201c[w]hat rates would have been approved in [PUC Order No. 95-322] if ORS 757.355 [(1993)] had been interpreted to prohibit a return on Trojan,\u201d and the second phase devoted to reconciling the results of Phase I with the rates that actually were approved. PUC Order No. 04-597 at 2, 7 (Oct 18,2004).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The PUC presently is proceeding with Phase I.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>That brings us to the present case. On January 23, 2003, two weeks after the Court of Appeals issued the appellate judgment in <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board </em>and before the PUC opened the hybrid proceeding described above, certain past and present ratepayers of PGE filed complaints against PGE in Marion County Circuit Court, seeking refunds of all amounts that ratepayers unlawfully had to pay between April 1, 1995 (the effective date of PUC Order No. 95-322) and October 1, 2000 (when PUC Order No. 00-601 came into effect) to provide PGE with a return on its Trojan investment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, who are represented by lawyers who also represented URP before the PUC and in the judicial review proceedings described above, sought certification as a class and sought relief in four separate claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In their first claim, plaintiffs alleged that they were entitled to return of the unlawful charges under ORS 756.185. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201c(1) Any public utility which does, or causes or permits to be done, any matter, act or thing prohibited by ORS chapter 756, 757 or 758 or omits to do any act, matter or thing required to be done by such statutes, is liable to the person injured thereby in the amount of damages sustained in consequence of such violation. * * * Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">\u201c(2) The court may not award attorney fees to a prevailing defendant under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section if the action under this section is maintained as a class action pursuant to ORCP 32.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Plaintiffs alleged that PGE had done something \u201cprohibited by * * * ORS [chapter] 757\u201d by receiving from customers payments \u201cwhich are derived from a rate base which includes within it any * * * installation * * * not presently used for providing utility service.\u201d ORS 757.355 (1993). Plaintiffs further alleged that they and other ratepayers were damaged in an amount equal to the unlawful charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In their second claim, plaintiffs alleged that PGE violated ORS 757.225 by (1) \u201cdirectly charging and collecting charges for service which was not rendered\u201d; and (2) \u201cincluding charges on bills which were in excess of lawful charges in rates.\u201d ORS 757.225 provides, generally, that \u201c[n]o public utility shall charge, demand, collect or receive a greater or less compensation for any service performed by it * * * than is specified in printed rate schedules as may at the time be in force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 third claim was a common-law claim for \u201cmoney had and received.\u201d <em>Service Lumber Co. v. Sumpter Val. Ry. Co., </em>67 Or 63, 77, 135 P 539 (1913), <em>judgment set aside on other grounds, </em>81 Or 32, 158 P 175 (1916), describes that kind of claim as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">\u201cIn the action for money had and received, it is sufficient to show that, by any process which was treated by the parties as a money transaction, the defendant has received money, or its equivalent, which in equity and in good conscience belongs to and should be paid to the plaintiff, and this is true although the plaintiff may never have had actual manual custody of the specie in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Plaintiffs alleged that PGE charged them and other ratepayers amounts that had been determined to be unlawful and that those amounts in equity and good conscience belonged to and should be paid to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">In their fourth claim for relief, plaintiffs alleged that PGE was \u201cunjustly enriched\u201d by the amounts that it collected, as part of its rates, as a return on its Trojan investment, and that it should not be permitted to retain that money.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">PGE moved to dismiss. It argued that plaintiffs\u2019 actions trespassed on the PUC\u2019s jurisdiction, noting that, in its recent remand of PUC Order No. 02-227, the circuit court had ordered the PUC to provide the very same relief that plaintiffs were seeking. Plaintiffs responded, however, that the PUC was not moving forward on the remanded case and insisted that, in any event, they were entitled to proceed in spite of the remand to the PUC. Plaintiffs pointed, in that regard, to ORS 756.200, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">\u201c(1) The remedies and enforcement procedures provided in ORS chapters 756, 757, 758 and 759 do not release or waive any right of action by the state or by any person for any right, penalty or forfeiture which may arise under any law of this state or under an ordinance of any municipality thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\u201c(2) All penalties and forfeitures accruing under said statutes and ordinances are cumulative and a suit for and recovery of one shall not be a bar to the recovery of any other penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\u201c(3) The duties and liabilities of the public utilities or telecommunications utilities shall be the same as are prescribed by the common law, and the remedies against them the same, except where otherwise provided by the Constitution or statutes of this state, and the provisions of ORS chapters 756, 757, 758 and 759 are cumulative thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The circuit court denied the motion to dismiss but indicated that it might consider abating the actions at some later point. PGE did later move to abate in accordance with that suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Plaintiffs then moved for partial summaryjudgment on two of their claims. PGE opposed that motion and filed its own motion for a summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The circuit court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion and denied PGE\u2019s cross-motion. PGE then filed the first of the two petitions for an alternative writ of mandamus that presently are before this court, asking this court to order the circuit court to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. Shortly thereafter, the circuit court issued an order certifying plaintiffs\u2019 actions as class actions pursuant to ORCP 32. PGE then filed its second petition for an alternative writ, this time asking this court to order the circuit court to vacate its order certifying the cases as class actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">On April 9, 2005, this court consolidated the cases and issued the requested alternative writs. The circuit court responded, urging the court to dismiss the writs as improvidently granted. With respect to the first petition, the circuit court argued that plaintiffs had instituted their actions pursuant to ORS 756.185 and the common law, and that the statutes (specifically, ORS 756.185 and ORS 756.200(2)) indicate such actions and remedies are preserved, regardless of the availability of agency remedies. With respect to the second petition, the circuit court argued only that certification of a class should be treated as an act of judicial discretion with respect to which the right to appeal is an adequate remedy. Since then, PGE and plaintiffs both have filed briefs on the merits, and a number of <em>amici </em>have offered their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Before we turn to the parties\u2019 arguments, we note that the extraordinary remedy of a writ of mandamus is available to compel a court\u2019s decision only when the law <em>requires </em>a particular decision. <em>See </em>ORS 34.110 (writ available to compel an act which the law \u201cspecially enjoins\u201d). We further note that such writs ordinarily are not available when there is a \u201cplain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, to obtain the specific remedy that it seeks (dismissal), PGE must persuade us that the law requires dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 actions and that the ordinary remedy of reversal on appeal is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">PGE\u2019s first argument in that regard is that none of plaintiffs\u2019 four claims has any basis in the law \u2014 specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>that plaintiffs\u2019 two statutory claims misconstrue the relevant statutes and that the two \u201ccommon-law\u201d claims in fact are based in statute and do not exist in the common law. However, as will be seen, we find PGE\u2019s arguments with respect to at least one of those claims to be unpersuasive. We refer, in particular, to plaintiffs\u2019 first claim, which alleges that PGE violated ORS 757.355 (1993) by charging and receiving rates that include a return on PGE\u2019s investment in the defunct Trojan plant. The first claim also alleges that, under ORS 757.185(1), PGE is liable to plaintiffs for damages that they sustained in consequence of that violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">PGE argues that that first claim involves a misreading of ORS 757.355 (1993) and that, if properly interpreted, it should be clear that PGE did not and could not violate that statute. PGE\u2019s argument in that respect begins with the premise that, under the so-called \u201cfiled rate doctrine\u201d embodied in ORS 756.225 (see above, 341 Or at 270-71 n 10), PGE\u2019s rates during the relevant period were conclusively lawful and were the only rates that PGE was permitted to collect. It follows, PGE argues, that, if ORS 757.355 (1993) is read (as plaintiffs do) as a mandate directed at PGE, then PGE is subject to conflicting mandates and must violate one in order to satisfy the other.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> PGE contends that that situation is untenable and that the only reasonable resolution is to read ORS 757.355 (1993) as a directive <em>to the PUC </em>rather than to utilities. Such a resolution would preclude any claim that PGE had \u201c[done] or cause [d] or permit [ted] to be done any matter, act or thing prohibited by\u201d the statute, as plaintiffs\u2019 first claim for relief alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The obvious problem with PGE\u2019s argument is that it would rob ORS 757.355 (1993) of any vitality. PGE assures us that that does not mean that ORS 757.355 (1993) is unenforceable, but only that the proper method of enforcement is a suit to set aside an order of the PUC as provided by ORS 756.580 (and not a civil action against PGE itself under ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>756.185(1)). Of course, PGE acknowledges, that may mean that ratepayers have no clear mechanism for obtaining a refund of charges that the PUC approves and that the utility collects, but that later are determined to be unlawful. PGE contends, however, that the refund issue is premature because the PUC now is engaged in a proceeding to determine whether a refund is required and, in any event, the mechanism for obtaining a refund that plaintiffs seek to employ here \u2014 an action for damages under ORS 756.185(1) \u2014 is clearly improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first objection to the foregoing analysis goes to PGE\u2019s perspective on the meaning and effect of ORS 756.225. Plaintiffs deny that that statute embodies the extreme form of the \u201cfiled rate doctrine\u201d that PGE (and, apparently, the PUC) advocate. They suggest that, so long as it is appealed, a rate order is not final (and, therefore, cannot serve as a shield against a claim of unlawfulness), at least until the final appellate judgment is entered. In support of that argument, plaintiffs point out that, according to ORS 756.565, a PUC-approved rate is only \u201cprima facie\u201d lawful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cAll rates, tariffs, [etc.] approved or prescribed by the Public Utility Commission and any order made or entered upon any matter within the jurisdiction of the commission shall be in force and shall be prima facie lawful and reasonable until found otherwise in a proceeding brought for that purpose under ORS 756.580 to 756.610.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Plaintiffs also note that, by its clear terms, ORS 757.355 (1993) is directed at utilities and not at the PUC (\u201cNo public utility shall * * *.\u201d). They contend, moreover, that there is no need to twist the words of that statute in order to reconcile it with ORS 757.225. They argue that the two statutes are easily reconciled \u2014 that ORS 757.225 should be read as requiring utilities to treat published rates as provisionally lawful, but not as absolutely shielding utilities from having to return any part of their rates that later is adjudged to be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">We share plaintiffs\u2019 skepticism of the proposition that is at the heart of PGE\u2019s argument \u2014 that ORS 757.225 manifests a legislative intent that PUC-approved rates be treated as conclusively lawful for all purposes \u201cuntil they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>changed as provided in ORS 757.210 to 757.220.\u201d We find it significant that, although the public utility statutes provide more than one process for changing the filed rates for a utility, ORS 757.225 refers to only one such process \u2014 the utility-initiated process \u201cprovided by ORS 757.210 to 757.220.\u201d If PGE\u2019s interpretation of ORS 757.225 were correct, then <em>only </em>rate changes adopted pursuant to the utility-initiated rate-making process at ORS 757.210 to 757.220 would be valid. A necessary corollary of that interpretation would be that rate changes adopted under any alternative process provided in the statutes, including the ratepayer- or PUC-initiated process set out at ORS 756.500 to 756.515, would <em>not </em>produce a binding change to the \u201clawful\u201d rate. Those two propositions do not persuade us.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Based on the foregoing, we therefore agree with plaintiffs that ORS 757.225 is most reasonably read as a direction to utilities to charge all their ratepayers the PUC-approved rate and, if a utility is dissatisfied with a rate, to obtain a new PUC-approved rate through the process set out at ORS 757.210 to 757.220. The statute is not aimed, as PGE suggests, at conclusively and permanently binding the entire world to the rate decisions of the PUC.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">It follows that, in the context of the present controversy, there is no necessary conflict between ORS 757.225 (directing utilities to charge the filed rate and to seek a rate change if that filed rate is unsatisfactory) and a natural reading of ORS 757.355 (1993), <em>i.e., </em>as a prohibition directed at utilities.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And, because we do not accept PGE\u2019s contention that ORS 757.355 (1993) has no application to the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>utilities, we cannot accept its derivative contention that plaintiffs\u2019 first claim has no basis in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Because PGE has failed to persuade us that plaintiffs\u2019 first claim is legally untenable, we need not consider its similar challenges to the other three claims. If even one of plaintiffs\u2019 claims is viable, then the law cannot compel the dismissal of the complaints on the theory that none of the claims has any basis in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">PGE next argues that plaintiffs\u2019 complaints must be dismissed because they either are time barred or amount to an unlawful collateral attack on unappealed and final orders of the PUC. PGE begins by noting that plaintiffs\u2019 claims pertain to overcharges that PGE purportedly collected between April 1995 and October 2000, after the PUC approved the charges in PUC Order No. 95-322 and before the PUC issued its order implementing the settlement with CUB. PGE then notes that, although CUB and URP timely challenged PUC Order No. 95-322 under ORS 755.580 (and obtained by that challenge a judicial determination that the charges were unlawful), <em>that </em>rate order was superseded within eight months by a new rate order, PUC Order No. 95-1216. PGE contends that, because no one sought review within the time period provided in ORS 756.580 of PUC Order No. 95-1216, it became final and no longer can be challenged, either directly through an action under ORS 756.580 or collaterally, as in the present action. Thus, PGE argues, to the extent that plaintiffs\u2019 claims pertain to overcharges that occurred after the effective date of PUC Order No. 95-1216, those claims are barred as unlawful collateral attacks on unchallenged orders. As to the overcharges that occurred before the effective date of PUC Order No. 95-1216, PGE contends that any claim based on those charges is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, ORS 12.080, because the charges were collected more than six years before April 17, 2003 (the date when plaintiffs filed their present action).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">PGE\u2019s argument fails on a number of grounds. First, the argument is premised on the idea that plaintiffs\u2019 challenge ultimately and necessarily is directed at the PUC and its rate orders, rather than at P\u00d3E and its alleged violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ORS 757.355 (1993). As we already have explained, we disagree with that premise. Whether or not they ever succeed, plaintiffs clearly are suing PGE for money that they say PGE owes them. Furthermore, PGE fails to acknowledge that the \u201cunchallenged\u201d rate orders do not address in any manner the rate treatment of Trojan. Those orders retained the rate treatment that previously had been approved (and thereafter was excluded from the decision-making process), at least in part because the two prior orders that had decided the issue were in the courts on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In that regard, we note that the PUC first decided the question of PGE\u2019s entitlement to a return on Trojan in the abstract, in the declaratory ruling designated as PUC Order No. 93-1117. CUB and URP challenged that order as provided in ORS 756.580. Shortly thereafter, the PUC issued PUC Order No. 95-322, the rate order that implemented its decision in PUC Order No. 93-1117. In that order, the PUC expressly refused to revisit its prior conclusion in PUC Order No. 93-1117 that PGE could recover a return on its Trojan investment from ratepayers, and noted that its conclusion was on appeal. CUB and URP sought judicial review of that order as well.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Eight months later, PGE sought another adjustment in its rates, but it did not propose to change the rate treatment of its investment in Trojan. URP <em>did </em>attempt to raise the \u201creturn on Trojan\u201d issue at that time, but the PUC again refused to consider the matter on the ground that it already had been presented and resolved in PUC Order No. 95-322. Thereafter, PGE sought and the PUC granted a number of modifications to PGE\u2019s rates, but the rate treatment of PGE\u2019s investment in Trojan already had been decided in PUC Order No. 95-322 and was not raised as an issue in those cases. As such, the fact that no one timely challenged either PUC Order No. 95-1216 or any of the rate orders that followed it is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">PGE argues, finally, that dismissal is required because plaintiffs\u2019 claims pertain to matters of utility regulation that are the exclusive province of the PUC (and, thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>are beyond the jurisdiction of the circuit court). PGE begins that argument with a proposition that is beyond serious dispute \u2014 that ratemaking is a quasi-legislative function that is vested in the PUC by statute. But PGE then moves on to a more debatable proposition, namely, that any resolution of the present action necessarily will involve ratemaking. PGE contends that that is so because \u201cthe jury will have to decide what rates the PUC would or should have set if it had not made an error in [PUC] Order [No.] 95-322.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">We disagree. Although a jury theoretically could go about deciding the damage question in the manner suggested, <em>i.e., </em>by determining what a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d rate would have been if the objectionable return on Trojan had been excluded and then comparing that rate to the one actually charged during the relevant period, it also could simply attempt to determine what part of the rates that the PUC had approved as \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d in fact represented a return on PGE\u2019s investment in Trojan and, therefore, were unlawful under ORS 757.355 (1993), as interpreted in <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board, </em>154 Or App 702. The first approach arguably would invade the PUC\u2019s exclusive ratemaking authority, but we are not persuaded that the latter approach would involve a similar trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">PGE also seems to argue, in a more nebulous way, that plaintiffs\u2019 actions in circuit court fly in the face of a \u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme\u201d that assigns all matters relating to utility regulation to the PUC and limits courts to reviewing PUC orders. We note, however, that plaintiffs rely on provisions within that supposedly \u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme,\u201d ORS 756.185(1) and ORS 756.200, that appear to contemplate judicial involvement in matters other than review of PUC orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Thus, we do not accept PGE\u2019s argument that the circuit court is without jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs\u2019 claims because they necessarily involve ratemaking or pertain to utility regulation. Neither do we accept any of PGE\u2019s other arguments urging that the law <em>requires </em>dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 actions. As such, we conclude that the particular remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>that PGE seeks is not available: We cannot issue a peremptory writ ordering the circuit court to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 actions and vacate its class certification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">We could, at this point, dismiss the writs and leave the parties to their ongoing struggle in the circuit court. However, we believe that doing so would not be appropriate because, even if the circuit court had no duty to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 cases, it appears clear to us that the court had a legal duty to abate the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Respecting abatement, we note that the PUC now is engaged in a proceeding that involves (essentially) the same controversy, the same ratepayers, and the same effort at determining a remedy for PGE\u2019s collection of unlawful rates, as do the present actions. That being the case, we believe, for the reasons we describe below, that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction requires that the present actions defer to that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In <em>Boise Cascade Corp. v. Board of Forestry, </em>325 Or 185, 935 P2d 411 (1997), this court described the doctrine of primary jurisdiction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201cJudicial invocation of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction generally is appropriate when a court decides that an administrative agency, rather than a court of law, initially should determine the outcome of a dispute or one or more issues within that dispute that fall within that agency\u2019s statutory authority. The purpose behind the doctrine is the \u2018recognition of the need for orderly and sensible coordination of the work of agencies and of courts.\u2019 * * * The reason for the doctrine is \u2018not a belief that an agency\u2019s expertise makes it superior to a court, [but] that a court confronted with problems within an agency\u2019s areas of specialization should have the advantage of whatever contributions the agency can make to the solutions.\u2019 That is, the doctrine is one ordinarily invoked by a court in the traditional judicial system with the belief that a previous agency disposition of one or more issues before the court will assist the court in resolving the case before it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201cCourts vary in their approaches to invoking the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. According to one treatise on administrative law, with which we agree:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201c \u2018There is no fixed formula for determining whether an agency has primary jurisdiction over a dispute or an issue raised in a dispute. In making such determinations, courts consider several factors, including (1) the extent to which the agency\u2019s specialized expertise makes it a preferable forum for resolving the issue, (2) the need for uniform resolution of the issue, and (3) the potential that judicial resolution of the issue will have an adverse impact on the agency\u2019s performance of its regulatory responsibilities. * * *\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u201cUpon invoking the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the disposition of the case depends on the nature of the parties\u2019 dispute and the scope of the agency\u2019s authority. If an agency has primary jurisdiction over the entire dispute, the court action is dismissed. However, if an agency has primary jurisdiction over an issue in dispute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201c \u2018the court will defer any decision in the action before it until the agency has addressed the issue that is within its primary jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 192-93 (quoting Kenneth Culp Davis, <em>Administrative Law Text </em>(3d ed 1972) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The initial question, then, is whether there are one or more issues in the present actions as to which the PUC should be deemed to have primary jurisdiction. We note, in that regard, that an essential component of plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that they were injured by PGE\u2019s collection and retention of rates that were based in part on amounts unlawfully representing PGE\u2019s investment in the defunct Trojan facility. We also note that, even before plaintiffs filed their actions, the PUC had received two remands from the courts, at least one of which clearly contemplated that the PUC would fashion a remedy for those very injuries.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, we note that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>PUC now is engaged in carrying out those remands in a single proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Although plaintiffs vigorously deny it, the PUC proceeding that is underway thus has the potential for disposing of the central issue in these cases, <em>viz., </em>the issue whether plaintiffs have been injured (and, if they have been, the extent of the injury). In that regard, we note that the PUC has been instructed either to revise and reduce rates to offset the previous \u201cimproperly calculated and unlawfully collected rates\u201d or to order PGE to issue refunds. Depending on how the PUC responds to that remand, some or all plaintiffs claimed injuries may cease to exist. Moreover, the PUC\u2019s specialized expertise in the field of ratemaking gives it primary, if not sole, jurisdiction over one of the remedies contemplated in the remand: revision of rates to provide for recovery of unlawfully collected amounts. Certainly, if the PUC decides to take that approach to the problem, its special expertise makes it a far superior venue for determining that remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The PUC also has special expertise with respect to an issue that lurks in the background of this case: Whether the PUC can order refunds or any other form of retroactive relief for amounts that PGE collected in violation of ORS 757.355 (1993).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At times, plaintiffs appear to suggest in their briefing that that issue is irrelevant, because they can proceed in circuit court in any event. At other times, however, plaintiffs seem to suggest that the PUC\u2019s refusal or lack of authority to act justifies their actions in circuit court. We think that the issue of PUC\u2019s authority <em>is </em>relevant in the present case: If that agency can and does provide a full or partial remedy, then plaintiffs either are not injured at all or, if they remain injured, their remedy is to seek judicial review of the PUC\u2019s order. In the former case, the circuit court can dismiss the actions. In the latter case, the scope of the court\u2019s work will be usefully curtailed. In either event, the issue of the PUC\u2019s authority to provide a retroactive remedy is one that, at least initially, belongs before that body.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Turning to the other two primary jurisdiction factors set out above, we think that this clearly is a case in which a uniform resolution of the issue is desirable. Conflicting or inconsistent resolutions of the remedy issue between the PUC and the circuit court would be highly problematic for the resolution of this dispute and for utility regulation generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Finally, we are persuaded that, in the present context, judicial resolution of the remedies issue before the PUC has acted would interfere with that agency\u2019s performance of its regulatory functions. In two judicial review actions that preceded the present action, courts have issued remands to the PUC that explicitly or implicitly contemplate some decision about PGE ratepayers\u2019 entitlement to a remedy. The PUC is performing part of its regulatory functions when it responds to those remands. A contemporaneous circuit court proceeding directed at the same issue would not, in our view, move that process forward.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We conclude, in short, that the PUC has primary jurisdiction to determine what, if any, remedy it can offer to PGE ratepayers, through rate reductions or refunds, for the amounts that PGE collected in violation of ORS 757.355 (1993) between April 1995 and October 2000. If the PUC determines that it can provide a remedy to ratepayers, then the present actions may become moot in whole or in part. If, on the other hand, the PUC determines that it cannot provide a remedy, and that decision becomes final, then the court system may have a role to play. Certainly, after the PUC has made its ruling, plaintiffs will retain the right to return to the circuit court for disposition of whatever issues remain unresolved, including the question of a fee award. That is the way that abatement is supposed to work. Until the PUC has had the opportunity to do its work, parallel circuit court litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>is duplicative and unnecessary. It should be abated. Accordingly, we issue a peremptory writ ordering the circuit court to abate the present actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Peremptory writ to issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\"> The statute, ORS 757.140(2), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">\u201cIn the following cases the commission may allow in rates, directly or indirectly, amounts on the utility\u2019s books of account which the commission finds represent undepreciated investment in a utility plant, including that which has been retired from service:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">\u201c(a) When the retirement is due to ordinary wear and tear, casualties, acts of God, acts of governmental authority; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">\u201c(b) When the commission finds that the retirement is in the public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-5\"> At the relevant time, i.e., 1993, ORS 756.450 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\u201cOn petition of any interested person, the Public Utility Commission may issue a declaratory ruling with respect to the applicability to any person, property, or state of facts of any rule or statute enforceable by the commission.

In PUC Order No. 95-1216, the PUC reiterated its position that PUC Order No. 93-1117 disposed of the issue of PGE\u2019s entitlement to a return on its Trojan investment and that it would not reconsider the issue.

Although URP opposed various aspects of the settlement, its primary focus was on PGE\u2019s selection of $180.5 million as the remaining balance.

However, the PUC long has argued that the two doctrines apply and the Oregon Attorney General has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>concurred in that position. Letter of Advice dated March 18, 1987, to Charles Davis, Public Utility Commissioner (op-6076). Both the PUC and the Attorney General suggest that there are strong policy considerations underpinning the two doctrines. The PUC also contends that the doctrines inhere in an Oregon statute, OES 757.225. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cNo public utility shall charge, demand, collect or receive a greater or less compensation for any service performed by it within the state, or for any service in connection therewith, than is specified in printed rate schedules as may at the time he in force or demand, collect, or receive any rate not specified in such schedule. <em>The rates named, therein are the lawful rates until they are changed as provided in ORS 757.210 to </em>757.220.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">In its briefs to this court, PGE asserts that <em>McPherson et al v. Pacific P. &amp; L. Co., </em>207 Or 433, 296 P2d 932 (1956), implicitly adopts the filed-rate doctrine, but the validity of that assertion is debatable. Certainly, <em>McPherson </em>does not adopt any rule about retroactive ratemaking. In any event, our disposition of this case eliminates any need to address the issue in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\"> The PUC acknowledged that the first phase would involve ratemaking but noted that it would not be necessary to duplicate the complete 1995 rate case. Rather, the ratemaking process would be limited to those aspects of the 1995 case that are affected by the Court of Appeals\u2019 statutory interpretation of ORS 757.355 (1993) \u2014 specifically</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">\u201c(1) the appropriate recovery period for the Trojan investment balance; (2) the cost of capital effects of the utility\u2019s change of circumstances; and (3) the application of the net benefits formula given that PGE is precluded from recovering the cost of capital represented by the Trojan investment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">PUC Order No. 04-597 at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"A5W\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>URP intervened in the proceeding and argued that the PUC\u2019s framing of the issues was improper in that it directly involved engaging in retroactive ratemak-ing. URP also argued that, unless the PUC repudiated its position that the filed rate doctrine precluded it from providing any relief for the unlawful charges that PGE had collected, the proceedings were \u201cfutile\u201d and \u201cmoot.\u201d The PUC acknowledged URP\u2019s position, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">\u201cthe uncertainty of the outcome of Phase I is one reason these remand proceedings may proceed despite the ongoing appeal of one of the underlying dockets, [PUC Order No. 02-227] at the Court of Appeals. URP expresses concerns that these remand proceedings are \u2018pointless,\u2019 \u2018meaningless,\u2019 and \u2018moot,\u2019 speculating that relief cannot be granted due to the [PUC\u2019s] legal position [in the appeal concerning PUC Order No. 02-227] that refunds violate the rule against retroactive ratemaking. As the Ruling observed, however, the [PUC\u2019s] legal position that it is not authorized to issue refunds is not necessarily implicated in the first phase. We agree that \u2018prior to completing the investigation of what rate determinations would have been made by the [PUC] under the statutory framework provided by the Court of Appeals, it is impossible to know whether any retroactive adjustment of rates will be necessary.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The PUC concluded, however, that it must proceed because it could not avoid, modify or otherwise dispense with the obligations imposed by reviewing courts. <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\"> Originally, two different sets of plaintiffs filed actions asserting essentially identical claims, the only difference being that plaintiffs in <em>Dreyer et al </em>v. <em>PGE </em>(Marion County Circuit Court Case No. 03 10639) alleged that they were <em>present </em>customers of PGE while plaintiffs in <em>Morgan v. PGE </em>(Marion County Circuit Court Case No. 03 10640) alleged that they were <em>former </em>PGE customers. Early on, the trial court consolidated <em>Morgan </em>with <em>Dreyer.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b321-6\"> Specifically, PGE asserts that if it adheres to ORS 756.355 (1993) and excludes retum-on-investment charges from its rates, it would be charging less than the published PUC-approved rates, thereby violating ORS 757.225. If, on the other hand, PGE charges the published rates because ORS 757.225 (as PGE interprets it) requires PGE to do that, it would violate ORS 756.355 (1993), because the published rates include return-on-investment charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"> Although we reject PGE\u2019s contention here that ORS 757.225 embodies the particular application of the filed-rate doctrine that it espouses, we do not reject the possibility that Oregon utility law incorporates some form of the doctrine. We simply do not address that question here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> We acknowledge that that interpretation could pose a dilemma for utilities, in that they theoretically could find themselves to be statutorily bound to collect a PUC-approved rate that includes amounts that, by statute, are unlawful for them to collect. However, realistically, utilities will rarely if ever be placed involuntarily into such a position; rather, they will make a calculated decision to pursue a theory that may or may not withstand judicial review (as in the present case), with the consequences of such a ruling factored into the choice to press their theory in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\"> As we previously noted, the challenges to PUC Order No. 93-1117 and PUC Order No. 95-322 were combined for purposes of appeal in <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility </em>Board, 154 Or App 702.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\"> They were (1) the remand in the final appellate judgment in <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board, </em>154 Or App 702, \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with the opinion and orders of the Court of Appeals\u201d; and (2) the remand from the circuit court in <em>Utility Reform Project, </em>which instructed the PUC</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201cto immediately revise and reduce the existing rate structure so as to fully and promptly offset and recover all past improperly calculated and unlawfully collected rates, or alternatively, to order PGE to immediately issue refunds for the full amount of all excessive and unlawful charges collected by the utility for a return on its Trojan investment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b329-6\"> This is an issue that potentially affects some of the plaintiffs \u2014 those who were PGE customers during the pertinent time period but no longer are customers \u2014 differently than it affects those who were customers during the pertinent time period and remain so. We note the potential dichotomy only to demonstrate that PUC\u2019s ultimate choice of remedy can have many possible effects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\"> We acknowledge that plaintiffs are concerned that, in spite of the circuit court\u2019s remand, PUC will refuse to provide any remedy for the amounts that PGE unlawfully collected between April 1995 and October 2000 on the ground that it has no authority to make retroactive adjustments to rates. Plaintiffs may be correct, but we cannot sit in review of speculation about what an agency will decide. Moreover, the issue that plaintiffs raise \u2014 whether the PUC has authority to order refunds or other retroactive relief \u2014 will not be ripe for decision by an appellate court until the PUC acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
