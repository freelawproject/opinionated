He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>received a sentence of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. Arguing that the sentence is substantively unreasonable, Mr. Alvarez appeals his sentence, which we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">Mr. Alvarez, a citizen of Mexico, was found on October 19, 2009, in the Montrose County Jail, in Montrose, Colorado. He was being held on state criminal charges. Agents from the United States Department of Homeland Security/Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) interviewed Mr. Alvarez and determined that he was a citizen of Mexico, and that he had been deported previously and had subsequently returned illegally to the United States. As it turned out, Mr. Alvarez had been deported twice previously, the most recent occasion on October 4, 2005, and had then reentered the country illegally following those deportations. Prior to the most recent deportation, Mr. Alvarez had been convicted (in October 2002) of the felony offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute it. For that conviction, he was sentenced to four years in the Colorado Department of Corrections. That conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">Mr. Alvarez pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement. During the change of plea hearing, he was informed that, statutorily, he could be sentenced to prison for up to twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-8\">In preparation for calculating an advisory sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Commission <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), the United States Probation Office prepared a presentencing agreement (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR correctly calculated that the base offense level for Mr. Alvarez\u2019s crime was eight. That offense level was increased by sixteen levels, in accordance with USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(B)(l)(A)(i), because his most recent reentry followed a prior deportation after being convicted of a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded thirteen months. The PSR also noted that Mr. Alvarez had pled guilty and been sentenced on two prior occasions (August 31, 1999, and March 27, 2001) for driving while impaired. Additionally, he had pled guilty and been sentenced in November 2009 for misdemeanor harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-11\">Mr. Alvarez\u2019s total offense level was calculated to be twenty-one (eight plus sixteen, minus three for acceptance of responsibility) and his criminal history category was IV.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That combination yielded an advisory guidelines range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-12\">Neither party submitted objections to the PSR, although Mr. Alvarez filed a pleading entitled \u201cDefendant\u2019s Sentencing Memorandum in Support of Statutory Sentencing.\u201d In this pleading, he requested that the district court impose a \u201cnon-Guideline\u201d sentence of thirty-six months. Among his arguments in support of his request for statutory sentencing, Mr. Alvarez argued that the sixteen-level enhancement applied pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(B)(l)(A)(i) (because he had been convicted of the felony drug trafficking sentence and received a sentence in excess of thirteen months) was \u201cunwarranted [and] unreasonable.\u201d Def.\u2019s Sentencing Mem. at 2, R. Vol. 1 at 44. He also requested a downward departure on the ground that his criminal history category of IV overstated his criminality. Accordingly, Mr. Alvarez sought a thirty-six month sentence, claiming that such a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>tence was sufficient but not greater than necessary, would reflect the seriousness of the offense, would promote respect for the law, and would sufficiently deter him and others from returning to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">In response to these arguments made by Mr. Alvarez, the probation office filed an addendum to the PSR. It argued that the criminal history category of IV was proper and did not over-represent the seriousness of Mr. Alvarez\u2019s criminal history. With respect to the sixteen-level enhancement, the addendum simply stated, \u201cThere is no argument that the 16-level increase was applied incorrectly, and it is for the Court to decide if this enhancement is unjustified.\u201d Add. at S \u2014 1, Supplemental R. Vol. 1 at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">At the sentencing hearing held on April 30, 2010, the district court asked counsel from both sides if they had any objections to the PSR, \u201cincluding the advisory guideline calculation and the sentencing recommendation.\u201d Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 2, R. Vol. 2 at 24. Government counsel responded in the negative, and Mr. Alvarez\u2019s counsel stated, \u201c[they] do not object to the calculation, but we do disagree with the recommendation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">The district court also noted that Mr. Alvarez has a \u201csignificant criminal record,\u201d <em>id., </em>which placed him in criminal category IV. When that was combined with Mr. Alvarez\u2019s \u201ctwo prior deportations which result in [Mr. Alvarez\u2019s] [entering and] returning ... [a total of] three times to the country illegally,\u201d the court asked why a sentence other than a sentence within the advisory guideline range was appropriate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-7\">Defense counsel acknowledged Mr. Alvarez\u2019s significant criminal history, but argued that his felony drug trafficking offense was the \u201cprimary contributor to inflating his guideline range in several ways, to the extent that it is counted in several ways.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. Thus, he sought a variance from the advisory guideline range on the ground that the sixteen-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b) (1) (A) (i) was unwarranted and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">Additionally, Mr. Alvarez argued that the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, especially deterrence, supported a variance. He also argued that since he had received a four-year sentence for his prior felony, it seemed inappropriate to receive a longer sentence for his reentry, and that a sentence of thirty-six months, rather that fifty-seven, would be adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">When the prosecutor addressed the court, he reminded the district court of Mr. Alvarez\u2019s two prior deportations and noted that Mr. Alvarez\u2019s prior state felony was very serious. The government attorney also reminded the court of Mr. Alvarez\u2019s three other criminal convictions (two driving while impaired and one harassment conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-12\">The court then spoke, observing that \u201cthe defendant has had regular contact with the criminal justice system, as evidenced by his arrests in 1997, 1999, 2001, 2002 and 2009, all of which resulted in convictions.\u201d Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 10, R. Vol. 2 at 32. With respect to his argument concerning the sixteen-level enhancement, the court characterized Mr. Alvarez\u2019s argument as an argument that \u201cthe application of the 16-level enhancement works some sort of injustice on the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-13\">The court subsequently denied Mr. Alvarez\u2019s motion for a statutory sentence, stating \u201cthere really is no case law in this circuit that supports that argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It then sentenced him at the bottom of the guideline range, after also concluding that criminal category IV did not substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>over-represent the seriousness of his criminal history. Mr. Alvarez argues that his fifty-seven-month sentence is unreasonably high.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">We review a criminal defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, deferring to the district court under the \u201cfamiliar abuse-of-discretion standard of review.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion \u2018when it renders a judgment that is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or manifestly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Beltran, </em>571 F.3d 1013, 1018 (10th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Haley, </em>529 F.3d 1308, 1311 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 428, 172 L.Ed.2d 310 (2008)). Reasonableness review has a procedural and a substantive component. <em>United States v. Alapizco-Valenzuela, </em>546 F.3d 1208, 1214 (10th Cir.2008). \u201cWe may not examine the weight a district court assigns to various [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and its ultimate assessment of the balance between them, as a legal conclusion to be reviewed de novo. Instead, we must \u2018give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the [sentence imposed].\u201d <em>United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 808 (10th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). A sentence imposed within the properly calculated advisory guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Chavez-Suarez, </em>597 F.3d 1137, 1139-40 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 286, 178 L.Ed.2d 188 (2010). Mr. Alvarez explicitly only challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-12\">Mr. Alvarez concedes that his sentence was not \u201carbitrary, capricious or whimsical.\u201d He argues, instead, that his sentence is \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d More specifically, Mr. Alvarez claims that \u201cit was the [sixteen-level] enhancement [under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) ], not Alvarez\u2019s offense-related conduct, that dictated his sentence. Such a scheme is not [a] substantively reasonable scheme.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. Indeed, he makes a broad challenge to the sixteen-level enhancement, asserting that there are \u201cendemic problems with USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i),\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8, and that \u201cnearly any sentence that relies on [that] guideline is manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-13\">Mr. Alvarez identifies \u201ctwo primary shortcomings with \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i)\u201d: (1) the enhancement lacks \u201can articulated justification\u201d and (2) the enhancement \u201ccreates unwarranted sentencing disparities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 16. We address each of his arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-14\">I. Lack of Articulated Justification</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-15\">Mr. Alvarez explains the history and development of the sixteen-level enhancement and argues that the \u201cSentencing Commission has never explained why the 16-level enhancement exists nor how potential justifications \u2014 like concerns about recidivism \u2014 account for its design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. Mr. Alvarez further argues that this lack of an explanation causes the \u201cpractical problem\u201d in that \u201cdistrict courts cannot evaluate whether applying the enhancement effectively serves its intended purpose in a given case,\u201d and renders them \u201cunable to meaningfully exercise their <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>discretion, since they cannot discern the extent to which the enhancement executes or furthers the factors contained at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>In response, as the government argues, the Sentencing Commission was merely following Congressional policy to impose more severe <em>statutory </em>penalties on previously deported aliens with a criminal record, who illegally return to the United States. Thus, Mr. Alvarez\u2019s arguments really should be directed at Congress, not the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">Moreover, a number of courts have explicitly rejected this same argument. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Padilla, </em>602 F.3d 802, 814 (7th Cir.2010) (\u201c[A] district court is not required to \u2018delve into the history of a guideline so that [it] can satisfy [it]self that the process that produced it was adequate to produce a good guideline.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Aguilar-Huerta, </em>576 F.3d 365, 368 (7th Cir.2009)), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 25, 2010, No. 10-5128); <em>United States v. Lopez-Reyes, </em>589 F.3d 667, 671 (3d Cir.2009) (\u201c[A] district court is not required to engage in \u2018independent analysis\u2019 of the empirical justifications and deliberative undertakings that led to a particular Guideline.\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. --\u25a0, 130 S.Ct. 2362, 176 L.Ed.2d 576 (2010) (quoted with approval in <em>United States v. Irazoqui-Leyva, </em>2010 WL 4055666, *2 (10th Cir. Oct.18, 2010) (unpublished)); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cIn appropriate cases, district courts certainly may disagree with the Guidelines for policy reasons and may adjust a sentence accordingly. But if they do not, we will not second-guess their decisions under a more lenient standard simply because the particular Guideline is not empirically-based.\u201d) (quoted with approval in <em>Irazoqui-Leyva, </em>2010 WL 4055666, at *2); <em>see also United States v. Flores-Escobar, </em>2010 WL 3910163, <em>*2 </em>(10th Cir. Oct.6, 2010) (unpublished) (\u201cTo the extent that [defendant] argues that the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) enhancement is simply too punitive, such an argument is unpersuasive.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ruiz-Terrazas, </em>477 F.3d 1196, 1204 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201c[W]e have routinely upheld as reasonable the use of prior convictions to calculate both the criminal history category and a sentence enhancement, where ... the Guidelines authorize it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-8\">We agree with those statements and reject Mr. Alvarez\u2019s argument that the enhancement is invalid because it lacks a specific explanation and justification by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>2010 WL 4262020, *6 (10th Cir. Oct.29, 2010) (\u201c[T]he district court has no obligation to duplicate the efforts of the Sentencing Commission or Congress and decide what guidelines policy it would impose if it were the sole decision-maker.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-9\">II. Enhancement Creates Unwarranted Disparities</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">The second \u201cproblem\u201d Mr. Alvarez identifies in the use of the sixteen-level enhancement is that it creates unwarranted disparities in three ways: (1) it makes no distinction based on the length of the prior sentence, as long as it exceeds thirteen months; (2) it makes no distinction based on the type or quantity of the drug involved in the earlier trafficking conviction; and (3) it makes no distinction based on the defendant\u2019s role in the prior offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">As the government points out, these arguments would not, in fact, affect Mr. Alvarez\u2019s sentence, since he received a four-year sentence for his prior conviction <em>(i.e., </em>not the minimum thirteen-month sentence), the drug involved in his prior conviction was methamphetamine, an indisputably dangerous drug, and his prior conviction followed a search of his residence in which drugs were found (as well as on his person and in his car).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>Moreover, we do not necessarily conclude that a conviction for marijuana possession, for example, is necessarily and in all cases a less severe crime than possession of another drug. And the thirteen-month minimum sentence required for the prior aggravated felony ensures that the crime was serious and significant, no matter what the actual sentence. We accordingly reject Mr. Alvarez\u2019s argument that the enhancement creates unwarranted disparities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">III. Substantive Reasonableness of Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">There is no other basis upon which Mr. Alvarez may successfully challenge the reasonableness of his sentence. When evaluating the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we \u201cafford substantial deference to [the] district court[],\u201d and determine \u201cwhether the length of the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>610 F.3d 1216, 1227 (10th Cir.) (further quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 543, 178 L.Ed.2d 399 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-8\"> In imposing Mr. Alvarez\u2019s sentence at the bottom of the guideline range, the district court considered the fact that Mr. Alvarez had already been deported twice to Mexico, and returned illegally after each deportation. <em>See Chavez-Suarez, </em>597 F.3d at 1139 (noting with approval the district court\u2019s consideration of \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s past illegal reentries\u201d). \u201cAbsent any contrary indication in the record, [we] ... presume that a district court properly considered the pertinent statutory factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Rose, </em>185 F.3d 1108, 1111 (10th Cir.1999). There is no basis for concluding that the experienced district court judge did not consider all the 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-9\">Further, as indicated above, since the sentence imposed was within the applicable guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Mumma, </em>509 F.3d 1239, 1243 (10th Cir. 2007). While that presumption is rebuttable, Mr. Alvarez has failed to convince us that the presumption should be discarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1169-9\">.
