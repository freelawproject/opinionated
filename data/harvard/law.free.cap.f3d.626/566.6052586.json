On appeal, Turner argues that the district court erred in applying a five-level sentencing enhancement for engaging in a \u201cpattern of activity\u201d involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5). Turner also contends that his 300-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">\n<em>A. Offense Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Turner subscribed to a website from which he purchased child pornography. Unbeknownst to Turner, the website was part of a nationwide undercover project, called Operation Thin Ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">On February 18, 2009, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) agents obtained and executed a search warrant for Turner\u2019s residence, including his computer. The ICE agents found computer media, including one hard drive used to receive images of child pornography and another hard drive that contained images of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Turner was present during the search. Afterward, Turner voluntarily spoke to the agents and confessed to using the Internet to receive and possess images of child pornography. Subsequent forensic examination of Turner\u2019s computer media revealed over 600 images of child pornography, some of which depicted sado-masochistic images involving children under the age of twelve engaging in sexual acts with adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">\n<em>B. Presentence Investigation Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">The revised Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended: (1) a base offense level of 22, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a)(2); (2) a two-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l), because Turner did not intend to distribute the child pornography; (3) a three-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility; (4) a two-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2), because the offense involved a prepubescent minor or a minor who had not attained the age of twelve; (5) a four-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4), because the materials portrayed sadistic or masochistic conduct; (6) a two-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6), because the offense involved the use of a computer; and (7) a five-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D), because the offense involved more than 600 images.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">The revised PSI also recommended a five-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5), because Turner previously had been convicted of sexually abusing a minor female from the age of two to the age of four. According to the revised PSI\u2019s criminal history section, Turner was convicted of first degree sexual assault in Alabama state court in 1990. At the time of Turner\u2019s conviction, the minor female victim was approximately seven or eight years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">Although the Alabama state court in 2009 could not provide further details of this offense, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office received a statement from the victim, who is now an adult. The victim reported that between the approximate ages of two and five, she was sexually abused by Turner \u201con numerous occasions.\u201d Turner, who was the best friend of the victim\u2019s father, would enter her house at night and molest her. The victim\u2019s statement described in detail the molestation that occurred \u201cmost nights,\u201d how she eventually told her parents, the ensuing investigation and trial and the effect Turner\u2019s abuse has had on her life.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e), the revised PSI did not assign criminal history points for the 1990 sexual abuse conviction because the sentence was imposed more than fifteen years before the commencement of the child pornography offenses. However, due to the 1990 sexual abuse conviction, Turner\u2019s statutory mandatory minimum was fifteen years and his statutory maximum was forty years for count one and his statutory mandatory minimum was ten years and his statutory maximum was twenty years for count two. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) &amp; (2) (imposing increased mandatory minimum and maximum sentences if the defendant has, <em>inter alia, </em>a prior state conviction for aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">With a total offense level of 35 and a criminal history category of I, the revised PSI calculated an initial guidelines range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, because of the fifteen-year statutory mandatory minimum for count one, the revised PSI noted that Turner\u2019s advisory guidelines range became 180 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.l(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Turner objected to the five-level \u201cpattern of activity\u201d enhancement. Turner ar: gued that his 1990 sexual abuse conviction was too isolated and attenuated to, and too substantively different from, the current offense to constitute a pattern of activity. However, Turner did not contend that the details of the sexual abuse were inaccurate or object to the factual statements as to the 1990 sexual abuse conviction in the revised PSI\u2019s criminal history section.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\n<em>C. Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">At sentencing, Turner reasserted his objection to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5)\u2019s five-level \u201cpattern of activity\u201d enhancement. Turner argued that his nearly twenty-year-old sexual abuse conviction was too remote to constitute part of a \u201cpattern of activity\u201d of sexual abuse and that the phrase \u201cpattern of activity\u201d was vague. Turner also pointed out that the victim was four years old when the sexual abuse occurred and was making her statement twenty years later. Although Turner did not object to the factual details of the sexual abuse offense, he asked the court to \u201ctake that into consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">The district court noted that the victim \u201cclearly recalled\u201d a \u201cgreat amount of the details\u201d and that Turner was actually convicted of the offense in 1990 (at which time the female victim was seven or eight years old). The district court overruled Turner\u2019s objection and found that the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) five-level enhancement was applicable. The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s factual statements and guidelines calculations and found that the advisory guidelines range was 180 to 210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">In mitigation, Turner pointed to the accessibility of child pornography on the Internet and contended that he was not a bad person. Turner personally apologized for his behavior and expressed regret. Turner asked for concurrent sentences of fifteen years on count one and ten years on count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">Before imposing a sentence, the district court emphasized the seriousness of Turner\u2019s offense, that Turner had paid to obtain this child pornography and that Turner was paying for a third party to abuse a small child for his pleasure, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-13\">... [T]he thing is that folks that actively pursue child pornography on the Internet, downloading it, viewing it, getting it, which I know that you went to a website that was at least, I believe this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>is right, went to a web site that was a government sting operation and obtained, I assume paid for - - did he pay for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">[Prosecutor]: Yes, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">The Court: That, you know, if that had not been a government web site and you had done that, then you paying for those images would have been you paying for someone else to abuse a small child for your pleasure, and that\u2019s a shame. And it\u2019s not something that our society should or can permit to exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The district court noted that it had seen studies suggesting people who abuse small children are less likely to change. The district court stated that it did not know if that was true or not and expressed hope that Turner could change. The district court explained that the fact that Turner had \u201cactually done something with a child before\u201d made Turner \u201cmore dangerous to society, dangerous to children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The district court considered the advisory guidelines range of 180 to 210 months, but found it \u201cinsufficient to accomplish the goals of the federal statutes.\u201d The district court then imposed the mandatory minimum 180-month sentence on count one and the mandatory minimum 120-month sentence on count two, to be served consecutively, for a total sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court also imposed supervised release for Turner\u2019s lifetime, with various special conditions of supervised release, such as limiting Turner\u2019s contact with minors and requiring Turner to register as a sex offender and to participate in the Probation Office\u2019s computer restriction monitoring program and mental health treatment program for sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The district court further explained that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors in determining an appropriate sentence. The district court stressed, in particular, the nature and circumstances of the offense, Turner\u2019s history and characteristics, the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law and provide just punishment and the need to deter Turner. In its written Statement of Reasons, the district court reasserted these factors as the reason for imposing a sentence above the advisory guidelines range. The district court added that Turner had a conviction for abusing a very young child, and his instant offense was for pornography involving very young children. Turner filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">\n<em>A. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AgN\">[1,2] Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, \u201c[i]f the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor,\u201d the defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by five. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5). The commentary defines \u201c[p]attern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">any combination of two or more separate instances of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor by the defendant, whether or not the abuse or exploitation (A) occurred during the course of the offense; (B) involved the same minor; or (C) resulted in a conviction for such conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 cmt. n. 1. The commentary excludes from the definition of \u201csexual abuse or exploitation\u201d the \u201cpossession, accessing with intent to view, receipt, or trafficking in material relating to the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\u201cThe government bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2006). However, \u201c[i]t is the law of this circuit that a failure to object to allegations of fact in a PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes.\u201d <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Here, Turner did not object to the revised PSI\u2019s factual allegations that he sexually abused a very small child \u201cnumerous times\u201d over a period of two or three years, which resulted in his 1990 conviction in Alabama state court for first degree sexual abuse. Thus, these facts are deemed admitted for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Further, the admitted facts are sufficient to establish a \u201cpattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5). Turner\u2019s undisputed sexual abuse of the little girl \u201cnumerous times\u201d involved more than two separate instances. Indeed, according to the statement of the victim, who is now an adult, it occurred \u201cmost nights\u201d over the two- or three-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Turner\u2019s argument that the \u201cpattern of activity\u201d must be between the past sexual abuse and the current offense lacks merit. The commentary to \u00a7 2G2.2 specifically excludes from the definition of \u201csexual abuse or exploitation of a minor\u201d the receipt or possession of \u201cmaterial relating to the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 cmt. n. 1. In other words, Turner\u2019s current offenses of receipt and possession of child pornography cannot be considered in determining whether he has engaged in a pattern of activity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Turner alternatively argues that his 1990 sexual abuse conviction is too remote in time to constitute a \u201cpattern of activity.\u201d This Court has explained that the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 defining the phrase \u201cpattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor\u201d permits the sentencing court to consider \u201cconduct unrelated to the offenses of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderton, </em>136 F.3d 747, 751 (11th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, we have not addressed whether U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) has a temporal limitation on unrelated conduct that is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">The five circuits that have addressed this question have consistently concluded that the plain language of \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) does not place a time limit on past instances of sexual abuse or exploitation a court may consider in finding a pattern of activity. <em>See United States v. Olfano, </em>503 F.3d 240, 243 (3d Cir.2007) (involving convictions approximately 16 and 13 years old); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>United States v. Garner, </em>490 F.3d 739, 742-43 (9th Cir.2007) (involving sexual abuse occurring \u201cat least 35 years earlier\u201d); <em>United States v. Gawthrop, </em>310 F.3d 405, 412-14 (6th Cir.2002) (involving an 11-year-old conviction); <em>United States v. Woodward, </em>277 F.3d 87, 90-92 (1st Cir. 2002) (involving multiple convictions between 22 and 27 years old); <em>United States v. Lovaas, </em>241 F.3d 900, 903-04 (7th Cir. 2001) (involving sexual abuse that occurred 26 years earlier).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We agree with our sister circuits. \u201c[A] guideline\u2019s meaning is derived first from its plain language and, absent ambiguity, no additional inquiry is necessary.\u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 1012 (11th Cir.2008). Nothing in \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) or its commentary suggests that the \u201cpattern of activity\u201d must be temporally close to the offense of conviction. Under the plain terms of the commentary, the only requirements for establishing a \u201cpattern of activity\u201d are two or more instances of sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor that are separate from one another. Turner\u2019s repeated sexual abuse of a little girl over several years in the late 1980s more than satisfies those requirements. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the five-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\n<em>B. Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Turner argues that the district court\u2019s decision to run his 180-month and 120-month sentences consecutively, for a total 300-month sentence, was substantively unreasonable. We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. Id<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). The district court also considers the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as to each offense when determining whether imprisonment terms should be imposed concurrently or consecutively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">\u201cIf, after correctly calculating the guidelines range, a district court decides that a sentence outside that range is appropriate, it must \u2018consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Likewise, although \u201c[s]entences outside the guidelines are not presumed to be unreasonable, ... we may take the extent of any variance into our calculus.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). However, we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Here, the total 300-month sentence represented a 90-month variance from the high end of the advisory guidelines range of 180 to 210 months. Turner has not met his burden to show that this upward variance was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Turner\u2019s offenses were extremely serious. Turner received over the Internet and then stored on his hard drive over 600 images of child pornography. Some of these images depicted children under the age of twelve engaging in sexual contact with adults that was sado-masochistic in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Turner emphasizes that he did not produce or distribute the child pornography and characterizes his involvement in the exploitation of the children depicted as indirect. When Turner subscribed to the undercover website, he purchased additional images of child pornography. As the district court noted (and this Court has recognized), receiving and possessing child pornography helps create a market for more pornography, encouraging the victimization of more children. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Furthermore, as the district court explained, Turner poses a more dangerous threat to society than many child pornography defendants given his history of actually abusing a small child and the increased recidivism of child sexual abusers. Although Turner argues that his 1990 sexual abuse conviction was already taken into account through the application of \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5)\u2019s five-level enhancement, the district court was not precluded from also considering it under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007) (rejecting argument that because conduct was considered in imposing guidelines enhancement, it could not be considered under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing an upward variance). Under the totality of the circumstances, and giving due deference to the district court\u2019s determination that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justified the 90-month variance, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in imposing a total 300-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-11\">. The initial PSI did not recommend the five-level \u201cpattern of activity\u201d enhancement because the details of the 1990 sexual abuse conviction were not available. The government objected, arguing that the enhancement should apply and submitted the victim's statement providing the details of the sexual abuse and its impact on the victim. A subsequent addendum to the PSI adopted the government\u2019s position on the enhancement. The revised PSI included the details of the sexual abuse and applied the five-level \u201cpattern of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>activity\u201d enhancement. Turner did not object to these factual details in the revised PSI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\">.
