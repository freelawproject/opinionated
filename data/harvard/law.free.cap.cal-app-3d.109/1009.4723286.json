J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEE\">Defendant was convicted by a jury of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211) and of using a firearm in the commission of the crime (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5). Defendant admitted a prior 1972 conviction under Penal Code section 211 and was sentenced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">On appeal, defendant raises issues of unlawful search and seizure and of entitlement to behavior (good time) and participation (work time) credit for presentence time spent in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">On December 1, 1977, defendant and another male, both wearing ski masks and carrying guns, entered the Capitol Federal Savings and Loan at 2717 Marconi Avenue in Sacramento County.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Defendant wore a navy blue ski mask with gold trim. The other man wore a lavender ski mask. Despite the blue ski mask, the bank tellers were able to tell that defendant was a young white male of average height and build. The man in the lavender mask waited near the door with a drawn gun while defendant robbed each teller.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">During the robbery, one teller triggered the silent alarm system, which notified law enforcement agencies and activated the bank surveillance cameras. One camera took an exposed profile shot of defendant removing the navy blue ski mask as he exited the bank. The lavender ski mask was subsequently recovered in the immediate area of the savings and loan by an FBI agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Defendant was arrested on a Vehicle Code violation on the night of the robbery; at that time his clothing was confiscated. Several days later, defendant became a suspect in the robbery and his blue jeans were sent to the FBI laboratory for analysis. At trial, an expert witness testified that fibers from the lavender ski mask and also navy blue synthetic fibers were found on the blue jeans worn by defendant when arrested on the night of the robbery. An expert witness also testified to the similarity of defendant\u2019s features with those depicted in the surveillance photograph and the similarity of the \u201cwear pattern\u201d of defendant\u2019s blue jeans to those in the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Defendant contends the evidence obtained from the laboratory analysis of his blue jeans should have been excluded under the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>Amendment since it was obtained without a search warrant and was the fruit of an unreasonable search and seizure. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">He assumes that since he was on searchable parole following a 1972 robbery conviction, a \u201csearch\u201d (examination of his blue jeans) was undertaken pursuant to the parole search agreement and argues extensively that (a) the waiver allowing the search of property \u201cunder my control\u201d was not applicable since the proper interpretation of the word \u201ccontrol\u201d excluded his jeans in the jail property room, and (b) the search was primarily for \u201claw enforcement\u201d and not \u201cparole administration\u201d and was therefore not permissible under the parole consent and constituted a violation of his Fourth Amendment protection against unlawful search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The argument is a fruitless exercise in semantics as it ignores the long-standing principle that a warrantless search of a person at booking and seizure of his property is reasonable. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 800, 802-804 [39 L.Ed.2d 771, 774-776, 94 S.Ct. 1234]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 64, 70 [60 Cal.Rptr. 254, 429 P.2d 606], revd. on other grounds <em>sub nom., Ross </em>v. <em>California </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 470 [20 L.Ed.2d 750, 88 S.Ct. 1850].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">It will be recalled that defendant\u2019s blue jeans were taken from him when he was booked in the Sacramento County jail. The jeans were retained with defendant\u2019s personal property until they were relinquished to the FBI laboratory for testing and analysis. The FBI was able to identify fibers from the ski mask on the jeans.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">\u201c\u2018Once articles have lawfully fallen into the hands of the police they may examine them to see if they have been stolen, test them to see if they have been used in the commission of a crime, return them to the prisoner on his release, or preserve them for use as evidence at the time of trial. [Citation.] During their period of police custody an arrested person\u2019s personal effects, like his person itself, are subject to reasonable inspection, examination, and test.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Remiro </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 809, 835 [153 Cal.Rptr. 89], citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 384, 389-390 [50 Cal.Rptr. 559].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Defendant\u2019s constitutional right against unlawful search and seizure was not impinged. The trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">If otherwise eligible, defendant is entitled to behavior and participation credits attributable to his presentence time in local custody. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sage </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 498 [165 Cal.Rptr. 280, 611 P.2d 874].) The computation of such conduct credits is, with respect to a defendant who has already been sentenced, an administrative function to be performed by the Department of Corrections. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sage, supra; </em>see also Cal. Dept. of Corrections, Admin. Bull. No. 80/11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Evans, J., and Finney, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 29, 1980. Bird, C. J., and Tobriner, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
