Lindsey (Lindsey), appeals from a judgment against him and in favor of respondent, County of Los Angeles (County), which was entered after the trial of a \u201cdeclaratory relief\u201d action brought by Lindsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Lindsey filed a complaint against the County seeking declaratory relief. By stipulation all the allegations of the complaint were admitted except paragraph 12, which set forth Lindsey\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The admitted portions of the complaint set forth: that Lindsey was injured in an automobile accident and needed care and treatment by reason of his injuries; that County provided the care and rendered a statement of account therefore in the sum of $27,688.79; that Lindsey commenced legal action against the third party who injured him, incurred the expense of the litigation and that County did not participate in the litigation; that there was never any source, funds or means of payment on the part of Lindsey for the costs and charges of the County except his cause of action against the third party and the proceeds therefrom; that recovery was had by settlement with the third party; that the County claimed a lien in the full amount of $27,688.79.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">Lindsey sought an adjudication that he had created the fund and justice and equity required the County to bear a portion of the total costs and expense of the litigation, including attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Judgment was entered that Lindsey \u201ctake nothing\u201d by reason of his complaint and that the County have judgment against him in the sum of $27,688.79 plus interest. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were made. The court concluded that Government Code section 23004 allowed the County to recover by way of lien in a third party action; that the section did not allow for attorney fees to Lindsey; that the common fund rationale for attorney fees was not applicable and Lindsey\u2019s claim for attorney fees was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Lindsey contends that under the common fund doctrine, the County should pay a proportionate share of the attorney fees from the sum of $27,688.79, which the County would receive from the settlement. The County contends that the common fund doctrine is not applicable and that the County is entitled to recover the whole sum of $27,688.79 by reason of the lien it has upon Lindsey\u2019s recovery, which arises from Government Code section 23004.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Lindsey further contends that he is entitled to a full declaration of his rights in the judgment; not just that he \u201ctake nothing\u201d by reason of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The common fund doctrine is not applicable in the present matter. Lindsey\u2019s position is that of a debtor and the County\u2019s is that of a creditor. By reason of such debtor-creditor relationship, the County is entitled to recover the full sum of its lien without contribution or apportionment for attorney fees. Judgment was proper in both form and content.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">1. <em>Lindsey is Not Entitled to Apportionment of Attorney Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">The cases out of which the common fund doctrine originated each involved three common elements: (1) without the litigation there would have been no recovery; (2) the recovery was an available fund out of which the beneficiaries of the litigation would be paid; and (3) the applicant seeking contribution in respect to costs and attorney fees was the sole \u201cactive litigant\u201d and as such obtained the recovery that provided the. fund. <em>(Glendale City Employees\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 328, 341, fn. 19 [124 Cal.Rptr. 513, 540 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>P.2d 609]; <em>Estate of Stauffer </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 124, 132 [346 P.2d 748]; <em>Estate of Reade </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 669, 671-672 [191 P.2d 745]; <em>Estate of Kann </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 212, 223 [61 Cal.Rptr. 122].)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Attorney fees were allowed the \u201cactive litigant\u201d in such matters so as \u201cto compel those for whose benefit the action or proceeding was taken to bear their share of the expenses of the litigation...\u201d <em>(Estate of Reade, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d at p. 672; <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Harold G. Ferguson Corp. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 274, 277 [153 P.2d 714]), thu\u00a7 preventing an unfair advantage by the others who were entitled to share in the fund. Such allowance of attorney fees also afforded an encouragement for the attorney for the successful litigant so that he would therefore be more willing to undertake and diligently prosecute the litigation to a successful termination. <em>(Estate of Stauffer, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d at p. 132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The theory of the common fund doctrine was extended to third-party suits as \u201cequitable apportionment.\u201d In <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 162, 166-167 [124 Cal.Rptr. 1, 539 P.2d 761], an injured worker sued and recovered a judgment from a negligent third party; from this judgment the employer recouped the amount he had paid the employee in compensation benefits. The court held that the employee\u2019s attorney was entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the employer based upon the services rendered in recouping the amount the employer had paid in compensation benefits. The court predicated its holding \u201cupon the equitable principle of apportionment long applied by the courts and upon the Legislature\u2019s incorporation of such principle into section 3856....\u201d of the Labor Code. <em>(Quinn </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>at p. 166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Similar recovery for attorney fees under the provision of section 3856 of the Labor Code has been provided for when the employee was the active litigant and the employer was the passive beneficiary. (See <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 700, 712-713 [145 Cal.Rptr. 219].)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The doctrine of equitable apportionment of attorney fees has extended to third-party suits where medical treatment has been given in respect to a work-related injury <em>(Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (California School for the Deaf) </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 413, 417-418 [148 Cal.Rptr. 54], and <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Brennan) </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 493 [154 Cal.Rptr. 760]) and to a nonwork related injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>where the right of subrogation exists. <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 458, 469 [129 Cal.Rptr. 271].)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The present case has distinctive differences from each of the previously cited cases. Health and Safety Code section 1473<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> makes the patient liable to the County for the reasonable value of the medical care and treatment furnished. Government Code section 23004.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that the County shall have a right to recover from third persons the reasonable value of the care and treatment furnished and in the event the injured party or his representatives brings an action for damages against the third person who is liable for the injuries, the County\u2019s right of action abates during the pendency of such action and continues as a lien against any judgment recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In the present matter a debtor-creditor relationship exists between Lindsey and the County; Lindsey was primarily liable to the County for the sum of $27,688.79. Such a relationship did not exist in any of the cases arising either under the common fund doctrine or the equitable contribution theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In the common fund cases, the applicant for attorney fees and the parties from whom fees were sought were similarly situated with mutual interests in and mutual rights to proceed and recover the sums representing the fund which they shared. In the equitable contribution cases, the \u201cpassive beneficiary\u201d did not have a remedy against the \u201cactive litigant.\u201d The most they had was a lien that was confined to any recovery that the \u201cactive litigant\u201d had against a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number><em>Quinn </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pages 168-169, footnote 10, noted the limitation in respect to the debtor-creditor relationship stating, \u201cWe would dispel in passing a confusion engendered by the defendant\u2019s characterization of himself as a mere lien creditor. While the statute uses this term to describe the employer\u2019s rights in any actual recovery by the worker, the words \u2018lien creditor\u2019 are misleading, for unlike the usual lien creditor, the employer\u2019s rights here depend entirely upon the worker\u2019s <em>success </em>in his third-party suit. Should he lose, the \u2018lien\u2019 evaporates....\u201d (Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The reason for apportionment of attorney fees that exists under the common fund theory does not exist in the matter at bench as there is no taking advantage of the active litigant as existed in the common fund cases. <em>(Estate of Stauffer, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d 124, 132; <em>Estate of Reade, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d 669, 671-672; <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Harold G. Ferguson Corp., supra, </em>25 Cal.2d 274, 283-286.) In the present matter the \u201cactive litigant\u201d was directly liable to the County and that liability existed irrespective of the success of the third-party suit. Further, in the present case the County had a right to go directly against the third party to recover the costs of Lindsey\u2019s medical care, except that the right abated and a lien was substituted when Lindsey proceeded against the third party as an active litigant. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 23004.1, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The obligation for which the County had a lien was a debt owed by Lindsey to the County and was payable without reduction for attorney fees. Lindsey was fortunate in that he recovered the sum he owed from the third party and thus relieved himself of the obligation. The obligation from which Lindsey was relieved was one that could have been satisfied out of property which Lindsey acquired after the obligation against him accrued. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 17403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Lindsey cites <em>Neil D. Reid, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Health Care Services </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 418, in support of his position in respect to apportionment of attorney fees. The <em>Neil D. Reid </em>matter did not involve a common fund theory; the apportionment of attorney fees was made by reason of Welfare and Institutions Code section 14117 which provided that the lien may be enforced \u201cin the same manner, with the same rights and authority... and to the same extent provided in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 3850), Part 1, Division 4 of the Labor Code... . \u201d Thus the statutory provisions for apportionment of attorney fees provided for in section 3856 of the Labor Code applied. Such statutory provisions do not apply to the matter at bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>2. <em>The Form of the Judgment Adopted by the Trial Court Was Proper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Lindsey contends that the judgment is improper in the instant matter in that it should \u201cexpressly declare the parties\u2019 rights\u201d instead of the provision that \u201cPlaintiff.. .take nothing by reason of his complaint filed herein.\u201d Both the claim of Lindsey and the claim of the County were matured claims. The fact that Lindsey\u2019s counsel chose to have his name placed on the check in the sum of $27,688.79 as payee, along with the name of the County, does not change the fact that the contended right to contribution had either matured or did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">At the time the instant matter was filed, Lindsey had acknowledged the County\u2019s lien but claimed a right to offset a part of his attorney\u2019s fees. The County had denied such right. \u201c\u2018[Declaratory procedure operates prospectively, and not merely for the redress of past wrongs.\u2019\u201d <em>(Watson </em>v. <em>Sansone </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 1, 3 [96 Cal.Rptr. 387], quoting <em>Babb </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 841, 848 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379].) At the time of the judgment, the result of an adjudication contrary to Lindsey\u2019s claim was that he was liable to the County for the full amount of its lien claim. The judgment effectively so declared by giving the County judgment for such amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Klein, P. J., and Potter, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 19, 1980.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-12\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-13\"> In payment of the settlement the third party gave two checks to Lindsey\u2019s attorney one of which was in the sum of $27,688.79 payable to the County and counsel for Lindsey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\"> Section 1473 of the Health and Safety Code provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe board of supervisors in each county may fix the rates to be charged patients admitted to any county hospital and may direct any county officer to collect the amounts due the county for hospitalization and medical care....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Section 23004.1 of the Government Code provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJj\">\u201c(a).. .in any case in which the county is authorized or required by law to furnish hospital, medical, surgical, or dental care and treatment,... to a person who is injured or suffers a disease, under circumstances creating a tort liability upon some third person to pay damages therefor, the county shall have a right to recover from said third person the reasonable value of the care and treatment so furnished....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak8\">\u201c(b)....
