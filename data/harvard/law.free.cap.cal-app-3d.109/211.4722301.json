J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azp\">Petitioner County of Santa Barbara (County) contends: (1) no substantial evidence supports the finding by respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) that County discriminated against respondent Robert Bouslaugh, in violation of Labor Code section 132a;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) the Board erred in finding Bouslaugh entitled to vocational rehabilitation pursuant to Labor Code section 139.5 without first referring the issue to the Rehabilitation Bureau of the Division of Industrial Accidents (of the Department of Industrial Relations) as provided by California Administrative Code, title 8, chapter 4.5, sub-chapter 1, section 10007; and (3) the Board erred in failing to issue specific findings on the issues of industrial injury and permanent disability. Reconsideration was denied. We find substantial evidence supports the award of increased benefits pursuant to Labor Code section 132a. We conclude, however, that the Board did err in the procedure followed in finding Bouslaugh entitled to vocational rehabilitation benefits and in failing to make certain findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Bouslaugh claims multiple industrial injuries in the course of his employment as a deputy sheriff for County: (1) a specific spinal injury on November 1, 1971; (2) a specific spinal injury in December of 1973; (3) a specific injury to the head and spine on January 31, 1977; (4) cumulative trauma injury to his spine during his entire period of employment for County from November 1, 1969, through September 30, 1977 (the date Bouslaugh last worked for County); and (5) cumulative trauma hearing injury. County admits the specific injuries of 1971, and 1977, but denies the cumulative injuries and the 1973 specific injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">On February 6, 1978, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) found Bouslaugh to be totally temporarily disabled from the 1977 injury from October 1, 1977, through February 1, 1978, and continuing. Bouslaugh, a peace officer, was entitled to be paid compensation measured by his salary as a peace officer. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4850; <em>Hawthorn </em>v. <em>City of Beverly Hills </em>(1952) 111 Cal.App.2d 723, 728-729 [245 P.2d 352].)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Labor Code Section 132a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">On December 7, 1977, after Bouslaugh had advised County that it appeared unlikely that his injuries would permit him to return to work, he was \u201cdemoted\u201d from the position of \u201cDeputy Sheriff II\u201d to \u201cDeputy Sheriff I.\u201d This demotion, reassignment, retransfer, reclassification or whatever it was, was the vehicle for reducing the amount of compensation Bouslaugh was receiving under section 4850.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">County\u2019s position is that there was no technical demotion, but that Bouslaugh was simply reassigned because his disability precluded his functioning in the position of deputy sheriff II. Therefore, no impermissible discrimination under section 132a was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">The position of deputy sheriff II was created by the County in 1972. It is not a classified position, but rather an assignment to certain specialized duties. It does, however, involve a 5 percent pay increase so long as the deputy holds the assignment. The deputy assigned as a deputy sheriff II may be transferred to another position where (1) he is promoted to a higher duty, (2) he requests reassignment, (3) he performs unsatisfactorily, and (4) whenever, in the judgment of the sheriff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u201cit is in the best interests\u201d of the department that reassignment be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">In November 1977\u2014just before Bouslaugh\u2019s demotion, the department adopted a policy that any employee likely to be certified as unfit for an extended period, would be transferred to the \u201cunassigned for medical reasons\u201d unit. Any deputy II thus transferred becomes a deputy I and the deputy II position is available for his replacement, if any. It was under that policy that Bouslaugh became a deputy I.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The WCJ received much testimony concerning the practices of the department with respect to disabled deputies and, in particular, heard a great deal about one Deputy Larry Gold who, though apparently quite disabled, had continued to receive his deputy II salary, albeit before the November 1977 policy went into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">A great deal of that testimony is beside the point. The issue is not whether Bouslaugh was discriminated against vis-a-vis another similarly situated deputy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, as we see it, the question is much more simple: was Bouslaugh the victim of discrimination prohibited by section 132a as authoritatively explained and interpreted in <em>Judson Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 658 [150 Cal.Rptr. 250, 586 P.2d 564]. We think that the finding to that effect must, under familiar principles, be upheld. <em>(Id., </em>pp. 664-665.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The WCJ found specifically: \u201c[A] reduction in status, as well as pay post-injury, entirely because of the disability caused by the injury, is a discrimination protected against by Labor Code Section 132(a) <em>[sic\\. </em>...\u201d We entirely agree. In <em>Judson Steel </em>the Board\u2019s finding was that \u201cthe applicant was penalized solely because he missed more than twelve months of work due to an industrial injury. Accordingly the penalty that was imposed upon the applicant was one that occurred under circumstances prohibited by Labor Code Section 132 [a].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">We freely admit that here, as in <em>Judson Steel, </em>there is no evidence that the employer violated any of the specific prohibitions of section 132a. In other words, nothing suggests that the County penalized Bouslaugh for availing himself of the remedies of the workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>law. Yet here, as in <em>Judson Steel, </em>the action taken against the employee fits comfortably into the preamble on the basis of which <em>Judson Steel </em>was decided: \u201cIt is the declared policy of this state that there should not be discrimination against workers who are injured in the course and scope of their employment.\u201d The November 1977 order of the department made such discrimination a matter of policy even though, as noted (see fn. 2 <em>ante) </em>it treated all disabilities\u2014industrial and nonindustrial\u2014alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The issue of vocational rehabilitation was first placed in issue by the WCJ at the hearing of February 21, 1979. In his decision of March 6, 1979, the WCJ found that Bouslaugh was \u201cin need of and interested in rehabilitation at the expense\u201d of County. The WCJ accordingly awarded Bouslaugh temporary disability until his rehabilitation was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">County correctly asserts that the WCJ erred in awarding any rehabilitation benefits without referring the matter to the rehabilitation unit of the Division of Industrial Accidents as required by California Administrative Code, title 8, chapter 4.5, subchapter 1, article 12. (Rehab. Regulations.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">By enacting Labor Code section 139.5 the Legislature delegated to the Administrative Director of the Division of Industrial Accidents the duty to establish the administrative process to regulate the mandatory provision of vocational rehabilitation to qualified workers. To this end the administrative director has established the rehabilitation unit (Bureau) within the Division of Industrial Accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The question of vocational rehabilitation was first raised at a hearing before the WCJ. At the time of the WCJ\u2019s decision section 10007 of the Rehab. Regulations provided: \u201cAll matters regarding rehabilitation plans and programs shall be initially submitted to the Bureau except those arising in cases before a [judge] of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board where injury is in issue, or where the question of need for rehabilitation first arises during the course of a proceeding on other issues. [11] <em>Where the question of need for vocational rehabilitation first arises in a proceeding before a </em>[judge] <em>of the Appeals Board, this </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>question shall be referred by the </em>[judge] <em>to the Bureau for its recommendation.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The WCJ erred in failing to make the required referral to the Bureau.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Failure to Make Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">County\u2019s final contention is that the WCJ erred in failing to make findings of fact on the questions of injury, permanent disability and apportionment. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5313.) Relying upon <em>Tangye </em>v. <em>Henry C. Beck &amp; Co. </em>(Board en banc opinion, 1978) 43 Cal.Comp.Cases 3, the WCJ reasoned that he was not required to make such findings since Bouslaugh was awarded temporary disability related to vocational rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Irrespective of how the Supreme Court decides the <em>Webb </em>and <em>San Diego Transit Corp. </em>cases pending before it and the possible impact upon <em>Tangye, Tangye </em>refers only to the deferral of the issues of permanent disability and apportionment. <em>Tangye </em>does not excuse the WCJ\u2019s failure to make findings of fact on the other disputed questions. Further, on the issues of permanent disability and apportionment thereof the Board has held that \u201ca permanent disability rating may properly be established while an applicant is seeking rehabilitation benefits <em>if rehabilitation benefits are not actually being received </em>or if neither party objects to the issue of permanent disability being tried and determined pending rehabilitation.\u201d <em>(Harklerod </em>v. <em>Young\u2019s Market Company </em>(Board en banc opinion, 1979) 44 Cal.Comp.Cases 561, 562. Italics added.) As Bouslaugh was not receiving rehabilitation benefits at the time of the WCJ\u2019s decision, the WCJ was accordingly not required to delay findings on permanent disability and apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Summary and Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The award of increased benefits to Bouslaugh under Labor Code section 132a is affirmed. The findings on rehabilitation benefits are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>annulled and remanded to the Board for compliance with Rehab. Regulations section 10007. The matter is also remanded to the Board to make the other necessary findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Stephens, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 8, 1980.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\"> Henceforth, unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Labor Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"> Nor does it matter that, in the words of the WCJ the \u201cDepartment seems to be designed to uniformly discriminate against Deputy II Sheriffs, and possibly others, irrespective of whether or not the disability arose from industrial or nonindustrial causes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b177-11\"> The date temporary disability, if any, should commence for purposes of vocational rehabilitation is a question we therefore need not reach. Accordingly, we are not required to comment upon this issue which is presently before the California Supreme Court in <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. </em>(S.F. 24094, hg. granted Nov. 28, 1979) and <em>San Diego Transit Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. </em>(L.A. 31193, hg. granted Nov. 28, 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
