Hickey appeals alleging his sentence was improperly enhanced by the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Hickey was convicted of kidnaping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207), lewd conduct with a child (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288) and oral copulation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288a, subd. (c)) on March 9, 1978, after a jury trial. He makes no complaint of the substantive or procedural propriety of the trial and asserts sentencing error only. By limiting the scope of our review we avoid detailed repetition of the unsavory details of the debauchment of a six-year-old boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Pleading of the Priors</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The information, as originally filed, alleged two prior felony convictions. The first pled the conviction in Fresno County Superior Court on October 10, 1969, of a violation of Penal Code section 288 (lewd conduct with a child)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and section 286 (sodomy). The second charged conviction on October 14, 1966,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the Court of Common Pleas, Miami County, Ohio, of sodomy, a felony. The record reveals that both priors were for offenses factually congruent with the current charges against appellant. Both were pled within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b), mandating a <em>one-year </em>enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">For reasons of prosecutorial discretion, or perhaps as a result of prosecutorial indiscretion, appellant\u2019s California and Ohio priors were not charged initially as violent felony priors under section 667.5, subdivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>sions (a) and (c), as they might have been.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both the prior convictions and the new conviction were for conduct denominated as \u201cviolent\u201d felonies in section 667.5, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Pretrial and Posttrial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">When initially arraigned, appellant pled not guilty and denied the priors. Three days before trial, he appeared before Judge Simon Marootian for a hearing on the priors. Fully advised of his constitutional rights and told that the consequences of his admission of the California prior would be a one-year enhancement of his sentence, he waived trial and admitted the prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">With respect to the Ohio prior, he waived his right to a jury trial, again having been advised that he was subject to a one-year enhancement of his sentence if the prior was found to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Appellant was reluctant to concede that time served in an Ohio mental institution counted as time served in prison to satisfy the requirement of subdivision (f) of section 667.5, that an out-of-state prior qualifies for enhancement only if \u201cthe defendant served one year or more in prison for such offense in the other jurisdiction.\u201d After a trial limited to this single issue, the court found the condition of one year of imprisonment satisfied and determined that the Ohio prior alleged was true. The question of whether the elements of this prior matched California requirements under the standard established by the second sentence of section 667.5, subdivision (f), was neither argued, considered, nor referred to in the decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The case was then confirmed for jury trial. It commenced March 7, 1978, before Judge Robert Z. Mardikian. At the conclusion of the trial, appellant Hickey was convicted of the three substantive offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Appellant appeared before Judge Mardikian for sentencing. The court found and determined that the underlying facts of both the California and Ohio priors, as revealed by the current probation report, came within the definition of \u201cviolent\u201d felonies. On the motion of the district attorney, and over the strenuous objection of appellant\u2019s trial counsel, the information was orally amended to plead both priors as \u201cviolent\u201d felonies within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivisions (a) and (c). No opportunity to admit or deny the new allegations was afforded appellant, nor was a further evidentiary hearing held.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The court proceeded to sentence appellant to an aggravated term for the kidnaping offense, five years in state prison, and stayed the sentence on the other two substantive offenses pending appeal. Having found that each of the prior convictions was for a \u201cviolent\u201d felony, the court sentenced appellant to consecutive terms of three years for each prior, for a total sentence of eleven years. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Appellant contends that (1) the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and California Constitutions preclude more than one-year enhancement for each prior; and (2) the finding of the truth of the Ohio prior is neither factually nor legally supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The People deny the applicability of the double jeopardy argument, concede that procedural irregularities require retrial of both enhancements, and assert that on retrial appellant may be subjected to a three-year-consecutive sentence for each prior conviction. They further contend that the trial court properly considered the factual basis of the Ohio prior as related in the probation report, and could also have considered the allegations of the 1964 Ohio information in determining that the prior constituted a \u201cviolent\u201d felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Rationale</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">We are mindful that the Legislature has stressed the need for enhancement of sentences where perpetrators of violent crimes have been previously convicted of offenses of like nature. This philosophy is manifested by an explanation of legislative intent affixed to section 667.5, subdivision (c)\u2014\u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that these specified crimes merit special consideration when imposing a sentence to display society\u2019s condemnation for such extraordinary crimes of violence against the person.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">It is in the light of such legislative guidance that the appellant\u2019s assertions of impropriety in the enhancing of his sentence must be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">I. Procedural Infirmity of the Enhancement Process</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Appellant makes no direct procedural objection to the pretrial proceedings by which he admitted the California prior and stood trial by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the court on the Ohio prior. His concern is directed primarily to the manner in which the one-year enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b), were transmuted by the post trial proceedings into three-year enhancements under subdivisions (a) and (c) of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The sentencing court failed to note that appellant had been specifically advised, before his plea and waiver that the consequences of such would result in a maximum one-year enhancement for each prior. Relying on this statement, appellant gave up substantial rights, and then found the consequence of his waivers to be a trebled sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In <em>In re Yurko </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 857 [112 Cal.Rptr. 513, 519 P.2d 516], the Supreme Court announced: \u201c[A]s a judicially declared rule of criminal procedure [citation] an accused, prior to the time the court accepts his admission of an allegation of a prior criminal conviction or convictions, is entitled to be advised:. . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\"><em>\u201c(2) of the precise increase in the term or terms which might be imposed, if any, in the accused\u2019s case pursuant to section 644 or other applicable statutes </em>(see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 666, 667);. . . \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 864.) (Italics added.) The <em>Yurko </em>requirements must be specifically and expressly met. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 637, 642 [160 Cal.Rptr. 607].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Clearly, appellant was misadvised as to both priors. As to the California prior, he waived his right to a judicial determination of its validity, relying on the court\u2019s statement of maximum enhancement of one year. With respect to the Ohio prior, he waived his right to have the prior tried by a jury, again relying on the fact that he had been charged with a \u201cnonviolent\u201d prior felony. The pretrial court, recognizing that such an enhancement is limited to a term of one additional year, inadvertently misled appellant to his ultimate detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The People concede these procedural mishaps, recognize them as constituting <em>Yurko </em>error, and recommend remanding both alleged priors to the trial court for further amendment to the information, a new plea, and if necessary, a limited retrial on the truth of the priors. Appellant resists this proposed disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>II. The Double Jeopardy Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Appellant contends that on remand and limited retrial, a sentence exceeding one year for each prior would be violative of the protection against double jeopardy afforded by the federal and state Constitutions. His position lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">First, the finding that appellant\u2019s prior convictions are true must be vitiated because of <em>Yurko </em>error in improperly advising him of the consequences of his plea on the enhancements. By granting this relief, we are in effect withdrawing appellant\u2019s plea to the California prior, and are setting aside the finding of truth of the Ohio prior. \u201c[T]he ends of justice require that the <em>status quo ante </em>be restored . . . . \u201d <em>(In re Sutherland </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 666, 672 [100 Cal.Rptr. 129, .493 P.2d 857].) (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Serrato </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 753, 765 [109 Cal.Rptr. 65, 512 P.2d 289]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schuler </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 324, 336 [142 Cal.Rptr. 798]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 801, 804-805 [136 Cal.Rptr. 241]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fisk </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 364, 372-373 [123 Cal.Rptr. 414]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Even though appellant carefully sidestepped allegations of <em>Yurko </em>error in this appeal, once he lays his cause at an appellate doorstep he subjects himself to thorough scrutiny of the proceedings below. \u201cIt is well established that when the trial court pronounces a sentence which is unauthorized by the Penal Code that sentence must be vacated and a proper sentence imposed whenever the mistake is appropriately brought to the attention of the trial court or the reviewing court. When the mistake is discovered while the defendant\u2019s appeal is pending, the appellate court should remand the case for a proper sentence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benton </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 92, 102 [161 Cal.Rptr. 12], relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Serrato, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d at p. 763; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cabral </em>(1975) 51 Cal. App.3d 707, 717-718 [124 Cal.Rptr. 418]; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Massengale </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 689, 693 [89 Cal.Rptr. 237].)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Second, if on retrial the findings as to the truth of the two prior convictions alleged are confirmed, any sentence on the priors other than the three years mandated in section 667.5, subdivision (a), is unauthorized and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">As this court held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Duran) </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 480 [148 Cal.Rptr. 698]: \u201cWithout discussing the possible double jeopardy implications a number of California cases support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>conclusion that: \u2018\u201cWhen a court pronounces a sentence which is unauthorized by the Penal Code, that sentence must be vacated and a proper sentence imposed whenever the mistake is appropriately brought to the attention of the court. [Citations.] If a trial court refuses to correct an illegal sentence, the People may obtain relief in the appellate court by writ of mandate. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Massengale, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 689, 693 [89 Cal.Rptr. 237].) Upon vacation of the unauthorized sentence, a proper judgment may be imposed, even though it is more severe than the sentence originally imposed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Serrato, </em>9 Cal.3d 753 [109 Cal.Rptr. 65, 512 P.2d 289].)\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Gon</em>zales), <em>supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d at [134] at p. 143.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u201cIn <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 349, 354 [93 Cal.Rptr. 257], the court, relying upon <em>Bozza </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1947) 330 U.S. 160 [91 L.Ed. 818, 67 S.Ct. 645], <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 352 U.S. 354, 361 [1 L.Ed.2d 393, 399, 77 S.Ct. 481], and <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C.Cir. 1957) 249 F.2d 516, held the correction of a sentence imposed in violation of statute to conform with the applicable statute does not place a defendant in double jeopardy though the defendant \u2018has not appealed from the judgment embodying the invalid sentence, has not begun to serve it, and steps to correct it are not initiated by him but by the government.\u2019 (At p. 354.) The federal cases cited, as well as other cases, support that view (see <em>Blankenship </em>v. <em>Parratt </em>(8th Cir. 1977) 554 F.2d 850; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1964) 330 F.2d 26; <em>King </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C.Cir. 1938) 98 F.2d 291, 296; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Parks </em>(1941) 67 Ohio App. 96 [36 N.E.2d 42]; 21 Am.Jur.2d, Criminal Law, \u00a7 167, p. 232.)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 486-487.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Where, as here, appellant is the prime mover in the appeal, he cannot complain, when his brief is successful, that he should not be subjected to a proper reappraisal of statutory sentencing standards upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Serrato, supra: </em>\u201c[A] defendant who successfully attacks a judgment which is in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction is not necessarily entitled to claim the protection of that invalid judgment as an absolute limitation upon what the court may do thereafter.\u201d (9 Cal.3d at p. 765.) (See also, <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 711 [23 L.Ed.2d 656, 89 S.Ct. 2072]; <em>In re Sandel </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 412 [50 Cal.Rptr. 462, 412 P.2d 806]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Massengale, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 689; <em>People </em>v. <em>Orrante </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 553 [20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 480]; <em>In re Robinson </em>(1956) 142 Cal.App.2d 484 [298 P.2d 656].)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We find no constitutional infirmity involved in remand of the prior convictions to the trial court for a retrial limited to the question of the truth or falsity of the priors. On the retrial, if the priors are found to be true, appellant may be sentenced to the term of enhancement mandated by section 667.5 for that category of prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">III. The Ohio Prior</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Appellant further contends that there was insufficient evidence before the trial court to support the finding that the Ohio prior was true. The principal concern below was whether appellant\u2019s incarceration in an Ohio mental health institution was creditable as prison time for satisfaction of the minimum one-year imprisonment required by section 667.5, subdivision (f). Putting this concern aside, we review the contention that the Ohio prior lacks all the elements of the enhancement-felony as that felony is defined under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In order to qualify as a \u201cviolent\u201d felony enhancement, the 1964 Ohio sodomy conviction must, to accord with the provisions of subdivision (f) of section 667.5, include \u201call of the elements of the particular felony as defined under California law .. . . \u201d The Attorney General suggests that any one of three gauges may be utilized to determine the statutorily mandated congruency of elements. These are (1) factual comparison of the specific evidence upon which the prior conviction was obtained with the elements required for conviction of a similar felony in California; (2) utilization of the charging document in the other jurisdiction to determine its factual basis for comparison with the California elements prescribed; and (3) facial, matching of the elements of the out-of-state legislation with those of the California statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">In the case at bench the California yardstick by which the foreign prior must be measured is those \u201cviolent\u201d felonies denominated by section 667.5, subdivision (c). The People contend that if appellant\u2019s 1964 Ohio conduct constituted either \u201c... (4) Sodomy by force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of great bodily harm. (5) Oral copulation by force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of great bodily harm. (6) Lewd acts on a child under 14 as defined in Section 288.... \u201d appellant is eligible for a three-year sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The trial court reviewed the probation report and determined that appellant\u2019s 1964 Ohio conduct factually comported with all three designated California felonies. On that basis it determined the Ohio conviction was qualified to support a three-year enhancement. This was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">First, the use of the probation report as evidence that the foreign prior was true was an impermissible use of hearsay. While probation reports are clearly hearsay, they have their proper place in sentencing proceedings as an aid to the court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valdivia </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 145, 149 [5 Cal.Rptr. 832]; \u00a7 1203d.) However, they may not be utilized as proof in evidentiary hearings to establish the truth of a prior conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lo Cicero </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1186, 1193 [80 Cal.Rptr. 913, 459 P.2d 241]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 460, 467-468 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487]; <em>In re Tartar </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 250, 257 [339 P.2d 553].)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Second, we conclude that extrinsic evidence may not be used to establish the similarity of California and foreign convictions. We have been referred to no contrary decisions subsequent to enactment in 1976 of the determinate sentencing law (\u00a7 1170 et seq.), and have found none ourselves. However, in dealing with cases under former section 644,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> concerning habitual criminals, the Supreme Court has been consistent in disallowing the use of extrinsic evidence to establish similarity of out-of-state priors. <em>(In re Wolfson </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 20, 23 [180 P.2d 326]; <em>In re McVickers </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 264, 278 [176 P.2d 40].)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Our conclusion also flows from judicial necessity. It avoids geographical and logistic difficulties inherent in California retrials of out-of-state priors. Such retrials would be accompanied by a plethora of conflict of laws issues, both substantive and procedural, would unduly prejudice the defendant, divert the jury\u2019s attention from the primary case, and in general, impose insuperable burdens upon the legal processes in the trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The trial court also had before it the Ohio information upon which his 1964 conviction was based. The People contend that this document is a resource which the court could consider in determining similarity between the Ohio and California statutes, relying on <em>In re Wolfson, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>pra, </em>30 Cal.2d at pages 24-25. This reliance is inapposite. <em>Wolfson, </em>in so holding, depended on former section 668 which provided: \u201cEvery person who has been convicted in any other state, government, country or jurisdiction of an offense for which, if committed within this state, such person could have been punished under the laws of this state by imprisonment in a state prison, is punishable for any subsequent crime committed within this state in the manner prescribed in Sections 644, 666, and 667, and to the same extent as if such prior conviction had taken place in a court of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Examination of the current equivalent of former section 668 indicates that the Legislature is now more specific in its classification of prior convictions and the manner in which they may be proved. In enacting subdivision (f) of section 667.5 in 1976, it provided: \u201c... A prior conviction of a particular felony shall include a conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense which includes all the elements of the particular felony as defined under California law . ...\u201d In so limiting the determinant of comparison to the elements of the respective local and foreign crimes, we conclude that the Legislature intended to eliminate recourse to extrinsic matters in classifying crimes subject to term enhancement. Such rejection includes not only the evidentiary facts of the crime as above noted, but the information or indictment which brought the prosecution to the out-of-state court as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">As a general rule, an intention to change the law or the meaning of a statute will be inferred or presumed from a material change in the statutory language, such as where the Legislature makes such an amendment subsequent to judicial decisions interpreting the statute in its former verbiage. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dixon </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 43, 51-52 [154 Cal.Rptr. 236, 592 P.2d 752]; 58 Cal.Jur.3d, Statutes, \u00a7 50, pp. 383-387.) Neither counsel nor this court have found legislative materials dealing with section 667.5 which rebut the presumed legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">We therefore reject use of the extrinsic resources relied on by the trial court in finding the Ohio prior was true. We advert to consideration of only the elements of the Ohio and California statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Appellant\u2019s 1964 Ohio conviction was for sodomy. As defined in section 2905.44, Ohio Revised Code: \u201cNo person shall have carnal copulation with a beast, or in any opening of the body, except sexual parts, with another human being. Whoever violates this section is guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>sodomy and shall be imprisoned not less than one or more than twenty years.\u201d There has been no material change in this section since 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Subdivision (a) of section 667.5 requires that the foreign prior constitute a \u201cviolent\u201d felony within the meaning of subdivision (c) of that section in order to invoke a three-year enhancement. Subdivision (c) incorporates the crime of sodomy as \u201c... (4) Sodomy by force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of great bodily harm...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Patently, the Ohio statute does not require pleading or proof of the elements of force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of great bodily injury to sustain a conviction of sodomy. Therefore appellant\u2019s Ohio conviction cannot qualify for treatment as a \u201cviolent\u201d prior.  The question then arises does the Ohio prior meet the requirements of subdivision (b) of section 667.5 as a \u201cnonviolent\u201d felony, subjecting the appellant to a one-year enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The threshold inquiry involves the date at which the Ohio and California convictions are to be compared. Consensual sodomy was a felony in California at the time of appellant\u2019s 1964 Ohio conviction. Section 286 then provided that \u201cEvery person who is guilty of the infamous crime against nature, committed with mankind or with any animal, is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not less than one year.\u201d The facial language of the California statute and the elements contained in it were compatible with the elements of the Ohio statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">However, effective January 1, 1976, our Legislature amended section 286<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and provided that the commission of sodomy between consenting adults was no longer a crime. Therefore, at the time of appellant\u2019s commission on November 29, 1977, of the offense for which he is currently before the court, the elements of the defined offense of sodomy in Ohio were different from the elements then required for prosecution in California. Consent was not an element in Ohio, while lack of consent was a necessary element in California. Having concluded that we may not permissibly refer to either the underlying facts of the Ohio crime, or the information under which it was prosecuted, we cannot consider, for purposes of comparison, any data concerning the age of the Ohio victim, or whether the act was committed without consent or by violent means.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Determination of the time at which the consideration of similarity of elements is conducted is crucial to appellant. If the date of measurement is the 1964 date of his Ohio conviction, the California and Ohio elements match, and his sentence may be enhanced by an additional year for this prior. If the date of his current offense, November 29, 1977, is determinative, the elements are obviously dissimilar and the Ohio prior must be discarded for sentence enhancement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Reexamining decisions under the now repealed habitual criminal statute, section 644, indicates that the date of commission of the primary (current) California offense, and only that date, is germane. <em>(In re Wolfson, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 25; <em>In re McVickers, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d at p. 267; <em>In re Seeley </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 294, 299 [176 P.2d 24]; <em>In re Harincar </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 403, 404 [176 P.2d 58].) Further close scrutiny of the provisions of subdivision (f) of present section 667.5 indicates that its use of the phrases \"... which if committed in California <em>is </em>punishable.. .in state prison...\u201d (italics added) and \u201c.. .for an offense <em>which includes </em>all of the elements...\u201d (italics added) is pointedly in the present tense.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">For these reasons we reach the result that the critical date for comparison of the Ohio and California statutes in this case is November 29, 1977, the date of appellant\u2019s commission of his present offense. Applying these conclusions to the Ohio prior, we determine that the elements of the prior are not similar to the like California crime (sodomy) denominated as a \u201cviolent\u201d felony on that date. Nor is such out-of-state prior similar to \u201cany\u201d California felony to qualify appellant for enhancement pursuant to subdivision (b) of Penal Code section 667.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The Ohio prior not qualifying as a prior conviction under current California statutes, no purpose would be served by remanding this conviction for retrial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We therefore affirm the convictions on the substantive offenses, but reverse the sentence enhancements, remanding the matter to the trial court for a limited retrial. We hold, however, that the retrial shall involve only the truth or falsity of the California prior, without restriction to its proper charge and proof pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c) of Penal Code section 667.5, and without limitation as to the length of any legal sentence enhancement available to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We further decide that the Ohio prior is not cognizable as a prior conviction for enhancement purposes under any provision of the Penal Code as the elements of the Ohio offense as charged did not match the elements of any California offense at the time of commission of appellant\u2019s present substantive crimes. As a corollary, we conclude that this deficiency may not be remedied by resort to the underlying facts of the Ohio conviction, whether obtained from the face of the Ohio pleadings or by resort to legally admissible extrinsic evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Hopper, Acting P.
