J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amx\">Petitioner Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty) seeks review of the summary denial by respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) of Liberty\u2019s petition to reopen the workers\u2019 compensation award of respondent injured worker, Levon Aprahamian. We agree with Liberty that such summary denial was in error and accordingly annul the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Summary of Appeals Board Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Aprahamian (hereinafter also applicant) on April 16, 1974, sustained injury to his spine arising out of and occurring in the course of his employment for Huck Manufacturing Company whose compensation insurance carrier is Liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">On August 12, 1976, the Board awarded applicant 78 percent permanent disability which is the sum of $31,167.50 payable at $70 per week for 445.25 weeks commencing February 24, 1975, and thereafter a life pension of $29.08 for the remainder of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">On April 16, 1979, Liberty filed a petition to reopen to reduce applicant\u2019s permanent disability award. (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5803, 5804.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) In its petition to reopen Liberty alleged applicant\u2019s \u201ccondition has changed since the Decision of August 12, 1976, in that his disability is substantially less than that found and awarded at that time.In its petition to reopen Liberty neither offered specifics of its contention of decreased disability nor attached any documentary evidence. Liberty did state that it would \u201cask leave of the Board to offer medical evidence in support of this contention along with other evidence of a relevant and material nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>On April 18, 1979, applicant filed \u201cObjections to Petition to Reopen and Motion to Dismiss.\u201d Citing <em>Polach </em>v. <em>American Smelting &amp; Refining Co. </em>(1969) 34 Cal.Comp.Cases 511, and WCAB Rules of Practice and Procedure (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, ch. 4.5, subch. 2) section 10454,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applicant moved that Liberty\u2019s petition be dismissed as it \u201cfails to specifically set forth the nature and substance of the evidence, report or reports, or other matters upon which [Liberty] relies for showing of good cause, change in physical condition of the injured employee, or any other ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">On April 24, 1979, and <em>without prior notice to Liberty, </em>the workers\u2019 compensation judge denied Liberty\u2019s petition to reopen on the grounds it had failed to present any evidence supporting its petition to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Liberty then sought reconsideration by the Board, asserting it had been denied the opportunity to present evidence on its petition to reopen. In its petition for reconsideration Liberty admitted it had presented no evidence to support its petition to reopen but stated: \u201cYour petitioners have recently come upon evidence in support of its contention that there has been a change in the nature and extent of claimant\u2019s disability in the form of work activity which is contrary and inconsistent with the rating that previously issued and the finding based thereon which is supportive of the contentions set forth in its Petition to Reopen.... Specifically, claimant is now self-employed as the owner, operator and driver of a catering and/or vending truck. It is and will be the position of petitioners that the activity with reference to this self-employment reflects substantially less disability than that which was previously awarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The Board denied Liberty\u2019s petition for reconsideration and awarded applicant attorneys fees pursuant to Labor Code section 5410.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The denial of Liberty\u2019s petition to reopen precludes it from ever attempting to reopen the case again. This is because a petition to reopen must be filed within five years of the date of injury and that period has now lapsed. <em>(Aliano </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 341, 365 [161 Cal.Rptr. 190]; 1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation (2d rev. ed. 1980) \u00a7 9.02 [3].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The informality of pleadings in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings before the Board has been recognized. <em>(Zurich Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 848, 852 [109 Cal.Rptr. 211, 512 P.2d 843]; <em>Bland </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 324, 328-334 [90 Cal.Rptr. 431, 475 P.2d 663].)  The courts have rejected pleading technicalities as grounds for depriving the Board of its continuing jurisdiction under Labor Code sections 5410,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5803, 5804 and 5805<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> concerning petitions to reopen filed by the injured worker.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>(Blanchard </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 590 [126 Cal.Rptr. 187]; <em>Beaida </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 204 [69 Cal.Rptr. 516].) If the injured worker\u2019s petition to reopen is timely filed within the five-year jurisdictional period, any lack of specificity therein may be later curable by amendment. <em>(Blanchard, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d at pp. 594-595; <em>Beaida, supra, </em>263 Cal.App.2d at pp. 208-210.) The language of an injured worker\u2019s petition to reopen is liberally construed. <em>(Bland, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 324.) Even the failure to attach medical reports to the petition to reopen is not fatal to an injured worker\u2019s petition. <em>(Blanchard, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Respondents point out that the liberal pleading rules in favor of an injured worker\u2019s petition to reopen are based upon the rationale that Labor Code section 3202 requires liberal construction of the workers\u2019 compensation laws in order to extend protection to <em>injured employees. </em>(See <em>Blanchard, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 590; <em>Beaida, supra, </em>263 Cal.App.2d at pp. 208-209.) Respondents thus urge that the Board\u2019s action is consistent with Labor Code section 3202, in that its summary denial of employers\u2019 and insurance carriers\u2019 skeletal petitions to reopen protects injured workers from groundless petitions to reopen,  Respondents would thereby establish one rule of pleading for injured workers and another for employers and carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In its brief the Board argues: \u201cThe Board is concerned that if it is reversible error to dismiss a petition filed in the form of [Liberty\u2019s] petition here, [employers/carriers] will be encouraged to file skeletal Petitions to Reopen shortly before the expiration of the 5 year period without having medical or other evidence to support their contentions. It may well be that [ employers/carriers ] will routinely file such petitions in the hope that such evidence can subsequently be obtained or that attorneys will feel compelled to routinely file such petitions merely to avoid the possibility of malpractice. The Board consequently believes that compliance with [WCAB] Rule 10454 is essential to insure the integrity of the reopening process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Injured workers are already provided ample protection from frivolous petitions to reopen by employers and carriers. The filing by an employer or carrier of a petition to reopen to reduce a permanent disability award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>does not permit the automatic unilateral termination of permanent disability payments. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (King) </em>104 Cal.App.3d 933 [168 Cal.Rptr. 789].) It is only until the Board actually grants the petition to reopen to reduce and modifies the award that the employer or carrier may discontinue or reduce payments in accord with the injured worker\u2019s reduced disability. <em>(King, supra.) </em>The employer or carrier is thus interested in proceeding diligently on its petition to reopen. If the employer or carrier is unsuccessful in reopening the case, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for the injured worker\u2019s attorney is assesed against the petitioning party pursuant to Labor Code section 5410.1.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, if the employer or carrier files a petition to reopen immediately before the 5-year period elapses the injured worker still has 30 days to file a counterpetition to reopen to increase his award. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5804.) In addition, if the employer or carrier has no evidence to support its petition to reopen the injured worker can simply get the matter set for hearing; or if the employer or carrier tries to delay, the injured worker can seek dismissal for lack of prosecution. (WCAB Rules, \u00a7 10582.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Accordingly, as the injured worker is already amply protected against frivolous employer or carrier petitions to reopen, we decline to endorse the pleading rule dichotomy to the extent suggested by respondents. This is not to say that employers\u2019 and carriers\u2019 petitions to reopen must necessarily be given as broad a reading as allowed to an injured worker\u2019s petition to reopen. (See <em>Bland, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 324.) In this case, however, Liberty\u2019s petition to reopen clearly states it requests a reduction of the permanent disability award based upon a change in such disability. Liberty\u2019s petition to reopen is not vague as to the issue presented only as to the underlying specific facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The summary denial of the petition to reopen also runs counter to the Board\u2019s own rules. The Board here has, in effect, granted a demurrer to Liberty\u2019s petition to reopen. Pursuant to WCAB Rules section 10490<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>when a petition or other pleading \u201cis insufficient no demurrer thereto is permitted; if a party is surprised or otherwise disadvantaged by the insufficiency of a pleading, the remedy is to grant that party a reasonable continuance to permit him adequately to prepare to present his case or defense.\u201d <em>(Blanchard, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d at pp. 594-595; see also, Lab. Code, \u00a7 5500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The summary denial of the petition to reopen without giving Liberty either prior notice or hearing is not justified under the Board\u2019s en banc decision in <em>Polach </em>v. <em>American Smelting &amp; Refinery Co., supra, </em>34 Cal.Comp.Cases 511. There, the Board upheld the summary denial of a petition to reopen by the employee after one such petition had already been denied and the new petition to reopen was denied on the grounds the employee failed to allege any new evidence and the employee\u2019s alleged \u201cnew theory\u201d was merely a restatement of an issue already considered by the Board. The situation here is different. Liberty did specifically allege a decrease in applicant\u2019s disability; deficiencies in Liberty\u2019s petition could have been remedied by a less drastic approach as by requiring Liberty to make more specific allegations in its petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The Board\u2019s decision summarily denying Liberty\u2019s petition to reopen and awarding applicant attorneys fees in accord with Labor Code section 5410.1 is annulled. The matter is remanded to the Board for further proceedings as may be consistent with the court\u2019s opinion herein. Of course, nothing herein should be construed as an expression by the court of an opinion on the merits of Liberty\u2019s petition to reopen, an issue not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Ashby, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Labor Code section 5803 provides: \u201cThe appeals board has continuing jurisdiction over all its orders, decisions, and awards made and entered under the provisions of this division.
