J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvKz\">Petitioners (the employer and its insurer) seek review of a decision of the respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) permitting respondent injured worker to reopen his workers\u2019 compensation award. Specifically, petitioners contend the Board erred in (1) increasing the permanent disability award and (2) awarding further medical treatment. There is no merit to the latter contention. The first contention, however, raises the serious question of the proper legal standards for reopening a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>decision of the Board under Labor Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sections 5410,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 5803,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 5804<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 5805.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Proceedings Before Board</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Respondent Juan J. Macias (hereinafter also \u201capplicant\u201d) while employed on October 14, 1972, as a waiter by petitioner Nicky Blair\u2019s Restaurant, whose compensation insurance carrier is petitioner The Travelers Insurance Company, sustained injury arising out of and in the course of his employment to his back. A herniated disc at the L4-L5 level was diagnosed. In October 1973 Macias underwent a lumbar laminectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">After a hearing on April 24, 1975, Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge Lippert awarded Macias back disability of 21 1/2 percent ($4,816.50) based upon finding \u201cback disability involving loss of approximately one-half of preinjury lifting capacity.\u201d Macias did not seek reconsideration of this award issued in August 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>In March 1977 Macias filed a petition to reopen his claim alleging \u201cnew and further\u201d disability. The petition to reopen was heard before Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge Stark.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Stark granted the petition to reopen and increased Macias\u2019 permanent disability award to 52 percent ($15,746.25) based upon a back disability limiting Macias to \u201clight work\u201d and also awarded further medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\">In the petition to reopen proceedings Macias testified that since the original 1975 award his condition has deteriorated. His pain is more intense. His problems with his left leg (cramps and burning sensation) have intensified. He has a tremendous burning sensation at the base of the neck and into both shoulders and has \u201cstrong\u201d headaches at the top of his head. The neck and shoulder complaints and the headaches started in the spring or summer of 1976.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>Medical evidence on the petition to reopen consists of reports from Thomas F. Morrow, M.D., a specialist in orthopedic surgery, Robert A. Rose, M.D., a specialist in neurology, and Michael J. Patzakis, M.D., associate professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of of Southern California School of Medicine. Both Dr. Morrow and Dr. Rose examined Macias in connection with the original proceedings leading up to the 1975 award and the petition to reopen. Dr. Patzakis only examined Macias in connection with the petition to reopen in the capacity of an independent medical examiner at the referral of the medical bureau of the Division of Industrial Accidents and at the request of Judge Stark.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>In his initial report of March 13, 1975, Dr. Rose set forth his opinion on Macias\u2019 factors of permanent disability as follows: \u201c1. Constant slight low back pain without activity, increasing when he stands over 15-20 minutes, moves quickly, or twists to either side, lifts or carries over 25 lbs., with pain radiating down back of both lower extremities to the heels, especially the right with both legs cramping, with intermittent buckling of right lower extremity causing patient to stumble. Pain estimated to become severe on more than minimal demand for physical effort over 2 to 4 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>\u201c2. <em>Permanent disability resulting in limitation to at least light work. </em>Patient is restricted from any repetitive lifting regardless of weight and any single lift of 25 pounds or <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Dr. Rose recommended Macias be fitted with a back brace, given analgesics, and that future medical care be provided \u201cas necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Reporting on February 15, 1977, in connection with the petition to reopen, Dr. Rose observes that Macias\u2019 condition has continued to deteriorate. Dr. Rose notes the increase in back pain and the development of headaches and neck pain. Dr. Rose opines Macias should not only be restricted to light work because of his back but also independently restricted to light work because of his neck problems. The head symptomatology, Dr. Rose believes, \u201cfurther limits him in his ability to deal with his employment situation.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. Rose relates these additional conditions to the industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>In connection with the original proceedings, Dr. Morrow, who performed the 1973 surgery upon Macias, opined Macias could return to work as a waiter. Dr. Morrow did place a work restriction upon Macias to \u201cavoid any type of heavy duty lifting individually where he is called upon repeatedly to lift weights alone in excess of 50 pounds on a continuous basis.\u201d This is the customary restriction placed by Dr. Morrow upon patients who have undergone the type of surgery performed upon Macias.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dr. Morrow\u2019s report apparently provided the basis for 21 1 /2 percent permanent disability rating in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\">In connection with the petition to reopen, Dr. Morrow believes Macias\u2019 condition and disability are unchanged. Further, Dr. Morrow opines the neck and head difficulties are unrelated to the industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Dr. Patzakis, in his report of December 16, 1977, opines Macias should be limited to light work, stating in pertinent part: \u201cHis condition can be considered permanent and stationary for rating purposes. He has complained of neck pain and upper extremity problems; his x-rays taken by the physician, of his neck, have been reported as normal. His EMG of the upper extremities has also been reported as normal. [1\u00cd] At this time, there is no evidence of any neurological deficit. The circumferential hypesthesia he has does not follow any root or dermatome distribution and is not from an organic standpoint. [IT] He complains of pain on top of his head, but this does not appear to be related to his injury and he probably should have these evaluated by his private physician. [1\u00cd] His subjective complaints should be considered moderate and based on his objective findings which include a positive EMG and a positive myelogram in the past with subsequent surgery and localized degenerative arthritis at L4-5. This patient\u2019s disability would preclude him to light work. No further treatment is necessary at this time. Provisions should be made for the patient to have 1-2 check-ups a year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Upon cross-examination Dr. Patzakis stated that in his opinion there has been no real change or progression in Macias\u2019 condition from March 1975. According to him, there is no objective evidence of deterioration but there is an increase in symptomatology. The headaches and shoulder problems, Dr. Patzakis maintains, are unrelated to the industrial injury. Of importance is that Dr. Patzakis states that if Dr. Patzakis had seen Macias in March 1975 the doctor would have placed the same work restriction upon Macias. In other words, Dr. Patzakis apparently would have concurred in Dr. Rose\u2019s 1975 permanent disability evaluation, had he been asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In granting the petition to reopen and in finding Macias limited to light work, Judge Stark stated in his opinion on decision: \u201cI rely on the opinion of the independent medical examiner, Michael Patzakis, M.D., in finding that there is good cause to reopen; that applicant sustained permanent disability of 52%, equal to $15,746.25.. .. Dr. Patzakis testified that his restriction of applicant to light work is not really a result of an increase in applicant\u2019s disability, but is a result of his evaluation of the applicant\u2019s disability. <em>That is to say, that had he seen applicant in March of 1975, based on the findings then made and evidence available he would probably have then limited him to light work. </em>Dr. Patzakis\u2019 opinion indicates that there is good cause to reopen to increase permanent disability, because the amount previously awarded applicant appears to be inadequate....\" (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>Judge Stark further explained his theory of \u201cgood cause\u201d in his report to the Board on petitioners\u2019 petition for reconsideration as follows: \u201cThere is good cause to reopen.... [If].... [If] [Petitioner] argues that there is no good cause to reopen because there is no \u2018new and further disability.\u2019 Certainly there is further disability. However, [petitioner] argues it is not \u2018new\u2019 disability since Dr. Patzakis testified there is no change in applicant\u2019s condition, only in the amount of disability he assigns to it. [1f] It is submitted that this greater disability is, in fact, new disability as well. To deem it otherwise would deprive applicant of his right to increased benefits for the sake of semantic differentiation. [If] There is no question that applicant is more disabled than indicated by the previous permanent disability rating he received. Basic justice requires that he now be given that permanent disability rating which properly reflects his true disability. Good cause to reopen does exist. [If] The order granting applicant\u2019s Petition to Reopen and the Findings and Award of August 27, 1979 are supported by substantial evidence and most particularly, the opinion of the independent medical examiner, Michael Patzakis, M.D.....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\">The Board denied reconsideration. It incorporated by reference Judge Stark\u2019s report. It also stated: \u201cLabor Code Section 5803 gives the Board continuing jurisdiction over its award. It may rescind, alter or amend such awards if good cause appears. Good cause exists here because either the Board made an erroneous decision initially or the applicant has sustained new and further disability. (See Labor Code Section 5410.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Reopening of Prior Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Both Macias and the Board assert that the reopening of Macias\u2019 award and increasing the permanent disability was proper under the \u201cnew and further disability\u201d concept of section 5410 and/or the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard of section 5803.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">At the outset we observe that sections 5410, 5803 and 5804 permit reopening of a case upon a petition filed within five years of the date of injury. <em>(Aliano </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 341, 365 [161 Cal.Rptr. 190].) While Judge Stark\u2019s decision granting reopening issued more than five years after the injury, there was still jurisdiction to render the decision as Macias had filed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>petition to reopen within five years of the date of injury. <em>(Ibid.; </em>1 Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 9.02[3].)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">\u201cSection 5410 permits the reopening of a prior decision of the WCAB for \u2018new and further disability\u2019 upon the filing of a petition of the injured employee within five years of the date of injury. <em>(Nolan </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 122 [138 Cal.Rptr. 561]; see generally, 1 Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9.01-9.03; 1 Herlick, Cal.

Workmen\u2019s Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1973) \u00a7\u00a7 4.19, 12.4-12.1.4; Mastoris, <em>The Statutes of Limitation in Workers\u2019 Compensation Proceedings </em>(1979) 15 Cal. Western L.Rev. 32, 61-65, 67-74 (hereinafter Mastoris, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>15 Cal.Western L.Rev. 32); see also, <em>Standard Rectifier Corp. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 287, 290 [54 Cal.Rptr. 100, 419 P.2d 164]; <em>Pizza Hut of San Diego, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 818, 822 [143 Cal.Rptr. 131].) Sections 5803-5805 permit the reopening of a previously adjudicated case for \u2018good cause\u2019 upon a petition filed by a party in interest within five years from the date of injury. (1 Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 9.02; Mastoris, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>15 Cal. Western L.Rev. at pp. 67-72.) (For a discussion of the similarities and differences between \u00a7 5410 and \u00a7\u00a7 5803-5805, see <em>Zurich Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 848, 854-858 [109 Cal.Rptr. 211, 512 P.2d 843] (conc. opn. of Sullivan, J.); Mastoris, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>15 Cal. Western L.Rev. at pp. 67-72; Cal. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1973) <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.8.)\u201d <em>(Aliano, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.3d at p. 365, fn. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Section 5410 fails to define the phrase \u201cnew and further disability\u201d and it has not been given a comprehensive definition by judicial interpretation. (1 Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 9.03[2].) Thus, its meaning is not entirely clear. <em>(Pizza Hut of San Diego, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 818, 825 [143 Cal.Rptr. 131].)  It is clear, however, that the phrase refers to disability which must be both \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cfurther.\u201d (1 Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 9.03[2].) \u201cThe phrase \u2018further disability\u2019 presupposes that such disability is in addition to that disability for which proceedings were timely commenced or for which compensation already was paid <em>(Kauffman </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Com., </em>37 Cal.App. 500, 502-503 [174 P. 690]). It has also been recognized \u2018[s]ome significance must be given to the word \u201cnew\u201d.\u2019 (See <em>Westvaco etc. Corp. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., </em>136 Cal.App.2d 60, 64-68 [288 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>P.2d 300].)\u201d <em>(Pizza Hut of San Diego, Inc., supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d at p. 825.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\">\u201cThe term \u2018new and further disability\u2019 has been defined to mean disability which results from some demonstrable change in an employee\u2019s condition.\u201d (1 Herlick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.5.) \u201c\u2018New and further disability can develop only after a cessation of temporary disability or an interruption of temporary disability by a period of nondisablement. A new period of temporary disability or a change to permanent disability is a new and further disability. A gradual increase in disability is a new and further disability. [Citation.] A permanent disability is a new and further disability. [Citations.] Permanent disability from the outset, however, such as loss of an eye, does not constitute new and further disability. [Citation.] [\u00b6] \u2018Historically, a change in physical condition necessitating further medical treatment had been considered new and further disability whether or not accompanied by time lost from work. [Citation.]\u2019 (Cal. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1973) \u00a7 4.21, pp. 108-109; see also 1 Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 9.03[2].) Thus, \u2018[c]ommonly, new and further disability refers to a recurrence of temporary disability, a new need for medical treatment, or the change of a temporary disability into a permanent disability.\u2019 (Cal. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1973) \u00a7 12.12, p. 410.)\u201d <em>(Pizza Hut, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d at p. 825.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Thus, if Macias\u2019 condition is unchanged from the time of the original decision in 1975, there is no \u201cnew and further disability\u201d within the meaning of section 5410 to permit reopening of the case.  However, irrespective of whether or not there has been \u201cnew and further disability,\u201d \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen under section 5803 may exist. (See <em>Aliano </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>100 Cal.App.3d at p. 366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\u201cTo reopen for \u201cgood cause\u201d there must exist some ground, not within the knowledge of the appeals board at the time of making the former award or orders which render said original award or orders inequitable; this cannot be premised upon a mere change of <em>opinion </em>by the appeals board. <em>(Walters </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 387, 394 [20 Cal.Rptr. 7, 369 P.2d 703].) \u2018Merely cumulative\u2019 evidence is insufficient for \u2018good cause.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 395.) In the absence of \u2018good cause,\u2019 the appeals board is powerless to act. <em>(Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. </em>v. <em>Indus. A.C. </em>(1936) 6 Cal.2d 314, 315-317 [57 P.2d 501].) What constitutes \u2018good cause\u2019 depends largely on the circumstances of each case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number><em>(Bartlett Hayward Co. </em>v. <em>Indus. Acc. Com. </em>(1928) 203 Cal. 522, 532 [265 P. 195].) While the WCAB\u2019s determination of what constitutes \u2018good cause\u2019 may be accorded great weight it is not conclusive. <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (Aliano, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.3d at p. 366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The principle of reopening for \u201cgood cause\u201d does not permit an attempt to simply relitigate the original award. A petition to reopen may not be used to litigate issues which should have been raised by a timely petition for reconsideration. (See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1944) 63 Cal.App.2d 286 [146 P.2d 693]; <em>Royster </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 412 [115 Cal.Rptr. 210].) \u201cGood cause\u201d to reopen does not consist of medical evidence obtained subsequent to the original decision which merely disagrees with the medical opinion relied upon by the Board at the time of the original decision. (See <em>Consolidated Western Steel Div. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1962) 205 Cal.App.2d 275, 277-278 [23 Cal.Rptr. 147]; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>W.C.A.B. </em>(1980) 45 Cal.Comp.Cases 499.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">\u201cGrounds commonly urged as \u2018good cause\u2019 for reopening.. .are (1) mistake of fact, occasioned by failure or inability to produce certain evidence at a prior hearing; (2) mistake of law disclosed by subsequent appellate court ruling on the same point in another case; (3) inadvertence, as when the Appeals Board issues a decision under the mistaken impression that its Medical Bureau had made an adverse report in the case; (4) newly discovered evidence which is more than merely cumulative; and (5) fraud, such as may be perpetuated through perjury and false statements. The mere fact that the Appeals Board itself has changed its mind as to the same facts is not good cause for revision of a decision. The ground most frequently urged as good cause is <em>mistake of fact, </em>reopening being sought on the basis of evidence alleged to be material and newly discovered since the prior hearing.\u201d (1 Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 9.02[2][c], pp. 9-14.) (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">\u201cThrough many court decisions it has become well settled that, in order to constitute \u2018good cause\u2019 for reopening, new evidence (a) must present some good ground, not previously known to the Appeals Board, which renders the original award inequitable, (b) must be more than merely cumulative or a restatement of the original evidence or contentions, and (c) must be accompanied by a showing that such evidence could not with reasonable diligence have been discovered and produced at the original hearing.\u201d (1 Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.02[2][d]; see <em>Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. </em>v. <em>Indus. A. C. </em>(1936) 6 Cal.2d 314 [57 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>501]; <em>Clendaniel </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 659 [111 P.2d 314].)  Reopening upon the claim of newly discovered evidence is not a matter of right. <em>(Clendaniel, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d at p. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\">\u201c[The Board\u2019s] power to re-open the case in the exercise of its continuing jurisdiction, \u2018invoked on the ground of newly discovered evidence, should be exercised with great caution and when fraud, inadvertence, mistake or excusable neglect are clearly shown. Otherwise, the process of introducing evidence before the [Board] would be interminable and the [Board] might be held to abuse its discretion in the exercise of its power.. ..\u2019\u201d <em>(Clendaniel, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d at p. 663.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">\u201cGood cause\u201d includes facts which for the first time develop subsequent to the decision sought to be reopened. <em>(Pullman Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 379, 388 [170 P.2d 10]; <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 654, 661-662 [72 Cal.Rptr. 140]; see also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 476 [67 Cal.Rptr. 544, 439 P.2d 648].) Thus, in <em>Ryan, supra, </em>\u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen was found where spinal surgery subsequent to the original decision demonstrated the true nature of injury and disproved that the claim was based on fraudulent complaints as was held in the original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Of course, while we have separately discussed the concepts of \u201cgood cause\u201d and \u201cnew and further disability,\u201d in application to a request to reopen these concepts may intertwine. \u201cGood cause\u201d includes \u201cnew and further disability.\u201d (Cal. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1973), <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.12.) \u201cNew and further disability\u201d may help establish \u201cgood cause.\u201d (See <em>Aliano, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.3d at p. 366.) For example, the change or lack thereof in the injured\u2019s condition may demonstrate his condition was originally misdiagnosed and therefor warrant a total reevaluation of the injured\u2019s status. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Respondents argue either \u201cnew and further disability\u201d or \u201cgood cause\u201d exists. In evaluating this question, we are mindful that what constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d under section 5803 is also applicable to employer\u2019s petitions to reopen to rescind, alter or <em>reduce </em>a prior award.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">For support of new and further disability respondents point out that Macias testified that his condition had deteriorated and that he was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>able to perform work duties. Had the Board relied upon Dr. Rose in reopening the case \u201cnew and further\u201d disability would clearly exist. Dr. Rose reports marked deterioration of Macias\u2019 condition and development of neck, shoulder, and head discomfort; Dr. Rose relates all this to the original industrial injury. The Board, however, has instead relied specifically upon Dr. Patzakis and not Dr. Rose. Dr. Patzakis opines the head and shoulder problem are unrelated to the industrial injury. Dr. Patzakis found no objective evidence of neck disability; he does not discuss whether the neck discomfort is related to the industrial injury. Further, the light work restriction is placed upon Macias by Dr. Patzakis not because of subjective complaints but upon his assessment of Macias\u2019 disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The problem with Macias\u2019 testimony of increased subjective complaints is that the only increase under Dr. Patzakis\u2019 opinion that is related to the industrial injury is for the back. Conditions unrelated to the industrial injury are not \u201cnew and further disability.\u201d As to the subjective complaints related to the injury, Dr. Patzakis neither found objective evidence supporting such increase in subjective complaints nor found them significantly changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">As to the Board\u2019s reliance upon the fact Macias has not returned to work, this too does not here necessarily establish a basis to reopen. At the time of the original decision Macias had not returned or even looked for work; he did not feel he could do the work of a waiter which he did at the time of injury. In connection with the petition to reopen Macias testified he had made no attempt to return to his job as a waiter or to any other work. Thus, the situation herein is unlike the circumstances where at the time of the original award it is believed the injured will be able to return to work consistent with the disability then found but subsequent attempts to work demonstrate the injured\u2019s inability to engage in such activities. (See <em>Pullman Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>28 Cal.2d at p. 388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Dr. Patzakis\u2019 opinion also does not establish \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen. His opinion is merely a reevaluation of Macias\u2019 disability as it existed at the time of the original decision. No <em>newly developed </em>facts are stated by Dr. Patzakis for his difference of opinion with the originally determined disability. (Compare <em>Consolidated Western Steel Div. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>205 Cal.App.2d at pp. 277-278 with <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>265 Cal.App.2d at pp. 661-662.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Macias argues that the opinion of Dr. Patzakis that he would have placed the same \u201clight work\u201d restriction upon Macias at the time of the original decision is pure speculation, unworthy of belief. <em>(Hegglin </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 162, 169 [93 Cal.Rptr. 15, 480 P.2d 967]; <em>Place </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 372, 378-379 [90 Cal.Rptr. 424, 475 P.2d 656].) A review of Dr. Patzakis\u2019 entire report and testimony, however, reveals that this opinion of Dr. Patzakis is based upon reasonable medical probability and not upon pure speculation. <em>(Gay </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 555, 564 [158 Cal.Rptr. 137].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\">Therefore, we conclude that the Board\u2019s decision granting reopening and increasing the permanent disability award must be annulled. The Board should reconsider the question of reopening in light of our opinion and conduct such further proceedings as may be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Future Medical Treatment</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Finally, we are asked to review the award of future medical treatment. In the original 1975 award, future medical treatment was not awarded. Petitioners assert that no good cause to reopen the issue of need for future medical treatment has been shown and that substantial evidence does not support the award thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In their petition for reconsideration of Judge Stark\u2019s decision, however, petitioners only challenged the award of future medical treatment on the basis that substantial evidence did not support the award thereof. They did not assert therein that no good cause to reopen the question of future medical treatment existed. This being so, they may not raise this point for the first time in their subsequent petition for writ of review. (\u00a7 5904; <em>Cedillo </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 450, 455-456 [96 Cal.Rptr. 471, 487 P.2d 1039].) Our review of the award of future medical treatment is accordingly limited to whether substantial evidence supports the award thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>While indicating no further care was needed at this time, Dr. Patzakis does recommend Macias have checkups one or two times per year. In his report of January 31, 1977, Donald A. Springer, M.D., notes the probability of need for further surgery. Thus, substantial evidence supports the award of future medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Summary and Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The Board\u2019s decision granting Macias\u2019 petition to reopen insofar as it increases the permanent disability award is annulled.

He drives a 1963 Corvair sometimes. After about one-half hour to one hour his right leg gets very stiff from the front of the knee to his toes which begin to tingle. This has reference to the first four toes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao_\">\u201cHe has frequent cramps at night and a burning sensation in the sole of his feet. He relieves the cramps by massaging his legs with alcohol. It helps a little. He has cramps sometimes during the day. He had cramps last night. He has night cramps about three or four times a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-g\">\u201cThe left leg is-also involved. If he sits or stands for a long time or changes body position, then he has a burning sensation in the soles of his feet. He has cramps on long standing, sitting for ten to 20 minutes. He also has a burning sensation in the soles of the feet if he stands for 40 to 60 minutes. If he walks four to five blocks, he has burning in the soles of his feet. If he doesn\u2019t feel good, he feels a numbness in his legs. This extends from just below the knee along the anterior aspect to the dorsum of the foot and also on the lateral aspect at the calf and also to the toes. This description pertains to both legs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUsT\">\u201cHe is bothered in his low back. He also has pain in his abdomen, which goes right through his body to the low back, each morning on arising. It is felt from the area in the region of the umbilicus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiv\">\u201cHis low back hurts all of the time. It feels like something is pushing on the bone. If he lifts heavy things or engages in a sudden movement or uses his arm, it is worse. He can perhaps lift 20 pounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arq\">\u201cHe has pain on going to sleep. He takes Anacin every night to help him sleep. He also does the exercises prescribed. They help to a point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A53\">\u201cIn the last six months, he can bend to tie his shoes without much difficulty but he can not remain bent over for more than one minute. it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUC\">\u201cDr. Morrow told applicant he could return to the same work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV8\">\u201cHe is not registered for work or looked for work since the injury. He does not go to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>school yet. He went to the 6th grade in Guadalajara. He may learn a new business. He does not know what it would be. He has made no plans as to how to live for the rest of his life. He may operate a filling station. Years ago he was a helper in one. He has no other income. He is now age 46.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI8\">tt \u00bb Judge Stark summarized Macias\u2019 testimony concerning his disability and complaints at the hearing on July 26, 1977, as follows: \u201cSince he was in Court in April of 1975, his condition has gotten worse. He has more problems in his left leg now, and he has a tremendous burning sensation at the base of his neck and into both shoulders. He also has strong headaches at the top of his head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ack\">\u201cHis left leg bothered him very little in April of 1975. He now has cramps in his left calf and on top of the left foot. He also has a burning sensation in the sole of his left foot. When he has cramps in his foot, he loses his balance and has to hold onto the wall at times. When he is asleep, the cramps in his calf wake him up. The burning sensation in the foot is constant. His left foot turns inward when he has cramps in the calf. He has cramps in the calf one to two times a day and three or four times per night. He has to sit up for relief. He massages his left leg and puts alcohol on it. This helps a little. He didn\u2019t have this problem as bad in April of 1975.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH5\">\u201cHe has always had the right leg complaints. These complaints have remained about the same. He has a burning sensation in his neck and into both shoulders which he first noticed about July of 1976. It appeared spontaneously. At times, it lasts three to four days. At times, it goes away in a minute. On some days, he has no problem in this area. He did not have these complaints in April of 1975. They have awakened him at night. He rotates his head in circles and rubs alcohol on his shoulders to get relief. This gives him a little relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASL\">\u201cHis neck condition is getting worse over the past six months. The pain is now more frequent. It happens during the day time too. The last time he had left leg cramps was this very day. He had neck complaints this day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajh\">\u201cHe first noticed headaches about the same time as he noticed the neck and shoulder pain. This was about one year ago. The headaches last up to fifteen days at a time. Sometimes they last as little as five or ten minutes, and sometimes they last one or two days. Sometimes he goes to sleep and wakes up with a headache. There is no pattern to when he gets the headaches. He feels left leg cramps when he has a false step or movement. He has not injured himself since April of 1975.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW06\">\u201cHe still can go up and down stairs with difficulty, but his ability to do this is now less than in April of 1975. He cannot move his foot as rapidly. He can stand 15 to 20 minutes just as he could in April of 1975. He can sit about the same as in April, 1975. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>\u201cHe has pain at a point just to the right of the spinal column at approximately belt level. The pain remains generally stationary. He gets relief of his leg pain in standing. His legs then are less numb. He always has a numb feeling in both legs. This wasn\u2019t as bad in April of 1975. The numbness in the left leg goes all the way down. In the right leg there is very little to the knee and more from the knee down. The numbness in the left leg goes into the foot. To get relief, he has to stand five to ten minutes. He sometimes drives. He cannot drive as well as in April of 1975 because his car has a clutch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agv\">\u201cHe probably could lift 25 pounds, but he hasn\u2019t tried. Bending causes pain in the low back. He had these complaints in April of 1975. Since April of 1975, his back has gotten worse since he cannot stand or lift as well. At times, he has to hold down to the armrest of a chair to sit down. This is because his back hurts, and he doesn\u2019t have the right balance in his legs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_2\">\u201cHe hasn\u2019t worked since October 14, 1972. He has made no attempt to return to work because he feels he cannot do his job. He feels he could do a job where he could stand or sit and do other things. He has not checked with the Employment Department because he feels they would laugh or joke about his ability to do small jobs. &lt;6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOJ\">\"... ,He takes aspirin every day, two in the morning and two at night. In April of 1975, he was also taking aspirin every day. He believes his lifting ability is now less than it was in April, 1975. He testified previously he did not think he could lift 20 to 25 pounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As4c\">u \u201cThe February 15, 1977, report of Dr. Rose indicates that the headaches, upper back, and neck pain increased in the spring of 1976 and that these stabilized around August or September of 1976, but he understands stabilize to mean that they occur all of the time. In fact, they were hurting all of the time in August or September of 1976. They now hurt the majority of the time. Actually, they only hurt the majority of the time then. (Applicant\u2019s testimony was confusing with regard to this history indicated. It appeared in answering the questions that he had to backtrack in order to be consistent. There is some question as to his understanding of stabilize and whether there was a language problem which caused this seemingly inconsistent history.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT2\">\u201cThe Summary of Evidence [of the April 24, 1975 hearing] was read to the applicant. He testified that, in fact, the summary was correct as to what his complaints were, but that his complaints are now different. His pain is more intense now. When he walks for long periods of time, he is unable to urinate properly. In April of 1975, he did not have this problem. He cannot drive as before. He did not tell Dr. Springer about his headaches because they didn\u2019t hurt a lot when he saw Dr. Springer. He did tell about them to Dr. Avila. He told about them to Dr. Rose in February. He told Dr. Rose that the headaches were stable in August or September of 1976. (Again there may be some confusion as applicant\u2019s understanding of the word stable or an inconsistent history.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>\u201cHe was having neck, shoulder, and head complaints last summer. He believes they have gotten sharper during the past six months and that his condition over the past six months is getting worse.

He will require intermittent professional attention for an extended period of time, perhaps throughout life, should be given analgesics and tranquilizers as well as home physiotherapeutic techniques and muscle strengthening exercises.
