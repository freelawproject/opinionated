During this period he became entitled to a commission of $956.81 as a result of a real estate listing he obtained for Day. Day failed to pay $478.41<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of this amount and Resnik filed a claim for the unpaid sum with the California Labor Commissioner. The commissioner awarded Resnik the $478.41 and Day filed an appeal de novo pursuant to California Labor Code section 98.2 in the superior court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That court also found in favor of Resnik for the same amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Day made timely motions for dismissal of the action due to a lack of jurisdiction during both the administrative and superior court proceedings, claiming that Resnik was not an employee of Day. The motions were denied although the trial court made findings that Resnik\u2019s contract with Day stated a relationship of independent contractor between the parties; that Resnik was also engaged as a full-time employee with the Bank of America during his association with Day; and that during his 19-1/2 month relationship with Day, Resnik delivered only 1 real estate listing, made no real estate sales, took no \u201cfloor time\u201d in Day\u2019s Northridge office and met with management no more than 11 times.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Day contends on appeal that neither the Labor Commissioner nor the superior court had subject matter jurisdiction over Resnik\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Day initially contends that the jurisdiction of both the Labor Commissioner and the superior court is limited to employee complaints, and this is conceded by the Labor Commissioner. Labor Code sections 96 and 98, subdivision (a), expressly allow the Labor Commissioner to take assignment of employee claims with the authority to resolve all matters within its jurisdiction. Any party to the proceedings may seek review of the commissioner\u2019s decision by filing an appeal to the superior court where the matter will be heard de novo (Lab. Code, \u00a7 98.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">On this basis Day argues that neither the Labor Commissioner nor the superior court had subject matter jurisdiction over Resnik\u2019s complaint and in support of this argument it points to the court\u2019s finding that Resnik was an independent contractor rather than an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The critical legal distinction between employees and independent contractors is the right to control the manner and means by which the agent conducts his business (51 C.J.S., Labor Relations, \u00a7 37(b), p. 649). A bona fide contractor is customarily engaged in an independently established business and retains the right to control the manner in which he performs his contract (Lab. Code, \u00a7 2750.5). An employee, on the other hand, is subject to the absolute control and direction of his employer <em>(Gipson </em>v. <em>Davis Realty Co. </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 190, 205 [30 Cal.Rptr. 253]). An employee may be classified as either a servant or an agent, but both convey the notion of action taken under employment and express the idea of service <em>(id., </em>at pp. 205-206).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">While there may be some question of fact as to whether Resnik qualifies as a contractor or an agent employee, the Legislature has made Resnik an employee of Day as a matter of law <em>(id., </em>at p. 206). An analysis of the statutory scheme relating to real estate salesmen compels the conclusion that such a person is strictly the agent of the broker under whom he is licensed <em>(Gipson </em>v. <em>Davis Realty Co., supra, </em>215 Cal.App.2d at pp. 206-207; <em>Grand </em>v. <em>Griesinger </em>(1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 397, 406 [325 P.2d 475]). A real estate salesman cannot contract in his own name <em>(ibid.); </em>he can only be employed by a licensed real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>broker (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10132;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he cannot \u201cbe employed by... any person other than the broker under whom he is at the time licensed\u201d (\u00a7 10137); and his license must remain in the possession of his broker employer (\u00a7 10160), who risks the suspension or revocation of his own license if he fails \u201cto exercise reasonable supervision over the activities of his salesmen\u201d (\u00a7 10177, subd. (h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">We conclude, therefore, that a salesman, insofar as his relationship with his broker is concerned, cannot be classified as an independent contractor. Any contract which purports to change that relationship is invalid as being contrary to the law <em>(Gipson </em>v. <em>Davis Realty Co., supra, </em>215 Cal.App.2d 190, 207).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Day further contends that even if Resnik qualifies as an agent as a matter of law, this principle should not be extended to all aspects of a broker\u2019s business. Although there is authority for this proposition, it is inapposite to the issue in the case at bench for three reasons. First, the cases cited in support of this principle <em>(California Emp. Stab. Com. </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 812 [172 P.2d 497]; <em>Cal. Emp. Stab. Com. </em>v. <em>Norins Realty Co. </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 419 [175 P.2d 217]; <em>Royal Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1930) 104 Cal.App. 290 [285 P. 912]) address and are limited to a different issue, i.e., whether a real estate salesman can be classified as an employee for purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Act and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Second, <em>Morris, Norins </em>and <em>Royal Indemnity </em>were all decided prior to the addition of section 10177, subdivision (h).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The presence of this provision, in conjunction with the other provisions applicable to real estate salesmen, has been deemed to be indicative of the legislative intent to create a principal-agent relationship between a broker and his salesman. <em>(Gipson </em>v. <em>Davis Realty Co., supra, </em>215 Cal.App.2d 190, 206; <em>Grand </em>v. <em>Griesinger, supra, </em>160 Cal.App.2d 397, 406.) Finally, Day does not present any reason, much less a compelling one, why the classification of Resnik as an agent as a matter of law should not be applied to Labor Code sections 96, 98, and 98.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Jefferson (Bernard), Acting P.
