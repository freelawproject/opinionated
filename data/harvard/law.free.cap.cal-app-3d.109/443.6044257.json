Code, \u00a7\u00a7 663, 459). He was placed on probation for 2 years; as a condition of probation he was ordered to serve 300 days in the county jail and to make restitution in the amount of $150. He has appealed the conviction, contending that the trial court erred by failing to suppress evidence of statements appellant made to law enforcement officers. Appellant argues that evidence of both his statements to sheriffs officers was inadmissible under <em>People </em>v. <em>Hitch </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 641 [117 Cal.Rptr. 9, 527 P.2d 361], because a tape recording of one of the statements was erased by a secretary at the sheriffs department. Appellant also contends the court erred by requiring him to make restitution in the amount of $150 as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">On the night of June 11-12, 1977, as Mr. Robert Swanberg was preparing to go to bed in his Visalia home, he heard something which sounded like the prying apart of wood. A few minutes later, Swanberg went outside to investigate. He followed the sound to one of the new, unoccupied houses in the subdivision where Swanberg saw two figures near the back of the new house. He told the people to halt, flashing his light on them. When they started to run, Swanberg fired a warning shot. The intruders continued running, but Swanberg was able to grab appellant Goss.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Swanberg told appellant to get down on the ground. Appellant asked if Swanberg was \u201cthe law,\u201d to which Swanberg replied he was a concerned neighbor. Appellant regurgitated and said he was so sick he didn\u2019t care if he was shot. He again attempted to flee, but Swanberg apprehended him in an open field. Swanberg detained appellant until officers from the sheriffs department arrived at about 1 a.m. (Swan-berg\u2019s wife, having heard the commotion, called for help).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Sheriffs Officer Dale Hardin responded to the call. Appellant was taken into custody and Hardin investigated the area for evidence. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>found an L-shaped tire iron near the unoccupied residence where Swan-berg first observed appellant and the other person. Officer Hardin noted pry-marks on a window of the house and the sliding glass door had been pried open approximately 18 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Appellant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and spoke with officers at the scene. Detective Alfred Richmond asked appellant why he had gone to the house in question. Appellant said he had been driving an automobile with a man named \u201cKenny\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the car had run out of gas. He claimed that he and - Kenny had walked to the residence to get some gasoline. Appellant explained that he went to the back door of the residence, and then he and Kenny started to run when a man began shooting at them.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">An older model Pontiac was discovered about one-half mile from the house where appellant was found. There were several other obviously occupied houses between the car and the house in question. It was later determined that the Pontiac belonged to a friend, who had loaned the car to appellant that evening. A tire changing tool was missing from the car when the friend retrieved the car from the towing service which had towed it from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Murry Jackson towed the Pontiac from the location at which it was parked to his towing establishment during the early morning hours of June 12th. In looking through the vehicle, he found a wallet containing appellant\u2019s identification under the front seat. The car started right away after having been towed and the gas gauge registered one-quarter tank. The owner testified the gas gauge was not accurate, but the car did run from the towing service to a nearby gas station when reclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">After appellant was taken to the sheriffs department, he again waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and spoke with Detective Richard Logan. Logan testified that appellant made the following statement to him. Appellant borrowed a friend\u2019s car on the night in question because his own car was not operating, and he was using the friend\u2019s vehicle to transport a battery to his car. He claimed to have met \u201cKenny\u201d at a Kwik Stop Market and solicited his help in driving one of the two cars after the battery was installed. While they were in the friend\u2019s car, Kenny told appellant to drive into a residential area. Appellant advised Kenny that they were getting low on gas and Kenny directed him down a road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>which Kenny thought would lead to a gas station. Appellant stated that they then ran out of gas and that they proceeded to walk toward where they believed the gas station was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Logan further testified that appellant told him Kenny suggested they \u201crip off\u201d a microwave oven from one of the unoccupied houses in the subdivision through which they were walking. Kenny showed appellant another house where he said he had \u201cripped off\u201d a microwave oven the night before.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kenny told appellant to go around to the back of the target house, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Officer Logan testified that after he obtained the foregoing statement from appellant (which was not recorded) he then decided to tape record a statement from appellant. He did so, played the tape back and heard the statement. He later turned the tape over to a sheriff\u2019s department secretary for transcribing. Some time shortly thereafter, Logan replayed the tape and discovered that nothing could be heard on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">On cross-examination of Officer Logan, defense counsel read from the report Officer Logan had originally prepared after taking the first unrecorded statement from appellant. The original report didn\u2019t mention the portion of appellant\u2019s statement referring to burglarizing a house to \u201crip off\u201d a microwave oven. That first report simply stated that appellant and Kenny went into the subdivision looking for a gas station and that appellant walked to the back of an unoccupied house, where he saw a man who started chasing him with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Officer Logan prepared a supplemental report after he discovered that the tape-recorded statement had been erased. The supplemental report, set forth in part in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> included incriminating remarks by appellant about the plan to burglarize the unoccupied house and take a microwave oven.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Appellant testified on his own behalf and denied attempting to commit a burglary. He also denied using a tire iron. In addition he offered an explanation for being in the subdivision with Kenny and for running from Swanberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Appellant denied admitting to Officer Logan that Kenny mentioned his plan to break into the house. He claimed that the incriminating admissions in the supplemental police report prepared by Officer Logan were untrue. He had no idea who caused the damage to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">An evidentiary hearing was held in connection with appellant\u2019s motion to suppress testimony of Officer Logan as to his statements pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Hitch, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d .641. Detective Richard Logan testified concerning the two reports he prepared and the two statements he took from appellant. Logan said that Sergeant Henry Babcock was present when the first statement was taken; Logan was alone with appellant when the second statement was taken. Logan testified that the second statement (which was tape recorded) was taken right after the first statement (which was not). Logan said the two statements were \u201csubstantially the same.\u201d Two days after taping appellant\u2019s statement, Logan took the tape to Cheryl Porter, the detective secretary, for transcribing. While Logan was giving the tape to Ms. Porter, he noticed another detective bring four or five tapes to her. The other detective deposited his tapes on Ms. Porter\u2019s desk and asked her to erase them. Detective Logan returned to his office, and about five minutes later, Ms. Porter came in to tell him she thought she had erased the tape of appellant\u2019s statement. Logan discovered the tape had been erased before transcribing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Logan testified as to the office procedures for handling such tapes. He also testified he followed that procedure with the tape of appellant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Appellant also testified at the hearing on the <em>Hitch </em>motion, to establish the materiality of the lost tape. He testified that the statements attributed to him in Logan\u2019s supplemental report were inconsistent with what he actually told Logan.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">After hearing the foregoing evidence, the trial court took the matter under submission and later ruled as follows: \u201cIt Is Hereby Ordered That Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress Pursuant to People vs Hitch Is Granted as to the Second Conversation With the Officer Which Was Taped, Said Tape Having Been Destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u201cThe Court Will Not Suppress the First Conversation of the Defendant With the Officer Which Was Not Taped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">I.  <em>The Hitch issue was properly preserved for appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">After the court ruled on appellant\u2019s <em>Hitch </em>motion, appellant\u2019s counsel stated that he wanted to withdraw the motion at the commencement of the jury trial. He explained that he wanted to do this because the court\u2019s ruling that only the second statement would be suppressed left him in a worse position than if nothing had been suppressed. While the court\u2019s ruling allowed the officer to testify as to appellant\u2019s admissions, it precluded appellant from mentioning the destruction of the tape. Defense counsel stated that he wanted to withdraw the motion so the jury could hear evidence that the tape was erased by the sheriffs department, yet defense counsel stated that he also wanted to preserve the issue of the court\u2019s ruling on the <em>Hitch </em>motion for appeal. The court indicated it would allow defense counsel to withdraw the motion, but that this would have the effect of allowing evidence of the second statement and the loss of the tape to go before the jury without objection, thus creating a risk that the <em>Hitch </em>issue would not be preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">We need not reach the issue of whether defense counsel\u2019s actions resulted in a waiver of the <em>Hitch </em>issue, because the Attorney General concedes that the issue was preserved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Penal Code, section 1259 supports such a concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>II. <em>The trial court erred by failing to suppress evidence of both of appellant\u2019s statements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred by ruling that only the second statement, which was tape recorded, had to be suppressed. We agree, but find the error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">All of Detective Logan\u2019s testimony concerning both statements should have been suppressed pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Hitch, supra, </em>12 Cal. 3d 641. The second statement was taken immediately after the first, and the two statements were substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The <em>Hitch </em>case set forth the following principles governing the loss or destruction of evidence by law enforcement. The court first adopted a standard for determining whether the evidence is sufficiently important to require that it be preserved and made available to the defendant. The <em>Hitch </em>court adopted a standard similar to that applicable when a defendant seeks to discover the identity of a confidential informant.  The court held that evidence must be preserved and disclosed if \u201cthere is a <em>reasonable possibility </em>that [it] would constitute favorable evidence on the issue of guilt or innocence\u201d (12 Cal.3d at p. 649, italics added). The <em>Hitch </em>opinion then discussed the consequences of failure to preserve such evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court held: \u201c. ..[W]here. . .such evidence cannot be disclosed because of its intentional but nonmalicious destruction by the investigative officials, sanctions shall in the future be imposed for such nonpreservation and nondisclosure unless the prosecution can show that the governmental agencies involved have established, enforced and attempted in good faith to adhere to rigorous and systematic procedures designed to preserve the test ampoule and its contents and the reference ampoule used in such chemical test. The prosecution shall bear the burden of demonstrating that such duty to preserve the [evidence] has been fulfilled. If the prosecution meets its burden and makes the required showing, then the <em>results </em>of the breathalyzer test shall be admissible in evidence, even though the ampoules and their contents have been lost. If the prosecution fails to meet its burden then the court shall apply sanctions for nondisclosure. Finally we hold that in such latter event due process shall not require a dismissal of the action but shall require merely that the <em>results of the breathalyzer test be excluded from evidence.\u201d (Id., </em>at pp. 652-653, fns. omitted; italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>In discussing the appropriate sanctions, the <em>Hitch </em>court went on to state: \u201c\u2018If the evidence of the breathalyzer test is excluded, there is no reason why the People may not, if they desire, go forward with whatever other proof may be available.\u2019 [Quoting from <em>Van Halen </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 233, 238 (82 Cal.Rptr. 140).] Indeed the other proof may well be overwhelming. The material evidence provided by a preservation of the ampoules and their contents serves the function of possibly impeaching the test results. Therefore suppressing the test <em>results </em>should fully balance the improper failure to preserve the potentially impeaching evidence. It is noteworthy that where material evidence which would be of potential value in the impeachment of a prosecution witness has been improperly lost or destroyed by the government, federal decisions have indicated that the appropriate sanction to be imposed is the suppression of the witness\u2019 testimony. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hitch, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The <em>Hitch </em>court also noted that \u201c[t]he purpose of imposing sanctions on the prosecution where material evidence favorable to the defendant has been nonmaliciously lost or destroyed is of course to afford to the defendant to the fullest extent a fair trial.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling on the <em>Hitch </em>motion, we apply the normal standard applicable in a section 1538.5 suppression motion to the extent the ruling is based on factual determinations. On appeal all presumptions favor the trial court\u2019s proper exercise of its power to judge credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in the evidence, weigh evidence and draw factual.inferences, and the trial court\u2019s findings\u2014whether express or implied\u2014must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Keithley) </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 406, 410 [118 Cal.Rptr. 617, 530 P.2d 585]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Swearingen </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 570, 576 [148 Cal.Rptr. 755] (dis. opn. of Hanson, J.) which applied that standard in a <em>Hitch </em>suppression issue.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In this case, the trial court imposed a sanction. Therefore, it must have concluded that the tape was material evidence under the standards set forth in <em>Hitch </em>and further concluded that the sheriff\u2019s department failed to establish and comply with rigorous and systematic procedures for the preservation of the tape. The evidence supports such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">First, as to materiality, there was a reasonable possibility that the tape could have impeached the officer\u2019s account of appellant\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ment to him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant testified at the hearing on the <em>Hitch </em>motion that he never made the incriminating statements about Kenny\u2019s plan to commit a burglary, which the officer claimed appellant had made in both statements. Appellant\u2019s denial of these admissions establish the tape\u2019s materiality. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 6, 16 [131 Cal.Rptr. 311].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The next question is the adequacy of law enforcement\u2019s efforts to preserve the tape.  Respondent contends the evidence established that the sheriff\u2019s department did have \u201creasonable procedures\u201d for preserving tape-recorded statements and that the erasure of the tape here was inadvertent and only slightly negligent. The fact that the erasure may have been negligent rather than intentional does not preclude imposition of <em>Hitch </em>sanctions. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Swearingen, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 570, the appellate court rejected a contention that <em>Hitch </em>is inapplicable to negligent loss of evidence. The <em>Swearingen </em>court stated at page 574: \u201cThe Attorney General argues that <em>Hitch </em>is applicable only when there has been an intentional destruction of evidence by the police and not negligent loss of evidence. The argument fails.... [T]he <em>Hitch </em>rule exists to guarantee a defendant a fair trial through the preservation of evidence and not to punish police conduct. A fair trial is no less denied by negligent loss of evidence than it is by nonmalicious destruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In the present case, the prosecution did present evidence of the procedures employed in the sheriff\u2019s department to preserve tapes of defendants\u2019 statements. This evidence revealed that the tape was placed randomly on the secretary\u2019s desk for transcribing. The trial court may reasonably have concluded that tapes to be erased should have been segregated and clearly marked. Certainly, such a procedure is not inconsistent with the <em>Hitch </em>opinion. In that opinion the court used the words \u201crigorous and systematic procedures\u201d\u2014not the more lenient language (\u201creasonable procedures\u201d) adopted in the respondent\u2019s brief. <em>(Hitch, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at pp. 652-653.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">As noted by this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 831 [131 Cal.Rptr. 104], <em>Hitch </em>established a \u201cstringent\u201d rule for the preservation of evidence <em>(id. </em>at p. 841). There is substantial evidence in this case to uphold the implied finding that the sheriff\u2019s department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>failed to undertake sufficient efforts to preserve the tape. Thus, imposition of some sanction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Turning to the propriety of the sanction adopted by the trial court, this court must proceed without much guidance from other reported decisions.  <em>Hitch </em>notes that the mode of sanctions depends upon the particular circumstances surrounding the destruction or loss of evidence (H<em>itch, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 650).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In the circumstances herein, the limited sanction imposed by the trial court still left appellant in the position of being confronted with evidence of his admissions, without having the benefit of the tape for impeachment. <em>Hitch </em>notes that \u201cwhere material evidence which would be of potential value in the impeachment of a prosecution witness has been improperly lost or destroyed by the government, federal decisions have indicated that <em>the appropriate sanction to be imposed is the suppression of the witness\u2019 testimony. (United States </em>v. <em>Bryant </em>(1971) 448 F.2d 1182 [145 App.D.C. 259]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Augello </em>(2d Cir. 1971) 451 F.2d 1167; Comment, <em>supra, </em>39 U.Chi.L.Rev. 542, 561.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hitch, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 654, italics added.) This principle was restated in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 357 [150 Cal.Rptr. 216] as follows: \u201cWhere potentially impeaching evidence on behalf of a defendant is suppressed [by law enforcement], due process does not require dismissal of the action, but only <em>exclusion of the prosecution\u2019s evidence which might have been impeached by the evidence </em>suppressed\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 363, italics added).  Since the missing tape might have had impeachment value as to Logan\u2019s testimony regarding both statements,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Logan should have been precluded from testifying as to either statement. Evidence of the first statement had to have been excluded in order to make the sanction of suppressing the second statement meaningful and effective. The suppression of only the second statement was of little, if any, benefit to appellant or detriment to the prosecution. It did little to balance the improper failure to preserve the potentially impeaching evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">We are not unmindful that the sanction the trial court imposed may have been an attempt to balance the hardships arising from the improper failure to preserve the potentially impeaching evidence. The sanction chosen by the trial court simply could not accomplish that objective. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The difficulty here is that the officers had no duty to tape record the first statement (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 666, 669-670 [125 Cal.Rptr. 341]). Therefore, if the officers had simply stopped after receiving the first statement, rather than making and then losing a tape of the second statement, there would have been no problem with allowing Logan to testify as to the contents of the first statement. We recognize the argument that it would be an unusual extension of <em>Hitch </em>to exclude evidence of the first statement, which would have been admissible even if no tape had ever been made. A sanction excluding evidence of the first statement might appear to penalize the prosecution for making the tape. This is not our intent. We realize that the purpose of <em>Hitch </em>sanctions is <em>not </em>to punish police conduct, but merely to insure that the defendant receives a fair trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Swearingen, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 570, 574.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In the unique circumstances of this case, we appreciate the difficulty faced by the trial court in attempting to reconcile the competing interests without either punishing the prosecution or depriving appellant of impeachment evidence. Suppression of both statements would have prevented the prosecution from introducing evidence (of the first statement) which would have been admissible, had no tape ever been made. This is a strong sanction. However, we believe it was impermissible to suppress only the second statement because this precluded appellant from informing the jury that a tape had been made and lost. That fact may have damaged Logan\u2019s credibility, particularly as to the statements he added in the supplemental report, after he knew it was no longer possible to verify the contents of appellant\u2019s admissions by resort to the tape. If appellant had accepted the questionable \u201cbenefit\u201d of the trial court\u2019s <em>Hitch </em>ruling, his opportunity to impeach Logan\u2019s testimony would have been substantially impaired. However, appellant withdrew his <em>Hitch </em>motion before trial, and some evidence to impeach Logan did go before the jury. The jury heard evidence that a tape had been made and lost and that Logan\u2019s supplemental report differed from his first. Thus, Logan\u2019s testimony was in actuality not infused with a false aura of veracity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The result is that the ruling on the <em>Hitch </em>motion, followed by withdrawal of the motion did not have the effect of depriving appellant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>When evidence affecting the credibility of a witness is nonmaliciously lost or destroyed, the reviewing court need not reverse the conviction if the absence of the evidence (or in this case the presence of evidence which might have been impeached by the missing evidence) was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruthford </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 399, 408-409 [121 Cal.Rptr. 261, 534 P.2d 1341], citing <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.3d at p. 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">After considering all of the evidence, the practical effect of the ineffective sanction imposed by the trial court and appellant\u2019s position after withdrawing his <em>Hitch </em>motion, we conclude that any error in allowing evidence of the first statement without the tape to impeach it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. There was strong evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt and no viable defense. Appellant was virtually caught in the act of attempting to burglarize the unoccupied residence. Mr. Swanberg saw him behind the house near where the door had been pried open. A tire tool was found nearby and one such tool was missing from the car appellant was driving. There was evidence of consciousness of guilt, in that appellant attempted to flee from Swanberg, rather than remain there to clear up the situation. Moreover, there was evidence that appellant gave a false name (Carl Goss) at one point. Appellant\u2019s proffered explanation that he had run out of gas and was hoping to find some at the residence in question was highly unlikely to raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors for the following reasons. There was evidence that his car contained sufficient gasoline to start up on two occasions. Moreover, there were several houses with lights on between the place where appellant left his car and the house where he was supposedly seeking gasoline. Additionally, there was evidence that the house where appellant was found was obviously unoccupied. The total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>picture of the evidence against appellant was so strong that any <em>Hitch </em>error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">III. <em>The court properly imposed a probation condition requiring appellant to make restitution in the amount of $150.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Appellant contends it was error to require him to make restitution in the amount of $150, because that amount represented the full cost of repairing the damage done to the house broken into. Appellant contends he should not have been required to pay for all the loss, because there was a confederate involved in the attempted burglary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Appellant relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Kay </em>(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 759 [111 Cal.Rptr. 894, 73 A.L.R.3d 1235], where the appellate court invalidated a restitution condition of probation. In <em>Kay </em>five persons were convicted of felony assault and felony battery in connection with a demonstration at a university hospital. The total amount of property damage was $40,356.97, and the trial court required each of the five convicted defendants to pay one-fifth of the losses. The appellate court held that such a probation condition could not stand. One of the reasons why the condition in <em>Kay </em>was invalid was that there were 123 demonstrators, and only 5 bore all the losses, which amounted to a substantial sum; 18 other defendants were convicted in municipal court of offenses arising from the demonstration and they were not required to pay anything by way of restitution. Moreover, the condition in <em>Kay </em>was not at all related to the acts (assaults) committed by the appellants, because there was no showing that the particular appellants in <em>Kay </em>had even been responsible for the property damage <em>(id., </em>at pp. 762-763). Additionally, the trial court in <em>Kay </em>failed to consider whether the appellants were able to pay such a large amount (approximately $8,000 each) <em>(id., </em>at p. 763).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The <em>Kay </em>court, in remanding, stated: \u201cOn remand, the judge will have information about the present resources of appellants and of their prospects. He will take into account the entire situation, including the responsibility of other guilty parties, not only those who were convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>in the municipal court, but also the total number of demonstrators, because apparently it is impossible to determine who among them was responsible for any particular damage to the property. We ought not spell out in more detail our conclusions but rather to leave the matter to the judge\u2019s good discretion.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">While the <em>Kay </em>opinion does indicate that the sentencing court imposing a restitution order should take into account the responsibility of other guilty parties, it does not establish rigid guidelines for apportionment, but merely requires the court to consider this factor in exercising its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In the present case, the total amount for which appellant was required to make restitution amounted to a much smaller figure than in <em>Kay. </em>And in this case, the restitution requirement clearly relates to the crime of which appellant was convicted. Appellant and his confederate should be jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the damage. This case does not present a restitution order totally unwarranted by the facts, as was the case in <em>Kay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The trial court has broad discretion in imposing conditions of probation. A condition of probation will generally not be invalidated unless it: \u201c\u2018(1) has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality. ...\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481, 486 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545], quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Dominguez </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 623, 627 [64 Cal.Rptr. 290].) The purposes of an order for restitution are rehabilitating the offender and deterring future criminal conduct <em>(People </em>v. <em>Richards </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 614, 620 [131 Cal.Rptr. 537, 552 P.2d 97]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lent, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 481, 486). The <em>Lent </em>court observed that the restitution order need not be limited to the transactions or amounts of which the defendant is actually convicted <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Since it could serve a rehabilitative purpose to require appellant to make the victim whole, and since the amount in question here was not great, we conclude there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court requiring appellant to pay for all the victim\u2019s losses. The fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>another party was involved in the crime does not preclude the court from requiring full restitution by appellant. This was a valid condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Hopper, Acting P.

Goss stated he was then told by Kenny that he was planning to rip off another house with Goss\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>help and steal another oven. Goss stated that he and Kenny located an unoccupied house and that Kenny told him to go to the rear of the house. Goss stated that he went to the rear of the house and heard noises that sounded like someone banging on a door where Kenny was at. Goss advised R.O. that it was not his idea to break into the house, but he was told by Kenny they were going to break into a house.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-11\"> Cheryl Porter testified, confirming that she had erased the tape under the circumstances testified to by Logan. She said she had been on the phone when Logan brought her the tape for transcribing. Another officer laid several tapes on top of Logan\u2019s tape and she erased the whole pile of tapes, including the tape given to her by Logan. Ms. Porter said the erasure of Logan\u2019s tape was not intentional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\"> No unfairness would result from treating this issue on appeal because the <em>Hitch </em>motion afforded both parties opportunity to present evidence of the facts surrounding erasure of the tape (contrast <em>People </em>v. <em>Burciago </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 151, 169-170 [146 Cal.Rptr. 236]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\"> The evidence at issue in <em>Hitch </em>was a test ampoule and its contents, which were the product of a breathalyzer test administered to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> A showing of materiality is accomplished where the appellant demonstrates a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d the evidence would be favorable on the issue of guilt or innocence.

The following is an excerpt from his argument. \u201c[W]hen there\u2019s been testimony about an oral confession you should look to that testimony with caution. [11] And I think in this case you should look on that testimony with extreme caution, because here you don\u2019t have any report, any evidence of a confession until after the tape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>was erased. [II] Now, maybe Officer Logan is mistaken about what Donny told him. Maybe he really thinks that Donny said what is in his supplemental report. Officer Logan knew microwave ovens had been taken in the recent past in that area. Maybe he expected Donny to say that was why he was there. I don\u2019t know. [II] But I do know that if we had the tape here I would play it for you. I would let you hear what Donny actually said. But through no fault of ours, we cannot do that. I think that if the tape still were in existence none of us would be here today because we would all know for sure, for absolute positive, that Donny did not say what Officer Logan says he said. But we do not have the tape here and I cannot play it for you. [11] I have been very reluctant to say that Office [sic] Logan did not tell the truth here. I\u2019ll let you decide that. But, really, you don\u2019t have to decide that question. All you need to do is when you look at the evidence, if you have a reasonable doubt as to Donny\u2019s guilt, you must return a verdict of not guilty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\"> Apparently, Kenneth Wayne Woods was also charged with the subject offense, but the record makes no mention of whether Woods was convicted of the attempted burglary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
