In its answer, the City affirmatively alleged, inter alia, that the wrong suffered by plaintiff (hereafter sometimes referred as respondent) was caused \u201csolely by [his] willfully resisting a public officer in the discharge and attempt to discharge the duty of his office,\u201d and that as a result of having had \u201creasonable cause to believe that a public offense was being committed in their presence,\u201d there \u201cexisted probable cause to arrest and detain the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">After the jury returned its verdict, appellant City (hereafter sometimes referred to as defendant) moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial. City contended that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury pursuant to BAJI No. 6.86. It is from the judgment that the City now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">The sole question before us is whether the trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to instruct the jury on a central issue in the case as a result of rejecting defendant\u2019s improperly drafted jury instruction regarding BAJI No. 6.86, on \u201cReasonable Cause for Arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Although there was substantial conflicting evidence in the testimony of the officers themselves,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as that of an eyewitness\u2014the following account is the version most favorable to the City in that they were denied instruction requested by them relating to their theory of the case. <em>(Sills </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Transit Lines </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 630, 633 [255 P.2d 795]; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball Club </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 620, 623-624 [128 Cal.Rptr. 807, 91 A.L.R.3d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On Sunday, June 30, 1974, Officers Hofer and Retana responded to a radio call regarding a man with a shotgun disturbing the peace on the 500 block of 35th Street. In the vicinity of the disturbance a citizen pointed out the suspect and the latter was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon and placed inside the officers\u2019 car. Officer Hofer then proceeded to a barbershop nearby, after being told , by another citizen that the man just arrested (Davis) \u201chad gone into [the shop] and left the gun in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Upon entering an open door to the shop, Officer Hofer observed respondent, Roberts, standing about 10 feet inside the door. Hofer was shortly joined by Officers Reiner and Higginbotham, who he believed were there to back him up. The evidence as to what happened from this point forward is substantially contradictory but, in a light most favorable to the City, can be summarized as follows: plaintiff (who officers believed at the time was either the owner or manager of the shop), apparently intoxicated, told the officers in an excited manner that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>could not look for the gun in the shop; Officers Reiner and Hofer proceeded to an open room in the back of the shop, while Officer Higginbotham stationed himself between them and Roberts, who was becoming adamant in his demand that they leave; after finding the shotgun in the rear of the shop, Officers Hofer and Reiner passed by Roberts and Higginbotham, who were still arguing; at this point, Higginbotham saw Roberts reaching for the arm in which Officer Hofer was carrying the gun and after stopping him from doing so, he believed that Roberts was then attacking him and \u201cfearful for his own safety,\u201d applied a bar arm control hold which resulted in both men falling to the ground; Roberts was then handcuffed and placed under arrest for violation of section 148 of the Penal Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> interfering with or resisting arrest. After being driven to the police station and placed in a holding tank, he was released without being booked and was driven by Officers Reiner and Higginbotham back to the barbershop.</p>\n<p id=\"A4l\">Mr. Roberts, 62 years of age at the time of the above incident, filed a claim in which he alleged receiving a \u201cbroken rib, bruises, lacerations, and neck injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Whether there was reasonable cause to arrest is the central issue in this case. The trial court itself stated that \u201c[t]he test that we have here is whether there was reasonable cause for the arrest.... \u201d The City\u2019s contention that \u201cthe officers at all times acted lawfully,... and that the plaintiff was lawfully arrested for violation of section 148,\u201d also clearly indicates that probable cause to arrest is a fundamental issue in the case. We agree with appellant\u2019s contention that as a general rule an instruction on reasonable cause for arrest should have been given under these circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u201cIn an action for false arrest and imprisonment, the question of reasonable or probable cause is ordinarily one for the court .... When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the facts are controverted or the evidence conflicting,... the jury is to be told that if it finds the facts in a designated way such facts do or do not amount to probable cause.\u201d <em>(Whaley </em>v. <em>Jansen </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 222, 227 [25 Cal.Rptr. 184]; accord <em>Aitken </em>v. <em>White </em>(1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 134 [208 P.2d 788].) The court in <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>J. C. Penney Co., Inc. </em>(1958) 165 Cal.App.2d 640 [331 P.2d 1057], also makes it clear that in a false imprisonment case where the evidence is in conflict with respect to probable cause, it is \u201c\u2018. .. the duty of the court to instruct the jury as to what facts, if established, would constitute probable cause. ...\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 645, quoting <em>Aitken, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.2d at p. 141.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The general rule, however, is not without its corollary.  As the court stated in <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Sierra Boat Co. </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 325, 335 [145 Cal.Rptr. 47]: \u201cIt is the responsibility of counsel to propose correct instructions and the court has no duty to modify erroneous instructions submitted to it, and there is no error if it simply rejects such instructions. <em>(Shaw </em>v. <em>Pacific Greyhound Lines </em>(1958) 50 Cal. App.2d 153, 158 [323 P.2d 391].)\u201d The instruction which the <em>Hyatt </em>court found had been properly refused by the trial court in that case \u201cwas not a correct statement of the law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 334.) The instruction which the <em>Shaw </em>court <em>(supra, </em>50 Cal.App.2d at p. 158) found had been properly rejected by the trial court was erroneous in part because it was incomplete, the proponent not having filled in a blank space for the specific facts required for that party\u2019s contention. Both kinds of defects mentioned above are present in the instructions in issue in the case before us\u2014BAJI No. 6.86\u2014as submitted in various forms by defense counsel,  Here the City made four unsuccessful attempts to properly draft a comparatively simple jury instruction. All that was needed was to fill in the factual material in the place provided in BAJI No. 6.86.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Time after time after time the judge attempted to assist the deputy city attorney in how to properly complete the instruction, which merely required the setting forth of \u201cfacts, which, if true, would establish reasonable cause as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ample opportunity was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>provided to draft a usable instruction. During the tenth trial day, after a lengthy explanation of how to draft the instruction was given, the deputy city attorney withdrew her third effort and stated she was relying on a previous <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge, then faced with an untenable situation, ruled the instruction as offered did not \u201cset forth evidence of facts which if true would establish reasonable cause as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Directly before plaintiff\u2019s closing argument, the court asked counsel, for the next to the last time, if she wished to change the instruction as offered. Counsel replied, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">This, however, was not the end of the matter; after plaintiff\u2019s closing argument the court again offered to allow defense counsel to submit a proper instruction, after once again reading to her the comment to 6.86 and showing her the errors in her previous drafts.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>After a 1 -hour-and-40-minute recess, the court reconvened and counsel submitted her final attempt, defendant\u2019s instruction No. 34, which the court refused, characterizing it as a \u201cslanted, improper instruction, [not meeting] the needs of 6.86,. . . \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The City, while admitting that it \u201cfail[ed] to provide the trial court with a single, proper jury instruction on reasonable cause to arrest,\u201d argues that, nevertheless, \u201cthe trial court still had a duty to instruct the jury properly on [this issue].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In support of its contention, however, the City cites <em>Lysick </em>v. <em>Walcom </em>(1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 136, 157-158 [65 Cal.Rptr. 406, 28 A.L.R.3d 368], wherein the court concluded its opinion by stating that \u201c[i]n the instant case it was incumbent upon the trial court properly to instruct the jury on the controlling legal principles applicable to the case so that the jury would have a complete understanding of the law applicable to the facts; and the court was not relieved of this responsibility even though faulty or inadequate instructions were submitted by the parties or instructions were not submitted by the parties on the vital issues at all.\u201d (Accord <em>Trejo </em>v. <em>Maciel </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 487, 498 [48 Cal.Rptr. 765]; cf. <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Lankershim </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 409, 482 [71 P.2d 220]; <em>Pepper </em>v. <em>Underwood </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 698, 708 [122 Cal.Rptr. 343].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Although we note that the language regarding the submission of \u201cfaulty or inadequate instructions\u201d is dictum, we do not quarrel with the rule that it is the responsibility of the trial court to instruct the jury on the controlling legal principles applicable to a case. The existence of this \u201cresponsibility,\u201d however, does not in itself define its parameters, and we hold that it is not absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The precise issue before us is to what extent can the actions of the author of an improperly drawn instruction shape or limit the nature of the trial court\u2019s responsibility to instruct the jury on all vital issues to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the case? We hold the general rule to be not applicable to the case at bench, wherein the record clearly indicates that the conduct of defense counsel at trial was such that her refusal to modify and submit a proper BAJI No. 6.86 instruction regarding probable cause to arrest, was tantamount to insubordination, and, as such, resulted in a waiver of counsel\u2019s right to have the jury instructed on its theory of the case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">In <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Lankershim </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 409, 482 [71 P.2d 220], the court recognized the exception which here is applicable. There the court, after holding that a minor change in the proffered instruction (the words \u201ca presumption of undue influence\u201d should have been substituted for \u201cpresumption of fraud\u201d) should have been made, states: \u201cWe think this is the rule approved by statute and judicial decision where fundamentals are involved, <em>there being no attempt on the part of the author to mislead the court or jury by resorting to equivocally or ingeniously phrased requests,. . </em>.\u201d (Italics added. <em>Id. </em>at pp. 482-483.)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Defense counsel requested the court to give CALJIC Nos. 16.100, 16.101 and 16.105. CALJIC No. 16.101 defines \u201clawful arrest\u201d in regard to resisting arrest. Of its alternative definitions, counsel submitted the fourth, modified, in essence defining reasonable cause to arrest upon reasonable belief that a felony had been committed by the person arrested. (Defendant\u2019s instruction No. 13.) The term \u201cfelony\u201d is clearly inapplicable to respondent\u2019s actions herein and counsel seems to have confused respondent with Davis, who had been arrested prior to the officers entering the barber shop. CALJIC No. 16.105, also proffered in a modified form, refers to resisting detention for questioning or investigation. (Defendant\u2019s instruction No. 14.) This language is also inapplicable to the facts of the case at bench. Lastly, as the court noted, Defendant\u2019s instruction No. 7, CALJIC No. 16.100, as modified, \u201cimproperly changed the whole meaning of\u201d that instruction, and was also properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Finally counsel stated that she \u201cwould have no objection to the court giving CALJIC No. 16.100 with no modification.\u201d The trial court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>not at that time make a ruling on No. 16.100, but held it in abeyance awaiting the submission of a properly drawn BAJI No. 6.86 instruction, since the latter would have accurately covered the subject. We do not rule on the propriety of CALJIC No. 16.100. Even assuming it would have been proper to give it as finally requested, we find that counsel\u2019s refusal to properly modify BAJI No. 6.86 is tantamount to a waiver of any error on the part of the court in its failure to give the former instruction. Without defense counsel specifically calling to the attention of the trial judge the necessity to rule upon this instruction, after four days of discussion regarding BAJI No. 6.86 (extending into the middle of closing arguments), there was failure in a proper submission of the latter instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Two cases cited by appellant, that of <em>Pepper </em>v. <em>Underwood, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.3d 698, 708, and <em>Trejo </em>v. <em>Maciel, supra, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 487, are instructive as to the parameters of the trial court\u2019s responsibility in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In <em>Trejo </em>v. <em>Maciel, supra, </em>the jury requested further instructions on a point, and the judge declined to answer the question. The appellate court noted that \u201c[t]he responsibility for adequate instruction becomes particularly acute when the jury asked for specific guidance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 498.) In the case before us, the jury requested clarification of the meaning of false imprisonment. Not only did the trial court offer clarification, but asked of both counsel: \u201cDo either of you ask that I read anything further?\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s response was: \u201cThe defendant does not, your Honor.\u201d This is particularly relevant in that the requested clarification had to do with the meaning of false imprisonment, and the judge, in response, read BAJI No. 6.82, as modified to the jury \u2014\u201cAn arrest is taking a person into custody in a case and in a manner authorized by law. A false arrest is the unlawful taking of a person into custody.\u201d In answer to the trial court\u2019s question regarding counsels\u2019 wish to have anything read further, this would have been an appropriate time for defense counsel to again request an instruction on probable cause as a clarification of the words \u201cin a manner authorized by law,\u201d but once again she chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The last case cited by appellant, <em>Pepper </em>v. <em>Underwood, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.3d 698, an opinion of this court wherein we held that even though the requested instruction rejected by the court was inaccurate, \u201cit was the duty of the court to instruct the jury correctly on the measure of damages [citations], and if necessary request counsel to prepare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>an accurate, or <em>more </em>accurate instruction for that purpose.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 708. Italics in original.) The rejected instruction in <em>Pepper </em>was \u201ca substantially accurate statement\u201d of the law. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 707.) Not only has the trial court here met the responsibility placed upon it by <em>Pepper, </em>but the judge did much more in that he repeatedly requested counsel to resubmit a proper instruction over the course of four days, and outlined what he felt were the pertinent areas that needed to be factually covered. His suggestions were rejected by counsel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We note that if the court had given the instruction in the manner it saw proper, it would have done so against the wishes of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">As the court stated in <em>Gagosian </em>v. <em>Burdick\u2019s Television &amp; Appliances </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 316, 318 [62 Cal.Rptr. 70], \u201cThere is neither reason nor justification for compelling a trial judge to act as a sort of advisory or \u2018backup\u2019 counsel, with all the frustration of the employed attorneys\u2019 trial strategy and tactics which such a holding could encompass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Kaus, P.

In <em>Pedesky, </em>however, we did not anticipate the situation present in the case at bench, wherein experienced counsel proffering the instruction sought to place the judge in the untenable position of either giving an erroneous or misleading instruction or submitting a version of her own to which counsel had expressly stated its disagreement. In the factual context before us, this situation, in effect, gives rise to a waiver of the requested instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
