J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK-\">After two jury trials defendant was found guilty of attempted robbery, assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, burglary, receiving stolen property and obliteration of identification of a firearm, a violation of section 12090 of the Penal Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sentenced to prison, he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">At 8 p.m. on March 23, 1979, defendant staged a remarkably unsuccessful robbery at a home where Doctor Richard Young was doing carpentry work at the time. Doctor Young stunned defendant with his hammer, took possession of a revolver with which defendant had threatened him and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Two officers arrived, arrested defendant and seized the revolver. It was loaded and additional rounds of ammunition were found on defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The revolver had been stolen by an unidentified burglar from the home of one Robert Polhamus 11 days earlier, at which time it had a serial number on the butt end. When taken from defendant, the serial number had been obliterated. Polhamus was, however, able to identify the revolver by a nick on the handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The defense was that on May 23 defendant had called at the home in question thinking that it was for rent. He got into an argument with Doctor Young and was ready to walk away, when he was struck on the head. He lost consciousness. Asked whether he had a gun at the time the answer, as reported, was: \u201cNo, not I recall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">On appeal defendant contends first, that the court improperly instructed the jury on the presumption contained in section 12091 of the Penal Code and, second, that in sentencing him the court committed various violations of section 654 of that code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">Section 12090 makes it a felony to change, alter, remove or obliterate the manufacturer\u2019s number from any pistol or revolver. Section 12091 declares that \u201c[possession of any pistol or revolver upon which the... manufacturer\u2019s number... has been changed, altered, removed or obliterated, shall be presumptive evidence that the possessor has changed, altered, removed or obliterated the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cPossession of any pistol or revolver upon which the name of the maker, model, manufactur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>er\u2019s number or other mark of identification has been changed, altered, removed, or obliterated, shall be presumptive evidence that the possessor has changed, altered, or obliterated the same unless from all the evidence there is a reasonable doubt to rebut this presumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The People and defendant do not agree just what this instruction told the jurors. Defendant asserts that it compelled the jury to find the presumed fact\u2014obliteration\u2014from the proved fact\u2014possession\u2014unless defendant himself came forward with evidence to rebut the presumption. The People, on the other hand, deny that the instruction had any mandatory effect and claim that it permitted the jury not to find the presumed fact even if no evidence on the identity of the obliterator other than the proved fact of possession was before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We think both sides are wrong. Preliminarily we are bound to say that as a means of communicating with a jury, the instruction leaves a lot to be desired. What is a lay juror to do with a charge that one fact \u201cshall be presumptive evidence\u201d of another? What evidence does it take to create a reasonable doubt \u201cto rebut [a] presumption,\u201d which is not evidence at all, but a rule of law? (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 600 and com. thereto.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Leaving draftsmanship aside and turning to the contentions of the parties, we think defendant is quite wrong in arguing that the jury was told that the presumption could be rebutted only by evidence produced by the defense. The words \u201call the evidence\u201d were presumably understood to mean just that. Conversely, we cannot agree with the People that the instruction merely told the jury that obliteration was a permissible inference it could draw from possession. \u201cShall be presumptive evidence\u201d sounds mandatory to us.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If all that the court meant to say was that the jury could infer obliteration from possession, what would have been the point of using such words as \u201cshall,\u201d \u201cpresumptive evidence\u201d and \u201cpresumption?\u201d Why instruct at all? In sum, we think that the jury was told that it must find obliteration if it finds possession, unless other evidence concerning the identity of the obliterator\u2014regardless of its source\u2014created a reasonable doubt that the culprit was defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The real question is whether the presumption, as it was conveyed to the jury, complied with recently recognized constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The constitutionality of the presumption at issue here was before the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 774, 784 [151 P.2d 517]. Applying the then recent test of <em>Tot </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1943) 319 U.S. 463, 467-468 [87 L.Ed. 1519, 1524, 63 S.Ct. 1241]\u2014 whether there was a \u201crational connection\u201d based on \u201ccommon experience,\u201d between the fact proved and the fact presumed\u2014the California Supreme Court found the presumption valid. The holding was followed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 738, 741 [83 Cal.Rptr. 6] and <em>Marchese </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 545 F.2d 645, 647. <em>Marchese </em>is of significance because it was decided after the United States Supreme Court had tightened the <em>Tot </em>standard somewhat by holding, in <em>Leary </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 6 [23 L.Ed.2d 57, 89 S.Ct. 1532] that \u201ca criminal statutory presumption must be regarded as \u2018irrational\u2019 or \u2018arbitrary,\u2019 and hence unconstitutional, unless it can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend. ...\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 36 [23 L.Ed. 2d at p. 82].)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In a footnote which immediately follows the quoted portion of the <em>Leary </em>opinion, the court noted that since the presumption involved in that case was unconstitutional under the announced standard, it did not \u201creach the question whether a criminal presumption.. . must... satisfy the criminal \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 standard if proof of the crime charged or an essential element thereof depends upon its use.\u201d <em>(Leary </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>395 U.S. at p. 36, fn. 64 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 82].)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The problem which the court avoided in Leary\u2014the relevance of the reasonable doubt concept to criminal statutory presumptions\u2014became acute as far as the states are concerned when, a year later, in <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068], the Supreme Court held that the reasonable doubt standard was applicable to the states by way of due process. Obviously <em>Winship </em>threatens any state criminal conviction in which proof of an element of the offense depends on a presumption, unless a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the presumed fact follows from the basic fact. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573-574, 99 S.Ct. 2781].)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Many of the questions raised by the introduction of the reasonable doubt concept into the field of presumptions were answered in <em>Ulster County Court </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 140 [60 L.Ed.2d 777, 99 S.Ct. 2213]. At least two rules vital to a resolution of the present appeal emerge from that decision. First, the court held that \u201cin criminal cases, the ultimate test of any device\u2019s constitutional validity in a given case remains constant: the device must not undermine the factfinder\u2019s responsibility at trial, based on evidence adduced by the State, <em>to find the ultimate facts beyond a reasonable </em>doubt....\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 156 [60 L.Ed.2d, p. 791]. Italics added.) Therefore, in any case in which the jury is informed that it must find the presumed fact if it finds the basic fact, the presumption is invalid \u201cunless the fact proved is sufficient to support the inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt....\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 167 [60 L.Ed.2d, p. 798].)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The second rule which emerges from <em>Ulster County </em>is that where the jury is instructed that a presumption is mandatory,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the validity of the presumption under the reasonable doubt standard is judged by the presumption \u201con its face.\u201d It is immaterial that together with the facts of the particular case under consideration the basic fact might prove the presumed fact beyond a reasonable doubt. This is so because the jury\u2019s verdict may rest entirely on the mandatory effect of the presumption. Hence it must meet the reasonable doubt standard without any support from facts the jury may disregard or positively disbelieve. \u201cTo the extent that the trier of fact is forced to abide by the presumption, and may not reject it based on an independent evaluation of the particular facts presented by the State, the analysis of the presumption\u2019s constitutional validity is logically divorced from those facts and based on the presumption\u2019s accuracy in the run of cases. [Fn. omitted.] It is for this reason that the Court has held it irrelevant in analyzing a mandatory presumption, but not in analyzing a purely permissive one, that there is ample evidence in the record other than the presumption to support a conviction....\u201d <em>(Id., </em>pp. 159-160 [60 L.Ed.2d, pp. 793-794].) The wisdom of this rule is dramatically illustrated by the facts of this very case, in which the jury found defendant guilty of having violated section 12091, but was unable to agree that he possessed the weapon during a burglary and while attempting an armed robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Applying these rules it is obvious that the court erred in its instruction. Since the language of the instruction was mandatory, we must examine the presumption \u201con its face\u201d or mirrored against \u201cthe run of cases.\u201d It seems too clear to warrant extended discussion that possession does not prove obliteration with the strength required by the reasonable doubt <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even if the particular circumstances of this case\u2014the recent theft of the gun and its use during an attempted robbery\u2014might arguably lend the necessary strength to the inference, <em>Ulster County </em>tells us that we may not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The only other issue on appeal is conceded by the People: section 654 clearly prohibits multiple punishment on the attempted robbery and burglary counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The judgment is reversed as to count 4, the violation of section 12090. It is reversed as to count 1, but only insofar as it imposes a sentence for attempted robbery. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Stephens, J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 8, 1980. Mosk, J., Clark, J., and Newman, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\"> All five crimes were charged in a single information. The first jury convicted defendant on the receiving and obliterating counts, but was unable to agree on the robbery, assault and burglary charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-13\"> Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\"> Even if the words \u201cshall be presumptive evidence\u201d are ambiguous on whether they mandate a finding of the presumed fact, we cannot speculate that the jury gave them the benign meaning contended for by the People. (Cf., <em>People </em>v. <em>Deloney </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 832, 839 [264 P.2d 532]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmen </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 768, 778 [228 P.2d 281].) The trial court\u2019s instructions did not define the words \u201cpresumption\u201d or \u201cpresumptive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b42-5\"> As far as California usage is concerned, the term \u201cmandatory presumption\u201d is redundant. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 600, subd. (a).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The California Supreme Court said much the same in <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d at pages 779-780: \u201cThe rational connection required between a proved fact and a presumed fact must be distinguished from the relation between a proved fact and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>alleged fact that warrants a jury\u2019s inferring the one from the other <em>(Tot </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at p. 468). An inference must be justified by the circumstances of the particular case. A statutory presumption, however, designed for general application in a given field and based on a pattern of experience in that field, is justified by the likelihood that the unpredictable circumstances of other cases will fall within the same pattern. The presumption may be invoked if the proved fact is \u2018at least a warning signal according to the teachings of experience\u2019 <em>(Morrison </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>[291 U.S. 82] at p. 90 [78 L.Ed. 664, 670, 54 S.Ct. 281]) of the fact presumed, and \u2018the evidence held to be inculpatory has at least a sinister significance.\u2019 <em>(Ibid., </em>p. 90.)\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b43-15\"> Actually, the California Supreme Court in <em>Scott </em>never really explained why the presumption in issue satisfied even the <em>Tot </em>standard. What it did say was that (1) this presumption is not as \u201coff the wall\u201d as the one rejected in <em>Tot, </em>(2) the law has traditionally imposed on the possessor of contraband the burden of explaining how he got it, and (3) since the use of firearms with obliterated marks of identification increases the difficulty of solving crimes, possession of such weapons may be legislatively discouraged and the presumption in question does just that. Reasons (1) and (3) are manifestly inadequate; reason (2) was expressly rejected in <em>Tot, </em>except as an adjunct to an otherwise valid presumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
