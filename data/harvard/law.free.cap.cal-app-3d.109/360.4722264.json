Only due to the overwhelming evidence of guilt do we find that his misconduct does not justify reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Michael John Villa was convicted by a jury of assault with intent to commit rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 220) and false imprisonment by means of force or menace (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 236-237). He was sentenced to the upper term of six years for the first offense and to three years for the latter offense, execution of which was stayed (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Witnesses called by the prosecution described the following pertinent events. At approximately 2:15 a.m. on the morning of March 6, 1979, Ann M., a purser and head flight attendant for Pan Am Airlines returned to her condominium complex in Mountain View after spending an evening with a colleague. She paid no attention to a car that entered the parking lot behind her and, in a hurry to get upstairs, she parked just outside her entrance rather than in the security area beneath the building. A man grabbed her before she reached her apartment, put his hand over her mouth and pulled her to the side of the building. She struggled and screamed. A neighbor heard a woman scream \u201cPlease don\u2019t\u201d and \u201chelp\u201d and he called the police. Each time Ann M. screamed, her assailant, whom she identified as Villa, hit her in the face with his fist. Villa fondled her breasts, opened her brassiere, forced her to the ground, and lay on top of her before Ann M. was able to struggle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>free. Villa asked for money, Ann M. ran, collapsed against a car, screamed, and was forced to the ground again. Finally the police arrived. From 75 yards Officer Stewart observed Villa pressing Ann M. against a vehicle. He heard her say: \u201cPlease leave me alone. Don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d The next thing Stewart observed was Ann M. on the ground being pulled to her feet by Villa. Stewart described Ann M. as disheveled, with dirt on her clothes, and her blouse open. A second officer described Ann M. as \u201chysterical and frightened.\u201d Stewart asked Villa what the problem was and Villa answered that he was trying to get Ann M. home. Villa then ran from the officers and was apprehended. The left side of Ann M.\u2019s face was swelling and discoloring rapidly. Photographs of these injuries were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Villa testified on his own behalf as follows. On the night in question he attended a boxing match in San Francisco with 15 acquaintances. The match ended at approximately 1:30 a.m. whereupon he started home to San Jose on Highway 101. As he attempted to pass a rhythmically swerving and slow-moving Volkswagen, the driver, a woman, indicated by waving, slowing down and pulling over that she wished him to pull over. He did. She was sobbing and asked him to follow her home. He did. When they exited their vehicles she put her hand on his shoulder and requested an escort to her door. She then wanted Villa to buy some liquor but he informed her that all stores were closed. She fell down several times. She got angry and loud. She leaned against a car and fell down again.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The police arrived just as Villa helped her up. Villa denied undoing the woman\u2019s bra or hitting her hard enough to cause swelling. Asked why Ann M. would lie about what had happened, he answered that it was perhaps because he had slapped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Several instances of prosecutorial misconduct occurred in the presence of the jury. The most serious involved a series of insinuations by the prosecutor to the effect that he had damaging evidence regarding Villa\u2019s prior sexual behavior. With Villa on the stand defense counsel asked him whether he and his wife still enjoyed sexual relations. The prosecutor responded: \u201cYour Honor, if he wishes to go into this area I have very relevant evidence about what happened when he was living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>with his wife.\u201d The court warned against speeches but upheld a relevancy objection. Defense counsel then elicited from Villa the information that he was living with a woman on the day of the incident in question. The prosecutor asserted: \u201cI\u2019m going to object on the grounds of relevancy unless counsel is offering this to establish that because he was living with a woman he wouldn\u2019t go out after another woman, because if that is the purpose he is offering it, I have rebuttal evidence on that.\u201d The court sustained the relevancy objection without admonishing the prosecutor. During closing argument defense counsel implied that he could give a damaging explanation for Ms. Ann M.\u2019s decision to have Villa prosecuted. The prosecutor interrupted: \u201cOh, if counsel wishes to go outside of the record and bring in outside evidence, I certainly have evidence that I would like to bring in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Miscellaneous instances of misconduct are also alleged. On cross-examination Villa denied causing Ann M.\u2019s facial injuries. The prosecution asked: \u201cQ. When you were finished with her, those were the injuries she had, isn\u2019t that a fact? A. When I was finished with her? I don\u2019t understand . Q. When you were finished attempting to rape her.\u201d A bit later defense counsel made a wisecrack. The prosecutor retorted: \u201cSomehow I fail to see the humor of the situation where a woman has been smashed in the face.\u201d Finally, during his closing argument, the prosecutor referred to Villa as an \u201canimal\u201d and compared Ms. Ann M.\u2019s being trapped to the prosecutor\u2019s own experience in Vietnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">At the outset it must be noted that the Attorney General\u2019s brief states that at trial Villa did not \u201cassign as misconduct\u201d the instances related above.  Instances of prosecutorial misconduct may be raised as errors on appeal only if they are objected to in timely fashion at trial or if the harmful effect of the misconduct could not have been obviated by a timely cautionary instruction by the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 34 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].) However, the record clearly shows that Villa\u2019s trial counsel expressly and contemporaneously objected to each and every comment alleged as error, and that he did so on grounds of prejudice or unfairness. The contentions are legitimately before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s insinuations that he had in his possession as yet undisclosed but highly relevant and damaging evidence regarding Villa\u2019s prior sexual conduct clearly constituted misconduct. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolton </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, 212 [152 Cal.Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396], defense counsel had been allowed to impeach the victim of a nonfatal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>shooting incident with the latter\u2019s prior felonies. In his closing argument to the jury the prosecutor hinted that but for certain rules of evidence he could show that the defendant was \u201cjust as bad a guy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 212, fn. 1.) The Supreme Court held: \u201cThere is no doubt that the prosecutor\u2019s statement constituted improper argument, for he was attempting to smuggle in by inference claims that could not be argued openly and legally. In essence, the prosecutor invited the jury to speculate about\u2014and possibly base a verdict upon\u2014\u2018evidence\u2019 never presented at trial. Appellant, in fact, had no prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u201cClosing argument presents a legitimate opportunity to \u2018argue all reasonable inferences from evidence in the record.\u2019 (ABA Standards, The Prosecution Function (1971) std. 5.8(a) (hereafter cited as Prosecution Function).) However, this court has for a number of years repeatedly warned \u2018that statements of facts not in evidence by the prosecuting attorney in his argument to the jury constitute misconduct.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kirkes </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 719, 724 [249 P.2d 1]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 372, 381-384 [17 Cal.Rptr. 233].)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u201cProsecution Function standard 5.9 specifically states: \u2018It is unprofessional conduct for the prosecutor intentionally to refer to or argue on the basis of facts outside the record.... \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u201cIn the present case, the prosecutor implied that there was additional evidence about the appellant\u2019s past known to him but unavailable to the jury. These implications tended to make the prosecutor his own witness \u2014offering unsworn testimony not subject to cross-examination. It has been recognized that such testimony, \u2018although worthless as a matter of law, can be \u201cdynamite\u201d to the jury because of the special regard the jury has for the prosecutor, thereby effectively circumventing the rules of evidence.\u2019 (Vess, <em>Walking a Tightrope: A Survey of Limitations On The Prosecutor\u2019s Closing Argument </em>(1973) 64 J.Crim.L. &amp; Criminology 22, 28; see also Crump, <em>The Function and Limits of Prosecution Jury Argument </em>(1974) 28 Sw.L.J. 505, 517-518.)\u201d (23 Cal.3d at pp. 212-213 (fn. omitted).) In addition <em>Bolton </em>overruled cases suggesting that \u201c\u2018bad faith must be shown to establish the existence of misconduct\u2019 [citations].\u201d For the first time the court adopted the position that \u201c\u2018injury to appellant is nonetheless an injury because it was committed inadvertently rather than intentionally\u2019 [citations].\u201d (23 Cal.3d at pp. 213-214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>As indicated in the cases summarized in the margin the appellate courts have, since <em>Bolton, </em>liberally characterized various prosecutorial excesses as \u201cmisconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those cases finding no misconduct are easily distinguished.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on these cases, there is no doubt that the references to evidence not before the jury were error and it is at least arguable that the prosecutor\u2019s several subjective indictments of Villa throughout the trial were also within the broad category of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Prosecutorial misconduct, however, will not be grounds for reversal unless it is shown to be prejudicial. \u201cReversal of judgment is designed not so much to punish prosecutors as to protect the fair rights of defendants.\u201d <em>(Bolton, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 214.) The <em>Bolton </em>court held that either of the two traditional tests of prejudice could apply to a particular instance of misconduct: \u201cUnder traditional application of this state\u2019s harmless error rule, the test of prejudice is whether it is \u2018reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the defendant would have occurred had the district attorney refrained from the comment attacked by the defendant. [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beivelman </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 60, 75....) However, if federal constitutional error is involved, then the burden shifts to the state \u2018to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u2019 <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24. . . .)\u201d (23 Cal.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>p. 214.) In a footnote the majority stated, without so holding, that it seemed \u201cprobable\u201d that <em>Chapman\u2019s </em>reasonable doubt standard applied to the prosecutor\u2019s improper suggestion that the defendant had a prior criminal record: \u201cThough this court need not decide this issue in the present case, it seems probable that the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to characterize the defendant as a \u2018bad guy\u2019 in violation of the rules of evidence was a violation also of defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. The prosecutor, serving as his own unsworn witness, is beyond the reach of cross-examination. However, recent decisions of the Supreme Court have noted the importance of cross-examination to the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. \u2018If one were to translate the Confrontation Clause into language in more common use today, it would read: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be present and to cross-examine the witnesses against him.\u2019\u201d <em>(Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1970) 400 U.S. 74, 95...; see also <em>California </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 149, 158-159. . .; <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123, 136. .. .) And, although the Supreme Court has allowed certain out-of-court statements, never subjected to cross-examination, to be admitted at trial, it has indicated that the absence of cross-examination at the time the out-of-court statement was made is not crucial \u2018as long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination\u2019 at trial. <em>(California </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158....) [1\u00cd] Therefore, in cases such as the present one, a strong argument exists that a violation of a constitutional right is involved and the <em>Chapman </em>standard of prejudice should be applied.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Bolton, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 214-215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Assuming that the <em>Chapman </em>standard is applicable here to the more egregious errors complained of, it nonetheless appears that the improprieties could not have been harmful. The subject matter of the errors was not, of course, insignificant since a fair inference from the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was that he had evidence of prior sexual offenses by Villa. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Modesto </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 695, 714 [59 Cal.Rptr. 124, 427 P.2d 788]; <em>Galloway, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.3d at pp. 560-565.) Nor was this impact cured or relieved. The court gave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>usual instruction that counsel\u2019s statements are not evidence and defense counsel himself gave the instruction after the prosecutor had interrupted the former\u2019s closing argument. But the real damage was done while Villa was undergoing direct examination. And at that time, rather than admonishing the jury that what the prosecutor was insinuating should be disregarded the court sustained the relevancy objections the prosecutor had coupled to his improper statements. (Cf. <em>Butler, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.3d at p. 880; <em>Galloway, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.3d at p. 565; <em>Carpenter, supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The nonprejudicial effect of the misconduct has only to do with the lopsided weight of the evidence. While it is true that essentially the jury had to choose between Ann M.\u2019s story and appellant\u2019s it is fairly incontestable that appellant\u2019s story bordered on the incredible. The details testified to by Ann M., on the other hand, were corroborated as much as was possible in the absence of eyewitnesses. Her colleague corroborated that she was not upset, crying, or intoxicated when she left the Hilton Inn, a neighbor she had never met, even by the time of trial, corroborated that she had screamed for help in the parking lot, photographs and several witnesses attested to the beaten-up condition of her face, and the police corroborated in a number of ways that a struggle had taken place. In addition Villa had no credible explanation for his abortive attempt at fleeing from the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We are therefore convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that without the errors complained of the jury would still have entered the verdicts it did.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Piper, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.3d at p. 113; <em>Powell, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d at p. 522, fn. 3.) This conclusion notwithstanding we join with the Supreme Court in issuing this caveat: \u201cThis court wishes to emphasize that our refusal to reverse appellant\u2019s conviction should in no way be taken as condonation for the deputy district attorney\u2019s misconduct. A closer case, marred by the same misconduct, might well require reversal. Therefore, this court again \u2018warn[s] prosecutors that they cannot continue with impunity to engage in [improper] conduct thinking that appellate courts will save them by applying the harmless error rule. Convictions have been reversed before, and will continue to be, whenever prejudicial misconduct occurs.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lambert, supra, </em>52 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Cal.App.3d 905, 912 [125 Cal.Rptr. 404]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Linden </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 1, 27. . . .)\u201d <em>(Bolton, </em>supra, 23 Cal.3d at p. 215 (fn. omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">One additional point is raised. The trial court awarded good time/work time credits on a basis of one day of credit for every <em>three </em>served in presentence confinement. Applying the equal protection analysis employed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sage </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 498 [165 Cal.Rptr. 280, 611 P.2d 874], the proper ratio is one to two. We call this to the attention of the Department of Corrections which will handle the adjustment administratively. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sage, supra, 26 </em>Cal.3d 498, 508.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">With the exception of the presentence credit recomputation to be handled by the Department of Corrections, appellant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">White, P.

The court concluded that \u201c[s]ince appellant\u2019s theory of self-defense was insufficient as a matter of law, the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct must be held harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (23 Cal.3d at p. 215.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\"> This conclusion takes into account the cumulative impact of all of the instances of misconduct alleged. The less than temperate utterances by the prosecutor which, standing alone, would be judged by the nonconstitutional test for prejudice, were not of a kind to influence a verdict except perhaps in the closest of cases. Moreover, on each of the occasions in question the trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection and indicated in some fashion that the prosecutor\u2019s technique was somewhat excessive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
