B. Key, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR3\">I. The plea is substantially defective, 1st. In not averring a seisin in some person who was liable for taxes. 2d. In not averring that there was no personal property which might be dis-trained for the taxes, for it was only in default of personal property that the collector was authorized by law to sell the land; and 3d. In not averring that Daniel Course had not notice of the complainants\u2019 claim before he paid the purchase-money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcX\">* Apurchase consists of a number of separate acts, such as the agreement, the deed, the payment, &amp;c. If, before the last act be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>done, he obtains notice, he gains no title in equity. Even if he has paid the money, but not received the deed at the time of notice, he is not a purchaser without notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">The same strictness is required in pleading in equity as at common law. A plea in equity must of itself constitute a complete defence : it can derive no aid from the answer. The answer cannot come into view, until the plea be disposed of. If the plea be good, the answer is unnecessary ; and in considering the validity of the plea, every allegation of the bill, not answered by the plea, is to be taken to be true. Mitford 15, 177 ; <em>Story </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>2 Atk. 630.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-7\">ll. But if these defects of the plea should be considered as cured by the replication, yet it appears upon the whole record, that the facts of the plea are not true, and that the sale of the collector transferred no right in the land to Daniel Course. 1st. The sale and conveyance were fraudulent and void. 2d. The collector had no authority, under the circumstances of the case\u00bf to sell; and if he had authority, he has not executed it legally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-8\">1. The sale was fraudulent. The circumstances indicating fraud are, that the lands were liable in equity to the debts of John Rae. That the taxes were not paid for 1790 and 1791, although there was personal estate enough in the hands of the representatives of Robert Rae, in whose occupation the lands were, to pay them. This appears by Hammond\u2019s return of property, in which he has returned 56 negroes as the property of Robert Rae. That notwithstanding his personal property was in his hands, Hammond, who had married Robert Rae\u2019s widow, the mother of the defendant Elizabeth Course, not only permitted the land to be sold for taxes, but requested it might be sold, and pointed out this very land as the object of sale. The advertisement described the land *by its least notorious appellation. It mentions neither the name of the owner of the land, nor the amount of *- taxes due. Hammond\u2019s son-in-law, the husband of the defendant, became the purchaser. There can be no doubt, that he must have known the situation of the estate : he knew it was liable for the debts of John Rae : he knew that there was personal estate sufficient to pay the taxes : he knew that his father-in-law ought to have paid them ; and he knew that he had directed the collector to sell the land. He knew the price which he gave for the land was far below its value ; for the bill states it was sold in 1799 for $2386, and the defendant, in her answer, says that it was then sold far below its value. He and his father-in-law and their wives were the representatives of Robert Rae, and were the only persons, except creditors, who were interested in the lands. These circumstances go strongly to show that the sah by the collector was only the means used to defeat the creditors of their just debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-9\">2. The collector had no authority to sell these lands for taxes. 1st. Because there was sufficient personal property, of which he had notice by the return of Hammond. 2d. Because he was not authorized in any case to sell more land than was sufficient to pay the taxes. The price which Daniel Course gave at this pretended sale was $552 ; the same lands, in 1799, sold, under the decree of the court, for $2386, which the defendant, in her answer, says, was far below their value, and yet the utmost amount of taxes which could be claimed, even supposing that all the taxes for 1790 and 1791, due from the estate of Robert Rae, for property wherever situated in Georgia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>*409] could be charged upon this one tract of land, would not exceed $150 ; and if, as we contend, this tract is liable for its own taxes only, the amount could not exceed $10 or $12. All special authorities are to be rigidly pursued and strictly \u00a1\u00a1onstrued. Cowp. 26. 3d. Because the collector could not sell, after the first of March in any year, for taxes due in a preceding year. *The 15th of December was the time limited for the debtors to pay their taxes, and from that time until the 1st of March, was allowed to the collector to enforce payment by distress and sale ; and on that day, he was bound to close his accounts, and pay over the moneys collected to the treasurer. Whether he had collected or not, he was bound to pay ; and the law did not give him this summary remedy to indemnify himself for any taxes he might advance. If it did, it must give him a lien for an indefinite time, which cannot be supposed to have been the intention of the legislature. It is a special power, of an extra-judicial nature, to perform a duty in a certain time, and he is bound to pursue his authority strictly. If he paid the taxes which he had not collected, the power to distrain did not continue for his benefit. It is to be presumed, that he did his duty, unless the contrary appears, and that he did pay the taxes which he was bound to collect, and had failed to collect at the time when he was bound to close his accounts. 4th. Because the advertisement did not sufficiently describe the land. It is simply called 450 acres of land lying on Pipemaker\u2019s Creek, without mentioning the Savannah river, on which it was also bounded, and which was a more notorious object. It neither mentions the person from whom the taxes were due, nor their amount, nor the name of the owner of the land. The advertisement has no date, nor is it stated, what notice was given, nor how it was published.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-7\">There is no evidence of the amount of the taxes due, nor of the amount demanded ; nor of the amount of taxes for the non-payment of which the land was sold. It does not appear, that Courvoisie was collector for the years 1790 and 1791.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-8\"><em>Martin, </em>contr\u00e1.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIH\">The purchaser from a collector of taxes has a good title, without deed. Upon the payment of the purchase-money, the title 1 -, vests by operation of law, in the same *manner as it does in the case -* of a sale of lands under a <em>fieri facias.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-9\">There is no fact stated in the bill to show the sale to be fraudulent. No advertisement is required by law, in the proceedings of the collector. There is no replication to the answer, and therefore, all the facts it contains are to be taken to be true, so far as it is responsive to the bill. It was not necessary to state in the plea, that any person was seized of the land, nor who was liable for the taxes. The property was liable for taxes, whoever might be its owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-10\">When sales are made by a public officer, he is presumed to do his duty, and to have complied with all the requisites of the law, until the contrary is proved. Every presumption is in favor of the purchaser. The purchaser is not bound to know, whether the taxes have been paid or not. There is no evidence that there was personal property, at the time the taxes were payable. The certificate of Hammond was a year preceding that time; and the personal property might have been sold; but if there was, the purchaser of the real estate is not to be prejudiced thereby ; it is a matter between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>person liable for taxes and the officer, who sold the land, when he might have sold the personal estate. If an executor have power by will to sell land for payment of debts, in case of a deficiency of personal assets, and he sells, although the personal assets were sufficient, yet the purchaser of the land will be protected. 1 Eq. Cas. Abr. 358, 359 ; 2 P. Wms. 148 ; 2 Chan. Cas. 115.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">The collector had a right to sell this land, to pay all the taxes due from Robert Rae\u2019s estate, wherever situated ; and it is immaterial, at what price Daniel Course purchased the land, if the sale was fairly made. *Ham- ^ mond was not bound to pay the taxes on this land, if he knew that it L was liable to the claim of the complainants. It would have been a waste of the estate of Robert Rae.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">The imperfect description of the land is no evidence of fraud in the collector ; he advertised it by the name stated in the return of Hammond. He was not obliged to describe it as lying on the Savannah. The law did not require him to name the person who had title to, or was in possession of, the land, nor the name of the person liable for the taxes, nor their amount. There is no proof of fraud but what arises from those circumstances, and the relationship between Mrs. Hammond and Mrs. Course ; and these are only circumstances which at most may excite a suspicion. The presumption of law is always against fraud : it must always be proved. And unless it be not only proved, but brought home to the purchaser, the sale cannot be set aside.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-8\"><em>P. B. Key, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACQ\">The plea admits everything in the bill, not denied by the plea, and although there be also an answer, and no replication to that answer, yet the facts stated in the answer cannot be brought in aid of the plea. It must stand on its own foundation. The answer cannot be brought into view, until the question upon the plea be decided. It was not necessary for the bill to state all the facts which may be given in evidence of fraud. It is sufficient, if fraud be positively charged in general terms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-9\">The rule of law is not, that everything is to be presumed in favor of the purchaser ; but that a purchaser who claims title under a special limited authority, a power naked and without interest, must show that the power has been strictly pursued. The doctrine advanced on the other side, that whether the taxes were due or not, the purchaser is protected in his title, is hazardous in the extreme ; it *would subject all our estates to the control of a collector of taxes. L</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-10\">The cases cited do not support the doctrine They only show that, where lands are devised for the payment of debts, generally, the purchaser is not bound to see to the application of the money ; or to inquire whether there be personal estate sufficient to pay the debts ; but if lands are devised to pay certain debts, specified in a schedule, there the purchaser must see to the application of the money. The case cited from 2 P. Wms. 148, was a case of a term for years only, which the executor had a right to sell as personal estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-11\">The sound rule of law is, that no man shall be permitted to sell the estate of another, without an express delegated authority; and he who claims under such an authority, must show that it has been strictly pursued. <em>Caveat emptor, </em>when he buys property from a man who is not the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of it. Property in one county could not be liable for taxes on property in another county.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AtQ\">delivered the opinion of the court, as follows : \u2014 The plaintiffs, who were the creditors of Rae &amp; Somerville, brought this bill to subject a tract of land in the possession of the defendants to the payment of a debt for which they had obtained a decree against Rae <em>&amp; </em>Somerville. The defendants plead that Daniel Course, under whom they claim by descent, is a fair purchaser, for a valuable consideration, of the premises in question, at a sale thereof, by the collector of taxes for the county in which they lie, made for taxes in arrear. The defendant also answered, denying fraud. *A replication was filed to this plea, and, on a hearing, it was sustained, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In this case, the merits of the claim cannot be examined. The only questions before this court are upon the sufficiency of the plea to bar the action, and the sufficiency of the testimony to support the plea as pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">On the first point, the counsel for the plaintiff has adduced authority which would certainly apply strongly, if not conclusively, in his favor, if a special demurrer had been filed to the plea. But as issue has been taken on it, the court thinks it sufficient, since it contains, in substance, matter which, if true, would bar the action. The replication puts the matter of the plea in issue, and it is incumbent on the defendants to support it. They prove a sale by the collector on account of taxes, and adduce a deed conveying the premises to the purchaser. But this testimony alone is not sufficient to support the plea. The validity of the sale is the subject of controversy, and its validity depends on the authority of the collector to sell, and on the fairness of the transaction. It would be going too far, to say, that a collector selling land, with or without authority, could by his conveyance, transfer the title of the rightful proprietor. He must act in conformity with the law from which his power is derived, and the purchaser is bound to inquire whether he has so acted. It is true, that full evidence of every minute circumstance onght not, especially at a distant day, to be required. From the establishment of some facts, it is possible, that others may be presumed, and less than positive testimony may establish facts. In this case, as in all others depending on testimony, a sound discretion, regulated by the law of evidence, will be exercised. But it is incumbent on the vendee, to prove the authority to sell, and the question respecting the fairness of the sale will then stand on the same principles with any other transaction in which fraud is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">*In examining the law under which this sale was made, the court perceives that the collector is authorized to sell land only on the deficiency of personal estate ; and then to sell only so much as is necessary to pay the tax in arrear. In this case, a sale is made of a whole tract of land, without specifying the amount of taxes actually due for which that land was liable and could be sold. This is proceeding in a manner not strictly regular. The sale ought to have been of so much of the land as would satisfy the tax in arrear. Should it be true, that the land was actually liable for the whole sum for which it sold, it would still be mcumbent on the vendee to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that fact; for it cannot be presumed. Every presumption, arising from the testimony in the cause, is against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Had this fact been established, the court is inclined to think, that the circumstances of the case, as stated, though not perhaps amounting to proof of fraud, afford such presumptions as would render a final decree, without further testimony, unsatisfactory, and that an issue ought to have been directed on the question, whether the sale was fraudulent or not. But if a whole tract of land was sold, when a small part of it would have been sufficient for the taxes, which at present appears to be the case, the collector unquestionably exceeded his authority, and the plea cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">It is, therefore, the opinion of the court, that there is error in the decree of the circuit court for the district of Georgia, in sustaining the plea of the defendants, and dismissing the bill of the plaintiffs, and that the said decree ought to be reversed and annulled, and the cause remanded, with directions that the defendants shall answer over, and that further proceedings be had in the said cause, according\u2019 to equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
