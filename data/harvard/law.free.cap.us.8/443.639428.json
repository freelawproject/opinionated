Upon the trial, the attorney for the United States produced and offered evidence, that during the months of August and September, in the same year, two other vessels, owned in whole or in part by the claimant, sailed from Alexandria, with clearances for St. Jago de Cuba, and as well as the Betsey and Charlotte, arrived at Cape Frangois. To this evidence, the claimant objected, but the judge overruled the objection, and heard the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">From the sentence of condemnation by the district judge, the claimant appealed to the circuit court, and new evidence being admitted, the sentence was reversed, and restoration awarded.

He ought to come with clean hands and a pure heart. If this be a case of admiralty jurisdiction, the proceedings must be according to the course of the civil law, where the practice universally has been to try cases without a jury. Wood\u2019s Inst.

But the act of congx-ess ixpon which this libel is founded, does not make it criminal in the person to trade to St. Domingo.

Cases of revenue, or of municipal seizure, are not cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. *The r\u00a1j. 9th section of the judiciary act (1 U. S. Stat. 76), merely gives to L the district court jurisdiction of cases of seizux-e, but does not make them cases of admiralty. And in all cases at common law, the trial by jury is guax-antied by the constitution of the United States. The act xxnder which this prosecution is commenced does not direct the form of trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The district court, as a court of admiralty, is a court of limited jurisdiction ; and in this case, the libel does not state that the seizure was made on waters which are navigable from the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burden. The fact is not alleged which alone could make it a case of admiralty jurisdiction. In England, a seizure for violation of the navigation act is tried by information in the court of exchequer, according to the course of the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-6\">It is contrary to the principles of the common law, to make a man criminate himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-7\">Marshall, Ch.

J. \u2014 No attempt has been made to distinguish this case from those of <em>The </em>Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297, and <em>The Sally </em>(2 Cr. 406). Those cases have settled the law, and unless this case can be distinguished from those, the court does not think an argument necessary, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A54\"><em>* Jones. </em>\u2014 It is objected, that it does not appear upon the face of the libel, that the seizure was made upon waters navigable from the sea, by vessels of ten and more tons burden. But it is stated in the libel, that the vessel was more than ten tons burden, that the seizure was made in the port of Alexandria, and that the vessel had sailed from that port to the West Indies, and back to Alexandria, from whence it necessarily follows, that the waters of the port of Alexandria are navigable from the sea by vessels of ten and more tons burden. Besides, this court is bound to take notice of the ports of entry for foreign vessels, established by law ; and the port of Alexandria is one of those ports.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-12\">In the case of <em>The Vengeance, </em>the court officially took notice that the bay of Sandy Hook contained waters navigable, &amp;c. If the jurisdiction appears by necessary inference from what is stated, it is sufficient.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-13\"><em>C. Lee, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar6u\">By the 3d article of the constitution of the United States, the judicial power of the United States is extended \u201c to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Congress could not make cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; and under that clause of the constitution, they could not give their courts jurisdiction of a case which was not of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, at the time of the adoption of that constitution. The question, then, is, whether, according to the understanding of the people of this country at that time, a seizure of a vessel, within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>body of a county, for breach of a municipal law of trade, was a case of admiralty cognisance. It certainly was never so considered in England, from whence we draw all our ideas of admiralty jurisdiction. All seizures in that country, for violation of the laws of revenue, trade or navigation, are tried by a jury in the court of exchequer, according to the course of the common law. There is nothing in the course of proceedings <em>in rem </em>which requires that they should be in a court of admiralty. A *court of common law is as competent to the trial of such cases, as a court of admiralty. L The high court of admiralty in England exercises no original jurisdiction in revenue cases. It hears only appeals, in such cases, from the vice-admiralty courts in the colonies, to whom the jurisdiction is given by an act of parliament. 2 Browne\u2019s Civil Law 492 ; <em>The Sarah, </em>2 Rob. 189 ; 4 Inst. 135, 139; 2 Browne 75, 78 ; 3 Bl. Com. 106 ; Parker 23, 273.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">Nor were such cases ever supposed by the people of this country to be rightfully classed among causes of admiralty. It was one of our serious grievances, and of which we complained against Great Britain, in our remonstrances to the king, and in our addresses to the people of Great Britain, while we were colonies, that the jurisdiction of the courts of vice-admiralty was extended to cases of revenue. Journals of the old Congress, vol. 1, p. 47. Such being the understanding of the people of this country, at the adoption of the constitution, we are to presume, that the words \u201c cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,\u201d did not include cases of seizure like the present. The 9th section of the judiciary act (1 U. S. Stat. 76) is to be construed with a reference to the meaning of those expressions in the constitution ; and if it cannot, consistently with the force of its terms, be reconciled with the constitution, it must yield to the superior obligations of that instrument. The words of that section of the act, as far as they affect the present question, are, \u201c and shall also have exclusive original cognisance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, <em>including </em>all seizures under laws of impost, navigation or trade of the United States, where the seizures are made on waters which are navigable from the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burden, within their respective districts, as well as upon the high seas : saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common-law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it; and shall also have exclusive original cognisance of all seizures on land, or other waters than as aforesaid, made, and of all suits for penalties and forfeitures incurred, under the laws of the United States.\u201d \u201c And the trial of issues in fact in the *district r*.. \u201e courts, in all causes, except civil causes of admiralty and maritime *- jurisdiction, shall be by jury.\u201d The word \u201c including \u201d means only moreover, or, as well as.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">The district court shall have exclusive original cognisance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, including, within its exclusive original cognisance, all seizures, <em>&amp;c. </em>It does not mean, including within the expression \u201c all civil causes of admiralty,\u201d &amp;e. If such cases of seizure were civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, there was no necessity to enumerate them, because the expression, all civil causes of admiralty, &amp;c., certainly included them. If they were not civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, congress could not make them such, nor by forcing them into that class, deprive the citizen of his right to a trial by jury. Congress had no such intention, for in the very same breath, they say, \u201c sav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ing to suitors, in all oases, the right of a common-law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it.\u201d We have seen, that in all cases of seizure for breaches of the laws of revenue, trade or navigation, the common law is competent to give a remedy ; and consequently, this suitor is entitled to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-4\">The several acts of congress creating forfeitures for breaches of the laws of revenue, <em>\u00bfso., </em>all seem to refer to the exchequer practice, rather than to that of the admiralty. In the act for registering vessels, passed the 51st of December 1792, \u00a7 4, 16 (1 U. S. Stat. 289, 295), if the owner shall take a false oath, \u201cthere shall be a forfeiture of the vessel, &amp;c., or of the value thereof, to be recovered with costs of suit,\u201d of the person taking the false oath. So, in case of the sale of a vessel to a foreigner, it shall be forfeited, in a certain case, \u201c provided, that if it shall be made appear to the jury before whom the trial for- such forfeiture shall be had, that,\u201d <em>&amp;o., </em>and the penalties and forfeitures under that act were to \u201c be sued for, prosecuted and recovered,\u201d in such courts, <em>\u00bfso., </em>*as penalties and forfeitures J under the act for the collection of duties, <em>\u00bfso. </em>Hence, it is evident, that congress intended that all cases of forfeiture should be tried by jury. The expressions in the act respecting registering of vessels, explain what may otherwise appear doubtful in the act concerning the collection of duties, as to the mode of prosecution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">So, in the act suspending intercourse with France (1 U. S. Stat. 565), offending vessels are made liable to be seized, \u201c and may be prosecuted and condemned in any circuit or district court of the United States, which shall be holden within or for the district where the seizure shall be made.\u201d But by the judiciary act, no circuit court could take original cognisance of civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; hence, it is obvious, that congress did not consider such seizures as civil causes of admiralty, <em>\u00bfso. </em>The forfeiture also is to accrue to any person \u201c who will inform and prosecute for the same,\u201d which shows that the proceedings were to be at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-7\">All the forfeitures under the act for the collection of duties, are to be recovered in the same way. Some of them being cases of seizure on land, must be tried by jury, therefore, all must. And in \u00a7 71 (1 U. S. Stat. 678), it is said, \u201c in actions, suits or informations to be brought, where any seizure shall be made pursuant to this act, if the property be claimed by any person, in every such case, the <em>onus probamdi </em>shall be upon such claimant.\u201d These expressions all indicate proceedings at common law only. The 89th section, in p. 695, speaking of the recovery of penalties, clearly refers to suits at common law ; and when speaking of forfeitures, it says, \u201c and all ships, goods, &amp;c., which shall become forfeited in virtue of this act, shall be seized, libelled and prosecuted as aforesaid ;\u201d referring to the mode of prosecution pointed out for the recovery of penalties. Here, if the word \u201c libelled \u201d had not been used, there could be no doubt. But the expres*4511 s*on \u201c libelled \u201d relates as well to *seizures on land, as to seizures on J water ; but seizures on land must be tried by jury, according to the course of the common law. -The word libel, therefore, does not refer exclusively to admiralty proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-9\">The Excise Law (1 U. S. Stat. 199) makes no distinction between seizures made on land, and those made on water.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-10\">By the 5th amendment to the constitution, no person shall be deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>of property, without due process of law; which means, by due process of the common law. By the 7th amendment, in suits at common law, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, <em>i. e., </em>continued as it then was. At'that time, all municipal seizures were triable at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">The act prohibiting the intercourse with St. Domingo differs fi-orn that under which the Vengeance was prosecuted. There, the mode of prosecution was declared to be the same as for penalties and forfeitures under the act for collecting duties ; but here, no mode of prosecution is prescribed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-6\">The act creates two offences. 1. Sailing to St. Domingo, without being destined for that island. 2. Being destined and sailing for a prohibited port, without arriving there. The offence of destination is an offence on land, and to be tried by the course of the common law. Hence also, it may be infex-red, that the other offence is to be tx-ied in the same manner. No difference is made by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-7\">The act requires bonds to be given, which are forfeited, if the offence has been committed. Suits at common law upon these bonds are now pending. If these had been tried first, the facts must have been decided by a *jux-y, and by the 7th amendment of the constitution, \u201cno fact tried r\u00a1j! by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United L States than according to the rules of the common law.\u201d The consequence would have been, that this case, involving the same fact, between the same parties, could not have been otherwise tried than by a jxxry. It could not have been the intention of congi-ess, that in one case the same fact should be decided by the judge, and in the other by a jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-8\">The case of <em>The Sally </em>was decided upon the authority of that of <em>The Vengeance, </em>without ax-gument; and is, therefore, of no authority.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-9\"><em>Rodney, </em>Attorney-General, in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOD\">was stopped by the court as to the law of the case.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-14\"> Whelan <em>v. </em>United States, 7 Cr. 412.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b282-14\"> <em>C. Lee. </em>\u2014 I hope to show that this case is distinguishable from those; and to be permitted to argue at large the point of law, that this is not a case of admiralty jurisdiction. I argued the case of <em>The Vengeance, </em>and I know it was not so fully argued as it might have been; and some of the judges may recollect that it was rather a sudden decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">Chase, J. \u2014 I recollect, that the argument was no great thing, but the court took time and considered the case well. The reason of the legislature for putting seizures of this kind on the admiralty side of the court was, the great danger to the revenue, if such cases should be left to the caprice of juries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b285-10\">Marshall, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHPb\">The court considers the law as completely settled by the case of <em>The Vengeance. </em>A distinction has been attempted to be drawn between this case and that, but the court can see no difference. It is the place of seizure, and not the place of committing the offence, which decides the jux-isdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AD0\">It has been said, the word \u201cincluding\u201d means moreover, or, as well as j but if this was the meaning of the legislature, it was, a very embarrassing mode of expressing the idea. It is clear, that congress meant to discriminate between seizures on waters navigable from the sea, and seizures upon land or upon waters not navigable ; and to class the former among the civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The only doubt which could arise would be upon the clause of the constitution respecting the trial by jury. But the case of <em>The Vengeance </em>settles that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">The sentence of the circuit court was reversed, and that of the district court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
