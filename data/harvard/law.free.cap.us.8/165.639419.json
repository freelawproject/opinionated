The declaration did not set forth the title of the plaintiffs, otherwise than by the following averment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-15\"><em>\u201c </em>Of which tract or parcel of land, the plaintiffs, on the 6th day of April, in the year of our Lord Christ, one thousand eight hundred and four, were well seised and possessed in their own right, and so continued thereof possessed, until the 8th day of April, in the year last aforesaid, when the defendant, without law or right, and contrary to the will of the plaintiffs, there-into entered, and ejected, expelled, drove out and amoved the plaintiffs therefrom, and ever since hath, and still doth keep out the plaintiffs from the premises, taking the whole profits to himself, which is to the damage of the plaintiffs, six hundred dollars, to recover which, and the quiet and peaceable possession of the said premises, and just costs, they bring this suit.\u201d-</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>Bradley </em>(of Vermont), for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4L\">contended, 1st. That <em>by </em>the common law of Vermont, the words \u201cequally to be divided between them\u201d do not make a tenancy in common, because a tenancy in common is not thereby necessarily implied. Joint heirs, in Vermont, hold as coparceners. *2d-- That if the plaintiffs are tenants in common, yet they have a J right, by the common law, to maintain a joint action for an injury to their lands holden in common. (3 Bac. Abr. 216.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-7\">3d. That even if the plaintiffs are to be considered as tenants in common, and could not, by the common law, join in an action to recover possession, yet by the statute of Vermont of 2d of March 1797 (Laws of Vermont, p. 118, \u00a7 88),theymust join in an action for the mesne profits, or rather no other action is given for the mesne profits, than an action for the possession itself, in which the plaintiffs shall recover the possession as well as damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-8\">The words of the act are, \u201cand in every such action\u201d (ejectment), \u201cif judgment be rendered for the plaintiff, he shall recover as well his damage as the seisin and possession of the premises.\u201d As, therefore, the action for the mesne profits cannot be severed from the action of ejectment, and as, upon every principle of law, tenants in common must join in the action for the mesne profits, it follows, that they must join in the possessory action also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-9\">The principle has also been admitted by the legislature of Vermont, by the act of 29th of October 1806, \u00a7 <em>4, </em>which declares, \u201cthat tenants in common of any lands, &amp;c., may join in any action which concerns their common interest in such land.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-10\">There was no argument on the part of the defendant.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b116-11\">February 23d, 1807.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b115-17\"> The Hon.
