The approximately thirty named defendants are aligned, according to company affiliation, into two groups for purposes of representation. The first group (\u201cSprint defendants\u201d) consists of Sprint Corporation (\u201cSprint\u201d), Sprint directors, and Sprint officers. The second group (\u201cWorldCom defendants\u201d) consists of WorldCom, Inc. (\u201cWorldCom\u201d) and Bernard J. Ebbers. This matter is before the court on Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Complaint (Doc. 94); plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Strike Certain Exhibits and Impertinent Language Contained in Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 105), and Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Strike the Hakala Affidavit (Doc. 111).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-11\">Also before the court are motions for Joinder of Linda Koch Lorimer and Warren L. Batts in the Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 102); Joinder of Defendant Ron Sommer in the Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 116); Joinder of Defendant Michel Bon in the Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 120); and Joinder of Defendant Andrew Sukawaty in the Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 127). Plaintiffs have not opposed these defendants\u2019 requests for joinder in Sprint\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. Accordingly, the court grants defendants Linda Koch Lorimer, Warren L. Batts, Ron Sommer, Michel Bon, and Andrew Sukawaty\u2019s request to join Sprint\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (Docs. 102, 116, 120, and 127).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-12\">\u2022 WorldCom\u2019s Bankruptcy</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-13\">As a preliminary matter, the court notes that the WorldCom defendants also have filed a Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 89). However, the court declines to rule on this motion due to WorldCom\u2019s subsequent bankruptcy filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-14\">WorldCom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 21, 2002. As a result, pursuant to \u00a7 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, this proceeding against WorldCom is automatically stayed. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a). Accordingly, under the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>this circuit, this court may not rule upon WorldCom\u2019s pending motion to dismiss, regardless of whether WorldCom would be entitled to judgment in its favor. <em>Ellis v. Consol. Diesel Elec. Corp., </em>894 F.2d 371, 372-73 (10th Cir.1990) (holding district court decision granting summary judgment two weeks after bankruptcy petition was filed invalid and stating \u201c[t]he operation of the stay should not depend upon whether the district court finds <em>for </em>or <em>against </em>the debtor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-3\">With respect to Bernard Ebbers, the court is aware that \u00a7 362(a) extends the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code only to the \u201cdebtor.\u201d The rule followed in the Tenth Circuit is that the stay provision does not extend to the third party defendants or a debtor\u2019s co-defendants. <em>Fortier v. Dona Anna Plaza Partners, </em>747 F.2d 1324, 1330 (10th Cir.1984). However, under \u00a7 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, courts may extend the protection of the automatic stay to a debt- or corporation\u2019s officers, directors, and employees during the pendency of a Chapter 11 case. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a) (\u201cThe court may issue any order, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.\u201d). The rationale in extending the stay to protect corporate officers, directors, and employees is to prevent those individuals from diverting their energies from the reorganization effort to defending themselves in litigation. <em>In re Arrow Huss, Inc., </em>51 B.R. 853, 855 (Bkrtcy.D.Utah 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">In this case, the court lacks sufficient information to make a determination whether this proceeding should be stayed as to defendant Ebbers. The parties have not briefed the issue, nor has any party requested that this court impose such stay. However, considering the likelihood that this issue will arise in the future, whether before the bankruptcy court or this court, the court declines at this point to rule on defendant Ebbers\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"AeX\">A. Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">1. Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-9\">Sprint is a diversified telecommunications corporation which offers long distance, local, and wireless communication services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sprint\u2019s operations are generally divided into two sections: (1) the PCS group, which markets and supplies wireless communication services under the PCS brand name; and (2) the FON group, which is a \u201ccatchall\u201d group consisting of all non-PCS business and assets. At the relevant time period, Sprint was the nation\u2019s third largest provider of long distance telecommunication services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-10\">At the time pertinent to this lawsuit, WorldCom was the second largest provider of international long distance services to United States based customers and the largest provider of domestically-connected international private voice and data lines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1998, WorldCom acquired MCI Communications Corporation, the then second largest provider of long distance telecommunication services in the United States. After WorldCom\u2019s acquisition, approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>mately eighty percent of the domestic long distance market was shared by just three providers: AT <em>&amp; </em>T, WorldCom, and Sprint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d), by 1998\u2014 1999, Sprint and WorldCom were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-4\">\u2022 The largest and second largest of a small group of top-tier providers of Internet \u201cbackbone\u201d network services in the United States and the world;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-5\">\u2022 The second and third largest of three providers who collectively dominated long distance telecommunications within the United States, and between the United States and numerous overseas destinations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-6\">\u2022 The largest and third largest of three providers who collectively dominated international private line services to business customers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-7\">\u2022 Two of three providers who collectively dominated various date network services to large business customers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-8\">\u2022 Two of three providers who collectively dominated custom network telecommunications services to large business customers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1263-9\">(Complaint at \u00b6 38).</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-10\">2. Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-11\">This securities fraud class action has been brought on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased the publicly-traded securities of Sprint between October 4, 1999 and September 19, 2000 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). In its Memorandum and Order (Doc. 45) dated September 28, 2001, the court appointed six institutional investors as lead plaintiffs. <em>In re Sprint Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>164 F.Supp.2d 1240 (D.Kan.2001). As noted earlier, this class action has yet to be certified pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-15\">B. Proposed Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-16\">In the summer of 1999, Sprint\u2019s board of directors began preliminary investigations into a possible merger with another telecommunications entity. (Sprint\u2019s Mem. in Support of Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 1 at 45). The leading candidates were BellSouth Corporation, Deutsche Telekom, and WorldCom. Through the summer, negotiations intensified with WorldCom. Principally involved in the negotiations were Sprint\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), William T. Esrey, and WorldCom\u2019s President and CEO, Bernard J. Ebbers. Eventually, on October 4, 1999, a merger agreement and related documents were executed by Sprint and WorldCom. The following morning, before the opening of the markets, Sprint and WorldCom issued a joint press release formally announcing the merger agreement. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Sprint was to be acquired by WorldCom for approximately $129 billion, with WorldCom being designated the surviving corporation. The combination of the two companies was to be the largest merger in history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-18\">As will be discussed below, the corporations issued a joint proxy statement/prospectus (\u201cJoint Proxy\u201d) on March 9, 2000. Thereafter, Sprint and WorldCom held simultaneous special meetings on April 28, 2000, for the purpose of seeking shareholder approval of the proposed merger. At the meetings, shareholders of both corporations approved the merger. However, on June 27, 2000, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) filed an antitrust lawsuit to block the merger. The European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) followed by announcing its formal opposition to the merger the next day. Thereafter, on July 13, 2000, Sprint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>and WorldCom officially terminated their merger agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">C. Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"Aeb\">1. General Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint principally alleges that the Sprint and WorldCom defendants perpetrated a fraud on the market in an attempt to gain shareholder approval of the merger, despite the fact that the merger was destined from the beginning to fail. More specifically, plaintiffs allege as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">During the 1990s, as part of Sprint\u2019s long-term stock incentive plan, Sprint\u2019s top executives and directors had been granted options to buy millions of shares of Sprint FON/PCS common stock at prices far below the market value. By 1998, however, virtually all of these options remained un-vested, meaning the options were not exercisable. Plaintiffs allege that the Sprint defendants were concerned that, by the time their options naturally vested, the stock value would be greatly reduced due to the enormous capital invested in PCS combined with forecasts of increased competition and slower growth. What was needed, therefore, was a way to accelerate the vesting of the options.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">To accomplish this goal, plaintiffs allege the Sprint defendants undertook to modify the \u201cchange in control\u201d provision contained in their incentive plan. Pursuant to the incentive plan, a \u201cchange in control\u201d of Sprint would immediately accelerate almost all of the outstanding options. According to plaintiffs, in late 1998, the Sprint defendants \u201csecretly\u201d altered the incentive plan so as to define a \u201cchange in control\u201d to occur when \u201cSprint\u2019s Stockholders approve a merger in which Sprint is not the surviving entity.\u201d In essence, under the newly modified incentive plan, shareholder approval alone, irrespective of the merger\u2019s actual viability, would trigger a \u201cchange in control.\u201d Upon a change in control, the stock options would vest and become exercisable. Plaintiffs allege that the value of the individually named defendants\u2019 options, once exercisable, totaled nearly $600 million. Defendant Esrey\u2019s options alone are alleged to have been valued at over $300 million. Furthermore, because the incentive plan covered executives throughout Sprint, plaintiffs allege the total windfall for all stock option participants was in excess of $1.7 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">With respect to WorldCom, plaintiffs allege that the WorldCom defendants had an incentive to attempt a merger with Sprint, regardless of whether the merger would ever in fact occur. Plaintiffs describe Eb-bers as \u201can exceptionally aggressive executive who was willing to \u2018play chicken\u2019 with the Department of Justice and gamble on getting an acquisition of Sprint past regulators.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 42). Ebbers was allegedly willing to challenge regulators, and whether or not the merger survived was inconsequential. If the merger was approved, then WorldCom would acquire Sprint\u2019s wireless PCS group, which was essential for WorldCom\u2019s continued success. If the merger was blocked, then Sprint, WorldCom\u2019s competitor, would suffer the consequences of $1.7 billion in accelerated options.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-10\">As alleged by plaintiffs, the foremost goal of both the Sprint and WorldCom defendants was to secure joint shareholder approval of the merger. This was achieved by misleading the market as to (1) the viability of the merger and (2) the financial performance of the two companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-11\">2. Regulator Reaction and Defendants\u2019 Response</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">Considering the size of the proposed merger and the state of competition within the telecommunications industry, regulators from the Federal Communications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), the DOJ Antitrust Division, and the EC were interested in the proposed merger. Even before the corporations officially announced their intent to pursue the merger, an official with the FCC issued a cautionary statement. On September 23, 1999, FCC Chairman Kennard, when asked whether the FCC would approve a possible merger between Sprint and WorldCom, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-5\">You don\u2019t hear me saying it\u2019s going to be fine ... mergers are very, very fact-specific. American consumers are enjoying the lowest long distance rates in history.... That\u2019s a function of one thing: competition. We cannot allow any merger to happen in this industry that turns back the clock of competition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiX\">(Complaint \u00b6 43) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">The Complaint goes on to detail numerous statements and acts attributed to domestic and foreign regulatory bodies, which indicated the regulators\u2019 building pessimism over the merger. Plaintiffs allege both the Sprint and WorldCom defendants issued false and misleading statements in response to these reports in an effort to reassure the market that the merger would in fact be approved. For the sake of brevity, the court will attempt to summarize plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of misleading statements and omissions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-7\">October 4, 1999 \u2014 In formally announcing the merger, the companies state that they \u201canticipate that the merger will close in the second half of 2000.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 44).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-8\">October 5, 1999 \u2014 -FCC Chairman Ken-nard (\u201cKennard\u201d) responds to the merger\u2019s announcement by stating: \u201cThis merger appears to be a surrender. How can this be good for consumers? The parties will bear a heavy burden to show how consumers will be better off.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 45).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-9\">October 6 and 7, 1999 \u2014 At a joint news conference, in response to Kennard\u2019s statements, Esrey and Ebbers state: \u2018We obviously would not have entered into this transaction if we didn\u2019t feel very confident that we could show this was pro-competitive.... We feel very confident that we will be able to show evidence that this is a pro-competitive merger.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 46) (citing the <em>National Post </em>and <em>Computer Wire, Inc.).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-10\">October 20, 1999 \u2014 In a press release, both companies commented that they \u201canticipate that the merger will close in the second half of 2000.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 48).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-11\">October 28, 1999 \u2014 Ebbers indicates he is \u201cconfident\u201d that the merger will gain regulatory approval. (Complaint \u00b6 49) (citing <em>Dow Jones News </em>Service).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApS\">October 29, 1999 \u2014 In a letter to FCC commissioners, Tom Krattenmaker, research director of the FCC\u2019s policy office, writes that \u201cany further consolidation among the major long distance providers would be intolerable.... \u201d (Complaint \u00b6 50).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-12\">November 5, 1999 \u2014 At a Prudential Technology Conference, Robert T. Le-May, Sprint\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer, \u201cexpressed confidence\u201d that the merger would be approved. (Complaint \u00b6 52) (citing a Prudential Securities report).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-13\">November 9, 1999 \u2014 Kennard reiterates his \u201cmisgivings\u201d about the merger by stating: \u201cNow is the time, more than ever before, to make sure any merger will serve the public interest....\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 53) (citing <em>The Kansas City Star).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-14\">November 9, 1999 \u2014 In a talk with Kansas City, Missouri business leaders, Es-rey\u2019s remarks are reported as follows: \u201cEsrey said the merger would withstand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>the scrutiny of federal antitrust and telecommunications regulators because the consumer long distance market would not be too concentrated as a result of the combination. \u2018We are comfortable that the facts will be overwhelmingly convincing.\u2019 \u201d (Complaint \u00b6 54) (citing <em>The Kansas City </em>Star).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcY\">November 13, 1999 \u2014 The <em>Washington Post </em>reports that \u201c[fjederal regulators are unlikely to approve the $129 billion merger proposed by MCI WorldCom Inc. and Sprint Corp., ... viewing the arrangement as a severe blow to competition .... Sources said the fusion, as announced, would violate antitrust standards .... In order to gain the blessing of the Justice Department, which must approve the merger along with the FCC, the companies would have to persuade regulators that special circumstances merit disregarding the rule.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 55).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-4\">November 15, 1999 \u2014 In response to the <em>Washington Post </em>report, Ebbers tells a Warburg Dillon Read conference in New York City \u201cthat a \u2018responsible\u2019 person at the FCC has told him that the <em>Washington Post </em>report wasn\u2019t accurate. Eb-bers also said Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein told him \u2018none of that could be further from the truth....\u2019\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 56) (citing <em>Washington Telecom </em>Newswire). Plaintiffs allege Ebbers\u2019 statement was false because no \u201cresponsible\u201d person nor Assistant Attorney General Klein had told Ebbers what he claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-5\">November 15, 1999 \u2014 In a <em>USA Today </em>article, the companies reported that they \u201cremained optimistic\u201d that they would win regulatory approval. (Complaint \u00b6 57).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-6\">November 17, 1999 \u2014 The companies again report that they are \u201cconfident that they would be able to convince regulators that the deal serves the public interest.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 58) (citing <em>Washington </em>Post).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-8\">November 18,1999 \u2014 As reported by <em>The Kansas City Star, </em>the DOJ \u201chas already asked for more information from the companies, indicating that it will be conducting a full-blown antitrust review.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 59).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-9\">December 1999 \u2014 The DOJ hires an experienced antitrust law firm to review the merger for its anti-competitive nature. According to plaintiffs, the last time the DOJ took such a step was when it retained David Boies to work on the Microsoft antitrust litigation. (Complaint \u00b6 60).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-10\">December 15, 1999 \u2014 The FCC asks Sprint and WorldCom to amend their applications by providing a description of the Internet services provided by the companies, an assessment, of the public interest impact of the merger, and any additional information regarding the Internet market that they believed would assist the FCC in its public interest analysis. (Complaint \u00b6 62).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-11\">December 16, 1999 \u2014 In response to the FCC\u2019s request for additional information, Prudential Securities states in a report:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-12\">[T]he FCC\u2019s letter, along with the Justice Department\u2019s decision to retain antitrust expert Stephen Axinn, reinforces our views about what investors should expect in the merger review process \u2014 a tough, skeptical, and prolonged set of negotiations, likely taking a year, involving a rigorous review of such issues as the Internet backbone assets, the definition of the market served by the companies ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1266-13\">(Complaint \u00b6 63).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-14\">January 12, 2000 \u2014 During a luncheon speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Ebbers\u2019 remarks are reported as follows: \u201c[Ebbers] is confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>dent he will gain approval with \u2018minor modifications\u2019 and that he expected the merger to be completed sometime after June, but before the end of the year.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 64) (citing <em>The Wall Street </em>Journal).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-5\">February 1, 2000 \u2014 Sprint and World-Com management hold a conference call, where they are reported to state they \u201cexpect the merger to obtain approvals from the DOJ and European authorities by mid 2000.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 66) (citing Prudential Securities report).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-6\">February 11, 2000 \u2014 In a <em>Communications Daily </em>article, Ebbers indicates the companies\u2019 meetings with DOJ officials regarding the merger had \u201cgone very well.\u201d Plaintiffs claim this is false. According to plaintiffs, during the meetings, DOJ officials indicated it was very unlikely they would let the merger go through without significant divestitures. (Complaint \u00b6 67).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-7\">February 21, 2000 \u2014 The EC\u2019s antitrust authorities inform both companies that it will take four months to review the impact of the merger on global voice and Internet services. EC Commissioner Monti states: \u201cThe commission has raised serious doubts as to the compatibility of the proposed merger between MCI WorldCom and Sprint, mainly ... [due to] Internet connectivity.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 68).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-8\">February 28, 2000 \u2014 In a joint press release, the companies indicate \u201cthey expect to close the deal in the second half, after receiving regulatory and shareholder approvals.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 69).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7c\">March 9, 2000 \u2014 Sprint and WorldCom issue their joint proxy. According to plaintiffs, the proxy does not disclose the \u201csecret\u201d modification to the \u201cchange in control\u201d provision. While the proxy does include disclosures regarding the risks associated with regulatory approval, plaintiffs allege the disclosures are false because they are couched in the abstract, when in fact, defendants already knew there was a substantial probability that the various regulators would block the merger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-10\">The proxy disclosures read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8X\">The merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from various governmental entities, which may jeopardize or delay completion of the merger or reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger. Completion of the merger is conditioned upon filings with, and the receipt of required consents, orders, approvals or clearances from various governmental agencies, both foreign and domestic, including the FTC, the Antitrust Division, European antitrust authorities, the Federal Communications Commission and state public utility or service commissions.

Financial Disclosures</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-15\">Plaintiffs also allege Sprint and World-Com issued false and misleading information regarding their respective financial performances. According to plaintiffs, these false disclosures were necessary to induce shareholder approval and \u201cconceal the deterioration of Sprint\u2019s core long distance business.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 82).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-16\">a. Sprint</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-17\">On April 18, 2000, Sprint issued a press release detailing its results for the first quarter of 2000 (hereinafter referred to as \u201c1Q00\u201d), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-18\">Sprint today announced record first quarter results. Sprint\u2019s consolidated net operating revenues for the quarter were $5.48 billion, an 18 percent increase from $4.65 billion in the first quarter of 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-19\">The Sprint FON Group\u2019s core businesses reported a strong increase in earnings driven by double-digit growth in operating income in each core business unit. The PCS Group had another quarter of outstanding subscriber growth, with net customer additions of 831,000-the equivalent of adding a new customer every 10 seconds in the quarter. Sprint PCS ended the quarter with more than 6.5 million customers nationwide. The PCS. Group also reached a major milestone in the quarter by exceeding the $1 billion quarterly revenue mark for the first time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1270-20\">(Complaint \u00b6 82).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-21\">Also on April 18, Sprint management held a conference call with analysts to discuss its 1Q00 results. The Complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>details numerous reports generated by the analysts after Sprint\u2019s release of its 1Q00 results. (Complaint \u00b6 83). The favorable reports all focus on Sprint\u2019s increased operating performance and decreased \u201cchurn rate.\u201d The churn rate is the percentage of customers lost or cut off during a period of time. For example, a report plaintiffs credit to Bear Stearns states: \u201cWe upgrade our rating on Sprint PCS to Attractive, as management delivers fundamental improvement on churn.... Lower churn helped Sprint add 90,000 more customers. The churn rate fell to 3.0% per month, down from the mid 3% range in 4Q99.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 83).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Plaintiffs allege these \u201crecord results\u201d were false due to Sprint\u2019s failure to make proper and timely provisions for doubtful accounts receivable. Sprint\u2019s reported earnings \u201cwere overstated (and PCS\u2019s loss was understated) due to Sprint\u2019s improper manipulation of its reserves (or allowances) for doubtful accounts receivable.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 107). Such manipulation, according to plaintiffs, was a violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">In brief, plaintiffs assert Sprint failed to timely accrue losses resulting from uncol-lectible receivables. During 1Q00, the FON Group\u2019s accounts receivables increased, and, at the same time, Sprint was having problems with both FON and PCS non-paying customers. Instead of increasing its reserves for these doubtful accounts, as plaintiffs allege was warranted, Sprint actually decreased the FON allowances. (Complaint \u00b6 114). After 1Q00 results were announced, Sprint eventually was required to record the charges and cut off non-paying customers. By December 31, 2000, Sprint\u2019s allowances for doubtful accounts under both FON and PCS had risen dramatically. In short, plaintiffs allege Sprint delayed cutting off non-paying customers till after 1Q00 results were released, consequently decreasing its churn rate and concealing losses. According to plaintiffs, Sprint\u2019s 1Q00 Earnings Per Share (\u201cEPS\u201d) were overstated by its failure to timely address the doubtful accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-8\">b. WorldCom</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-9\">As with their allegations against Sprint, plaintiffs assert WorldCom falsified its 1Q00 results by failing to timely accrue losses from uncollectible receivables. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 125 30). According to the Complaint, WorldCom had significant doubtful accounts but failed to timely raise its allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-10\">Plaintiffs also assert WorldCom failed to properly depreciate its telecommunication equipment. (Complaint \u00b6 131). According to the Complaint, WorldCom selected an unreasonably long depreciation period for its telecommunication assets, so reducing its depreciation expense and increasing reported income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-11\">4. Objective Activity</p>\n<p id=\"Ak5\">a. Exercised Options</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-12\">According to plaintiffs, the objective activity was obtaining shareholder approval of the merger. Once the Sprint shareholders had approved the merger, the \u201cchange in control\u201d clause was activated, and the majority of unvested options immediately accelerated. According to the Complaint, by the end of July 2000, four of Sprint\u2019s fifteen principal corporate officers had left the company. These four key executives left the company with over $30 million in stock option benefits. (Complaint \u00b6 101). In all, plaintiffs assert that, following the shareholder vote, Sprint executives and employees exercised over 4.3 million options worth over $153 million. (Complaint \u00b6 102). Furthermore, within the first six months of 2000, it is alleged 2,179 employees left Sprint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>b. Market</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">On September 20, 2000, Sprint announced its 3Q00 results, which revealed lower than forecasted revenues, earnings, and PCS subscriber additions. In particular, the lowered results were the product of a higher than forecasted churn rate. Based on this news, Sprint\u2019s PCS shares dropped to $33.25, a forty-nine percent decrease from a Class Period high of $65.50, and Sprint\u2019s FON shares dropped to $26.81, a sixty-one percent decrease from a Class Period high of $68.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">5. Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">In sum, the Complaint alleges that the public shareholders of Sprint lost billions of dollars. The Complaint asserts three claims: (1) that pursuant to \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) and Rule 10b 5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b 5, all defendants disseminated or approved of the allegedly false statements specified above; (2) that pursuant to \u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange Act, defendants Sprint, Esrey, LeMay, Lorimer, Ausley, Batts, Bon, Hoc-kaday, Hook, Rice, Smith, Sommer, and Turley have controller liability; and (3) that pursuant to \u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange Act, defendants WorldCom and Ebbers have controller liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">\u2022 Motions to Strike</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">\u2022 Motion to Strike Certain Exhibits and Impertinent Language Contained in Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">Before addressing the Sprint defendants\u2019 arguments for dismissal, the court first must consider plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Strike Certain Exhibits and Impertinent Language Contained in Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 105). Plaintiffs request the court to strike numerous exhibits the Sprint and WorldCom defendants have attached to their respective motions to dismiss. Due to WorldCom\u2019s pending bankruptcy, as discussed above, the court declines to rule on plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike as it relates to exhibits the WorldCom defendants attached to their motion to dismiss. With respect to the Sprint defendants\u2019 exhibits, the court grants in part plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">Within its review of a motion to dismiss, the court generally must limit itself to the facts stated in the complaint, documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and documents incorporated by reference. However, \u201c[i]t is accepted practice that, \u2018if a plaintiff does not incorporate by reference or attach a document to its complaint, but the document is referred to in the complaint and is central to the plaintiffs claim, a defendant may submit an indisputably authentic copy to the court to be considered on a motion to dismiss.\u2019 \u201d Dean <em>Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Howsam, </em>261 F.3d 956, 961 (10th Cir.2001), ce<em>rt. granted, </em>584 U.S. 1161, 122 S.Ct. 1171, 152 L.Ed.2d 115 (2002) (quoting <em>GFF Corp. v.

However, the court is not obligated to consider such extraneous documents, because the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>sion to do so rests on the court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Prager, </em>180 F.3d at 1189 (holding district court acted reasonably in declining to consider documents attached to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\">Plaintiffs specifically request the court to strike Sprint defendants\u2019 exhibits 9, 11, 23, and 28, as well as Sprint\u2019s March 12, 1987 Proxy and third quarter 1997 SEC Form 10 Q. Each exhibit will be discussed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">Exhibit 9 is a Sprint press release dated April 19, 2000. Sprint contends that the court should consider the press release because it includes a cautionary statement regarding approval of the Sprint/World-Com merger. The Press Release states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">As part of the merger approval process, the Department of Justice may require that Sprint divest its Internet assets. While discussions with the Department of Justice are preliminary and no decision has been reached, identifying and consolidating those assets would simplify divestiture, if it is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">Specifically, the Sprint defendants argue that the statement should be considered to determine whether a \u201csafe harbor\u201d warning was given.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), the court must consider all information and documents relevant to the question of whether a defendant gave a safe harbor warning, regardless of whether the information and documents are cited in the complaint. <em>Karacand v. Edwards, </em>53 F.Supp.2d 1236, 1245 (D.Utah 1999). Specifically, the safe harbor provision provides that \u201cthe court shall consider ... any cautionary statement accompanying [a] forward-looking statement, which [is] not subject to material dispute, cited by the defendant.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(e). With respect to oral forward-looking statements, the safe harbor provision explicitly provides that a written cautionary statement contained in an identified, \u201creadily available document\u201d may be incorporated by reference. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 78u-5(e)(3). The court finds that the April 19, 2000 press release is properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-12\">Exhibit 11 is an October 17, 2000 press release in which Sprint announced the company\u2019s third quarter results. The Sprint defendants argue that the October 17, 2000 press release is relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 accounting fraud claim because that claim rests upon a comparison between the reserves taken for doubtful accounts receivable in the first and third quarters of 2000. In the Complaint, plaintiffs set forth their accounting fraud claim based upon a press release dated September 20, 2000, the last day of the putative class period, in which Sprint announced its projections for the third quarter. However, Sprint\u2019s actual third quarter results, announced in the October 17, 2000 press release, fared better than the previously announced September 20 projections. The Sprint defendants argue that the court should therefore consider the October 17, 2000 press release because it is a more accurate representation of Sprint\u2019s third quarter results. The court looks to the law in this circuit and holds that, because the October 17, 2000 press release is not attached to or referred to in the Complaint, nor is it incorporated by reference, plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike the October 17, 2000 press release is granted. <em>See GFF Corp., </em>130 F.3d at 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-13\">Exhibit 23 is a December 13, 1999 <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article that quotes 'an October 1999 letter from Tom Krattenmaker, a research director at the FCC\u2019s policy of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>fice. The Sprint defendants point out that the Complaint quotes directly from Mr. Krattenmaker\u2019s letter without naming the source. The Sprint defendants argue that, given that plaintiffs have provided no source for Mr. Krattenmaker\u2019s statements, the court should consider the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article to determine the context of those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">The court foremost notes that the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article is not attached to or referred to in the Complaint, nor is it incorporated by reference. Moreover, it is not apparent from the Complaint whether plaintiffs learned of the contents of Mr. Krattenmaker\u2019s letter via the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article or some other source. Thus, the court cannot conclude that the Complaint implicitly references the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article. As such, the court will not consider the December 13, 1999 <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article in ruling on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">Exhibit 28 is a March 15, 2000 <em>Kansas City Star </em>article. The Complaint alleges, \u201cSprint and WorldCom issued identical responses to Cleland\u2019s comments: \u2018We remain convinced that the merger will go through in the second half of 2000,\u2019 according to the March 15, 2000 <em>Kansas City Star.\u201d </em>(Complaint \u00b6 76). Clearly, the court may consider the March 15, 2000 <em>Kansas City Star </em>article because it is referenced in the Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">Plaintiffs also move to strike Sprint\u2019s March 12, 1987 Proxy and third quarter 1997 SEC Form 10-Q. The court need not elaborate on the Sprint defendants\u2019 arguments because the court readily concludes that these documents are not attached to or referred to in the Complaint, nor are they incorporated by reference. Additionally, consideration of such documents clearly would raise factual issues. The court hereby strikes Sprint\u2019s March 12, 1987 Proxy and third quarter 1997 SEC Form 10-Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">Lastly, plaintiffs move to strike several of defendants\u2019 arguments, which plaintiffs contend mischaracterize certain documents. Plaintiffs cite no authority holding that it is appropriate for the court to strike arguments contained in a motion to dismiss simply because a party disagrees with the other party\u2019s interpretation or characterization of the documents. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike is denied with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-8\">\u2022 Motion to Strike the Hakala Affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-9\">Plaintiffs submitted the affidavit of Scott D. Hakala (\u201cHakala Affidavit\u201d) in response to the Sprint defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The Hakala Affidavit states an opinion as to the alleged value of certain stock options that vested upon the shareholder vote to approve the Sprint/World-Com merger. The Sprint defendants move to strike, arguing that the Hakala Affidavit raises facts and expert opinions. The court agrees and therefore will not consider the Hakala Affidavit in ruling on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Rather, the court will merely accept as true all well-pleaded facts in the Complaint, including the alleged value of the options received by the Sprint defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-10\">IV. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"ALN\">A. Motion to Dismiss Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-11\">The court will dismiss a cause of action for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure only when it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the theory of recovery that would entitle him or her to relief, <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); <em>Maher v. Durango Metals, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 1302, 1304 (10th Cir.1998), or when an issue of law is dispositive, <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 326, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>(1989). The court accepts as true all well-pleaded facts, as distinguished from con-clusory allegations, <em>Maher, </em>144 F.3d at 1304, and all reasonable inferences from those facts are viewed in favor of the plaintiff, <em>Witt v. Roadway Express, </em>136 F.3d 1424, 1428 (10th Cir.1998). The issue in resolving a motion such as this is not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether he or she is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims. <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974), <em>overruled on other grounds, Davis v. Scherer, </em>468 U.S. 183, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\">In the context of securities litigation, the Tenth Circuit has warned that dismissal is \u201cdifficult to obtain\u201d due to the fact-sensitive nature of the relevant issues. <em>Grossman v. Novell, Inc., </em>120 F.3d 1112, 1118 (10th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 240, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988)). Dismissal is appropriate, however, \u201cwhere the alleged misstatements or omissions are plainly immaterial,\u201d or where the plaintiff has failed to satisfy established pleading requirements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">B. Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act</p>\n<p id=\"AQO\">Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or any facility of any national securities exchange\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-7\">(b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchase of sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-11\">Read in conjunction with .\u00a7 10(b), Rule 10b-5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-12\">It shall be unlawful for any person ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-13\">(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-14\">in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1275-15\">17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-16\">To state a valid claim under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b 5, therefore, a plaintiff is required to allege: \u201c(1) a misleading statement or omission of a material fact; (2) made in connection with the purchase or sale of securities; (3) with intent to defraud or recklessness; (4) rebanee; and (5) damages.\u201d <em>Grossman, </em>120 F.3d at 1118 (noting that in \u201cfraud on the market\u201d cases, an investor\u2019s reliance on public material misrepresentations is presumed). Traditionally, Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governed the pleading requirements for claims brought under Rule 10b-5. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) (\u201cIn all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-17\">In 1995, however, Congress reinforced Rule 9(b)\u2019s pleading requirements by enacting the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4 <em>et seq. </em>Congress designed the PSLRA to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>deter perceived abuses of private securities litigation. <em>City of Philadelphia v. Fleming, </em>264 F.3d 1245, 1258 (10th Cir.2001). \u201cThe PSLRA thus mandates a more stringent pleading standard for securities fraud actions in general, and for scienter allegations in particular.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">First, with regard to material misstatements and omissions, the PSLRA requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbP\">In any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-5\">(A) made an untrue statement of a material fact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-6\">(B) omitted to state a material fact necessary in oi\u2019der to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-7\">the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alk6\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(l). Second, with regard to scienter, the PSLRA requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-8\">In any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the complaint shall, with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to <em>a strong inference </em>that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1276-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 78u-4(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-10\">Now, to sufficiently allege a Rule 10b 5 claim under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), a plaintiff must plead with particularity not only facts constituting fraud but also facts permitting a strong inference that the defendant or defendants acted with the requisite state of mind, or scienter. \u201cConsequently, defendants moving to dismiss can now challenge the particularity of allegations regarding both the allegedly false or misleading statements, <em>and </em>the alleged state of mind.\u201d <em>In re Ribozyme Pharms., Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>119 F.Supp.2d 1156, 1162 (D.Colo.2000) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">V. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-13\">A. Defendants\u2019 Affirmative Statements and Omissions Regarding the Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-14\">As detailed above, plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 10b 5 claim against the Sprint defendants is based primarily on defendants\u2019 allegedly false statements and omissions regarding the viability of the Sprint/WorldCom merger. As to misleading statements, plaintiffs\u2019 claim relies almost exclusively on the defendants\u2019 multiple statements of \u201coptimism\u201d or \u201cexpectation\u201d regarding regulatory approval. Plaintiffs do not argue, nor does the Complaint allege, that any defendant proffered a guarantee or promise that the merger would be approved. Furthermore, the statements at issue do not concern \u201chard\u201d financial information regarding corporate performance but rather are forward-looking predictions or opinions concerning on going regulatory proceedings. Defendants contend that, even after construing the Complaint\u2019s allegations as true, the statements proffered by plaintiffs fail to state an actionable claim under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-15\">1. Opinions and Beliefs May Support Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-16\">As a starting point, the court acknowledges that merely packaging a false or misleading statement as a belief or opinion does not automatically insulate the speaker from \u00a7 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 liability. In <em>Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, </em>501 U.S. 1083, 1093-94, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 115 L.Ed.2d 929 (1991), the Supreme Court made clear that statements couched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>as opinion or belief may be actionable if the opinion is (1) known by the speaker to be false when made or (2) made without a reasonable basis in fact. <em>See Grossman, </em>120 F.3d at 1120 n. 6 (discussing <em>Virginia </em>Bankshares); <em>see also In re Syntex Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>95 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cOptimistic statements may constitute a basis for a claim under Section 10(b).\u201d); <em>Mayer v. Mylod, </em>988 F.2d 635, 639 (6th Cir.1993) (\u201cMaterial statements which contain the speaker\u2019s opinion are actionable under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act if the speaker does not believe the opinion and opinion is not factually well-grounded.\u201d); <em>In re Time Warner, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>9 F.3d 259, 266 (2d Cir.1993) (acknowledging opinions or belief may be actionable pursuant to <em>Virginia Bankshares </em>).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">In line with <em>Virginia Bankshares, </em>plaintiffs allege that \u201c(1) defendants did not actually believe that the merger would obtain regulatory approval; (2) there was no reasonable basis for defendants\u2019 statements that they \u201cexpected\u201d regulatory approval ...; and (3) defendants were aware of facts both before and during the Class Period tending to seriously undermine the accuracy of their positive reassurances .... \u201d (Pis. Response at 3). While the court agrees that opinions or beliefs may be actionable, the subject matter of such opinion based statements must first be material. As enumerated earlier, the first element of a \u00a7 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 claim is a <em>material </em>misstatement. Whether a statement was false is inconsequential if the subject matter of the statement is immaterial. <em>See Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 238, 108 S.Ct. 978 (\u201c[I]n order to prevail on a Rule 10b-5 claim, a plaintiff must show that the statements were <em>misleading </em>as to a <em>material </em>fact. It is not enough that a statement is false or incomplete, if the misrepresented fact is otherwise insignificant.\u201d) (emphasis in original). In other words, unless the defendants\u2019 professed optimism concerned a material fact, merely alleging that defendants did not believe their words of confidence or that such confidence lacked any reasonable basis is not sufficient to state a \u00a7 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 claim. <em>See Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>82 F.3d 1194, 1217 (1st Cir.1996) (\u201c[N]ot every unfulfilled expression of corporate optimism, even if characterized as misstatement, can give rise to a genuine issue of materiality under the securities laws .... \u201d), <em>superseded by statute as stated in Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 185 (1st Cir.1999). The viability of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, therefore, turns primarily on the issue of materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">2. Materiality Defined</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">The definition of materiality in the context of securities litigation has long been established. \u201cA statement or omission is only material if a reasonable investor would consider it important in determining whether to buy or sell stock.\u201d <em>Grossman, </em>120 F.3d at 1119 (citing <em>TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976); <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 231-32, 108 S.Ct. 978). However, \u201c[wjhether information is material also depends on other information already available to the market; unless the statement \u2018significantly altered the total mix of information\u2019 available, it will not be considered material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>TSC Indus., </em>426 U.S. at 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">In the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court is reminded that materiality is a mixed question of law and fact and ordinarily should be reserved for the trier of fact. <em>Kaplan v. Rose, </em>49 F.3d 1363, 1375 (9th Cir.1994) (stating that \u201cmateriality\u201d is a \u201cfact-specific issue which should ordinarily be left to the trier of fact\u201d). Only if defendants\u2019 statements are obviously immaterial may the court grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>defendants\u2019 request for dismissal. <em>In re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig., </em>7 F.3d 357, 369 n. 13 (3d Cir.1993). In asserting that their statements of optimism fail to satisfy the materiality threshold, defendants offer several distinct but interrelated arguments: (1) that their statements represent immaterial corporate optimism; and (2) that their statements or alleged omissions were immaterial because they failed to alter the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of information available. The court will now address these two related issues.</p>\n<p id=\"AJkk\">3. Corporate Optimism and the \u201cTotal Mix\u201d of Available Information</p>\n<p id=\"AJi\">As described by the Tenth Circuit, \u201c[statements classified as \u2018corporate optimism\u2019 or \u2018mere puffing\u2019 are typically forward-looking statements, or are generalized statements of optimism that are not capable of objective verification.\u201d <em>Grossman, </em>120 F.3d at 1119. Furthermore, these \u201c[v]ague, optimistic statements are not actionable because reasonable investors do not rely on them in making investment decisions.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Raab v. Gen. Physics Corp., </em>4 F.3d 286, 290 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201cAnalysts and arbitrageurs rely on facts in determining the value of a security, not mere expressions of optimism from company spokesmen.\u201d). As the <em>Grossman </em>opinion makes clear, statements of sales puffery do not support a Rule 10b-5 claim because of their inability to influence reasonable investors not because of their inherent optimistic nature. <em>See also id. </em>(\u201c \u2018Soft,\u2019 \u2018puffing\u2019 statements ... generally lack materiality because the market price of a share is not inflated by vague statements predicting growth.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A3n\">Federal courts weighing this issue have found a wide array of statements to be immaterial sales puffing. <em>See, e.g., Grossman, </em>120 F.3d at 1119-20 (company \u201chad experienced \u2018substantial success;\u2019 \u201d \u201cmerger presented a \u2018compelling set of opportunities\u2019 for the company;\u201d and company \u201c \u2018expects that network applications will quickly reshape customer expectations\u2019 \u201d); <em>Shaw, </em>82 F.3d at 1219 (\u201ccompany \u2018going reasonably well;\u201d\u2019 \u201ccompany was \u2018basically on track;\u2019 \u201d and defendant \u201cwas \u2018confident that [company] was pursuing the right strategy\u2019 \u201d); <em>Raab, </em>4 F.3d at 289 (\u201cregulatory changes ... have created a marketplace for the [company] with an expected annual growth rate of 10% to 30% over the next several years\u201d and \u201cthe [company] is poised to carry the growth and success of 1991 well into the future\u201d); <em>In re Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>181 F.Supp.2d 1283, 1291 (D.N.M.2002) (\u201c[the company] is well positioned to thrive ...\u201d and \u201c \u2018[w]e think [the product] will give the company a unique competitive advantage\u2019 \u201d); <em>Kas v. First Union Corp., </em>857 F.Supp. 481, 490 (E.D.Va.1994) (\u201cdefendants had \u2018agreed to use best efforts\u2019 to consummate the merger\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AAR\">On the other hand, several courts have found statements of optimism uttered by company insiders actionable under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>See, e.g., Warshaw v. Xoma Corp., </em>74 F.3d 955, 959-60 (9th Cir.1996) (regarding an on going application to the FDA, defendants stated \u201cwe are encouraged by the progress FDA is making in its review ... [w]hen the trials are combined, we believe the safety and effectiveness of E5 is clearly demonstrated\u201d); <em>Fecht v. Price Co., </em>70 F.3d 1078, 1081 (9th Cir.1995) (company stating it \u201canticipates a continuation of its accelerated expansion schedule\u201d); <em>In re Honeywell Int\u2019l Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>182 F. Supp 2d 414, 425-26 (D.N.J.2002) (denying motion to dismiss in case involving statements described by the defendants as merely \u201cmisguided optimism\u201d); <em>In re 2TheMart.com, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>114 F.Supp.2d 955, 961-62 (C.D.Cal.2000) (defendants\u2019 \u201cstatements represented that the web site was in \u2018development,\u2019 that [defendants] \u2018expected\u2019 to have the web site up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>and running by the end of the second quarter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\">There is no bright-line test for determining when an optimistic statement crosses the line between immaterial puffery and material misstatement. However, the court has discerned several key factors for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">First, there is a distinction between optimistic \u201cspin\u201d of presently verifiable facts and optimistic forecasts of future events. As a general rule, optimistic opinions or beliefs regarding actual past or present facts are more likely material than statements couched as optimistic predictions. <em>See generally Malone v. Microdyne Corp., </em>26 F.3d 471, 479 (4th Cir.1994) (\u201cMisstatements or omissions regarding actual <em>past </em>or <em>present </em>facts are far more likely to be actionable than statements regarding projections of future performance.\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Raab, </em>4 F.3d at 290 (\u201c[W]e recognize that expressions of belief or opinion concerning <em>current </em>facts may be material. We do not believe, however, that this materiality extends so easily to opinions on uncertain future events.\u201d) (emphasis in original) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">The justification for this general rule lies within the definition of materiality itself, namely, whether a \u201creasonable\u201d investor would consider such information important. <em>TSC Indus., </em>426 U.S. at 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126. As the <em>Grossman </em>court noted, material statements, as compared to immaterial puffery, \u201ccould have and should have ... some basis in objective and verifiable fact.\u201d 120 F.3d at 1123. Opinions offered as to uncertain outcomes are, by their very nature, generally unverifiable by reasonable investors. Unverifiable information disseminated to the market bears little materiality because reasonable investors do not rely on such information. <em>See id. </em>at 1122-23 (\u201cThese are the sort of soft, puffing statements, <em>incapable of objective verification, </em>the courts routinely dismiss as vague statements of corporate optimism.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"AkDM\">(emphasis added); <em>In re Sun Healthcare Group, Inc., </em>181 F.Supp.2d at 1291 (finding statements immaterial because, in part, \u201c[i]t would be impossible to objectively verify such soft statements that merely convey the subjective assertions of the speaker\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-9\">Second, the materiality of optimistic statements should be closely scrutinized when the \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b 5 claim at issue is premised on a \u201cfraud on the market\u201d theory of liability. As the First Circuit noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-10\">Review of vaguely optimistic statements for immateriality as a matter of law may be especially robust in cases involving a fraud-on-the-market theory of liability. In such cases, the statements identified by plaintiffs as actionably misleading are alleged to have caused injury, if at all, not through the plaintiffs\u2019 direct reliance upon them, but by dint of the statements\u2019 inflating effect on the market price of the security purchased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1279-11\"><em>Shaw, </em>82 F.3d at 1218. The <em>Shatu </em>court went on to state that a \u201cfraud on the market\u201d claim \u201ccan draw no sustenance from allegations that defendants made overly-optimistic statements if those statements are ones that any reasonable investor (ergo, the market) would easily recognize as nothing more than a kind of self-directed corporate puffery.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">Third, as with any alleged misstatement, an optimistic statement\u2019s materiality must be adjudged in light of the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of information available to the market. <em>TSC Indus., </em>426 U.S. at 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126. In the majority of the cases wherein courts have found optimistic projections actionable, the courts also have found accompanying omissions of material fact. For example, in <em>Warshaw, </em>a case heavily relied upon by plaintiffs, the defendant corporation was seeking FDA approv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>al for one of its pharmaceutical products. 74 F.3d at 957. Before the FDA officially released its decision, the defendants made several statements assuring the market that FDA approval was \u201cimminent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In fact, as negative indications concerning approval entered the market, the defendants responded with optimistic forecasts. <em>Id. </em>at 958. In the end, the FDA denied approval of the drug. <em>Id. </em>Within their federal securities claim, the plaintiffs alleged the defendants \u201cmanipulated the market by intentionally issuing ... false and misleading representations....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 958. In reversing the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, the Ninth Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai8\">The Complaint alleges that [defendants\u2019] optimistic statements about [the drug], when taken in context, were designed to prevent shareholder flight in the aftermath of a damaging report regarding the possible hazards of [the drug] and the unlikelihood of FDA approval. <em>These optimistic statements allegedly contravened the unflattering facts in [the defendants\u2019] possession. </em>On these facts, we believe the Complaint alleged a sufficient basis for a claim under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1280-3\"><em>Id. </em>at 959-60 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">The \u201cunflattering facts\u201d alluded to by the <em>Warshaw </em>court were based on internal clinical studies performed by the defendants, which revealed that the drug \u201cmight not work and would never be approved by the FDA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 959. The plaintiffs in <em>Warshaw </em>alleged the existence of the clinical studies as well as the defendants\u2019 subsequent failure to disclose the studies\u2019 results. <em>Id. </em>at 958. Due to the materiality of the omitted information, the optimistic statements were much more likely themselves to be material. In other words, if investors had been fully aware of file negative clinical studies, the market could better have weighed the value of the corporate insiders\u2019 statements, and the securities would have been appropriately priced. The court interprets the <em>Warshaw </em>opinion as turning on this integral fact of nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">In reaching its conclusion in <em>Warshaw, </em>the Ninth Circuit cited extensively to its earlier opinion in <em>Fecht. </em>In <em>Fecht, </em>also a \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b 5 case, the plaintiffs alleged the defendants \u201cintentionally misrepresented the financial condition of the Company, in particular its expansion program\u2019s prospects for enhancing the Company\u2019s earnings.\u201d 70 F.3d at 1080. The defendants had issued numerous optimistic statements regarding its business expansion, including a report stating that they \u201canticipatefd] a continuation of its accelerated expansion schedule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1081. The <em>Fecht </em>complaint also included a list of material information known, but undisclosed, by the defendants, which strongly indicated the expansion program\u2019s negative performance. <em>Id. </em>at 1081 n. 2. In again reversing the district court\u2019s dismissal, the Ninth Circuit found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-8\">The cautionary statements cited by the district court, when considered against the backdrop of the allegations [of known but undisclosed adverse information]' \u2014 allegations which at this stage we must accept as true \u2014 do not \u2018so obviously\u2019 render the challenged public documents not misleading as to permit adequacy of the disclosure to be determined as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1280-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1081 (internal citation omitted). Once again, the Ninth Circuit concluded the optimistic statements in <em>Fecht </em>were actionable, in part, because of the materiality of the nondisclosed information undermining the truth of the statements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>With these factors established, the court now turns to the statements and omissions at issue in the present case. Initially, the court notes that, without question, defendants\u2019 statements of optimism regarding the regulators\u2019 approval are predictive in nature. Each statement expresses \u201cconfidence\u201d about or an \u201cexpectation\u201d of the outcome regarding an uncertain proceeding. As such, the statements would appear to fall outside the normal spectrum of material statements under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>See In re PLC Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>41 F.Supp.2d 106, 118 (D.Mass.1999) (\u201cMere expressions of hope or expectation regarding future approval, not worded as guarantees,, are not actionable.\u201d); <em>Kas v. First Union Corp., </em>857 F.Supp. 481, 490 (E.D.Va.1994) (\u201cBecause defendants\u2019 statements were no more than \u2018expressions of optimism\u2019 about the future consummation of the merger, they were not actionable under Sec 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.\u201d). However, to grant dismissal at this stage in the proceedings, the court must be convinced that the market could \u201ceasily\u201d determine the statements at issue to be nothing more than immaterial puffery. <em>Shaw, </em>82 F.3d at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">Reviewing the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of available information, the court finds that the Complaint alleges three instances of material omissions. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 85-87). The first allegation of material non-disclosure is the meetings and communications throughout April of 2000 between officials front both companies and DOJ authorities. (Complaint \u00b6 85). According to plaintiffs, at these meetings, both companies were informed that the DOJ was unlikely to approve of the merger.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Complaint \u00b6 85). The Complaint alleges this information was not disclosed. The second instance of nondisclosure alleged by plaintiffs is that both companies were informed on April 19, 2000, nine days before the shareholders\u2019 vote, that the FCC was suspending its investigation into the merger until further documentation was provided by the companies. (Complaint \u00b6 86) (stating FCC suspended its 180-day investigation at day seventy-five). According to the Complaint, the decision to suspend the investigation represented \u201can extremely negative development,\u201d which the defendants failed to disclose. (Complaint \u00b6 86). Thirdly, plaintiffs assert that on April 26, 2000, the EC informed both companies of its \u201cserious concerns\u201d regarding the merger, which the defendants also faded to disclose. (Complaint \u00b6 87). Although aware of this adverse information, the defendants continued their release of optimistic statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">In line with <em>Warshaw </em>and the cases discussed above, the court finds the release of the above information, especially the FCC\u2019s decision to suspend its investigation, would have been seen by a reasonable investor as significantly altering the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of available information. Although the market was aware of the possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>bility of regulatory opposition, the court finds that the FCC\u2019s decision significantly elevated the risk from threatened opposition of the merger to preliminary blockage. In light of such material omissions, the defendants\u2019 optimistic statements reassuring the market bear a stronger degree of materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">In response, the Sprint defendants draw the court\u2019s -attention to authority holding first, that a company is under no duty to update a . forward-looking statement and second, that a company need not update investors on the advance of regulatory proceedings. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u 5(d) (\u201cNothing in this section shall impose upon any person a duty to update a forward-looking statement.\u201d); <em>Epstein v. Wash. Energy Co., </em>83 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cOnce a utility has informed investors that it is involved in a regulatory proceeding, it has no affirmative duty to provide investors with a further summary of the regulatory process.\u201d) (quoting <em>Sailors v. N. States Power Co., </em>4 F.3d 610, 612 (8th Cir.1993)). The court is unpersuaded. By voluntarily choosing to speak about the merger\u2019s viability, the defendants were under a duty to be honest and forthright. <em>Helwig, </em>251 F.3d at 562 (\u201cWith regard to future events, uncertain figures, and other so-called soft information, a company may choose silence or speech elaborated by the factual basis as then known-but it may not choose half-truths.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">Significantly, the only material omissions alleged in the Complaint occurred well after the majority of the statements at issue were uttered by the Sprint defendants. The court therefore grants Sprint defendants\u2019 motion in part. Those optimistic statements occurring prior to April of 2000 are deemed to be immaterial as a matter of law. These statements were predictive in nature, and the court finds, based on the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of information available at the time they were made, an investor could \u201ceasily\u201d have recognized the statements as merely puffing. The Complaint contains no facts supporting plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that, prior to April of 2000, the defendants \u201cknew\u201d regulatory approval was not possible. According to the facts alleged in the Complaint, up to April of 2000, the defendants knew what the market knew, namely that regulators were going to be highly critical of any such merger. Put succinctly, prior to April of 2000, the Complaint fails to allege any secret or otherwise unknown information, which, if released by the defendants, would have significantly altered the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of available information. <em>See Wells v. Monarch Capital Corp., </em>129 F.3d 1253 (1st Cir.1997) (affirming district court\u2019s finding that alleged misstatements of opinion were immaterial because other public filings fully disclosed the true nature of the underlying business concern). Therefore, the court grants the Sprint defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss as to the statements contained in the following paragraphs of the Complaint: \u00b6\u00b6 44, 46-49, 51, 52, 54, 57-58, 65, 66, 69, 71,72, and 76-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">However, after April of 2000, the Sprint defendants were in possession of information, which, if released,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would have altered the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of available information. The court is unable to conclude that the Sprint defendants\u2019 nondisclosure of this information and their optimistic statements predicting regulatory approval were \u201cobviously\u201d immaterial. Accordingly, the Sprint defendants\u2019 optimistic statements and omissions which the court will consider in the remainder of this opinion are con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>tained in the following paragraphs of the Complaint: \u00b6\u00b6 85-87 and 93-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">\u2022 Bespeaks Caution and the PSLRA\u2019s Safe Harbor</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">Sprint defendants further assert their optimistic statements made throughout the class period were immaterial due to the operation of the judicially crafted \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine and the legislatively drafted safe harbor provision of the PSLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">\u2022 Bespeaks Caution</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">In <em>Grossman, </em>the Tenth Circuit specifically recognized the \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine. 120 F.3d at 1121. The <em>Gross-man </em>court identified the doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-9\">Forward-looking representations are also considered immaterial when the defendant has provided the investing public with sufficiently specific risk disclosures or other cautionary statements concerning the subject matter of the statements at issue to nullify any potential misleading effect. This doctrine, which is called the \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine, \u201cprovides a mechanism by which a court can rule as a matter of law (typically in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action or a motion for summary judgment) that defendants\u2019 forward-looking representations contained enough cautionary language or risk disclosure to protect the defendant against claims of securities fraud.\u201d However, not every risk disclosure will be sufficient to immunize statements relating to the disclosure, rather \u201cthe cautionary statements must be substantive and tailored to the specific future projections, estimates or opinions ... which the plaintiffs challenge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1283-12\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Worlds of Wonder Sec. Litig., </em>35 F.3d 1407, 1413 (9th Cir.1994); <em>In re Donald Trump Sec. Litig., </em>7 F.3d at 371). The \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine applies only to forward-looking statements as compared to the \u201cspeakers\u2019 beliefs concerning then-present factual conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-13\">The Sprint defendants direct the court\u2019s attention to the Joint Proxy, which contains certain warnings discussing the risks associated with the completion of the merger. (Complaint \u00b6 73). The Sprint defendants assert these warnings sufficiently disclosed the risks involved. Plaintiffs offer several arguments for why the doctrine fails to immunize the Sprint defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-14\">First, plaintiffs argue the statements at issue in this case, while facially appearing to be forward-looking, are in fact \u201cstatements of what [the Sprint defendants] currently believe based upon information at their disposal at the time the statement is made.\u201d (Pis. Response at 35). The court disagrees. The defendants\u2019 optimistic statements were clearly predictive in nature, because the subject matter of the speculative statements was uncertain. If the court were to accept plaintiffs\u2019 position, then all predictions would necessarily fall outside the scope of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-15\">Plaintiffs next assert the disclosures contained in the Joint Proxy were insufficient to immunize the Sprint defendants\u2019 misleading optimistic statements. As a starting point, the court recognizes that \u201cthe mere presence of some cautionary language does not in and of itself neutralize untrue or misleading statements as a matter of law.\u201d <em>In re Synergen, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>863 F.Supp. 1409, 1415 (D.Colo.1994). As for temporal proximity,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>Tenth Circuit has made clear that the cautionary disclosures need not be contained in the same document or uttered in the same statement to adequately \u201cbespeak caution.\u201d <em>Grossman, </em>120 F.3d at 1122-23. However, \u201c[r]emote cautions are less likely effectively to qualify predictions contained in separate statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1123. In addition, it is appropriate for the court to consider the formality by which the disclosures are dispersed to the market as compared to how the misstatements were disseminated. <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201cthe inclusion of general cautionary language regarding a prediction would not excuse the alleged failure to reveal known material, adverse facts.\u201d <em>Rubinstein v. Collins, </em>20 F.3d 160, 171 (5th Cir.1994). <em>See also Gabriel Capital, L.P. v. NatWest Fin., Inc., </em>122 F.Supp.2d 407, 419 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (\u201cThe \u2018bespeaks caution\u2019 doctrine, however, does not apply where a defendant knew that its statement was false when made.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">In light of these general guidelines, the court finds that, as to the three omissions discussed above, (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 85-87), the court finds the \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine to be inapplicable. As to the remaining optimistic statements, (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 87 and 93-95), the court is unable to determine, as a matter of law, that the risk disclosures contained in the Joint Proxy sufficiently nullified any misleading effect. The Joint Proxy was issued approximately seven weeks before the first optimistic statement at issue. Although the court recognizes the formal nature of the Joint Proxy, the significant time lapse weighs against operation of the doctrine. Additionally, in light of the Sprint defendants\u2019 alleged omission of the FCC\u2019s decision to suspend its investigation, merely warning the market that FCC opposition <em>\u201cmay </em>jeopardize or delay completion of the merger\u201d fails to convince the court that all possible risks were adequately disclosed. Dismissal pursuant to the bespeaks cation doctrine is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">\u2022 PSLRA\u2019s Safe Harbor</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">Under the PSLRA, Congress provided a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for certain forward-looking statements by immunizing the speaker from liability if the following criteria are met: (1) the forward-looking statement is \u201cidentified as a forward-looking statement, and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement; or immaterial;\u201d or (2) the plaintiff fails to prove that the forward-looking statement \u201cif made by a natural person, was made with actual knowledge by that person that the statement was false or misleading\u201d or, if made by a business entity, was \u201cmade by or with the approval of an executive officer of that entity; and made or approved by such officer with actual knowledge by that officer that the statement was false or misleading.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-10\">Similar to the court\u2019s analysis regarding the bespeaks caution doctrine, the court concludes that the Sprint defendants are not entitled to dismissal under the PSLRA\u2019s safe harbor provision. The court cannot say, as a matter of law, that the actionable statements were \u201caccompanied by meaningful cautionary statements\u201d since, as the court already noted, the Joint Proxy was issued approximately seven weeks before the first optimistic statement at issue. Moreover, in light of the omissions the court has deemed material, the court concludes that the Complaint adequately pleads that the Sprint defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>made statements that were, at least, misleading. Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is inappropriate on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">5. Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">As previously discussed, the PSLRA and Rule 9(b) require that all elements of securities fraud be pled with particularity. Specifically, a plaintiff must plead with particularity facts permitting a strong inference that the defendants acted with fraudulent intent, or scienter. The court already has determined that the Complaint sufficiently alleges material omissions and optimistic statements (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 85-87 and 93-95). The court must therefore determine whether plaintiffs have sufficiently pled scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">The PSLRA imposes strict pleading requirements for scienter in securities fraud cases. The PSLRA provides that in securities fraud cases, \u201cthe complaint shall, with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). Thus, the PSLRA requires that plaintiffs plead \"with particularity all facts giving rise to a \u201cstrong inference\u201d that each defendant acted with scienter. A district court, upon motion of the defendant, \u201cshall\u201d dismiss any complaint that does not meet this requirements. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 78u-4(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">The appropriate level of scienter in securities fraud cases is \u201ca mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\u201d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 193 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). Recklessness, which is sufficient to satisfy the scienter requirement, is defined as \u201cconduct that is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.\u201d <em>Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod. Co., </em>77 F.3d 1215, 1232 (10th Cir.1996). Allegations of motive and opportunity are typically not sufficient in themselves to establish a strong inference of scienter. <em>Fleming, </em>264 F.3d at 1262. However, allegations of motive and opportunity are relevant to a finding of scienter and may therefore be considered as part of the mix of information. <em>Id. </em>at 1263. Thus, in addition to motive and opportunity, the court must examine plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in their entirety to determine whether the complaint gives rise to a strong inference of scienter. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">The Sprint defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint fails to allege scienter with respect to each individual defendant. Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint alleges that, because of their positions, each Sprint defendant (directors and officers of Sprint) had access to material, non-public information about the problems with the merger and knew that such information had not been disclosed. (Complaint \u00b6 22). The Complaint further alleges that each individual Sprint defendant assisted in the scheme and was in a position to do so to given their executive positions, control over Sprint, and their stock ownership. (Complaint \u00b6 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-11\">In support, the Sprint defendants primarily rely on <em>Fleming, </em>wherein the Tenth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the defendants, who simply were alleged to have occupied senior positions, had knowledge of allegedly fraudulent statements. <em>Fleming, </em>264 F.3d at 1263-64. The alleged fraud in <em>Fleming </em>involved the defendants\u2019 failure to make explicit disclosures regarding pending litigation, which subsequently resulted in an adverse jury verdict and a damage award of $200 million. The court stated, \u201c[T]he mere fact that the individual Defendants occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>pied senior positions in the company, and that two of them knew of [the lawsuit] by early 1995, is not sufficient to imply knowledge of the specific fact of materiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\"><em>Fleming </em>thus stands for the proposition that mere allegations that defendants held senior management positions, had access to inside information, and therefore must have known of the falsity of certain statements, is insufficient to plead scienter. In other words, such facts, <em>standing alone, </em>are not sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter. If they were, every corporate executive who participates in the day-to-day management of his or her company would be exposed to liability for securities fraud. Other courts are in accord with this proposition. <em>See, e.g., In re Peritus Software Servs., Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>52 F.Supp.2d 211, 228 (D.Mass.1999) (finding allegation that defendants held executive and managerial positions and had access to the alleged adverse non-public information insufficient by itself to raise strong inference that defendants had knowingly or recklessly caused the company to issue statements that were false or omitted material information); <em>In re Health Mgmt, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>970 F.Supp. 192, 204-05 (E.D.N.Y.1997) (allegation that defendant held senior management position and was \u201cprivy to inside information\u201d insufficient, standing alone, to demonstrate strong inference of recklessness or conscious misbehavior).</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">The case at hand differs from <em>Fleming </em>in at least one material respect. In <em>Fleming, </em>the allegation that the defendants occupied senior positions stood alone in raising (albeit insufficiently) an inference of scienter. In fact, the Fleming court considered the possible motives pled by the plaintiffs to determine whether the allegations, taken as a whole, were sufficient under the PSLRA. The court concluded that the only plausible alleged motive, while relevant, was not sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">In this case, plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of motive is compelling. Plaintiffs allege that the Sprint defendants were motivated by $1.7 billion worth of stock options, previously unexercisable, which accelerated and vested upon shareholder approval of the merger. With respect to each individual Sprint defendant, the Complaint sets forth the number of previously unvested and unexercisable shares of common stock options that defendant owned, which then accelerated, vested, and became exercisable upon shareholder approval of the merger. With respect to those individual defendants who exercised their options after the merger, the Complaint states the number of options each defendant exercised and the amount of proceeds obtained as a result. Regarding those individual defendants who did not immediately exercise their options, the Complaint sets forth the total value of their options realized after the vote. In total, the value of the named Sprint defendants\u2019 accelerated stock options totaled nearly $600 million.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">The court finds that plaintiffs have set forth a motive which is highly relevant to plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of scienter. This al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>leged motive is not a generalized motive shared by all companies but is, rather, specifically and uniquely related to each individual Sprint defendant and is particularly probative in light of the alleged prior alteration of the \u201cchange in control\u201d provision. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of motive, coupled with the allegations that each Sprint defendant held positions of control and had access to material, non-public information, are enough to raise a strong inference of scienter with respect to each individual Sprint defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">Upon review of the optimistic statements the court has deemed material, the court notes that only one, Sprint spokesman James Fisher\u2019s April 27, 2000 statement, was made prior to the shareholder vote. (Complaint \u00b6 87). The remaining three statements, Sprint\u2019s April 28, 2000 press release, Sprint general counsel\u2019s May 18, 2000 statement, and Sprint spokesman\u2019s May 19, 2000 statement, were made after the shareholders approved the merger. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 93-95). Logically, after the shareholders approved the merger, the Sprint defendants\u2019 alleged motive disappeared: Upon shareholder approval, the Sprint defendants\u2019 stock options vested, and the alleged scheme was thus complete. Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint fails to allege any motive with respect to the Sprint defendants\u2019 optimistic statements made after this point. Viewing plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in their entirety, and with no alleged motive regarding the three post-shareholder approval statements, plaintiffs have failed to raise a strong inference of scienter. In light of the strict pleading requirements for scienter, the court finds that there simply is no basis found in the Complaint for the court to conclude that the Sprint defendants intended to deceive, manipulate, or defraud with respect to any statements made after April 28, 2000. The court holds that the statements made after shareholder approval are not actionable as a matter of law and, accordingly, grants Sprint defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as to those statements contained in the following paragraphs of the Complaint: \u00b6\u00b6 93-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">Also, the individual Sprint defendants contend that they cannot be held liable for statements which they did not themselves make or which they were not involved in drafting or publishing. The only remaining statement at issue is the April 27, 2000 statement made by a Sprint spokesperson. The court points out that identification of corporate insider defendants, without matching specific misstatements with specific officers or directors, does not itself violate Rule 9(b). <em>Schwartz v. Celestial Seasonings, Inc., </em>124 F.3d 1246, 1254 (10th Cir.1997). Rather, the Tenth Circuit has recognized the group pleading doctrine, which allows plaintiffs to attribute statements generally to corporate officers and directors when the fraud allegations arise from misstatements or omissions in group-published information. <em>Id. </em>The court concludes that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding Sprint\u2019s optimistic statements, in particular the April 27, 2000 statement made by a Sprint spokesperson,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> falls within the group pleading doctrine and, therefore, satisfies Rule 9(b)\u2019s pleading requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">Defendants next point out that the Complaint fails to set forth allegations that the Sprint defendants \u201cknew\u201d the DOJ or EC would in fact decide to block the merger or \u201cmust have known\u201d in advance how the regulatory process would end. Defendants argue this is fatal to plaintiffs\u2019 claims, asserting that plaintiffs must set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>forth specific facts that the Sprint defendants knew, at the time the optimistic statements were made, that the merger would not be consummated. However, the question is not whether the Sprint defendants knew that the merger ultimately would be blocked; rather, the question is whether the Sprint defendants knew that the nondisclosure of certain information, coupled with the April 27, 2000 optimistic statement that the merger would go through, would mislead its shareholders. <em>Id. </em>at 1264 (stating that the important issue is not whether the defendants knew the underlying facts, but whether defendants knew that not disclosing certain information posed substantial likelihood of misleading a reasonable investor).</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">The court finds that plaintiffs adequately have pled at least recklessness on the part of the Sprint defendants. Plaintiffs have alleged that the Sprint defendants knew in April 2000 that the DOJ was unlikely to approve of the merger, that the FCC was suspending its investigation into the merger, and that the EC had \u201cserious concerns\u201d regarding the merger. Yet, according to plaintiffs, the Sprint defendants chose not to disclose this information and, moreover, issued an optimistic statement regarding regulatory approval so that Sprint shareholders would vote in favor of the merger. Accepting as true plaintiffs\u2019 well-pleaded facts, the court concludes that the Complaint sufficiently alleges that the Sprint defendants departed from the standards of ordinary care and that they knew, or it was so obvious that they must have been aware, that such omissions and statements presented a danger of misleading buyers or sellers. In other words, the information received from the DOJ, FCC, and the EC was significant such that the Sprint defendants were reckless in not disclosing this information and in issuing a favorable statement about regulatory approval. Plaintiffs have alleged facts creating a strong inference of reckless conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">B. Financial Statements</p>\n<p id=\"AkY\">The court turns to plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the Sprint defendants failed to make proper and timely provisions for doubtful accounts receivable, thereby inflating Sprint\u2019s 1Q00 profits. Plaintiffs allege that during 1Q00, Sprint was having problems with non-paying customers due to \u201cSprint\u2019s inability to properly bill and service many customers.\u201d (Complaint \u00b6 112). In support, plaintiffs assert two factual allegations: 1) Sprint\u2019s main service call center had 1,400 complaints lodged against it with the Better Business Bureau from 1997 to 2000 and 2) one customer, Cheetah Communications LLC (Cheetah), had disputed Sprint\u2019s billing since 1998 involving millions of dollars and that Cheetah ultimately sued Sprint in October 2000 to prevent Sprint from cutting off its service. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 112 and 113). Plaintiffs allege that Sprint should have increased its reserves for doubtful accounts in 1Q00 and that Sprint\u2019s failure to do so was fraudulent. Significant to this court is the March 29, 2002 opinion rendered in <em>In re MCI WorldCom, Inc. Sec. Litig., 191 </em>F.Supp.2d 778 (S.D.Miss.2002). In <em>In re WorldCom, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that WorldCom\u2019s financial statements were false and misleading because WorldCom failed to timely write-off certain uncollectible accounts. <em>Id. </em>at 789. The <em>In re WorldCom </em>plaintiffs\u2019 only support for their assertion that the write-offs were untimely was that the timing and the size of the write-off in 3Q00 were indicative of fraud. The <em>In re Worldcom </em>court, in rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 accounting fraud claims, expressly held that \u201c[m]ere allegations that statements in one report should have been made in earlier reports do not make out a claim of securities fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790 (citing <em>Stevelman v. Alias Research, Inc., </em>174 F.3d 79, 84 (2d Cir.1999); <em>DiLeo v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir.1990) (finding, \u201cIf all that is involved is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>a dispute about the timing of a writeoff, based on the estimates of the probability that a particular debtor will pay, we do not have fraud; we may not even have negligence\u201d); <em>Kriendler v. Chem. Waste Mgmt, Inc., </em>877 F.Supp. 1140, 1154 (N.D.Ill.1995) (finding that \u201c[tjiming, alone, cannot support an inference of fraud\u201d)). The court further stated that, \u201cto establish scienter based on improper accounting, Plaintiffs must plead with particularity facts demonstrating that \u2018the accounting judgments that were made were such that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decision if confronted with the same facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Miller Indus., Inc., </em>120 F.Supp.2d 1371, 1382 (N.D.Ga.2000). The <em>In re WorldCom </em>court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to plead facts showing that the decision to write off uncollectible accounts in 3Q00, rather than on an earlier date, was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">In line with the reasoning set forth in <em>In re WorldCom, </em>the court notes that, the mere fact that Sprint increased its reserves for doubtful accounts in 3Q00 does not, by itself, call into question the accuracy of the 1Q00 statement. Such an allega-' tion, standing alone, is nothing more than pleading fraud by hindsight. <em>Caprin v. Simon Transp. Servs., </em>112 F.Supp.2d 1251, 1257 (D.Utah 2000) (plaintiffs allegation, that an increase in operating supplies and expenses in a future period meant that defendants fraudulently misstated prior periods, was nothing more than fraud by hindsight). In this case, the Complaint contains no specific factual allegation that Sprint improperly accounted for its doubtful accounts reserve in 1Q00. The mere comparison between 3Q00 and 1Q00 is not enough. Accordingly, in these circumstances, plaintiffs must plead with particularity facts demonstrating that a reasonable accountant would have chosen to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in 1Q00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 only factual assertions fall short of sufficiently pleading that Sprint should have increased its doubtful accounts receivable in 1Q00. Plaintiffs\u2019 first fact, that Sprint\u2019s 'main service call center had 1,400 complaints lodged against it with the Better Business Bureau from 1997 to 2000, does not support plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Sprint\u2019s financial statement in the first quarter of 2000 was false and misleading. While 1,400 complaints over a three- to four-year period may be material in some circumstances, there simply is no allegation that Sprint should have considered the complaints in accounting for its doubtful receivables <em>in 1Q00. </em>Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 second factual allegation, that Cheetah had disputed Sprint\u2019s billing since 1998 and ultimately sued Sprint in October 2000, again does not support plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that Sprint should have accounted for this <em>in 1Q00. </em>To the contrary, the fact that Cheetah did not sue Sprint until October 2000 supports the notion that Sprint should not have factored this in its doubtful accounts receivable until after October 2000.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of accounting fraud is not supported by specific facts that permit an inference that receivables of these types were uncollectible and that the Sprint defendants acted with scienter in misrepresenting Sprint\u2019s financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">In sum, the Complaint lacks any factual allegation that the amount set forth in Sprint\u2019s 1Q00 statement for doubtful accounts receivable should have been higher. In other words, plaintiffs have failed to plead facts showing that Sprint\u2019s decision to write off certain accounts in 3Q00, rather than in 1Q00, was unreasonable. Without such allegations, dismissal is appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>ate. <em>See Kane v. Madge Networks N.V., </em>2000 WL 33208116, at *5 (N.D.Cal. May 26, 2000) (\u201c[Accounts receivable reserves are relatively \u2018soft\u2019 information, despite the fact that they are expressed in dollars and cents. Thus, it is not enough to allege that the bad debt reserves were inadequate, because even reasonable predictions turn out to be wrong. Instead, plaintiffs must allege with particularity facts that show that the initial prediction was \u2018a falsehood.\u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>In re GlenFed, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>42 F.3d 1541, 1549 (9th Cir.1994)), <em>aff'd </em>32 Fed.Appx. 905, 2002 WL 506286 (9th Cir.2002). Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the Sprint defendants violated the Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures (GAAP) is not enough to save plaintiffs\u2019 accounting fraud claim. <em>Fleming, </em>264 F.3d at 1261 (holding that, only where allegations of GAAP violations are coupled with evidence of the defendant\u2019s fraudulent intent to mislead investors, may such allegations be sufficient to state a claim). Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Sprint defendants failed to make proper and timely provisions for doubtful accounts receivable in IQ00 is hereby dismissed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-3\">\u2022 Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">\u2022 Loss Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">In a securities fraud case, plaintiffs must establish two components of causation: transaction (buf/for) causation and loss (proximate) causation. To show loss causation, plaintiffs must set forth how \u201cthe misrepresentation touches upon the reasons for the investment\u2019s decline in value.\u201d <em>TBG, Inc. v. Bendis, </em>841 F.Supp. 1538, 1563 (D.Kan.1993) (citation omitted). Stated another way, plaintiffs must plead that defendants\u2019 material misrepresentations or omissions actually caused plaintiffs\u2019 injury. As the court in <em>TBG </em>explained, \u201cThe loss causation requirement serves as a limiting device in securities claims. The rationale behind requiring loss causation is that a defendant should only be held liable for the foreseeable consequences of the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-11\">Specifically, to adequately plead loss causation, plaintiffs in this case may allege that the price of Sprint common stock was artificially inflated by the Sprint defendants\u2019 materially misleading omissions and statements when plaintiffs made their respective purchases. <em>Picard Chem., Inc. Profit Sharing Plan v. Perrigo Co., </em>940 F.Supp. 1101, 1126 (W.D.Mich.1996). However, it is not plaintiffs\u2019 burden to prove loss causation in their pleadings. <em>In re Accelr8 Tech. Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>147 F.Supp.2d 1049, 1057 (D.Colo.2001). Rather, \u201cit is sufficient at this stage of the proceedings that Plaintiffs have alleged they have suffered damage and this damage was caused by the misleading statements of the Plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-12\">The Complaint alleges that the Sprint defendants omitted material information and made numerous misrepresentations regarding the likelihood the merger would be consummated and that, as a result, plaintiffs paid artificially inflated prices for Sprint publicly traded securities. Furthermore, the Complaint specifically pleads that, when the truth regarding merger was finally revealed, the price of Sprint\u2019s stock fell 15%, from $60 to $51 per share. (Complaint \u00b6 99). Defendants\u2019 argument, that the stock price dropped because the merger was called off, rather than because of any alleged misrepresentations, is unavailing at this stage in the litigation. Whether the omissions and remaining alleged misstatement actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>could have been the cause-in-fact of the price of Sprint stock raises an issue of fact and, as such, is a question properly reserved for a motion for summary judgment or for the trier of fact. <em>See P\u00e9rtigo, </em>940 F.Supp. at 1126. The court finds that plaintiffs adequately have alleged they have suffered damage and this damage was caused by the misleading statements of the Sprint defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">\u2022 Transaction Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">In addition to loss causation, plaintiffs must plead transaction causation. To plead transaction causation, plaintiffs must allege that they would not have invested in the instrument if the defendants had stated truthfully the material facts at the time of sale. <em>Caremark, Inc. v. Coram Healthcare Corp., </em>113 F.3d 646, 648 (7th Cir.1997). In other words, plaintiffs must plead that the violations in question caused plaintiffs to engage in the transaction. <em>McGonigle v. Combs, </em>968 F.2d 810, 821 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">The Compliant alleges that plaintiffs \u201cwould not have purchased Sprint publicly traded securities at the prices they paid, or at all, if they had been aware that the market prices had been artificially and falsely inflated by defendants\u2019 misleading statements.\u201d With respect to those plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on shares purchased <em>before </em>the DOJ announcement blocking the merger, the court finds that plaintiffs adequately have pled transaction causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">However, plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on shares purchased <em>after </em>the DOJ announcement fail as a matter of law. Plaintiffs can state no claim that they relied on omissions or material misrepresentations about the merger prospects since, at the time the DOJ announced it was blocking the merger, those plaintiffs knew the merger had failed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, claims premised on the purchase of Sprint stock after the DOJ announcement are hereby dismissed for lack of transaction causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-11\">\u2022 Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second count alleges a claim against individual defendants Esrey, Le-May, Lorimer, Ausley, Batts, Bon, Hocka-day, Hook, Rice, Smith, Sommer, Turley, and Sprint. Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act imposes secondary liability on \u201ccontrolling persons.\u201d To state a claim under \u00a7 20(a), a plaintiff must first state a viable primary claim for violation of \u00a7 10(b). Thus, to the extent that the court has dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) claims, those claims also are dismissed as to these defendants. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motions for Joinder of Linda Koch Lorimer and Warren L. Batts in the Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 102); Joinder of Defendant Ron Sommer in the Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 116); Joinder of Defendant Michel Bon in the Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 120): and Joinder of Defendant Andrew Sukawaty in the Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 127) are granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-13\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Strike Certain Exhibits and Impertinent Language Contained in Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 105) is granted in part and denied in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>and Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Strike the Hakala Affidavit (Doc. Ill) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Sprint Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Complaint (Doc. 94) is granted in part and denied in part. The only remaining claims in this lawsuit are those based on the Sprint defendants\u2019 alleged omissions and misstatements contained in \u00b6\u00b6 85, 86, and 87 of the Complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">. In addition to naming the <em>corporate entity </em>as a defendant, plaintiffs filed against thirty individual defendants associated with Sprint. The Complaint names nine present members of the Sprint board of directors and three former directors. Two of the board members also are officers: William T.

This trend of material nondisclosure appears in the remaining cases plaintiffs assert stand for tire proposition that optimistic projections are actionable. <em>See Helwig v.

Sec. Litig., </em>182 F.Supp.2d at 419 (\u201cThere were other undisclosed problems which defendants covered up so that they could perpetrate the illusion that new Honeywell was thriving.\u201d); <em>In re 2TheMart.com, Inc. Sec.

Specifically, plaintiffs allege that the DOJ authorities indicated to both companies that the DOJ was very unlikely to approve the merger under any circumstances, and certainly not without asset divestments that defendants knew would make the transaction uneconomical to the parties. (Complaint \u00b6 85).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">. As to the alleged omissions, the defendants make no argument that the omitted information had adequately reached the market. Even if raised, the court would decline to consider such a position at this stage in the litigation since the court must accept as true all well-pleaded facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1283-10\">. Plaintiffs assert cautionary disclosures may only act to immunize misleading statements uttered after the disclosure. <em>See generally Grossman, </em>120 F.3d at 1123 (noting that cautionary statements limited \"the forward-looking predictions made in <em>subsequent </em>discussions of the same transaction\u201d) (emphasis added). Therefore, plaintiffs argue the doctrine is inapplicable in regards to the defendants' statements offered prior to the March 9, 2000 release of the Joint Proxy. With the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>court already concluding such statements were immaterial as a matter of law, there is no need to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">. The Sprint defendants argue that plaintiffs' allegations of motive fail because, they contend, the defendants did not profit from the alleged scheme. The Sprint defendants point out that not all of the officers and directors exercised their options and, of those who did, it is not alleged that any of the individuals sold any of the stock associated with the option, thereby profiting from the sale. The court, however, views the vesting of the stock options as merely the first step in potentially reaping, in this case, tremendous financial gain. <em>See In re Silicon Graphics, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>183 F.3d 970, 986 (9th Cir.1999) (\"[W]e see no reason to distinguish vested stock options from shares because vested stock options can be converted easily to shares and sold immediately.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">. The Sprint defendants do not assert that this argument applies to the alleged omissions which this court has deemed material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">. The court is not aware, nor do the parties proffer, whether Sprint in fact considered this in accounting for its doubtful receivables after October 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">. Because the court has concluded plaintiffs fail to state a claim for fraud based on Sprint\u2019s reported first quarter earnings, the court need not address the Sprint defendants\u2019 argument that it cannot be liable for the analysts\u2019 reports about the company's projected performance in 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">. Plaintiffs claim that two lead plaintiffs, New England Health Care Employees Pension Fund and Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters National Pension Fund, purchased their shares after the DOJ announcement but before Sprint revealed its true financial condition in its 3Q00. The court already has found that plaintiffs cannot state a claim based on Sprint's 1Q00 financial statements because those statements were not fraudulent. Therefore, these plaintiffs can state no actionable claim based on securities they purchased in reliance on Sprint\u2019s reported 1Q00 earnings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
