LANIER ANDERSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b783-29\">Appellants Bruce Graziano and Sam Ward were convicted of several drug-related offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After reviewing appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>several claims of error, we vacate Grazi-ano\u2019s conviction and sentence for the offense charged in Count XI under 21 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 846 (West 1981) (conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute). We affirm Graziano\u2019s other convictions and sentences, and we affirm Ward\u2019s convictions and sentences. Our analysis of appellants\u2019 principal contentions is detailed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">I. SEVERANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Ward argues that the district court erred in not granting his motion for severance under Fed.R.Crim.P. 14.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court has discretion to grant or deny a Rule 14 motion for severance of defendants, and the district court\u2019s judgment will not be overturned in the absence of an abuse of that discretion. <em>United States v. Butera, </em>677 F.2d 1376, 1385 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 735, 74 L.Ed.2d 958 (1983); <em>United States v. Nickerson, </em>669 F.2d 1016, 1022 (5th Cir.1982) (Unit B); <em>United States v. Berkowitz, </em>662 F.2d 1127, 1132 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To prevail on a severance claim, \u201cappellant must demonstrate that he received an unfair trial and suffered compelling prejudice against which the trial court was unable to afford protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1132. We hold that Ward has not demonstrated such compelling prejudice. <em>See United States v. Butera, supra; United States v. Marszalkowski, </em>669 F.2d 655, 660 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 208, 74 L.Ed.2d 167 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">Ward\u2019s specific argument concerning <em>De-Luna v. United States, </em>308 F.2d 140 (5th Cir.1962), deserves further mention. Ward\u2019s co-defendant, Graziano, did not testify at the trial, and Ward\u2019s attorney sought to comment on Graziano\u2019s silence in closing argument. The district court ruled that the attorney could not comment on Graziano\u2019s failure to take the stand. Ward contends that such comment was necessary to contrast Ward\u2019s willingness to testify with any inferences of guilt that could be associated with Graziano\u2019s unwillingness to testify. Ward cites <em>DeLuna </em>wherein it was stated in dictum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-16\">If an attorney\u2019s duty to his client should require him to draw the jury\u2019s attention to the possible inference of guilt from a co-defendant\u2019s silence, the trial judge\u2019s duty is to order that the defendants be tried separately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-17\"><em>DeLuna v. United States, </em>308 F.2d at 141.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-18\">As <em>DeLuna </em>has been construed, the defendant\u2019s attorney has a clear duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>comment on a co-defendant\u2019s silence only when those comments are necessary to avoid real prejudice to the defendant. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Kopituk, </em>690 F.2d 1289, 1319 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 3542, 77 L.Ed.2d 1391 (1983). Real prejudice occurs only if the defenses offered by the defendant and the co-defendant are antagonistic and mutually exclusive. <em>United States v. Vadino, </em>680 F.2d 1329, 1336 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1771, 76 L.Ed.2d 344 (1983); <em>United States v. Nakaladski, </em>481 F.2d 289, 302 (5th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1064, 94 S.Ct. 570, 38 L.Ed.2d 469 (1973); <em>United States v. Hyde, </em>448 F.2d 815, 832 (5th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1058, 92 S.Ct. 736, 30 L.Ed.2d 745 (1972); <em>Gurleski v. United States, </em>405 F.2d 253, 265 (5th Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 981, 89 S.Ct. 2140, 23 L.Ed.2d 769 (1969). <em>DeLuna </em>provides a good example of antagonistic defenses. Each defendant in <em>DeLuna </em>sought to cast total blame for the criminal offense on his co-defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">In the instant case, the defendants\u2019 defenses were not sufficiently antagonistic to require severance. Since Ward\u2019s attorney did not need to comment on Graziano\u2019s silence to avoid real prejudice to Ward, Ward\u2019s attorney did not have a clear duty to comment on Graziano\u2019s silence. <em>DeLuna </em>is inapplicable, and we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ward\u2019s motion for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">II. JURY INSTRUCTION ON SECTION 848</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 848 defines the offense of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This offense includes the element of obtaining \u201csubstantial income.\u201d A person is engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise only if he \u201cobtains substantial income or resources\u201d from a continuing series of violations. Graziano argues that the district court\u2019s instruction on the \u201csubstantial income\u201d element was erroneous. He contends that the instruction authorized the jury to find the element if the drug operations represented substantial <em>anticipated </em>profits to Graziano, while the statute requires a finding that Graziano actually obtained substantial income or resources. For the purpose of evaluating this contention, we assume, but expressly do not decide, that the statute requires the actual receipt of substantial income or resources, and that a defendant who merely engages in drug operations that represent substantial <em>anticipated </em>profits does not fall within the purview of the statute. After reviewing the record, we have concluded that Gra-ziano did not sufficiently object to the use of the phrase \u201canticipated profits\u201d in the district court\u2019s proposed jury instruction. As a result, we must evaluate the instruction given under the \u201cplain error\u201d standard. We conclude that there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-18\">Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-19\">No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the manner to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-d\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 30. On this appeal, Graziano assigns as error this part of the district court\u2019s jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-20\">I charge you that the statutory requirement of receipt of substantial income or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>resources is satisfied if you find that many thousands of dollars changed hands, some of which was received directly by Defendant Graziano as a result of drug trafficking operations that represented substantial, anticipated profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKyF\">Now, the statutory requirement is also met if you find the drug trafficking operations represented substantial, anticipated profits to Defendant Graziano.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6T\">Record, vol. 9, at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The following exchange occurred out of the jury\u2019s presence at the trial below. Gra-ziano\u2019s attorney said that \u201cthe income must come from the enterprises alleged in the indictment, not some <em>prior </em>conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96 (emphasis added). Graziano\u2019s attorney then requested \u201ca limiting instruction to the jury to the effect that the jury would not be authorized to find the element of substantial income from any transactions other than the transactions as alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96-97. At that point, the government attorney agreed with Gra-ziano\u2019s attorney and the district judge added that \u201cthe continuing enterprise could take into consideration other actions on his part; the question of substantial income could not.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Significantly, the district court acceded to Graziano\u2019s request for a limiting instruction. The court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">I charge you that the burden is on the Government in this respect to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substantial income claimed to have been received by defendant Graziano came from the alleged violations described in the indictment. Mere expenditures by him are not enough unless coupled with proof that the money expended came from the continuing drug violations alleged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 136. This instruction came from defense counsel\u2019s own requests. <em>Compare </em>Record, vol. 2, at 556 (requested instruction) <em>with id., </em>vol. 9, at 136 (actual instruction). <em>See also id. </em>at 129 (charging jury that it must find that Graziano obtained substantial income from the continuing series of violations which included those in the indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">Applying Rule 30\u2019s requirements, we hold that defense counsel\u2019s statements do not state distinctly an objection to the instruction\u2019s use of the term \u201canticipated.\u201d Nowhere did defense counsel specifically ground his objection to the \u201csubstantial income\u201d instruction in the use of the word \u201canticipated.\u201d It is defense counsel\u2019s duty to identify a jury instruction\u2019s erroneous language. <em>United States v. Spiegel, </em>604 F.2d 961, 970 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 935, 100 S.Ct. 2151, 64 L.Ed.2d 787 (1980). If Graziano\u2019s attorney sought to delete reference to the term \u201canticipated,\u201d this was not made clear from any of his statements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, his statements indicate that his concern was not directed at anticipated income. Instead, Graziano\u2019s attorney evidenced concern about the jury considering income obtained from prior conduct not connected with the offenses charged in the indictment. Record, vol. 9, at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">Since Graziano\u2019s attorney did not adequately object to the use of the word \u201canticipated\u201d in the jury instruction,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> our inquiry on appeal concerns the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>whether the instruction constitutes plain error. <em>See United States v. Spiegel, </em>604 F.2d at 970. Graziano\u2019s attorney, to be sure, did object generally to the instruction on substantial income. However, his objection, as we have indicated, centered on the fear that the jury would find Graziano guilty based tin his receipt of substantial income from prior conduct. The plain error standard applies even where the defendant objects on one ground at trial and then argues on appeal that the objection should have been sustained on other grounds. <em>See United States v. Pool, </em>660 F.2d 547, 559 n. 4 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B); <em>United States v. Fox, </em>613 F.2d 99, 101 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Under the plain error standard, the defendant must demonstrate that \u201c \u2018the charge, considered as a whole, is so clearly erroneous as to result in a likelihood of a grave miscarriage of justice,\u2019 \u201d or that the charge \u201c \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Thevis, </em>665 F.2d 616, 645 (5th Cir.1982) (Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1008, 102 S.Ct. 2300, 73 L.Ed.2d 1303, ___ U.S. ___, 102 S.Ct. 3489, 73 L.Ed.2d 1370, &amp; ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 57, 74 L.Ed.2d 61 (1982) (quoting from <em>United States v. Varkonyi, </em>645 F.2d 453, 460 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit A), and <em>United States v. Adams, </em>634 F.2d 830, 836 (5th Cir.1981)). The jury charge, even though it included the term \u201canticipated,\u201d was not plain error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A fair interpretation of the entire charge suggests that the jury was directed to find the substantial income element only if Graziano obtained substantial income from \u201cthe alleged violations described in the indictment.\u201d Record, vol. 9, at 136. Significantly, that phrase came from the requested instructions submitted by Graziano\u2019s attorney. This suggests to us that, had Graziano\u2019s attorney specified that the use of the word \u201canticipated\u201d was objectionable, the district court would have corrected any lingering ambiguity. <em>See United States v. Thevis, </em>665 F.2d at 645. There was no plain error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE ' EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">Graziano contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 848<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> because the evidence did not prove that he obtained substantial income or resources from engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. Evidence is sufficient to sustain a criminal conviction if a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc). To evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence, the evidence is viewed in a light most favorable to the government. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Applying these standards, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find that Graziano obtained substantial resources from a continuing series of federal drug violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">The government\u2019s evidence showed that Graziano occupied a supervisory position in three separate incidents.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> First, the evidence indicated that Graziano directed the attempted importation of approximately 40,000 pounds of marijuana and that this attempted offload was thwarted by the Coast Guard\u2019s capture of the mother ship. Second, the evidence detailed Graziano\u2019s participation in an attempt to import 60,000 to 80,000 pounds of marijuana. This offloading operation never took place. Third, the evidence outlined the arrangements which Graziano had made for transporting marijuana from a stashhouse in South Carolina to New York City. As it turned out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Graziano had engaged undercover agents to drive the delivery truck. Four thousand eight hundred pounds of marijuana were loaded into the truck, but since the undercover agents drove the delivery truck, this operation also ended in failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Graziano argues that the government failed to adduce any evidence that he received substantial income or resources from these operations. While his argument is appealing at first glance, it ultimately suffers from an excessively narrow reading of \u00a7 848\u2019s requirements. Graziano\u2019s claim that he never received income from the three drug violations overlooks the plain language of \u00a7 848. By its very terms, \u00a7 848 illustrates Congress\u2019 intent to punish those persons who receive substantial \u201cresources.\u201d Although the statute does not explicitly define the term \u201cresources\u201d, basic principles of statutory construction suggest that marijuana itself is a resource, for purposes of applying \u00a7 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Under one fundamental principle of statutory construction, \u201cwords will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\u201d unless otherwise defined. <em>Perrin v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 37, 42, 100 S.Ct. 311, 314, 62 L.Ed.2d 199 (1980); <em>United States v. Scrimgeour, </em>636 F.2d 1019, 1022 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 878, 102 S.Ct. 359, 70 L.Ed.2d 188 (1981). The common contemporary meaning of resources is \u201ca natural source of wealth or revenue.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 978 (1979). In the context of a criminal statute dealing with drug violations, marijuana fits this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Of course, an interpretation according to plain meaning should give effect to Congress\u2019 intention. <em>United States v. Apfelbaum, </em>445 U.S. 115, 121, 100 S.Ct. 948, 952, 63 L.Ed.2d 250 (1980). In enacting \u00a7 848 and its companion provisions, Congress made its general purpose quite clear: to strengthen control and law enforcement over importation, manufacture, distribution, and possession of controlled substances. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801(2) (West 1981). Section 848 in particular was \u201cintended to serve as a strong deterrent to those who otherwise might wish to engage in the illicit traffic, while also providing a means for keeping those found guilty of violations out of circulation.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1444, 91st Cong.2d Sess. 10, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4566, 4576. Section 848 effectuated Congress\u2019 intent to punish severely professional criminals engaged in continuing criminal drug violations. <em>See Jeffers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>432 U.S. 137, 148 n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2215 n. 14, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977) (summarizing House floor debates).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This evidence of Congress\u2019s general purpose supports our interpretation of marijuana as a \u00a7 848 resource.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">With our understanding that \u201cresources\u201d can mean marijuana itself, we have no difficulty in finding that Graziano obtained substantial resources. In particular, the third operation provides sufficient evidence that Graziano obtained substantial resources. As we have already indicated, the marijuana itself was a resource. Graziano \u201cobtained\u201d that marijuana; evidence showed Graziano\u2019s constructive possession of it. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>679 F.2d 845, 854 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1198, 75 L.Ed.2d 441 (1983). The 4,800 pounds of marijuana qualifies as a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1035 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B) (defendant received substantial income from 3,800 pounds of marijuana); <em>United States v. Losada, </em>674 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>167, 173 (2d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1125, 102 S.Ct. 2945, 73 L.Ed.2d 1341 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Overall, the evidence revealed Graziano\u2019s key management role in the several attempted drug operations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That evidence, combined with the specific acquisition of the 4,800 pounds of marijuana, is sufficient to justify conviction under \u00a7 848. <em>United States v. Chagra, </em>669 F.2d 241, 257 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit A); <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">IV. SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Graziano asks this court to vacate the conviction and sentence he received for Count XI, the \u00a7 846 offense of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute. This \u00a7 846 offense of conspiracy is a lesser-included offense of the \u00a7 848 offense of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. <em>See Jeffers v. United States, </em>432 U.S. 137, 149-50, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2215-16, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977); <em>United States v. Michel, </em>588 F.2d 986, 1001 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 825, 100 S.Ct. 47, 62 L.Ed.2d 32 (1979). In such circumstances, the proper remedy is to vacate both the conviction and sentence of the \u00a7 846 conspiracy offense. <em>See United States v. Michel, </em>588 F.2d at 1001. We therefore vacate Graziano\u2019s conviction and sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana (Count XI).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">We have examined the other contentions advanced by appellants Ward and Graziano. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">Accordingly, appellant Ward\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Appellant Graziano\u2019s conviction and sentence for Count XI, the \u00a7 846 offense of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute, are VACATED.
