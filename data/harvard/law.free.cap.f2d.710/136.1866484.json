Stevens &amp; Company\u2019s employment practices. The court ordered this information disclosed after an in <em>camera </em>inspection of the records pursuant to <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>571 F.2d 195 (4th Cir.1978). We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">On November 7, 1974 the EEOC filed a charge against J.P. Stevens &amp; Company (Stevens) alleging that it was engaging in a pattern and practice of employment discrimination based upon race, color and sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. CRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">By letter of March 13, 1975, Stevens made a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the EEOC for the following documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-15\">1. Any and all charges filed with the Commission, against this Company, by any member of the Commission or by any other person whomsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-16\">2. Any and all writings in the possession or under the control of the Commission, which in any manner set forth or relate to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-17\">(a) Reasons, grounds or justifications for any charge referred to in \u201c1\u201d above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-18\">(b) Any communications to or from any person with respect to any charge referred to in \u201c1\u201d above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-19\">(c) Any affidavit or statement bearing upon any charge referred to in \u201c1\u201d above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-20\">(d) Any ruling, decision or commentary with respect to the processing of any charge referred to in \u201c1\u201d above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-21\">(e) Any ruling, decision or commentary with respect to the validity or invalidity of any charge referred to in \u201c1\u201d above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-22\">(f) Any information or facts or assertions as to employment practices, or alleged employment practices, of this Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-23\">(g) Any recommendations or solicitations by any person that charges or legal proceedings be brought against this Company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-24\">The Acting General Counsel of the EEOC responded to the request by letter of March 31, 1975. Counsel stated that the charges would be made available to the Company and that any information covered by 2(a) and 2(f) of the request would be contained in the charges. In regard to requests 2(d) and 2(e), Counsel stated that no \u201cdeterminations, rulings or decisions\u201d have been made, so there was no such information to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>disclose. General Counsel, however, denied the request for the information in categories 2(b), 2(c) and 2(g) on the ground that the information requested was exempt from disclosure pursuant to the FOIA exemptions (b)(3) and (b)(7). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(3), (b)(7). On June 3, 1975, the EEOC upheld the General Counsel\u2019s refusal to disclose the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">On March 29, 1976, Stevens filed the FOIA complaint that is the subject of this appeal. The complaint sought access to the documents the EEOC had previously refused to disclose. The Commission voluntarily responded to Stevens\u2019 motion under <em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>484 F.2d 820 (D.C.Cir.1973) by submitting an itemized index of categories of the documents it claimed were exempt from disclosure. The categories included affidavits by the charging parties, fellow employees or other witnesses and, <em>inter alia, </em>the following classes of documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">Correspondence between other governmental agencies and the Commission concerning the status of litigation involving the Commissioner\u2019s charge filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXd\">Correspondence between private attorneys and the Commission pertaining to the filing of charges against the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">Correspondence between the Commission and state or city referral agencies concerning the filing of charges or referral of cases for Commission processing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8n\">Correspondence between private organizations and the Commission concerning referral of persons with potential cases for EEOC processing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">Correspondence between labor organizations and the Commission concerning the processing of charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Stevens filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on its FOIA claim on October 29, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">On May 24, 1978, the district court held that the documents were not exempt from disclosure under (b)(3) of the FOIA. Citing <em>Perry, </em>the court further stated that it could make a determination as concerns the (b)(7) exemption only after an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the documents in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">By order of June 9, 1981, the court reaffirmed its holding that the (b)(3) exemption did not apply. As to the (b)(7) exemption, the court held that the affidavits and statements of witnesses were exempt from disclosure. Because the EEOC had not met its burden of showing that disclosure of the other documents would interfere with any enforcement proceedings, the district court ordered the EEOC to \u201cmake available to Stevens all documents previously withheld with the exception of witness statements and affidavits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">The EEOC appeals from the district court\u2019s order on the grounds that both exemptions apply to the requested documents. The first .exemption, (b)(3), exempts from disclosure matters that are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-15\">(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">Title VII requires the EEOC to withhold from \u201cthe public\u201d the charges, anything said or done during informal endeavors to reach conciliation, or any information gathered by the Commission during its investigation until a formal proceeding has been instituted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because it cannot release the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>information in question to \u201cthe public\u201d under Title VII, it argues that it has \u201cno discretion on the issue\u201d and exemption (b)(3) prohibits it from releasing the same information to Stevens, a party to the charge. The weight of authority, however, militates against this construction of the two statutory schemes. The Fourth Circuit in fact has rejected just such an argument in <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority v. Perry, </em>571 F.2d 195 (4th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Essentially, the EEOC\u2019s argument is that \u201cpublic\u201d means the same thing in both statutes; therefore, despite the fact it has the discretion to release some information to the parties, the parties are the \u201cpublic\u201d and have no right to disclosure under the FOIA, regardless of any special status under Title VII. The Commission maintains that if parties did have such a right it would cripple its enforcement proceedings and it would \u201close all control over conciliation negotiations since every party could learn all the weaknesses of the other party\u2019s position.\u201d The agency\u2019s practices and the legislative scheme that charges it with seeking conciliation between the parties, however, belie this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">As <em>Perry </em>has held, the fact that the EEOC claims the discretion to disclose some information to the parties is an argument for requiring disclosure. 571 F.2d at 199. Exemptions to disclosure under the FOIA are to be \u201cnarrowly construed\u201d in favor of disclosure. <em>Department of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352 at 360-361, 96 S.Ct. 1592 at 1598-1599, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976). In <em>Perry, </em>this court distinguished between \u201cpublic\u201d as used in Title VII and the FOIA, holding that because Title VII did not prohibit disclosure to the parties, the (b)(3) exemption does not apply. This is because the narrow construction of the exemption requires the prohibition in Title VII to prohibit disclosure \u201cnot simply to the public generally but also to the specific party demanding disclosure.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>571 F.2d at 200. Therefore, while the FOIA will prevent the EEOC from disclosing this information to the public at large, it will not prohibit disclosure to the parties involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Title VII does not define the word \u201cpublic\u201d. In <em>EEOC v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., </em>449 U.S. 590, 101 S.Ct. 817, 66 L.Ed.2d 762 (1981), the Supreme Court held that the word \u201cpublic\u201d in Title VII \u201ccannot logically include the parties to the agency proceeding.\u201d 449 U.S. at 598, 101 S.Ct. at 822. The Court considered the plain language of the statute, the legislative history and the purpose of Title VII and decided that \u201ccommon sense and the express language\u201d of Title VII dictate this conclusion. 449 U.S. at 598-601, 101 S.Ct. at 822-823.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">First, the plain language of the statute shows that the Commission is to make available to the employer the charge in any case to which it is a party. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both <em>Perry </em>and <em>Associated Dry Goods </em>relied upon this reading of Title VII when holding that the parties are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the \u201cpublic\u201d to whom disclosure is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Second, the legislative history of the statute indicates that the purpose of the disclosure provisions is to limit the unauthorized dissemination of unproven charges to the general public, not to limit disclosures that are necessary to carry out the statutory scheme. <em>Associated Dry </em>Goods, 449 U.S. at 599, 101 S.Ct. at 822. (citing 110 Cong.Rec. 12723 (1964))<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Third, the Court recognized that the EEOC\u2019s statutory duty to resolve the charges through \u201cthe informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion,\u201d is enhanced by this limited disclosure. This is because the party \u201cis far more likely to settle when he has enough information to be able to assess the strengths and weaknesses of his opponent\u2019s case as well as his own.\u201d <em>Associated Dry Goods, </em>449 U.S. at 601, 101 S.Ct. at 823. Thus, <em>Associated Dry Goods </em>confirms the holding in <em>Perry </em>that disclosure of information to an employer is not the prohibited disclosure to the public under Title VII.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the court below noted, this is the \u201clinchpin\u201d of <em>Perry. </em>In <em>Perry </em>this court construed both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5(b) and 2000e-8(e), the exemptions to disclosure in Title VII, and exemption (b)(3), and held that exemption (b)(3) did not apply to the parties to a charge, even though it might apply to others. This construction is wholly consonant with <em>Associated Dry Goods </em>and the purpose of the two Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Therefore, we find that <em>Perry </em>remains persuasive in this instance. It is clear from <em>Associated Dry Goods </em>that a party has access to certain information in his own file. The limitation placed upon disclosure under the (b)(3) exemption by <em>Associated Dry Goods </em>and <em>Perry </em>is that one cannot discover information in another\u2019s file. <em>See, Associated Dry Goods, </em>449 U.S. at 603-04, 101 S.Ct. at 824-825. That is not, however, the only limitation upon disclosure to a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">Exemption (b)(7) of the FOIA exempts from disclosure</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-16\">(7) investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-17\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A). The Commission claims that the documents in question were compiled for law enforcement purposes; therefore, the documents are entitled to a \u201cblanket exemption\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from disclosure. Thus, the Commission maintains that disclosure of any law enforcement record is interference with the enforcement proceedings. This is the exact argument that Congress rejected by amending the FOIA in 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-18\">The original language of this exemption to the FOIA covered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsD\">investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes except to the extent available by law to a private party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-19\">80 Stat. 251. Congress was dissatisfied with the broad interpretation given to this language and amended the statute to its present form. The purposes of the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ment were to \u201crequire reviewing Courts to \u2018[l]ook to the reasons\u2019 for allowing withholding of investigatory files before making their decisions\u201d and to reject \u201cthe wooden and mechanical\u201d approach applied by courts. <em>N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 230, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 2321, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978) (citing Freedom of Information Act and Amendments of 1974 (Pub.L. 93-502) Source Book, 94th Cong., 1st Session, 334-335 (Joint Comm. Print 1975) (1975 Source Book)). In that same amendment, Congress also provided that \u201c[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions exempt under this subsection.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These amendments show Congress\u2019 intent that some interference with the proceedings must be shown, and further, that only those portions of the record that actually interfere with the proceedings are to be withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The EEOC, however, argues that <em>N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978) stands for the proposition that all investigatory records of an ongoing proceeding are exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">An understanding of <em>Robbins Tire </em>is complicated by the language of the majority which seems to restrict itself to statements of witnesses. \u201cSince we are dealing here with the narrow question whether witnesses\u2019 statements must be released five days prior to an unfair labor practice hearing, we cannot see how FOIA\u2019s purposes would be defeated by deferring disclosure until after the government has presented its case in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 98 S.Ct. at 2326.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">However, the scope of <em>Robbins Tire </em>is clarified by a short concurrence of three justices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">The \u2018act of meddling in\u2019 a process is one of Webster\u2019s accepted definitions of the word \u2018interference\u2019. A statute that authorized discovery greater than that available under the rules normally applicable to an enforcement proceeding would \u2018interfere\u2019 with the proceeding in that sense. The court quite correctly holds that the Freedom of Information Act does not authorize any such interference in Labor Board enforcement proceedings. Its rationale applies equally to any enforcement proceeding. On that understanding, I join the opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-10\"><em>Id. at </em>243, 98 S.Ct. at 2327.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">While a \u2018blanket exemption\u2019, as urged by the Commission, is not mandated by <em>Robbins Tire, </em>neither is a case-by-ease approach.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">... We can find little support in the language of the statute itself for respondent\u2019s view that determinations of \u201cinterference\u201d under Exemption 7(A) can be made only on <em>a </em>case-by-case basis. Indeed, the literal language of Exemption 7 as a whole tends to suggest that the contrary is true. The Exemption applies to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\">\u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (B) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (C) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (D) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, (E) disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or (F) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-14\">There is a readily apparent difference between subdivision (A) and subdivisions (B), (C), and (D). The latter subdivisions refer to particular cases \u2014 \u201ca person,\u201d \u201can unwarranted invasion,\u201d \u201ca confidential source\" \u2014 and thus seem to require a showing that the factors made relevant by the statute are present in each distinct situation. By contrast, since subdivision (A) speaks in the plural voice about \u201cenforcement proceedings,\u201d it appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>contemplate that <em>certain generic determinations </em>might be made. <em>Id. </em>at 223-24, 98 S.Ct. at 2317-2318 (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">It is obvious from the district court\u2019s order that it proceeded on a case-by-case basis, after the Commission had made an adequate showing of interference by disclosure of various categories of documents. The examination of each document within the category by the district court was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In Stevens\u2019 2(b) request it sought \u201c(b) Any communications to or from any person with respect to any charge referred to in \u201c1\u201d above.\u201d See page 137 <em>Ante.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The Commission claimed the following categories of documents were exempt under 7(A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">1. Internal memos between various offices of the EEOC concerning the processing of charges filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">2. Correspondence between private attorneys and the Commission concerning the process of charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">3. Correspondence between charging parties and the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">4. Correspondence between State or City referral Agencies and the Commission concerning the processing of charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">5. Correspondence between other governmental Agencies and the Commission concerning the status of litigation involving the Commissioner\u2019s charge filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">In its 2(c) request Stevens asked for \u201c(c) Any affidavit or statement bearing upon any charge referred to in \u201c1\u201d above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">The Commission claimed 7(A) exemption of the following categories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-15\">1. Affidavits by charging parties pertaining to Company policies and practices which may be violative of Title VII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-16\">2. Affidavits by fellow employees of charging parties or other witnesses concerning their knowledge of Company policies and practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-17\">3. Interviews with charging parties as transcribed by Field investigators or Commission attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-18\">4. Interviews with other witnesses who have some knowledge of the Company\u2019s employment patterns and practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-19\">Request 2(g) by Stevens demanded <em>\u201c(g) </em>Any recommendations or solicitations by any person that charges or legal proceedings be brought against this Company.\u201d As to this demand, the Commission claimed the following categories as exempt under 7(A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-20\">1. Internal Justification Memorandum in Support of Commissioner\u2019s charge against J.P. Stevens Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-21\">2. Correspondence between charging parties and the Commission\u2019s District Offices prior to the filing of various charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-22\">3. Internal memos between various offices of the Commission pertaining to the filing of charges against the Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-23\">4. Correspondence between private attorneys and the Commission pertaining to the filing of charges against the Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-24\">5. Correspondence between the Commission and State or City referral Agencies concerning the filing of charges or referral of cases for Commission processing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-25\">6. Correspondence between private organizations and the Commission concerning referral of persons with potential cases for EEOC processing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-26\">7. Correspondence between labor organizations and the Commission concerning the processing of charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-27\">The EEOC filed with these categorizations a memorandum stating why premature disclosure of the disputed documents would interfere with enforcement proceedings. Such disclosure, according to the memorandum, would \u201cdry up\u201d investigative sources. The Commission also argued that disclosure would deprive it of its ability to shape and control its investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>An examination of the title of each category indicates that disclosure of its contents to Stevens, the object of the investigation, would interfere with any enforcement proceeding that may stem from the investigation. These categories represent the \u201cgeneric determinations\u201d of <em>Robbins Tire. </em>\u201cWitness statements prior to a hearing\u201d is the generic determination or category established by <em>Robbins Tire </em>as being exempted from disclosure under 7(A). The reasoning underlying witness statements obviously applies to affidavits and interviews of charging parties, fellow employees and witnesses; correspondence with attorneys and charging parties; internal memoranda of EEOC concerning the charge and all of the categories set forth by EEOC in response to Stevens\u2019 demands 2(b), (c) and (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Premature disclosure of these documents would (1) create a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on potential witnesses and dry up sources of information, particularly those of charging parties and their attorneys; (2) hamper the free flow of ideas between Commission employees and supervisors or with other governmental agencies; (3) hinder its ability to shape and control investigations; and (4) make more difficult the future investigation of charges and enforcement thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">It is obvious that plaintiff brought this action with the intention of using the freedom of information act as a discovery tool. <em>Robbins Tire </em>makes clear that such premature discovery was not intended and is the type of \u201cinterference\u201d prohibited by exemption 7(A). <em>Id. </em>at 241-43, 98 S.Ct. at 2326-2327.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">On the present facts the district judge was in error to conduct an <em>in camera </em>examination of the documents and to order some of them disclosed after the Commission had made its return to the demand, which return carefully categorized the documents in such a way as to give notice that their contents would interfere with an enforcement proceeding. Although these documents were not exempt under (b)(3), they are exempt under 7(A) and therefore the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART</p>\n<p id=\"Arn\">REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-10\">. The relevant statutory language is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeh\">(b) Whenever a charge is filed by or on behalf of a person claiming to be aggrieved, or by a member of the Commission, alleging that an employer ... has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the Commission shall serve a notice of the charge (including the date, place and circumstances of the alleged unlawful employment practice) on such employer ...

In <em>Associated Dry Goods </em>the Court read this statutory language as logically showing that disclosure is not prohibited to the parties. 449 U.S. at 598, 101 S.Ct. at 822,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\">. Senator Humphrey, cosponsor of the bill, discussed the purpose of the disclosure provision stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">[Tjhis is a ban on <em>publicizing </em>and not on such disclosure as is necessary to the carrying out of the Commission\u2019s duties under the statute .... The amendment is not intended to hamper Commission investigations or proper cooperation with other State and Federal agencies, but rather is aimed at the making available <em>to the general public </em>of unproven charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">110 Cong.Rec. 12723 (1964) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b230-12\">. Indeed, the Court held that the prohibition is that a party can only discover information in his <em>own </em>file. 449 U.S. at 603-604, 101 S.Ct. at 824-825. This supports our conclusion in <em>Perry </em>that the exemption must prevent disclosure to the party seeking disclosure, not some other party. 571 F.2d at 200-201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b230-21\">. See Acting General Counsel\u2019s letter of March 31, 1975 claiming an exemption to the FOIA \u201cbecause said documents are part of investigatory records now being compiled by the Commission for law enforcement purposes and therefore are exempt under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7).\u201d This letter was incorporated by reference into the EEOC\u2019s response to the plaintiffs motion under <em>Vaughn v. Rosen.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
