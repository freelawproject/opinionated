WINTER, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A9Y\">Allen Carlos Woodruff, a longshoreman severely injured after accidentally falling over the side of a docked United States aircraft carrier on which he was working, brought suit in negligence against the United States as shipowner. At the conclusion of a bench trial, the district court entered judgment for the United States. The court reasoned that the risk of injury was not \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d by the Navy because the longshoreman\u2019s stevedore-employer had assumed full responsibility for work-area safety. Woodruff appeals, contending that the district court misapplied the controlling legal standard. We agree, and reverse. We remand for entry of a judgment of liability and the determination of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Neither party challenges the district court\u2019s findings of fact. These we summarize: In February 1981, Woodruff was a longshoreman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> employed by stevedore<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Douglas Call Company in the application of a non-skid coating to the deck of the USS GUADALCANAL. On the morning of February 9, Woodruff was clearing objects from an area of the flight deck. While dragging a heavily laden pallet close to the ship\u2019s edge onto an elevator platform then level with the deck, Woodruff tripped. He lost his balance, plunged overboard, and fell some fifty feet to the dock below before bouncing into the water. Woodruff was severely injured, but he survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Woodruff unluckily had stumbled at one of the few spaces along the edge of the GUADALCANAL that lacked safety nets hinged out from the side of the ship. On each side of the aircraft carrier an elevator platform is cut into the deck for use in raising and lowering helicopters stored below. By design, when the elevator lowers, stanchions with a wire strung between them automatically rise from the deck to create a safety barrier around the hole left by the depressed elevator. When the elevator rises back to flight deck level, the automatic stanchions retract, leaving a four-foot wide \u201cvoid\u201d in the safety netting along the side of the ship. However, a set of four manually-placed stanchions can be set in holes drilled into the deck approximately six inches away from the ship\u2019s edge. When so placed, the stanchions are rigged to fill this \u201cvoid\u201d with a wire barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">The manual barrier was not in place on the morning of the accident. The Call Company had contracted to apply non-skid material to within four inches of the deck\u2019s edge. According to Call\u2019s president and its operations manager, Call Company determined that placement of the portable stanchions during actual application of the nonskid material would have interfered with its performance according to the specifications, so Call had not requested rigging of the wire barrier. The Navy, however, was fully aware that Woodruff and others were working in the vicinity of the four-foot gap, and the stanchions were at all times under the Navy\u2019s control. Woodruff also knew that the gap existed, and was found to have been careless and inattentive in working near the hazard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">Woodruff brought suit under \u00a7 5(b) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b), alleging the government\u2019s negligence as shipowner in failing to erect the wire barrier or otherwise block the \u201cvoid\u201d. Although \u00a7 905(b) establishes a negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>standard,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the contours of LHWCA liability had been a subject of disagreement among the circuits prior to the resolution of conflicting interpretations in <em>Scindia Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. v. De Los Santos, </em>451 U.S. 156, 101 S.Ct. 1614, 68 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981). Now, however, because we recently articulated the law governing this area after <em>Scindia </em>in <em>Gill v. Hango Ship-Owners/AB, </em>682 F.2d 1070 (4 Cir.1982), our inquiry in this case is greatly narrowed to the question of whether the district court correctly applied that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Despite ruling prior to <em>Gill, </em>the district court to a large degree correctly discerned the proper duty of care owed. In <em>Gill </em>we stated that the shipowner<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is negligent \u201cif it should have anticipated harm despite the fact that the risk of harm created by [a shipboard condition or practice] was open and obvious.\u201d 682 F.2d at 1074. The district court, relying on our earlier opinion in <em>Harris v. Reederei, </em>657 F.2d 53 (4 Cir.1981), accurately verbalized this standard, including the proviso that the injury to the longshoreman must be a \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d consequence of exposure to the open and obvious hazard for the shipowner to be liable. <em>See Gill, supra, </em>682 F.2d at 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Where the district court erred was in its holding that the injury is not as a matter of law \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when the shipowner has some valid basis for relying on the stevedore to take charge of safety precautions. This view was specifically rejected in <em>Scindia. </em>There, Scindia, the shipowner, argued that even if it knew or was chargeable with knowledge of a malfunctioning winch, \u201cit was nevertheless entitled to assume that Seattle, the specialist in loading and unloading [and the stevedore], considered the equipment reasonably safe and was entitled to rely on that judgment.\u201d 451 U.S. at 175, 101 S.Ct. at 1626. The argument was rejected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">Yet it is quite possible, it seems to us, that Seattle\u2019s judgment in this respect was so obviously improvident that Scin-dia, if it knew of the defect and that Seattle was continuing to use it, should have realized the winch presented an unreasonable risk of harm to the longshoremen and that in such circumstances it had a duty to intervene and repair the ship\u2019s winch, (footnote eliminated)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">451 U.S. at 175-76, 101 S.Ct. at 1626. <em>See also, Gill, supra, </em>682 F.2d at 1074. The district court\u2019s understanding of \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d would render this ultimate duty meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">Under the guiding legal standard, then, the district court\u2019s findings of fact lead to no other conclusion than that an \u201cobviously improvident\u201d lapse by the stevedore occurred here. The evidence established that the Navy understood that the absence of netting created a serious hazard. As the district court stated in its bench ruling, \u201cThe Navy obviously knew that there was a hazard in this area because they designed in their plans, when they built the ship, according to the expert here who got the plans and reviewed them, a stanchion and rope system to guard against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>that opening.\u201d Placing the manual stanchions as a barrier against Woodruff or anyone else working in the area falling overboard required a minimum of effort. The choice to have the stanchions absent from the elevator area, to be sure, was found to be the stevedore\u2019s.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the stevedore\u2019s primary interest was in a fast and convenient performance of its contract. Call Company took no alternative precautions, an omission that was apparent to the Navy personnel in that area of the ship while the work progressed. Exposing the longshoreman to the risk of a sheer drop some fifty feet onto the dock below or into the water, by foregoing the available safety device without any offsetting precautions, was \u201cobviously improvident\u201d as a matter of law. Although the Navy may have preferred to rely completely on the stevedore to protect longshoremen, \u201cin such circumstances it had a duty to intervene\u201d. <em>Scin-dia, supra, </em>451 U.S. at 176, 101 S.Ct. at 1626; <em>see also, Gill, supra, </em>682 F.2d at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">In oral argument before us (but not in its brief), the government nonetheless contends that all responsibility for safety precautions had been shifted to Call Company by contract, and that such a contract overrides the duty otherwise owed by the shipowner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not reach this issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>however. No express written or oral agreement delegating full safety responsibility to Call Company has been brought to our attention, nor have we located one in the record.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not think that such a contract can be implied from the relationship of the parties, their conduct or the documents which passed between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Having concluded that there was liability on the part of the government as a matter of law, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for entry of a judgment of liability and the assessment of damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is conceded by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that plaintiff was contributorily negligent at least in part. Of course, contributory negligence is not a total bar to recovery for a maritime tort, <em>Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, </em>346 U.S. 406, 408-09, 74 S.Ct. 202, 204-05, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953), but plaintiff may recover only to the extent that his fault did not cause his injuries. The district court on remand will therefore determine total damages and the extent to which recovery accordingly shall be allowed against the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">.

The necessity of removing the stanchions from the \u201cvoid\u201d area at the time Woodruff was working near there is less than clear. Douglas Call, the company\u2019s president, admitted that the non-skid material had already been applied to the elevator surface prior to the day of the accident. He asserted that the stanchions only needed to be removed- from an area of deck long enough for the material to \u201ccure.\u201d He went on to concede that he did not know of any reason why the portable stanchions were not placed in the holes in the elevator to form a barrier on the morning of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Somewhat in contradiction was the testimony of Call Company\u2019s operations manager. He testified that the elevator, but not the surrounding deck area, had indeed been resurfaced just a few days before the accident and had not yet \u201ccured\u201d by February 9. But the consequence of this was that none of the resurfacing machinery that was to be used in the adjacent areas that day could have traveled across the elevator area without hurting the new surface. As a result, \u201cwe were moving stuff by our hands to get it out of the way and onto the elevator\u201d \u2014 i.e., the elevator was nonetheless sufficiently \u201ccured\u201d to allow heavy pallets and other objects to be stored in it. In addition, because the elevator itself had already been resurfaced, the placing of stanchions in the holes cut into the elevator would not have interfered with application of the material to within four inches of the edge. Moreover, the operations manager expressed his surprise at the fact that in several weeks aboard the GUADALCANAL prior to the accident he had never seen any stanchions erected as a barrier on the elevator in front of the \u201cvoid,\u201d whether or not Call personnel needed to work in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Despite this evidence, the district court concluded that Call Company wanted the deck to be clear of stanchions in areas where it was to work, and that the elevator was such an area. More importantly, we note that the district court did not make a specific finding that Call had actually requested that stanchions not be placed manually on the elevator on the day of the accident, but rather appears to have inferred such to be the case because of Call\u2019s general practice of supervising the safety of its employees. Nor did the court make any finding concerning the apparent contradiction between Douglas Call\u2019s statement that stanchions could not be simply stood in the holes drilled into the deck until the area had \u201ccured,\u201d and the operations manager\u2019s testimony that even an uncured area was a suitable place onto which to drag heavy objects. We need not consider whether these findings are \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d however, because the result we reach is only reinforced if in fact the Navy not only had not removed the stanchions due to a specific, work-related request by Call to do so, but, in addition, had never erected the manual barrier at any time. Accordingly, we simply state in the text the district court\u2019s factual conclusions explaining the absence of a barrier while Woodruff worked near the \u201cvoid,\u201d and confine our reservations to this footnote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b221-12\">. The government also suggests that the Safety and Health Regulations for Shipyard Employment, 29 C.F.R. Part 1915, cast all responsibility for work area safety on the stevedore Call Company. But the regulations referred to in fact expressly state that no such alleviation of the shipowner\u2019s liability is effected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-13\">(b) This part [29 C.F.R.
