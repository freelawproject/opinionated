(\u201cArco\u201d), instituted this action in the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, seeking a declaratory judgment that certain of the appellees\u2019 United States patents are invalid and have not been infringed through Arco\u2019s operations at its plant in Monument, Texas. This appeal involves one of those patents, the \u2019115 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The district court, 555 F.Supp. 547, dismissed the complaint as barred by <em>res judicata </em>because: (1) Arco had purchased the plant from a company that itself had purchased the plant from Phillips Petroleum Company (\u201cPhillips\u201d); and (2) in prior litigation, Phillips\u2019 operations in the Monument plant had been held to infringe the \u2019115 patent. <em>Ziegler v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>483 F.2d 858 (5th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1079, 94 S.Ct. 597, 38 L.Ed.2d 485 (1973). The sole question in this appeal is whether the district court properly applied <em>res judicata </em>to bar Arco from litigating the validity of the \u2019115 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">There is pending before this court an appeal from the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in <em>Studiengesellschaft Kohle, m.b.H., </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., </em>549 F.Supp. 716, which held the \u2019115 patent valid and infringed. <em>Studiengesellschaft Kohle, m.b.H., v. Dart Industries, Inc., </em>Appeal No. 83-591.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Arco informed the district court in the present case that it \u201cagrees to be bound by the final result in the Delaware [Dart] litigation.\u201d This court expects to hear the <em>Dart </em>case in the summer or early fall. Since Arco will be bound by the \u201cfinal result\u201d of the <em>Dart </em>case \u2014 a case which directly involves the validity of the patent at issue here \u2014 we think it appropriate to suspend further proceedings in this case until we have decided <em>Dart. </em>The decision in <em>Dart </em>may be dispositive of the present case. If it is, there would be no need for us to determine the <em>res judicata </em>issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Accordingly, it is ordered that proceedings in this case be suspended, pending the decision in the <em>Dart </em>case. After that case has been decided, we shall determine the appropriate disposition of the appeal in the present case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
