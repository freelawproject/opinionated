Penney Company (\u201cPenney\u201d), applied for benefits under Penney\u2019s Long-Term Disability Benefit (\u201cLTD\u201d) Plan. The administrator of the LTD Plan, Prudential Insurance Company (\u201cPrudential\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied Wolfe\u2019s application because it found that Wolfe was not disabled within the meaning of the Plan. Wolfe contested this denial by bringing this action under section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132. The district court overturned the decision denying bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>fits and instated Wolfe into the LTD Plan. The issues raised by this appeal are: (1) whether the letter notifying Wolfe of Prudential\u2019s decision satisfied 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133, and (2) whether the district court properly instated Wolfe under Penney\u2019s LTD Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Wolfe worked in various positions for Penney from 1955 until Penney terminated him on October 6,1976. From July of 1966 until his termination, Wolfe managed Penney\u2019s Washington, Indiana store. In July of 1972, Wolfe suffered serious health problems, requiring hospitalization and surgery. Despite his health problems, Wolfe continued to work as a store manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In October, 1975, Tony Haake became the Penney district manager responsible for Wolfe\u2019s store. Haake visited Wolfe\u2019s store in April, 1976, and noted a number of problems respecting profits, markdowns, and overstocking. At this time, Wolfe did not say that his health caused him difficulty in performing his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Upon returning in August, 1976, Haake saw no improvements and, therefore, asked Lanny Benson, the regional personnel manager, to inspect and evaluate Wolfe\u2019s store. Benson confirmed Haake\u2019s conclusion that Wolfe was seriously deficient as a manager. During the August, 1976 visit, Benson questioned Wolfe about his health. Wolfe assured Benson that he felt fine and was capable of performing his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Because the problems with Wolfe\u2019s store continued to escalate, Haake went to the store on October 6, 1976. When told that Wolfe was at home for lunch, Haake called Wolfe\u2019s home, requesting that he come to the store. With Benson\u2019s approval, Haake told Wolfe that he could resign or be terminated; Wolfe resigned. Although he was ill, Wolfe made no mention of his health problems to Benson.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">On November 18, 1976, six weeks after Wolfe\u2019s termination, his wife Dorothy wrote to Benson, inquiring about possible disability benefits. On December 6, 1976, Dr. Murray, Wolfe\u2019s physician since 1971, wrote to Benson, stating that Wolfe had been disabled by \u201cdepression syndrome\u201d since \u201cearly 1974.\u201d Benson wrote to Robert Bivona of Penney\u2019s Benefits Administration Office concerning Mrs. Wolfe\u2019s inquiry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">As a result, information respecting the LTD Plan was sent to Wolfe. On March 24, 1977, a claim for benefits was filed on Wolfe\u2019s behalf. The material filed with Prudential included Wolfe\u2019s statement of disability form, Dr. Murray\u2019s Attending Physician\u2019s Statement, the medical records submitted by Dr. Murray, Benson\u2019s December 13,-1976 letter to Bivona, and Dr. Murray\u2019s December 6, 1976 letter to Benson.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">John Murray was the person at Prudential principally responsible for processing Wolfe\u2019s claim. Under the Plan, a Penney employee ceases to be a Participant on \u201cthe date of termination of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48-49. However, the Plan provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-p\">If a Participant\u2019s active service terminates because of injury or sickness for which Monthly Benefits are or may become payable under the Plan, he will continue to participate during the Benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Qualifying Period and during the period for which Monthly Benefits are payable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 49. To find out why Penney terminated Wolfe, Murray telephoned Benson on April 25, 1977. Benson informed Murray that Wolfe was terminated because of substandard job performance and not because of health problems or sick time.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">On the basis of the information before him, Murray decided the claim should be denied and wrote to Wolfe informing him of his decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Murray and Dr. Murray had further correspondence, no further information was provided to Prudential before Wolfe filed this action on February 23, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">At trial, the district court admitted additional evidence regarding Wolfe\u2019s claim over the defendants-appellants\u2019 objection. The additional evidence consisted of testimony by Dr. Murray (which went beyond the Attending Physician\u2019s statement), Wolfe, Bernice Gress (Wolfe\u2019s co-worker), and Dorothy Wolfe. Because the district court admitted Wolfe\u2019s additional evidence over the objection that review was limited to the evidence before Prudential, the defendants-appellants called Haake and Benson as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">II. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Wolfe contends that the May 11, 1977 letter from Prudential, denying his application, violated the ERISA Procedural requirements set forth in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 1133 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">In accordance with regulations of the secretary, every employee benefit plan shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">(1) provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-16\">(2) afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">The pertinent federal regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory mandate provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-18\">(f) <em>Content of notice. </em>A plan administrator or, if paragraph (c) of this section is applicable, the insurance company, insurance service, or other similar organization, shall provide to every claimant who is denied a claim for benefits written notice setting forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-19\">(1) The specific reason or reasons for the denial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-20\">(2) Specific reference to pertinent plan provisions on which the denial is based;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-21\">(3) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>(4) Appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the participant or beneficiary wishes to submit his or her claim for review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-l(f) (1980). However, this regulation became effective on October 1, 1977, months after Prudential sent the denial letter. Nonetheless, in order to satisfy 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133, a denial letter must substantially (not strictly) comply with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-l(f). Compliance with subsections (1) and (2) of section 2560.503-1 is necessary to meet subsection (1) of section 1133. Indeed, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1(1) tracts the language of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133(1). The 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1(2) requirement of specifying the pertinent plan provision may be, in a particular case, essential for the participant to fully apprehend the reason for the denial and to know what deficiency in his application must be overcome. Satisfaction of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1(3) contributes towards the requirements of both subsections of section 1133. Describing additional information needed and explaining its relevance, as required by subsection (3) of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1, enables a participant both to appreciate the fatal inadequacy of his claim as it stands and to gain a meaningful review by knowing with what to supplement the record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, subsection (4) of* 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1 must invariably be met to satisfy section 1133(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">The letter from Prudential misses the section 1133 target. The \u201creason\u201d given for denial is not a reason but a conclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See generally, Richardson v. Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, </em>645 F.2d 660, 664 (8th Cir.1981); <em>Grossmuller v. Budd Co. Consolidated Retirement Benefit Plan for Employees, </em>547 F.Supp. 111, 114 (E.D.Pa.1982); <em>Hayden v. Texas</em>\u2014U.S. <em>Chemical Co., </em>557 F.Supp. 382, 386 (E.D.Texas 1983). Murray\u2019s reasoning for denying Wolfe\u2019s claim is stated quite clearly, however, in a memorandum to his supervisor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An explanation along the lines provided in the memorandum would \u25a0have apprised Wolfe of the reason for the denial, alerted him to the deficiency of the record accompanying his claim, and thereby aided him in building his claim with additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The only type of information which the denial letter indicates Wolfe should supply is \u201cmedical information.\u201d As Wolfe\u2019s claim file already contained substantially all of the medical records from Dr. Murray\u2019s treatment file, Wolfe was no doubt at a loss as to what more he might submit; although, as the trial in district court bore out, Wolfe had additional, relevant evidence. Particularly where, as here, the record itself raises significant questions respecting the merits of the claim, a fiduciary (or its agent) ought to specify with some detail what type of information would help to resolve these questions, and how the applicant should present such information. <em>See generally, Grossmuller v. International Union, U.A.W., </em>511 F.Supp. 709, 710 (E.D. Pa.1981). Prudential\u2019s failure to indicate the type of information which Wolfe should submit becomes critical in light of the sparse reasons for denial contained in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Finally, the denial letter is frugal with information pertaining to the steps to be taken for obtaining review. Therefore, we hold that the procedure outlined by section 1133 was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Although every procedural defect will not upset a trustee\u2019s decision, here, fairness requires that Prudential\u2019s decision be set aside. A decision to deny benefits under a plan covered by ERISA will be overturned when \u201c(1) arbitrary and capricious, (2) not supported by substantial evidence, or (3) erroneous on a question of law.\u201d <em>Peckham </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>653 F.2d 424, 426 (10th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We view Prudential\u2019s procedural error as a significant error on a question of law, erroneously interpreting and applying section 1133. The additional evidence which Wolfe adduced at trial suggests that if Prudential had complied with section 1133, Wolfe would have supplemented the record before Prudential, sought and received a full and fair review before the Board of Governors, and obtained a decision one way or the other based upon substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Wolfe is not entitled to a substantive remedy, however, based upon Prudential\u2019s procedure violation. <em>Grossmuller v. International Union, U.A.W., </em>511 F.Supp. 709, 710 (E.D.Pa.1981). Rather, this case must be remanded to the fiduciary for a new determination of Wolfe\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">III. Instatement in the LTD Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">The district court overturned Prudential\u2019s decision because Prudential \u201carbitrarily and capriciously failed to develop any evidence on the relationship between the plaintiff\u2019s medical history and his poor job performance.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>No. EV 79-33-C at 20 n. 6 (S.D.Ind. Sept. 1, 1982). In particular, the district court determined that Prudential should have exercised its authority to have Wolfe examined by a physician during the claim\u2019s pendency in light of the \u201cmass of uncontroverted medical information submitted\u201d and \u201cPrudential\u2019s recognition of the critical nature of the circumstances surrounding the plaintiff\u2019s determination.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18-20. <em>See generally, Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., </em>698 F.2d 802, 811 (6th Cir.1983) (a trustee has a limited duty to investigate and a concomitant duty not to undertake unreasonable investigations to determine coverage). As a remedy for this procedural defect, the district court instated Wolfe in the LTD Plan because \u201cgiven the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>unliklihood [sic] that an examination of the plaintiff\u2019s health at the present time would shed any light upon his ability to perform his job in 1976, the court [was] of the opinion that an award without remand [was] appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regardless of whether Prudential based its decision on substantial evidence, we must reverse the district court\u2019s directive to instate Wolfe into the LTD Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">In reviewing a fiduciary\u2019s decision, \u201c[a] federal court is to focus on the evidence before the truste[e] at the time of [his] final decision and is not to hold a <em>de novo </em>factual hearing on the question of applicant\u2019s eligibility.\u201d <em>Wardle v. Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, </em>627 F.2d 820, 824 (7th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1112, 101 S.Ct. 922, 66 L.Ed.2d 841 (1981). <em>See also Miles v. New York State Teamsters Conference, </em>698 F.2d 593, 599 (2d Cir.1983). Policy considerations favor allowing the fiduciary to decide an employee\u2019s benefit eligibility. <em>Taylor v. Bakery &amp; Confectionary Union, </em>455 F.Supp. 816, 820 (E.D.N.C.1978) (discussing importance of exhaustion). When additional evidence on the merits of the claim for benefits is presented for the first time to the district court, the court should remand to the fiduciary to make the initial assessment of whether such facts establish an applicant\u2019s eligibility. <em>Wardle, </em>627 F.2d at 828. This is necessary to insure that the fiduciary retains the \u201cprimary responsibility for claim processing\u201d that Congress intended. <em>Challenger v. Local Union No. 1, </em>619 F.2d 645, 649 (7th Cir.1980). No remand is necessary, however, where it \u201cwould be a \u2018useless formality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ruth v. Lewis, </em>166 F.Supp. 346, 349 (D.D.C.1958). In <em>Wardle, </em>we considered remand unnecessary where the unsuccessful applicant presented additional evidence which strengthened his position only minimally. <em>Wardle, </em>627 F.2d at 828. Thus, we upheld the fiduciaries\u2019 decision and did not overturn it based on the additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In contrast to <em>Wardle, </em>the additional evidence introduced at trial by Wolfe and the defendants-appellants is significant and led the district court to overturn the denial. Although a present examination of Wolfe is not apt to reveal whether he was disabled on October 6, 1976, Prudential must be permitted to evaluate the additional evidence produced at trial and determine Wolfe\u2019s eligibility. If Wolfe prevails at the hearing before the fiduciary, Wolfe would then be entitled to retroactive benefits. We do not, however, intend to indicate a view as to a final decision on the merits, only that the plaintiff is entitled to reconsideration of his claim by the fiduciary, the Board of Governors.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Reversed and remanded to the district court with direction to remand to the fiduciary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-13\">. Prudential was a defendant in the district court but not a party to this appeal; the district court ruled that Prudential was not a fiduciary under ERISA and thus could not be held liable as a fiduciary. For purposes of administering the LTD Plan, Penney established the defendant-appellant J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Voluntary Employee\u2019s Beneficiary Association (\u201cAssociation\u201d). In turn, the Association was managed by the defendant-appellant Board of Governors of the J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Voluntary Employee\u2019s Beneficiary Association (\u201cBoard of Governors\u201d). The Board of Governors was the named fiduciary of the Penney LTD Plan and entered an administrative service contract with Prudential whereby Prudential agreed to provide certain claims services relating to the LTD Plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\">. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">We released [Wolfe] on October 6th of this year for failure to meet Company Standards. His performance frankly, had been marginal for many years. From late 1972 thru January of 1974, he underwent several surgical procedures, however, he assured us several times since his last operation that he was feeling fine. In fact, I personally visited his store on August 26th of this year and George commented to me that he was in good health. I did not note any depression in his attitude or manner at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">Since his dismissal from the Company, his wife states that he is terribly depressed and has been committed to a hospital for care and treatment. Mrs. Wolfe feels that George may qualify for some type of disability earnings. She further stated, during our phone conversation, that her husband simply left the store the day he was released with little or no personal papers and that due to his condition, she has been unable to determine exactly what benefits, insurances, etc. to which he is entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-17\">A December 6th letter from Mr. Wolfe\u2019s doctor (copy enclosed) offers an opinion that his current depression syndrome tracks back to early 1974.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">Defendants-Appellants\u2019 Appendix at 100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-11\">. Murray\u2019s letter explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">Under the terms of the Plan, in order to qualify for benefits, an individual\u2019s absence from Active Service must be caused by sickness or accidental bodily injury, directly and independently of all other causes. A review of the information submitted with your file indicates that your absence from Active Service was due to your being terminated by J.C. Penney, rather than sickness or injury. The medical information in our file does not indicate that sickness or bodily injury, directly and independently of all other causes, caused you to stop working at that time. Your coverage under the Plan ended upon your termination by J.C. Penney, so you would not have been covered at any point subsequent to the termination when you might actually have become disabled or been hospitalized. In view of the above, we have no alternative but to deny your claim for benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-23\">Please be advised that our decision has only been reached after a very careful review of all the information in our file. We are, of course, willing to review any additional medical information which you might wish to submit, indicating that your employment was terminated due to medical reasons in October of 1976. Should you wish to submit such additional medical information, or should you desire a review of our decision, you may write to me in the Group Life Claim Division of Prudential at the address shown above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQy\"><em>Id. </em>at 107.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Aroi\">. The district court did not resolve this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b482-5\">. In dicta, we previously indicated that this requirement must be met in certain instances, even though the claim and the denial letter both preceded 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1 (f). <em>War-dle v. Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, </em>627 F.2d 820, 828 n. 17 (7th Cir.1980). In <em>Wardle, </em>we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">Although Wardle does not raise this issue, we note with concern the skeletal nature of the letters explaining the Committee\u2019s reasons for its decision. Although they informed Wardle that his application had been denied because he was self-employed while working for Purcell and Lovelace, the letters arguably did not set forth the reasoning behind the decision or the type of information necessary for him to qualify for a pension. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1(f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\">. Furthermore, some of the language used in the letter created confusion rather than understanding. The letter\u2019s reference to \u201cActive Service\u201d is cryptic without either a citation to the LTD Plan\u2019s definition of the phrase or a definition of the term within the letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b482-9\">. In the memorandum, Murray states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agr-dedup-0\">Admittedly, associate did have a good deal of physical problems, with several major sur-genes since that time, but a review of those hospital records reveals only two notations relating to emotional or psychiatric problems .... Dr. Murray indicates in his ltr [sic] of 12-6-76 that he didn\u2019t realize the severity of Associate\u2019s emotional problems, &amp; since associate was reluctant to seek treatment, he didn\u2019t push him in that direction until after LDAS. Dr. concludes that Associate has been \u201cdisabled by this depression since early 1974....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">Would conclude that Associate was functioning on the job up until 10-6-76. He did, according to AP, have emotional problems going back to 1974, &amp; was able to work in spite of same. Those emotional problems were not severe enough to rate more than the 2 notations in his hospital records, as discussed above. Associate apparently had no psychiatric care until after his employment was terminated. In all probability, the emotional shock of his termination probably served to exacerbate his problems, &amp; to push him to a point finally requiring treatment, rather than his emotional problems or treatment thereof causing his work to suffer and his being terminated. Since his disability did not cause him to be absent from active service (his termination did), would deny LTD and \u201cS\u201d claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">Appendix at 105-106.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">.
