The Administrative Law Judge awarded benefits on the basis of a doctor\u2019s opinion that Rowe had pneumoconiosis. The Benefits Review Board found that opinion to be an insufficient basis for the award of benefits, but affirmed on the basis of a second doctor\u2019s opinion which was in the record but not discussed at all by the ALJ. The Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs now appeals,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contending that the Board exceeded its statutory standard of review in finding that the second doctor\u2019s opinion was a documented and reasoned medical opinion sufficient to establish an interim presumption of total disability. The Director asserts that such a finding must initially be made by the ALJ as the factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 21(c) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), as incorporated by \u00a7 422(a) of the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we find that the Board exceeded its proper scope of review and, accordingly, we vacate the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Rowe\u2019s claim is governed by Part C of the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 931 <em>et seq. </em>since it was filed after December 31, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">We recently set out the general procedures for processing a black lung claim. <em>Blevins v. Director, OWCP, </em>683 F.2d 139, 140-41 (6th Cir.1982). A dissatisfied claimant may have his case heard by an ALJ. Then, any party aggrieved by the ALJ\u2019s decision may appeal to the Benefits Review Board. Finally, any party adversely affected or aggrieved by the Board\u2019s decision may appeal to the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">In this case, Rowe\u2019s claim was denied by the Director and then heard by an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">The record before the ALJ included two reports of physical examinations. Dr. P.L. Odom examined Rowe in 1976. Dr. Odom noted that Rowe was missing one eye and had injured his back in 1950, from which he had occasional lower back pain. Dr. Odom also noted that Rowe had complained of significant coughing and phlegm production over a 15-18 year period and shortness of breath upon walking, climbing and while laying down at night. Dr. Odom\u2019s physical examination of Rowe revealed evidence of scattered rhonchi in both lungs. Dr. Odom also conducted a chest x-ray and a ventila-tory function test. He diagnosed bronchitis and coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis. Dr. Odom stated his conclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW1\">Advanced pneumoconiosis, totally and permanently disabled for coal mining, dusty work to prevent further injury to lungs. Spirometry revealed only mild impairment, but in view of x-ray and history of exertional dyspnea, and advanced age, Mr. Rowe is totally and permanently disabled for all work. I believe that more sophisticated pulmonary. function tests will demonstrate pulmonary impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APU\">(App.26).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">Dr. C.M. Rivera also examined Rowe in 1976. Dr. Rivera noted that Rowe com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>plained of arm, leg, and back pain but that he took no medication for the pain. Rowe also complained of a chronic cough and shortness of breath but denied suffering from chronic wheezing, orthopnea<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Rivera noted that Rowe had worked in the coal mines for 19 years and had smoked <em>xk </em>of a pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years. Dr. Rivera noted that a chest x-ray showed evidence of pneumoconiosis but a test of arterial blood gases was normal. He diagnosed pneumoconiosis, bronchitis, and spinal disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The ALJ found that Rowe had established a rebuttable presumption of total disability which was not rebutted by the Director. There are four different ways for a live claimant to establish an interim presumption. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(l)-{4). The first three interim presumptions involve x-rays, biopsies, ventilatory studies, and arterial blood gas studies which meet prescribed standards. The ALJ found that none of the presumptions set forth in \u00a7 727.203(a)(l)-(3) were satisfied and the claimant does not dispute that finding. However, the ALJ found that \u00a7 727.-203(a)(4) had been satisfied. That provision states that an interim presumption of disability arises when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">(4) Other medical evidence, including the documented opinion of a physician exercising reasoned medical judgment, establishes the presence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The ALJ found that the interim presumption in (a)(4) had been satisfied based solely on Dr. Rivera\u2019s report. Since the Director failed to rebut that evidence to the ALJ\u2019s satisfaction, benefits were awarded. The ALJ\u2019s opinion did not mention (Dr. Odom\u2019s report at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The Director appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Benefits Review Board, contending that the ALJ erred in finding an (a)(4) presumption solely on Dr. Rivera\u2019s diagnosis of pneumoconiosis. The Board agreed with the Director because (a)(4) required a finding of a \u201ctotally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment\u201d and Dr. Rivera made no such finding. Rowe does not dispute the Board\u2019s finding on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Even though it found the sole basis for the ALJ\u2019s opinion to be insufficient, the Board affirmed the award of benefits. It found that Dr. Odom\u2019s report, even though it was never mentioned by the ALJ, was a documented and reasoned medical opinion sufficient to invoke the (a)(4) presumption. On appeal, the Director contends that the Board should have remanded the case in order to allow the ALJ, rather than the Board, to determine if Dr. Odom\u2019s opinion was a documented and reasoned medical opinion sufficient to invoke the interim presumption of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">This court\u2019s review of a decision of the Benefits Review Board is limited. \u201cThe court of appeals scrutinizes Board decisions for errors of law and for adherence to the statutory standard governing the Board\u2019s review of the administrative law judge\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d <em>Bumble Bee Seafoods v. Director, OWCP, </em>629 F.2d 1327, 1329 (9th Cir.1980). <em>Accord Miller v. Central Dispatch, Inc., </em>673 F.2d 773, 778-79 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Janusziewicz v. Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>677 F.2d 286, 290 (3d Cir.1982). The Board\u2019s function is similarly limited. It is not empowered to engage in a <em>de novo </em>review but rather is limited to reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision for errors of law and to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record viewed as a whole. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.301. We hold that the Board failed to adhere to its limited statutory function.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">The ALJ\u2019s opinion was clearly deficient. First, the AU failed to set out and discuss all of the medical evidence presented. It is the ALJ\u2019s duty to consider all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the evidence and make findings of fact and conclusions of law which adequately set forth the factual and legal basis for his decision. <em>See Volpe v. Northeast Marine Terminals, </em>671 F.2d 697, 701 (2d Cir.1982) (disability case brought under Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act). Second, the AU erred in finding Dr. Rivera\u2019s diagnosis of pneumoconiosis to be sufficient to invoke the interim presumption absent a finding of total impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Board recognized that the sole evidence relied upon by the ALJ was insufficient to support the award of benefits. Furthermore, the Board noted the ALJ\u2019s failure to discuss Dr. Odom\u2019s report. Rather than remanding the case to the ALJ in order to allow him to consider all of the evidence under the proper legal standard, the Board decided that the ALJ reached the right result for the wrong reason and affirmed the award on the basis that Dr. Odom\u2019s opinion was a documented and reasoned medical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We cannot agree with the Board\u2019s approach. When the ALJ fails to make important and necessary factual findings, the proper course for the Board is to remand the case to the ALJ pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(bX4) rather than attempting to fill the gaps in the ALJ\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Spra-gue v. Director, OWCP, </em>688 F.2d 862, 868 n.11 (1st Cir.1982); <em>Volpe, </em>671 F.2d at 701; <em>Director, OWCP v. U.S. Steel Corp., </em>606 F.2d 53 (3d Cir.1979). The determination as to whether Dr. Odom\u2019s report was sufficiently documented and reasoned is essentially a credibility matter. As such, it is for the factfinder to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">The Board noted in its opinion that Dr. Odom\u2019s opinion was documented because it was \u201cbased on an x-ray, pulmonary function study, medical history, and physical examination.\u201d App.12. However, the mere fact that an opinion is asserted to be based upon medical studies cannot by itself establish as a matter of law that it is documented and reasoned. Rather, that determination requires the factfinder to examine the validity of the reasoning<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of a medical opinion in light of the studies conducted and the objective indications upon which the medical opinion or conclusion is based. Of course, the factfinder should also consider any contrary test results or diagnosis in reaching a decision as to whether a statutory presumption applies and ultimately whether the claimant is totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Since neither the Board nor this court is empowered to make such a determination, in light of the record in this ease, the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>must be remanded to the ALJ.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Volpe, </em>671 F.2d at 700-01; <em>Director, OWCP v. U.S. Steel, </em>606 F.2d at 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Benefits Review Board is Vacated and the case is Remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-11\">. The Director has been designated by the Secretary of Labor as the Secretary\u2019s representative in all review proceedings regarding the Black Lung Benefits Act. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.410-(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-18\">. The history of the incorporation and the problems it caused is detailed in <em>Director, OWCP v. Alabama By-Products Corp., </em>560 F.2d 710 (5th Cir.1977) and in <em>Director, OWCP v. Eastern Coal Corp., </em>561 F.2d 632 (6th Cir.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\">. Orthopnea is discomfort in breathing in any but the erect sitting or standing position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b344-14\">. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is an acute shortness of breath appearing suddenly at night.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\">. This case is distinguishable from <em>Director, OWCP v. Gurule, </em>653 F.2d 1368 (10th Cir. 1981). In that case, the Board found that a factual determination made by the ALJ was not supported by substantial evidence and simply applied a regulation implemented by the Secretary as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">We also believe that this case is distinguishable from <em>Lawson v. Secretary of HHS, </em>688 F.2d 436 (6th Cir.1982). In <em>Lawson, </em>the claim for benefits was filed under Part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act and was originally ruled upon by the Secretary of HEW rather than the Secretary of Labor. Thus, <em>Lawson </em>was decided under the hearing and review procedures of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405, rather than under the review procedures of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. The major difference between the two review procedures for the purposes of this case is that the regulations promulgated under the Social Security Act allow the Appeals Council to obtain and review additional evidence under certain circumstances. 688 F.2d at 439-40. The Benefits Review Board has no authority to obtain additional evidence or make any factual findings. In that respect, the Board\u2019s function is similar to that of the district court\u2019s in Social Security disability cases and also to that of the district court\u2019s under the pre-1972 Longshoremen\u2019s Act. <em>See Miller v. Central Dispatch, Inc., </em>673 F.2d 773, 779 n.12 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b345-13\">. The validity of Dr. Odom\u2019s opinion is certainly open to attack. First, the x-ray which he found to be positive for pneumoconiosis (but apparently still insufficient to establish an interim presumption pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(1)) was later found to be unreadable by more qualified readers. Second, the pulmonary function study noted by the Board as documentation was inconclusive. Dr. Odom stated his belief \u201cthat more sophisticated pulmonary function tests will demonstrate a pulmonary impairment,\u201d but no such tests are in the record. Finally, Dr. Odom\u2019s report on Rowe\u2019s medical history contains no mention of Rowe\u2019s smoking habit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">. Unlike the concurring opinion, we do not intimate our view of the effect of the remand on the ultimate outcome of this case since such a suggestion would be inconsistent with the function of an appellate court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b346-5\">MILES, Chief District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A26\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">I am in complete agreement with the holding reached by Judges Contie and Well-ford that \u201c[wjhen the ALJ fails to make important and necessary factual findings, the proper course for the Board is to remand the case to the ALJ....\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, I agree with the present disposition of this case and write separately only to express my disagreement with two secondary matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">First, I disagree with the contention made by the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs that the Benefits Review Board engaged in <em>de novo </em>review. While the majority opinion does not address this assertion, some of the language used therein may imply tacit agreement with the Director\u2019s position. The record before this Court indicates to me, however, that the Benefits Review Board did not engage in <em>de novo </em>review, but merely examined the complete record in light of the ALJ\u2019s opinion. The Board\u2019s review would have been <em>de novo </em>if it had considered evidence outside of the record or had considered the record \u201cafresh\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> without giving any consideration to the ALJ\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Secondly, I have problems with the majority\u2019s brief discussion of what is necessary to determine that a doctor\u2019s diagnosis is sufficiently documented and reasoned to invoke the presumption of pneumoconiosis under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">The majority contends that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABV\">the mere fact that an opinion is asserted to be based upon medical studies cannot by itself establish as a matter of law that it is documented and reasoned. Rather, that determination requires the factfinder to examine the validity of the reasoning of a medical opinion in light of the studies conducted and the objective indications upon which the medical opinion or conclusion is based. Of course, the fact-finder should also consider any contrary test results or diagnoses in reaching a decision as to whether a statutory presumption applies and ultimately whether the claimant is totally disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">While conceding that experienced administrative law judges frequently develop considerable expertise in evaluating evidence routinely encountered in the hearings over which they daily preside, I believe that it is unnecessary and unduly burdensome to require all ALJs, whether novice or veteran, \u201cto examine the validity of the reasoning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>a medical opinion\u201d before finding that a doctor\u2019s opinion raises the presumption of pneumoconiosis in subsection (a)(4). I also am convinced that it is improper for the ALJ to consider evidence contrary to a finding of totally disabling pneumoconiosis until a presumption of pneumoconiosis has been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">When I read subsection (a)(4) in the context of the entire regulation codified at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(4), I am convinced that the presumption in (a)(4) t is raised by a medical opinion which finds total disability due to.pneumoconiosis and states that the diagnosis is based on the results from specified tests. An ALJ need do no more than find that the specified tests are generally considered probative regarding pneumoco-niosis to determine that the opinion is reasoned and thereby sufficient to raise the presumption. To require more intensive inquiry into the basis of the diagnosis before invoking the presumption has the effect of rendering subsection (a)(4) a compilation of the provisions in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) require the ALJ to look to specific test results in determining whether or not the results raise the presumption of pneumoconiosis. Since the tests referred to in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) are presumably the same or equivalent to those which would be cited as the basis for a reasoned medical opinion in compliance with subsection (a)(4), I am satisfied that the regulation in 'question is best construed to allow the ALJ to make an independent judgment based on the objective results from tests listed in subsections (a)(1), (2) and (3) regarding the invocation of the presumption, but to allow for a doctor\u2019s judgment (also based on test results but perhaps augmented by subjective considerations such as the patient\u2019s history) to satisfy subsection (a)(4). Furthermore, once the presumption is raised under any part of the regulation in question, then, and only then, need the ALJ look to other evidence to see if the presumption has been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">This interpretation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.-203(a) appears to comport with the Benefits Review Board\u2019s understanding regarding that provision. In the past, the Benefits Review Board has endorsed the practice of allowing an opinion based on generally accepted medical tests to invoke the presumption in subsection (a)(4), but has considered other evidence, such as contrary test results or diagnoses, in rebuttal of the presumption when raised.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Edward Justice v. Jewell Ridge Coal Corporation, </em>3 B.L.R. 1-547, 1-552 (1981). See also, <em>Fred J. Marshall v. The Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Company, </em>2 B.L.R. 1-746, 1-756-759 (1979), and the cases cited therein for examples of the types of documentation which have previously been deemed sufficient to justify the conclusion that a physician was \u201cexercising reasoned medical judgment\u201d thereby satisfying the requirements of subsection (a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">If this past practice was followed in the present case, the ALJ would be allowed to rely on Dr. Odom\u2019s and Dr. Rivera\u2019s conclusions jointly and thereby determine that the presumption in subsection (a)(4) has been raised. The ALJ would then consider the respondent\u2019s smoking habit, and the opinion of the more qualified x-ray reader that the x-rays relied upon by Dr. Odom were unreadable, as rebuttal evidence. I consider this procedure to be preferable because it imposes upon the AU the duty to consider and weigh all the evidence contained in the record in assessing the merits of a particular claim, but does not require the ALJ to substitute his or her own opinion for that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>qualified members of the medical profession.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\">. The cases cited by the Director in support of the contention that the Benefits Review Board should have remanded the case to the ALJ for reconsideration of the entire record and for explicit evaluation of all the evidence contained therein are <em>Albert D. Rasel v. Bethlehem Mines Corp., </em>1 B.L.R. 1-918 (1978); <em>Edna Gerhardt v. Saraha Coal Company, Inc., </em>1 B.L.R. 1-405 (1978); <em>Ersilio Marsella v. Starvaggi Industries, Inc., </em>2 B.L.R. 1-286 (1979); <em>Fred J. Marshall v. The Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co., </em>2 B.L.R. 1-746 (1979); <em>Edward Justice v. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp., </em>3 B.L.R. 1-547 (1981); <em>Lee Hopwood v. Sextet Mining Corp., </em>3 B.L.R. 1-477 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">This case stands in contrast to the cases listed above for, as was conceded by the petitioner in oral argument, remand is not likely to alter the ultimate outcome of the present case. In fact, the evidence which the ALJ failed to consider, Dr. Odom\u2019s report, lends additional support to the ALJ\u2019s initial decision to award benefits to the respondent. While appropriate, remand in this case will therefore serve only to insure that the basis for this award of benefits is adequately articulated and thereby preserve the procedural integrity of the system. While these goals are not without merit, it appears to me that the time and energy available to the Benefits Review Board and the ALJ might be better spent on consideration of pending cases in which the outcome has yet to be determined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-16\">. <em>De novo </em>is defined as \u201canew; afresh; a second time\u201d in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(4th ed. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\">.
