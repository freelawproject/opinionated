(Because of the confusing similarity of the names, we shall refer to Rolfe\u2019s company as \u201cRinc\u201d and to Mielko\u2019s company as \u201cMico\u201d). In 1976 Rinc bought the assets of Mico and, as part of the sale price, gave Mico a $70,000 promissory note secured by Rinc assets and a second mortgage on a home owned by Rolfe and his wife. To make a long story short, Rinc failed and filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition; its assets were insufficient to pay the Note; and the Rolfes have filed a chapter 13 petition in which they seek to avoid the consequences of pledging their home as collateral. Their arguments are highly technical, and amount to attacks on the validity of the various legal papers drawn in 1976 \u2014 some of which the record suggests (but does not clearly indicate) were drawn by the Rolfes\u2019 own lawyers. The bankruptcy court, 25 B.R. 89 (Bkrtcy.1982) rejected the Rolfes\u2019 technical arguments. And, so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">There are three basic relevant documents: (1) the Purchase Agreement between Rinc and Mico; (2) the $70,000 Note that Rinc executed in favor of Mico; and (3) the Mortgage that the Rolfes executed in favor of Mico. The Purchase Agreement refers specifically to the other two documents and says that it includes their actual text. The Agreement states that when Rinc receives various relevant papers from Mico, Rinc will then mail to Mico the following documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">A. Promissory Note in the sum of Seventy Thousand ($70,000) Dollars, a copy of which is appended hereto and marked Exhibit A [Exhibit A is the Note here at issue]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">C. A Second Mortgage executed and suitable for recording on the house owned by EDWARD ROLFE and STEPHANIE ROLFE, as tenants by the entirety, located on Silver Birch Lane, Lincoln, Massachusetts, a copy of which is appended hereto and marked Exhibit B [Exhibit B is the Mortgage here at issue].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">The Note, signed by Rolfe as President of Rinc states that for \u201cvalue received\u201d Rinc promises to pay Mico:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqc\">the sum of SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($70,000) with interest on the unpaid balance at the rate of ten (10%) percent per annum, for a period of five (5) years .... Payment of principal together with interest on the unpaid balance shall be made on the seventeenth day of May, 1976 and monthly thereafter on the seventeenth day of each month in equal installments of $1526.89 until the principal of said Note has been paid in full....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">This Note is secured by: ... (2) a second mortgage on a certain parcel of real estate in Lincoln, Massachusetts, a copy of which is appended hereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">The Mortgage, signed by both Rolfes personally, states in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"az-dedup-0\">Edward Rolfe and Stephanie Rolfe ... for consideration paid, grant [this Mortgage to Mico] ... to secure the payment of Seventy Thousand ($70,000) Dollars in five (5) years with ten (10%) per cent interest per annum, payable as provided in one note of even date....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">The Rolfes here claim that these documents are inadequate in four respects. First, they claim they received no consideration for the Mortgage, because Mico \u201cloaned\u201d the $70,000 <em>(i.e., </em>agreed to defer the payment of the purchase price of the Mico assets) to Rinc rather than the Rolfes. This is not a serious argument, however, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the consideration that promisor A receives when C lends money to B is the loan to B, not some <em>additional </em>benefit to A. In other words, the Rolfes wanted Mico to take <em>deferred </em>payment from Rinc and by putting up security, they got what they bargained for. <em>See, e.g., Marine Contractors Co. v. Hurley, </em>365 Mass. 280, 310 N.E.2d 915, 919 (1974); <em>Palmer Savings Bank v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>166 Mass. 189, 196, 44 N.E. 211, 213 (1896); <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts, </em>\u00a7 71(4) &amp; comment e.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Second, the Rolfes argue that the Statute of Frauds prevents enforcement of their mortgage because not all of its essential terms are in writing. Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 259, \u00a7 1. We assume for the sake of argument that we deal with \u201ca special promise to answer for the debt\u201d of another. <em>But cf., e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 116 (Statute of Frauds inapplicable when \u201cthe consideration for the promise is in fact or apparently desired by the promis- or mainly for his own economic advantage\u201d). Yet, even on that assumption, the writings are adequate. As the <em>Restatement </em>makes clear, for Statute of Frauds purposes a written memorandum \u201cmay consist of several writings\u201d as long as they \u201cclearly indicate that they relate to the same transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 132; <em>see, e.g., Clark v. Olejnik, </em>240 Mass. 215, 217, 133 N.E. 197 (1921); <em>Freeland v. Ritz, </em>154 Mass. 257, 259, 28 N.E. 226 (1891); <em>Salmon Falls Manufacturing Co. v. Goddard, </em>55 U.S. (14 How.) 446, 454, 14 L.Ed. 493 (1852); <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 132 comment a (\u201c[ejxplicit incorporation by reference is unnecessary,\u201d so long as evidence of connection between writings is \u201cclear and convincing\u201d). Here the Agreement explicitly refers to the specific Note and Mortgage at issue; the Note makes clear that a home mortgage is held as security for payment; and the Mortgage states that Rolfe\u2019s house secures a $70,000 note. Moreover, the Rolfes signed the Mortgage. For Statute of Frauds purposes, only one of several writings need be signed if \u201cthe writings in the circumstances clearly indicate that they relate to the same transaction.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 132. Appellants point out that the Note is undated and the Mortgage refers to a \u201cnote of even date.\u201d But in the context of this record that fact creates no ambiguity or uncertainty and will result in no injustice when the mortgage is enforced. <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 131. The Statute of Frauds is not the tax code. <em>See 2 </em>A. Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 498 (1950) (\u201cwe should always be satisfied with \u2018some note or memorandum\u2019 that is adequate, when considered with the admitted facts, the surrounding circumstances, and all explanatory and corroborative and rebutting evidence, to convince the court that there is no serious possibility of consummating a fraud by enforcement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Third, appellants claim that the transaction violates Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 140, \u00a7 90B:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">If any note secured by such a mortgage and any such mortgage does not, among its provisions, specify as separate items the principal sum, the rate of interest or its equivalent in money, the period of the loan and the periodic due dates, if any, of principal and interest, the lender shall have no right to collect interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Appellants concede that the Mortgage states (1) \u201cthe principal sum,\u201d (2) \u201cthe rate of interest or its equivalent in money,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe period of the loan.\u201d They argue that it does not state the \u201cperiodic due dates ... of principal and interest,\u201d because, instead of explicitly setting those items forth, the Mortgage provides that the principal and interest are \u201cpayable as provided in one note of even date.\u201d In our view, given the commercial context, the fact that both parties were represented by counsel, and the fact that one document\u2014 the Agreement \u2014 contains the text of both the Note and the Mortgage, this language is sufficient. As far as the record indicates, by referring to the provisions in the Note, the Mortgage referred as adequately to the relevant terms as if they had been spelled out on an appended page of the Mortgage. Although \u00a7 90B may be strictly construed, the Supreme Judicial Court suggests that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the section will not be interpreted in an overly technical fashion where doing so would work a gross injustice. <em>Cf. Remy v. Sher, </em>346 Mass. 471, 194 N.E.2d 106 (1963) (five year note that lists total interest as $2,356.80 adequately states \u201crate of interest or its equivalent in money\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Fourth, appellants seek attorney\u2019s fees for a claimed violation of Mass.Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 90A &amp; 90D. Section 90A limits the interest that may be charged on a loan secured by a second mortgage on a home. If it is interpreted as Dean Huber of the Boston College Law School suggests, there may have been no significant violation, for he argues that under \u00a7 90A:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">Maximum interest rates are limited to <em>IV2 </em>per cent per month on the unpaid balance of the loan; further interest limited to 1 per cent per month can be charged when default occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Huber, <em>Security and Mortgages, </em>7 Ann.Survey Mass.L. 88, 94 (1960). On the other hand, appellants in this suit would interpret the statute differently and they have made a host of complicated arguments in support. The answers to those arguments are not obvious; indeed, Professor Scott has cited this statute as an example of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ-\">a structure of categories, exceptions, and rates and methods of computation that surpasses (or at least does not repay the effort required for) understanding....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH\">Scott, <em>The Patchwork Quilt: State and Federal Roles in Bank Regulation, </em>32 Stan.L. Rev. 687, 713 &amp; n. 162 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We need not decide the substantive question raised, however, for the statute, as far as relevant here, provides only two remedies: (1) reformation of the interest to 18 per cent per year; and (2) attorney\u2019s fees. Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 140, \u00a7 90D. The district court reformed or interpreted the documents to eliminate the possibility of an \u201covercharge,\u201d and appellees do not now seek to collect any interest in excess of \u00a7 90A limits. Further, given the inconsequential role that any alleged \u00a7 90A \u201covercharge\u201d has played in this lawsuit, we suspect that the only \u201creasonable\u201d \u00a7 90D attorney\u2019s fee in this case would be none. For these reasons, we believe it fair to hold appellants strictly to our rule of \u201cwaiver.\u201d Although they sought attorney\u2019s fees under a different statute, they did not seek attorney\u2019s fees <em>under \u00a7 90D </em>from the court below. And the relevant circumstances and arguments under the different statutes are quite different. Had they sought \u00a7 90D attorney\u2019s fees below, the bankruptcy judge would have focused more precisely on whether \u00a7 90A had been violated, and if he had found a violation, he would have decided what fee would be reasonable. To prolong these proceedings further in order to allow such consideration now would be unfair to appellees. In these circumstances, we shall not consider appellants\u2019 \u00a7 90D contention, raised for the first time on this appeal. <em>Johnston v. Holiday Inns, Inc., </em>595 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
