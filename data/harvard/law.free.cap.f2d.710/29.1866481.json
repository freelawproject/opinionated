Gilroy Daly, then <em>Judge, </em>now <em>Chief Judge, </em>ruling that the court has personal jurisdiction over the Commissioners in their individual capacities pursuant to Connecticut\u2019s long-arm statute, Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-59b(a)(2) (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commissioners contend that \u00a7 52-59b(a)(2) conferred jurisdiction over them only in their official capacities. We agree and, accordingly, vacate the order and remand to the district court for consideration of other possible bases for jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b120-16\">The present action concerns the procedures followed by the Commission\u2019s hearing examiners in conducting disciplinary hearings at the Federal Correctional Institution at Danbury, Connecticut (\u201cFCI Danbury\u201d), with respect to inmates who had been granted parole but had not yet been released. In a series of six or more lawsuits between 1974 and 1978, the district court in Connecticut ruled that proceedings in which the Commission had determined whether to rescind a grant of parole had not been conducted in accordance with fundamental notions of due process, and ruled that the grantee should be allowed, for example, to have prior notice of the charges against him, to call witnesses, to confront and cross-examine his accusers, and to have the assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>nevertheless persisted in following its discredited procedures, and did not appeal until <em>Drayton v. McCall, </em>445 F.Supp. 305 (D.Conn.1978), in which this Court described the procedures as \u201cfatally deficient.\u201d 584 F.2d 1208, 1221 (2d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">This action was commenced in 1978 by plaintiffs Theodore Green and Daniel Porter, who were then inmates at FCI Danbury and whose parole grants had been rescinded by the Commission, allegedly pursuant to its judicially disapproved procedures, resulting in delays in the releases of Green and Porter of 68 days and 372 days, respectively. The complaint, filed as a class action, seeks (1) a writ of mandamus compelling the Commission and the Commissioners to cease violating the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs and others similarly situated, and to take certain affirmative steps to protect those rights, (2) a declaratory judgment that regulations followed by the Commission, to wit, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.34, 42 Fed. Reg. 39,817 (1977), are unconstitutional, and (3) compensatory and punitive damages from the Commissioners in their individual capacities, in accordance with <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Process was served on the Commissioners by certified mail at their offices in Washington, D.C., apparently pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e) (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of the Commissioners maintained a personal or official residence in Connecticut, and there is no indication that they entered Connecticut to perform any of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">In answering the complaint in 1978, the Commissioners asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court lacked jurisdiction over them except in their official capacities. In 1981, they moved for a preliminary determination of their defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue as to the claims against them in their individual capacities. Relying on <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>444 U.S. 527, 100 S.Ct. 774, 63 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980), the Commissioners contended that \u00a7 1391(e) allows nationwide service of process and expanded venue only with respect to 'claims against federal officials in their official capacities, and not with respect to damages claims against them in their individual capacities. In response to this motion, plaintiffs moved for, and were granted, permission to serve process on the Commissioners pursuant to the Connecticut long-arm statute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-59b.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The Commissioners\u2019 jurisdictional motion was referred to Magistrate Thomas P. Smith, who recommended that the motion be denied on the ground that the district court had jurisdiction over the defendants in their individual capacities under Conn. GemStat. \u00a7 52-59b(a)(2). That section provides for jurisdiction over a nonresident who commits a tortious act within the state through an agent. In reaching this conclusion the magistrate viewed the hearing examiners who conducted the parole rescission hearings at FCI Danbury as the agents of the Commissioners for purposes of the long-arm provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">Title 28, U.S.C. \u00a7 4203 indicates that hearing examiners are subordinates who act with the Commissioners\u2019 knowledge and consent, and for their benefit. Without the former, the latter would simply be unable to discharge their statutory duties. Examiners, moreover, do not appear to possess rulemaking authority, but must follow instructions given by the Commissioners, who alone are empowered to render decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">There is direct evidence in this case that the hearing examiners at FCI Dan-bury were aware of this and, therefore, despite knowledge of case law by federal courts in this district, instead followed contrary instructions given by the defendants .... In doing so, it hardly can be said they were acting in behalf of the government and that \u201c[ojnly the United States government acting in the <em>public interest </em>stood to benefit.\u201d <em>Compare Marsh v. Kitchen, </em>480 F.2d 1270, 1273 (2d Cir.1973) (Emphasis Added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Magistrate\u2019s Ruling dated Jan. 4, 1982 (\u201cMagistrate\u2019s Ruling\u201d), at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">Over the Commissioners\u2019 objections, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation. The court certified the question of the applicability of \u00a7 52-59b(a)(2) for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">Subsection (2) of Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-59b(a), which is set out in full in note 5 <em>supra, </em>provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nonresident individual .. . who . . . through an agent ... (2) commits a tortious act within the state....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">The question before us is whether the applicability of this provision to a claim against a government official in his individual capacity depends upon the agent\u2019s having represented the defendant in his individual capacity rather than his official capacity. We hold that it does so depend and that in the present case that requirement has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">Although this question apparently has not previously been decided by the courts of Connecticut, we are aided by the fact that the Connecticut long-arm statute was patterned after N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law (\u201cCPLR\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u00a7 302(a) (McKinney 1972).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Bross Utilities Service Corp. v. Aboubshait, </em>489 F.Supp. 1366, 1374 n. 39 (D.Conn.), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>646 F.2d 559 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Gandolfo v. Alford, </em>31 Conn.Supp. 417, 333 A.2d 65 (Super.Ct.1975). Thus, \u201cNew York decisions are especially useful and relevant in construing General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b.... \u201d <em>Id., </em>333 A.2d at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nondomiciliary ... who ... through an agent ... 2. commits a tor-tious act within the state ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Under New York law it is established that this subsection does not provide jurisdiction over a defendant in his individual capacity based on an agent\u2019s tortious act within the state unless the agent was representing the defendant in his individual capacity. <em>See, e.g., Grove Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Angleton, </em>649 F.2d 121, 122-23 (2d Cir.1981), discussed in greater detail below; <em>Unicon Management Corp. v. Koppers Co., </em>250 F.Supp. 850, 853 (S.D.N.Y.) (no jurisdiction over individual defendants since agents acted as agents of corporation rather than of defendant corporate employees), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>366 F.2d 199 (2d Cir.1966); <em>Mandaglio v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters, </em>528 F.Supp. 468, 471 (E.D.N.Y.1981) (to same effect in dismissing claim against union official in his individual capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In <em>Grove Press, Inc. v. Angleton, supra, </em>the plaintiffs sued the Central Intelligence Agency (\u201cCIA\u201d) and eight former CIA officials, complaining of surveillance in violation of their constitutional rights and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, a writ of mandamus against the CIA, and money damages from the individual defendants. See Grove Press, Inc. <em>v. CIA, </em>608 F.2d 926, 927 (2d Cir.1979), in which, in an earlier appeal in the same case, we reversed an order sustaining jurisdiction over individual defendants under \u00a7 1391(e) and remanded for consideration of applicability of the New York long-arm statute. On remand the district court upheld jurisdiction on the basis of CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(2) on the ground that CIA personnel in New York had acted as agents of the defendant CIA officials. We reversed because the district court had \u201cfound nothing to suggest that these appellants expected to benefit as individuals from the wrongdoing alleged in the complaint.\u201d 649 F.2d at 122-23. We noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">[s]o far as the record discloses, these individuals ... were simply United States employees acting as agents for the United States government. More than this was required to make a prima facie showing that they were appellants\u2019 personal agents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 123. <em>Accord Marsh v. Kitchen, </em>480 F.2d 1270, 1273 (2d Cir.1973) (in executing warrant for plaintiff\u2019s arrest, Secret Service agents located in New York and acting on instructions of appellees, who were a Missouri Secret Service agent and an Assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, were not acting as their agents: \u201c[ajppellees did not stand to benefit from the arrest of Marsh\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">In accordance with these constructions of CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(2), we interpret Conn.Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-59b(a)(2) similarly as not providing jurisdiction over defendants in their individual capacities on the basis of tortious acts of agents within Connecticut unless the agents represented the defendants in their individual, as contrasted with their official, capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">In the present ease, plaintiffs have failed to make a prima facie showing, <em>see, e.g., Marine Midland Bank, N.A. v. Miller, </em>664 F.2d 899, 904 (2d Cir.1981), that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Commission\u2019s hearing examiners at FCI Danbury represented the Commissioners as individuals. In suggesting that plaintiffs had met their burden of establishing jurisdiction, the magistrate relied on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4203 (1976), which permitted the Commissioners (1) to delegate to hearing examiners the power to conduct hearings and make parole rescission recommendations, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4203(c)(2), and (2) to promulgate the regulations under which the hearing examiners conducted the rescission hearings and allegedly deprived plaintiffs of procedural due process, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 4203(a)(1). The magistrate concluded that absent this authority to delegate, the Commissioners \u201cwould simply [have been] unable to discharge their statutory duties.\u201d Magistrate\u2019s Ruling at 19. We agree with this assessment of the Commissioners\u2019 operational needs, but the suggestion that these requirements implicate the Commissioners as individuals does not logically follow. Although the Commissioners benefited from the hearing officers\u2019 actions, there is no basis for inferring that they benefited, or sought to benefit, in their individual capacities rather than their official capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Nor do we find pertinent either the magistrate\u2019s observation that the interest of the government does not benefit from the performance of acts that are unconstitutional, or the plaintiffs\u2019 emphasis on the importance of <em>Bivens </em>-type actions as a means of vindicating constitutional rights. We agree that it is not in the interest of the government or the public to have their goals pursued in an unconstitutional manner; but this does not mean either that in proceeding in such a manner an official is pursuing his own individual interests, <em>see Grove Press, Inc. v. Angleton, supra, </em>or that the existence of in personam jurisdiction can be inferred simply from the potential for personal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the order of the district court upholding jurisdiction on the basis of \u00a7 52-59b(a)(2) and remand for consideration of other possible bases of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-11\">. George J. Reed, named as a defendant in the caption, had retired from the Commission at the time service of the complaint was first attempted and apparently has not appeared in the action, although he was not expressly excluded from those in whose behalf this appeal was undertaken. We note also that since this action was commenced, several other defendants have also retired and are no longer members of the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-18\">. <em>See Williams v. United States Board of Parole, </em>383 F.Supp. 402, 405 (D.Conn. 1974); <em>Green v. Nelson, </em>442 F.Supp. 1047, 1058-59 (D.Conn.1977), and cases cited therein; <em>Drayton v. McCall, </em>445 F.Supp. 305, 311 (D.Conn.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>rev\u2019d, </em>584 F.2d 1208 (2d Cir.1978). In <em>Drayton v. McCall, </em>this Court rejected the Commission\u2019s argument that a parole grantee is not entitled to any due process procedural protection prior to rescission of a grant of parole, and we concluded that the procedures followed had denied Drayton due process. We reversed the district court\u2019s outright grant of parole, however, because we rejected the court\u2019s view that due process in rescission hearings required the entire panoply of safeguards set forth in <em>Morris-sey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), and <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973), and we remanded for entry of a conditional order, granting parole to Drayton in the event the Commission persisted in its refusal to follow the procedures we identified as required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">(e) A civil action in which a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of legal authority, or an agency of the United States, or the United States, may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought in any judicial district in which (1) a defendant in the action resides, or (2) the cause of action arose, or (3) any real property involved in the action is situated, or (4) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.

Plaintiffs did not concede the correctness of the Commissioners\u2019 interpretation of <em>Stafford v. Briggs, </em>and on this appeal they contend that since \u00a7 1391(e) provides jurisdiction over an official in his official capacity, it provides pendent jurisdiction over him in his individual capacity. We find\u2019 this argument meritless. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>Driver v. Helms, </em>577 F.2d 147 (1st Cir.1978), as here, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and in-junctive relief against the defendants in their official capacities as well as money damages against them in their individual capacities. The court of appeals\u2019 decision upholding jurisdiction of the latter claims under \u00a7 1391(e) was reversed by the Supreme Court in <em>Stafford v.
