The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment for the university based on a general release signed by Pil\u00f3n of all claims against the university. Pil\u00f3n appeals from the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Pil\u00f3n was a graduate student at the University of Minnesota. In June 1977 she instituted a civil action in Hennepin County District Court against the university and others alleging that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her sex and age when she was denied a Ph.D. in Educational Administration. In December 1980 a settlement was reached in which the university agreed to pay Pil\u00f3n $1,500.00 and Pil\u00f3n agreed to execute a general release of all of her claims against the university and the other defendants. On March 17, 1981, Pil\u00f3n signed a general release which had been prepared in part by her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In May 1981, two months after signing the release, Pil\u00f3n filed a claim form pursuant to a consent decree entered into in <em>Rajender v. University of Minnesota, </em>Civ. No. 4-73-435 (D.Minn.). Pil\u00f3n alleged in the claim form that between 1975 and 1980 she had applied for six faculty positions at the university and had been denied each position on the basis of her sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The university moved for summary judgment based on Pilon\u2019s general release of all claims against the university. On October 30, 1981, oral argument was held on the university\u2019s motion before special masters appointed by the federal district court pursuant to the <em>Rajender </em>consent decree. The special masters recommended that the district court enter summary judgment in favor of the university based on the general release. The district court adopted the special masters\u2019 proposed order granting summary judgment for the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The general release executed by Pil\u00f3n stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">Elaine Pil\u00f3n, on behalf of herself, her heirs, successors or assigns, agreed to and does hereby release acquit and forever discharge the University of Minnesota, the Regents, the employees of the University of Minnesota, and, specifically, the individuals named in this action, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, from any and all manner of action or actions, suits, claims, damages, judgments, levies, and executions, whether known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, fixed or contingent, direct or indirect, which Elaine Pi-Ion ever had, has or ever can, shall or may have or claim to have against these parties from any act or thing occurring prior to the date of the execution of this document and without limiting the generality of the foregoing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">To any and all claims which may have been asserted in a certain action pending in Hennepin County District Court entitled <em>Elaine Joyce Pilon vs. The Regents of the University of Minnesota, et al, </em>File No. 736923.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">The parties do not dispute the fact that the release is worded to clearly and unambiguously release all Pilon\u2019s claims against the university. Pil\u00f3n contends that she did not intend the release to extinguish her <em>Rajen-der </em>claim and that in fact she informed her attorney that she wished to reserve this claim. Pil\u00f3n argues that she did not knowingly and voluntarily waive her Title VII claim and therefore this action is not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">In support of her position, Pil\u00f3n cites <em>Cox v. Allied Chemical Corp., </em>538 F.2d 1094 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1051, 98 S.Ct. 903, 54 L.Ed.2d 804 (1978) in which the Fifth Circuit held that a relinquishment of Title VII rights must be voluntary and knowing. The court in <em>Cox </em>held that mere signature of a waiver form was \u201cinsufficient to establish a knowing, voluntary relinquishment of Title VII rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1098. We find <em>Cox </em>distinguishable on its facts. First, the wording of the release in the present case is clear and leaves no doubt that all claims potentially held by Pil\u00f3n are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>waived. Second, counsel informed this court at oral argument that the employees in <em>Cox </em>were not advised by counsel before they signed the agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pil\u00f3n, on the other hand, was represented by her attorney throughout the negotiation of the settlement. Additionally, the release signed by Pil\u00f3n was negotiated by the parties. Counsel on both sides agreed to the language to be included in the release, and therefore the parties are assumed to be fully cognizant of the terms of the agreement. In <em>Cox, </em>the agreement signed by the employees was not a negotiated contract agreement but rather, was a standard EEOC form.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">We are not convinced that the Fifth Circuit, if confronted with the facts in the present case would rule as it did in <em>Cox. </em>Nevertheless, we decline to adopt the rule asserted by Pil\u00f3n that even where a waiver of Title VII rights is unambiguous, a court must inquire into the voluntariness of the employee\u2019s consent. If fraud or duress were claimed, Pil\u00f3n would of course be entitled to show by evidence that she had not voluntarily signed the release, however clear and unambiguous its language; here, however, her claim at most is merely that her lawyer improperly advised her as to the legal effect of the words of the release. The general release signed by Pil\u00f3n clearly bars the present action. We accordingly, affirm the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment for the university.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-14\">. The Honorable Miles W.
