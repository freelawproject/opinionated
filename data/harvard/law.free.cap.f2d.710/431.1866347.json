The principal question presented is whether the District Court so far injected itself into the trial as to give the jury the impression that it favored the prosecution, thus depriving defendants of a fair trial. Although this is by no means a case of actual bias on the part of the trial judge, our review of the record constrains us to hold that his repeated remarks in the presence of the jury, culminating in a reference to his \u201chelping the Government to try its case,\u201d prevented the defendants from having their guilt or innocence determined in a proceeding free of a fatal appearance of unfairness. We therefore, in the exercise of our supervisory power over the administration of criminal justice in this Circuit, reverse the judgments of conviction and remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-22\">This case was originally submitted to a panel of this Court, and an opinion was filed affirming the convictions, one judge dissenting. <em>United States v. Singer, </em>687 F.2d 1135 (8th Cir.1982). We adopt the statement of facts contained in part I of the panel opinion. We also adopt parts III and IV of the panel opinion. Specifically, we agree with the panel that the grounds urged by appellants in support of reversal (apart from the question of the District Court\u2019s conduct of the trial) are without merit. The panel\u2019s unanimous decision rejecting each of these grounds is adopted and reaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-23\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-24\">This case was tried before a jury from December 8,1980, to December 18,1980. It was a complex multi-defendant trial, with each of the six<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defendants who went to trial retaining his own lawyer. An Assistant United States Attorney tried the case on the government side alone. The District Court early became dissatisfied with the conduct of the government\u2019s case. On December 10, the third day of the trial, the court summoned the United States Attorney to a conference in chambers. The conference began as follows (Tr. 311):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-25\">THE COURT: You may recognize an array of faces as being the cream of the crop of the Criminal Bar of the State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Minnesota, most of them specializing in Federal practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">Yesterday I wrote a note which was delivered to Mr. Berg [the United States Attorney] which said I thought he ought to have a backup man for [the Assistant United States Attorney trying the case] in Court here. It\u2019s Christmastime, it\u2019s the beginning of winter, it\u2019s the flu time, and I thought we don\u2019t want this case delayed because we lost somebody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">Now I could go on to give you some other reasons why I thought you should have a backup man. But can\u2019t you assign somebody up here this morning to start with us?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Mr. Berg declined. The District Court then ordered the United States to send another Assistant United States Attorney \u201cto second-chair this man. That\u2019s an order. And we\u2019ll wait until he comes, before we go on with the case.... And if he is not here by noon, I will dismiss the case\u201d (Tr. 312-13). The United States Attorney asked for a recess to consider the matter, following which the judge relented and agreed to allow the trial to proceed without additional counsel on the prosecution side. The court warned that \u201cI am not going to try the Government\u2019s case for it, <em>like I\u2019ve been doing up to this time </em>\u201d (Tr. 317) (emphasis ours).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The trial judge nevertheless continued to help government counsel in the presence of the jury. As the trial continued, the court helped the government again and again. The judge admonished the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">You\u2019ve just about got that question so that it\u2019s unintelligible because it\u2019s about four questions in one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">What do you want him to say?, did he look at the stuff coming back from Minnesota? (Tr. 1057).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">He instructed him on when, how, and on what grounds to object.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">THE COURT: ... [W]hat are you doing there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I was just considering making an objection, objecting on the grounds of lack of relevance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">THE COURT: Well, that\u2019s a good thought. You are still here, however, aren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-15\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: Yes, I am, Your Honor, I am objecting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-16\">THE COURT: Have you thought anything about repetitiveness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-17\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I object also on the grounds of repetitiveness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-18\">THE COURT: All right. Now when you come to a specific question, you make the objection and let me rule on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-19\">The question has been asked and answered now, but you might be just a little more aggressive here \u2014 or we\u2019ll be here for a month (Tr. 630-31).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-20\">The judge was concerned that government counsel elicit testimony properly and avoid objections. \u201cJust a minute. Lay a little more foundation than that. \u2018Was there a time when another person came?\u2019 That\u2019s the way you do that, you see?\u201d (Tr. 677). He directed government counsel when to end questioning (Tr. 789), and, apparently exasperated over the inability of government counsel to examine a witness properly, he took over the questioning himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-21\">REDIRECT EXAMINATION:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-22\">[BY GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-23\">Q. You\u2019ve described material you seized as marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-24\">MR. RESNICK: I will object to the reference to it as marijuana because it has not yet been identified as that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-25\">THE COURT: Lay the foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-26\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-27\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-28\">Q. Did you see some material\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-29\">THE COURT: Wait, wait.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-30\">Does he know marijuana from a bale of hay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-31\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-32\">Q. Do you know what marijuana looks like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-33\">A. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>MR. RESNICK: I object to that as lack of proper foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">THE COURT: How does he know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">Q. How do you know what marijuana looks like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">A. Because I\u2019ve come in contact with marijuana on numerous occasions in the course of my duties with .the Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">$ \u00a1js \u00a1}s * sfc sf:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">Q. Could you describe what the substance looked like that you seized?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">THE COURT: Now, let\u2019s talk about what marijuana looks like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">Q. What does marijuana look like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">THE COURT: In a bale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">A. Marijuana in a bale \u2014 just like a hay bale, but it\u2019s wrapped up, usually, in burlap, sometimes in plastic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">MR. RESNICK: I will object to the packaging. He asked what marijuana looks like, Your Honor. Not responsive to the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">THE COURT: I think there is something to that. Let\u2019s look at the material. You know, if you saw a truck riding down the street and it had little windows in it, would you say there were horses in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">A. Yes, I would, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">THE COURT: You would?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-19\">Wouldn\u2019t it take a kind of a little smell to confirm that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-20\">(Laughter.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-21\">A. Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-22\">THE COURT: What does marijuana look like, what does it smell like, what does it feel like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-23\">If you know all of those things, we\u2019ll let you go on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-24\">If you don\u2019t, we\u2019ll send you back to Florida.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-26\">THE COURT: Ask him a question please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-27\">I\u2019ve given you a hint as to what you might ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-28\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-29\">[BY GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-30\">Q. Would you tell the members of the jury what marijuana looks like and smells like, just a physical description?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-31\">THE COURT: One question at a time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-32\">[BY GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-33\">Q. What does marijuana look like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-34\">THE COURT: What color is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-35\">A. Sometimes it\u2019s green, sometimes it\u2019s gold, goldish-tan color, depending on where it comes from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-36\">THE COURT: What is the texture of it? What do the little things look like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-37\">A. It has the texture of a leaf. And the marijuana plant has five leaves on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-38\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: Okay, I\u2019ll go on to the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-39\">THE COURT: Does it have any seeds in it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-40\">[BY GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-41\">Q. Does it have seeds on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-42\">A. Yes, it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-43\">THE COURT: Do the leaves have any little pointees [sic] on them? (Tr. 648-53).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-44\">These examples are only illustrations. The trial court injected itself into the proceedings in a similar fashion on several other occasions. See, <em>e.g., </em>Tr. 677, 1014r-15, 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-45\">Matters came to a head on Monday, December 15, 1980, the sixth day of trial. That morning, government counsel of his own accord corrected a statement he had made earlier to the effect that Izquierdo\u2019s fingerprints had been found on a certain lease application. Counsel for Izquierdo moved for a mistrial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court (properly) found that the prosecutor\u2019s error had been unintentional. When Izquierdo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>lawyer then attempted to press his motion, the court interrupted him (Tr. 974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">THE COURT: Hey, there\u2019s one lawyer up here who I wanted them to get some help for, and they won\u2019t send him any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">MR. RESNICK: Well, that\u2019s not my fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">THE COURT: And he\u2019s just about overwhelmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">Now, Jurors, there is no fingerprint of Mr. Izquierdo on that thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">Mr. Sehermer made a mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">So I think you can put that out of your mind, can\u2019t you, Jurors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">(Jurors nod their heads affirmatively.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">THE COURT: The motion for mistrial is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">The jury is to disregard that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">It didn\u2019t happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-15\">It was a mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">Later that day, during a conference in chambers, the defense again moved for a mistrial, this time on the ground that, because of the court\u2019s remarks earlier that day, \u201cthey\u2019re [the jury] going to feel sorry for this guy [the Assistant United States Attorney], and as a result it\u2019s going to redound to our prejudice\u201d (Tr. 1022-23). The court denied the motion, observing (Tr. 1025- 26):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-18\">I am not letting Sehermer make mistakes. He\u2019s tried to make several of them, and I just must concede that I have straightened him out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-19\">And I asked U.S. Attorney Tom Berg to send somebody up here to help him, and Berg wouldn\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-20\">But the statement I made to the jury about this man being overwhelmed was unfortunate \u2014 but I am going to straighten that out for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-21\">And I will straighten them out on the one mistake which I made, which was to say that Sehermer was overwhelmed; and \u2014 even though it\u2019s true \u2014 I will straighten it out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-22\">The jurors then returned to the courtroom, and the following took place (Tr. 1026- 27):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-24\">THE COURT: Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, I should tell you something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-25\">I made a mistake, and it really probably isn\u2019t even factually true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-26\">When Mr. Sehermer made that mistake where he said the wrong fingerprints were on the exhibit \u2014 he said the fingerprints were from a room that was rented over there, whereas in reality the fingerprints were in what he claims is a drug book \u2014 do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-27\">(The jurors nod affirmatively.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-28\">THE COURT: \u2014that was a mistake he made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-29\">I made a mistake, too, in trying to get this in perspective and set up so that you would understand it, and I said, \u201cWell, Schermer\u2019s busy and he\u2019s overwhelmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-30\">Well, he is not overwhelmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-31\">He represents the Government; and if the Government can\u2019t send enough people up here to do their case right, then they deserve to lose if \u2014 by so doing \u2014 they don\u2019t get the evidence in and make mistakes and mess up the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-32\">So don\u2019t go feeling sorry for Sehermer. He\u2019s tried dozens of cases for the Federal Department of Justice, criminal income-tax cases, he\u2019s tried narcotics cases, he\u2019s done all kinds of things, and he has wonderful credentials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-33\">Sometimes I make him do it my way, but don\u2019t go feeling sorry for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-34\">And I\u2019m sorry I said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-35\">He is not overwhelmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-36\">He is a tiger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-37\">Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-38\">MR. SCHERMER: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-39\">In context, the remark about counsel\u2019s being \u201ca tiger\u201d could not have been taken seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-40\">A few minutes later, the court again interrupted government counsel, this time to keep him from what would apparently have been a breach of an agreement about the proper scope of a witness\u2019s examination. The judge instructed counsel as to how to proceed, addressed the witness directly himself, and then stated to the jury: \u201cNow I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>hope you don\u2019t object to my helping the Government to try its case, Ladies and Gentlemen, and Counsel ... (Tr. 1029).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">We have carefully studied the entire transcript of the trial, amounting to over 1,800 pages, and the passages we have quoted are a fair sampling. To be sure, every intervention by the trial court in the proceedings was not on the side of the government, and some of the comments that the court made may have been helpful to the defense. It is nevertheless true that most of the court\u2019s interventions were designed to clarify government testimony, to help government counsel, to indicate to government counsel when he should or should not make objections, to instruct government counsel on how to make his evidence more intelligible, to suggest to him when he should stop the examination of a witness, to indicate to him what he should write on a blackboard in order to illustrate a point to the jury, and the like. In addition, on numerous occasions the court took over the questioning of government witnesses in order to make sure that the somewhat complicated facts of this case were clearly explained. On the whole, it seems clear to us that the court believed the evidence of the defendants\u2019 guilt was strong, but that the case was a complicated one, and that justice might not be done if government counsel were left to his own devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">While it is a judge\u2019s privilege and duty to take an active part in the trial where necessary to clarify evidence and assist the jury, a judge must studiously avoid one-sidedness. See <em>Quercia v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 470, 53 S.Ct. 698, 699, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933). In the case at hand the jury could well have inferred that the judge was siding with the government. While he undoubtedly thought that by aiding and correcting the government attorney, he was merely redressing the balance between several reputable defense lawyers and one \u201coverwhelmed\u201d government attorney, the obvious effects were 1) to place the defense at a disadvantage in the eyes of the jury by casting the prosecutor in the role of an underdog, <em>United States v. Haley, </em>452 F.2d 391, 396 n. 2 (8th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 978, 92 S.Ct. 1205, 31 L.Ed.2d 253 (1972); <em>United States v. Guglielmini, </em>384 F.2d 602 (2d Cir.1967), and 2) to suggest to the jury that he favored the government\u2019s position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">A few improper comments are not necessarily enough to require reversal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>441 F.2d 1204 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 911, 92 S.Ct. 238, 30 L.Ed.2d 184 (1971). Each case must turn on its own circumstances. Here, the judge injected himself into the trial throughout the entire proceeding. Chief Justice Hughes observed in <em>Quercia v. United States, supra, </em>289 U.S. at 470, 53 S.Ct. at 699, that a judge\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">privilege of comment in order to give appropriate assistance to the jury is too important to be left without safeguards against abuses. The influence of the trial judge on the jury \u201cis necessarily and properly of great weight\u201d and \u201chis lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.\u201d .. , <em>Starr v. United States, </em>153 U.S. 614, 626, 14 S.Ct. 919, 923, 38 L.Ed. 841.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">We have recently had occasion to explain the legal principles applicable in this kind of situation. In <em>United States v. Bland, </em>697 F.2d 262, 265-66 (8th Cir.1983), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ae7-dedup-0\">This Court has always been reluctant to disturb a judgment of conviction by reason of a few isolated, allegedly prejudicial comments of a trial judge. This is particularly true in a long trial. In each case a balancing process must be employed to determine whether the trial judge\u2019s comments have pervaded the overall fairness of the proceedings. We think the balance is adversely tipped against the defendant in a criminal trial where the judge\u2019s role loses its color of neutrality and tends to accentuate and emphasize the prosecution\u2019s case. A trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>judge s isolated questioning to clarify ambiguities is one thing; however, a trial judge cannot assume' the mantle of an advocate and take over the cross-examination for the government to merely emphasize the government\u2019s proof or to question the credibility of the defendant and his witnesses. <em>A judge\u2019s slightest indication that he favors the government\u2019s case can have an immeasurable effect upon a jury. A trial judge should seldom intervene in the questioning of a witness and then only to clarify isolated testimony. A trial court should never assume the burden of direct or cross-examination.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">(Footnotes and citations omitted) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">No two cases are alike, and there are differences between <em>Bland </em>and the case before us. The trial in <em>Bland </em>was much shorter, and there the defendant himself took the witness stand. Here, defendants did not testify, and the trial took a total of ten days, including voir dire, argument, instructions, and jury deliberation. On the other hand, the evidence against the defendant in <em>Bland, </em>was, if anything, even stronger than the case made against the defendants before us on this appeal. In <em>Bland, </em>the charge was possession of an unregistered firearm by a felon, and a police officer actually saw Bland with a sawed-off shotgun in his hands. 697 F.2d at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">We recognize that these are matters of judgment and degree, about which reasonable judges may and do differ. We conclude, however, that what was said in <em>Egan v. United States, </em>287 F. 958, 971 (D.C.Cir. 1923), is apt here: \u201cWhile there is perhaps no single instance involving error so prejudicial as to warrant reversal, we are convinced that, considered as a whole, the rights of defendant[s] were so prejudiced thereby as to deprive [them] of that fair and impartial trial which the Constitution and the law of the land accords to every citizen accused of the commission of crime.\u201d In short, our review of the entire record convinces us that the conduct of this trial fell below the Plimsoll line<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of fairness and the appearance of fairness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Accordingly, the judgments are reversed, and these causes are remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-19\">.

We disagree. In <em>Hasting, </em>a court of appeals had reversed a conviction without considering whether the error it found was harmless, and the Supreme Court did not approve.

This case is reversed because of prejudicial error occurring by reason of the trial court\u2019s comments and excessive questioning of witnesses. Although trial judges may not always agree with the manner in which trial counsel interrogate witnesses or present a case, it is fundamental that the trial judge respect the role of counsel in the adversary process. It is even more fundamental that the judge remember that he or she is not an advocate and notwithstanding the temptation to enter into the adversarial argument, that the judge exercise the utmost restraint to avoid doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Perhaps this is to the disappointment of some judges, however there exists much empirical evidence justifying such a policy of restraint. At stake is the essence of a fair trial and fair judgment of the facts by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>a jury. Once the judge assumes the mantle of an advocate the balance of fair process becomes imbalanced and the proceeding becomes inquisitorial in kind. The fair and respected judge is one who becomes detached from the outcome and allows the chips to fall where they may. Some may disagree with this form of justice \u2014 but experience has taught us that if the adversarial system should survive \u2014 and there is none proven better \u2014 then this is the way it must be. If a trial judge cannot conform to this system, then the administration of justice will continue to require reversals by appellate courts until fair trials with fair procedures prevail.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b528-4\">HENLEY, Senior Circuit Judge, with whom BRIGHT and JOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judges,</author>\n<p id=\"AzT\">join, concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">With so much of the court\u2019s opinion as adopts Parts I, III and IV of the panel opinion, <em>United States v. Singer, </em>687 F.2d 1135 (8th Cir.1982), I agree. But I cannot agree that intervention in the trial by the trial judge was so egregious as to justify reversal of the judgments of conviction. In general, Part II of the panel opinion, 687 F.2d at 1140, sets forth my views on the judicial intervention aspect of the case and I shall elaborate but briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Appellants mount a somewhat dichotomous attack on intervention by the trial judge. They argue that he projected himself to the jury as an advocate of the government\u2019s case and also that he was so critical of government trial counsel as to evoke sympathy for the trial attorney. The court has found facts in support of appellants\u2019 contentions and has accepted the proposed inferences to be drawn from those facts as \u201cobvious\u201d. Yet the court\u2019s reasoning may well be flawed in that it assumes that reaction to mistreatment of the attorney will create sympathy for the attorney\u2019s client rather than resentment and reaction against the trial judge and his alleged favorite, the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">It is to be observed also that the court, unintentionally perhaps, leaves the impression that in coming to judgment it is influenced by the fact that fifteen motions for mistrial, including one on the second day of trial, were made. <em>See </em>note 2, page 434, majority opinion. In a complex multi-de-fendant trial where each of six defendants is represented by separate counsel, it is of small consequence that fifteen motions were made in ten days. In making the first motion counsel for Singer felt that although the court\u2019s intentions may have been good in instructing, as it did, that absent witnesses could be assumed to be favorable to the defendants, the court\u2019s admonition was overstated as it applied to Singer, who is said to have been relying especially upon two missing witnesses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a basis for claiming he was innocently involved in the alleged criminal activity. That motion bears no relationship to the charge that the trial judge unduly was critical of the prosecutor and little, if any, to the charge that the trial judge unduly projected himself into the trial. Indeed, later in the trial the judge again, and without objection, told the jurors they could assume certain persons not present in the court would testify for the defendants. (Tr. 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">More fundamentally, I disagree with the court\u2019s interpretation of the record. It is true that the trial judge intervened actively in the trial of the case. But his actions were not overly partisan and his overall conduct was not oppressive or abusive. Indeed, the atmosphere of the trial seems to have been comparatively relaxed. For example, to enliven a dull morning the judge concluded that a picture speaks \u201cbut not very loud.\u201d (Tr. 735.) At the end of the trial, in sending the jury out laughing the judge admonished the jurors about the need for unanimity and closed by saying: \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to decide this case. You know, if you come up and you can\u2019t decide anything, then somebody else will just be doing it ... and \u2018Old Judge Lord\u2019 will be sitting up here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>giving the same instructions. So you go ahead now and do your duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">It is, of course, impractical here to repeat at length from the transcript or to reproduce completely the atmosphere of the trial. But neither those record materials cited by the court nor anything disclosed by a full reading of the transcript persuades me that the conduct of the trial fell below the Plimsoll line of fairness or polluted the waters of justice. <em>Cf. Mesarosh v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 1, 14, 77 S.Ct. 1, 8, 1 L.Ed.2d 1 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Finally, I sound a warning that as a means of reversal the court may be expanding unwisely its use of supervisory power over the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Concededly judges well may differ, as we do, on interpretation of the record. Yet no one on the court has found a single reversible error and no meritorious objection to the conduct of the trial was voiced until near the end of the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Here, one suspects that the reversals come because of strong disapproval of the conduct of the trial judge and without proper weight to the relevant interests involved. <em>Cf. United States v. Hasting, </em>___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983), in which the Supreme Court most recently had occasion to condemn reversal of convictions under the supervisory power in disregard of the rule of harmless error. While undoubtedly most, perhaps all, of the judges of this court would not approve of the manner in which the trial judge conducted this trial, or at least would have conducted it differently, and while they would send a message loud and clear cautioning against excessive intervention in trials, it is neither necessary nor wise to overturn these convictions under our supervisory power over the administration of justice in the district courts. I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">.
