Gilmore served as Fiscal Director of the Salt Lake Community Action Program (\u201cSLCAP\u201d) from 1974 to 1977. In 1977, the Executive Director of SLCAP reorganized the Fiscal Department, assumed the position of Fiscal Director, and terminated Mr. Gilmore\u2019s employment as a \u201creduction in force.\u201d Mr. Gilmore appealed the termination to the SLCAP Personnel Committee, which sustained the Executive Director\u2019s decision. He then filed this suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>under section 1983<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against SLCAP, its officers, and its trustees. He alleged that the termination was state action that deprived him of a property interest without due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment. He also included a <em>Bivens </em>claim,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging that the termination was federal action that deprived him of a property interest without due process in violation of the fifth amendment. The district court concluded that neither state nor federal action was present and entered judgment for the defendants. Mr. Gilmore challenges this determination on appeal. He claims that governmental action is present because SLCAP is a \u201ccommunity action agency.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">The concept of the community action agency originated in Title II of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 (the \u201cEOA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2781-2837 (1976) (repealed 1981). Through the EOA\u2019s provisions, Congress sought to encourage the creation of community operated agencies that would coordinate federal, state, and private resources to combat poverty at a local level.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress defined the basic structure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>and functions of these agencies and established requisites for federal funding. <em>See </em>EOA \u00a7\u00a7 210-221, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2790-2808. However, Congress left broad discretion to the local communities in the operation of the agencies. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1458, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1964 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2900, 2909.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Congress established a number of requirements of particular relevance to this appeal. It provided that \u201c[a] community action agency shall be a State or political subdivision of a State ... or a combination of such political subdivisions, or a public or private nonprofit agency or organization which has been designated by a State ... . \u201d EOA \u00a7 210(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2790(a). It also specified that \u201c[n]o political subdivision of a State shall be included in the community action program of a community action agency designated under section 2790(a) of this title if the elected or duly appointed governing officials of such political subdivision do not wish to be so included.\u201d EOA \u00a7 210(e), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2790(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Congress set forth specific requirements for the governing board of the community action agencies, providing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">Each board to which this subsection applies shall consist of not more than fifty-one members and shall be so constituted that (1) one-third of the members of the board are elected public officials, or their representatives, except that if the number of elected officials reasonably available and willing to serve is less than one-third of the membership of the board, membership on the board of appointive public officials may be counted in meeting such one-third requirement ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">EOA \u00a7 211(b), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2791(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Regarding the authority of the board, Congress provided,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-12\">The powers of every community action agency governing board shall include the power to appoint persons to senior staff positions, to determine major personnel, fiscal, and program policies, to approve overall program plans and priorities, and to assure compliance with conditions of and approve proposals for financial assistance under this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">EOA \u00a7 211(e), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2791(e). '</p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">SLCAP is a community action agency created pursuant to the EOA. Its avowed purpose is to \u201cprevent and alleviate poverty and its causes.\u201d Articles of Incorporation, Record, vol. 2, at 208, 209. It is eligible for and has received federal funding under the EOA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">SLCAP is organized as a private nonprofit corporation under the laws of Utah,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as permitted by section 210 of the EOA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2790(a). During the period of interest in this suit, its Board of Trustees consisted of thirty members, of whom eleven were apparently public officials,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>meeting the requirements of section 211(b) of the EOA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2791(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The SLCAP Board of Trustees promulgated personnel policies for SLCAP and delegated power over personnel decisions to the Executive Director, as authorized by section 211 of the EOA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2791. Mr. Gilmore claims that both the policies promulgated by the Board and the specific decision by the Executive Director to terminate his employment constitute governmental action because of the extensive government involvement in creating, regulating, funding, and operating SLCAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The Constitution promotes individual liberty by forbidding the government, and the government alone, from engaging in certain activities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 936, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2754, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982); <em>Flagg Brothers, Inc. v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 156, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 1733, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978). Although the pertinent provisions appear uncomplicated, the concept of government action, and the consequent reach of the constitutional proscriptions, has consistently eluded certain definition. <em>See Reitman v. Mulkey, </em>387 U.S. 369, 378, 87 S.Ct. 1627, 1632, 18 L.Ed.2d 830 (1967). Experience has shown that governmental power can be exercised in the absence of an official presence. <em>See Evans v. Newton, </em>382 U.S. 296, 86 S.Ct. 486, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966). Conversely, not all acts by government employees can be justly characterized as governmental action. <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1982).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">The Supreme Court has approached the concept of governmental action flexibly. It has pragmatically examined ostensibly private activities to determine if they constitute governmental action. In this regard, the Court has inquired whether a private party is performing a \u201cpublic function,\u201d <em>see Terry v. Adams, </em>345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152 (1953); <em>Marsh v. Alabama, </em>326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946), or acting under \u201cstate compulsion,\u201d <em>see Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970), whether there is a \u201cnexus,\u201d <em>see Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974); <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961), or \u201cjoint action\u201d between the private party and the government, <em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982); <em>Flagg Brothers v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">These cases, taken together, impart at least two important principles. First, they recognize that power entrusted to the government by the people can ultimately be exercised through nominally private entities, be it through the government\u2019s delegation, compulsion, concerted action, or acquiescence. Second, they provide that when these nominally private parties exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u25a0 governmental power, they shall not exercise it insulated from constitutional constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The problem remains in distinguishing the exercise of governmental power from benign or tangential governmental involvement. This problem is resolved by \u201csifting facts and weighing circumstances\u201d in each case. <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 722, 81 S.Ct. 856, 860, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The appellant asserts that federal action is present in this case because of the extensive federal funding and regulation of SLCAP. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit accepted this argument in <em>Mathis v. Opportunities Industrialization Centers, Inc., </em>545 F.2d 97 (9th Cir.1976). <em>See also Ginn v. Mathews, </em>533 F.2d 477 (9th Cir.1976). However, this result seems questionable in light of subsequent Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Last term, the Supreme Court twice concluded that governmental funding and regulation of an ostensibly private organization, in the absence of other factors, is insufficient to establish governmental action. In <em>Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982), the Court held that state funding and associated regulation of a private school for troubled youths did not render the school\u2019s personnel decisions state action, absent evidence of state influence or control over those decisions. 457 U.S. at 838 n. 6, 102 S.Ct. at 2770 &amp; n. 6. <em>Compare Milonas v. Williams, </em>691 F.2d 931 (10th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1524, 75 L.Ed.2d 947 (1983). In <em>Blum v. Yaretsky, </em>457 U.S. 991, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982), the Court held that state funding and associated regulation of nursing homes was insufficient to establish state action in the nursing homes\u2019 patient care decisions, absent a showing of government involvement in those decisions. 457 U.S. at 1008 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. at 2788-89 &amp; n. 19. In both of these cases, the facts and circumstances suggested that though the private entities were funded and regulated by the government, they did not exercise government power so as to be subject to constitutional constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-14\">Federal involvement in community action agencies is analogous to state involvement in the private school in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and the nursing homes in <em>Blum. </em>Indeed, in describing community action agencies and the provisions of the EOA in a different context, the Supreme Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-15\">Nothing could be plainer than the congressional intent that the local entities here in question have complete control over operations of their own programs with the Federal Government supplying financial aid, advice, and oversight only to assure that federal funds not be diverted to unauthorized purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-16\"><em>United States v. Orleans, </em>425 U.S. 807, 96 S.Ct. 1971, 48 L.Ed.2d 390 (1976) (footnote omitted) (considering the application of the Federal Tort Claims Act to community action agencies). In the instant case, the appellant has shown no federal involvement in SLCAP beyond the provision of financial aid, advice, and associated regulation. There are no substantial allegations that the federal government exercised any meaningful influence or control over SLCAP\u2019s challenged personnel decisions. The facts of this case clearly fall within the ambit of <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and <em>Blum. </em>Accordingly, we find no federal action. <em>Accord Griffith v. Bell-Whitley Community Action Agency, </em>614 F.2d 1102, 1108 (6th Cir.1980); <em>Hines v. Cenla Community Action Committee, Inc., </em>474 F.2d 1052, 1057-58 (5th Cir.1973); <em>Joseph </em>v. <em>Ulster County Community Action Committee, Inc., </em>475 F.Supp. 944, 948 (S.D.N.Y.1979); <em>Kelley v. Action For Boston Community Development, Inc., </em>419 F.Supp. 511, 525-27 (D.Mass.1976).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The appellant also claims that his termination was state action subject to the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In <em>Ginn v. Mathews, </em>533 F.2d 477 (9th Cir.1976), the Ninth Circuit concluded that the community action agency was engaged in state action, citing \u201cabundant evidence\u201d in the record. 533 F.2d at 481. To some extent, <em>Ginn </em>relied on state funding and regulation in finding state action. 533 F.2d at 480-81 &amp; n. 4. As we explained in examining the federal action issue, funding and regulation provide insufficient grounds for finding governmental action. To the extent that <em>Ginn </em>relied on these factors, its result is questionable. But as the appellant notes, other factors in this case suggest grounds for finding state action. In particular, the appellant points to the extensive involvement of public officials in the creation and operation of the community action agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982), provides the appropriate analytical framework for assessing the relevance of involvement by public officials in nominally private activities. In <em>Lugar, </em>the Court considered whether a party who relied on the participation of state officials in a prejudgment attachment of a debtor\u2019s property could be held accountable for the deprivation of a federal right. In finding state action, the Court stated the following two-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab5\">First, the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the state or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state or by a person for whom the state is responsible .... Second, the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. at 2754. We believe that this test is directly applicable in determining whether SLCAP engaged in state action in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Examining the second prong of the test first, we inquire whether SLCAP may fairly be considered a state actor. <em>Lugar </em>states that a person may be a state actor \u201cbecause he is a state official, because he has acted together with or has obtained significant aid from state officials, or because his conduct is otherwise chargeable to the state.\u201d 457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. at 2754. The facts in this case indicate substantial participation and aid by state officials in the creation of SLCAP; Federal law gave the State of Utah the option of establishing community action agencies. EOA \u00a7 210, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2790. In exercising this option, Utah could have designated either a political subdivision or a public or private nonprofit organization to serve as a community action agency. <em>Id. </em>It chose to designate SLCAP, a private nonprofit corporation. Even after this designation, political subdivisions of Utah retained the option to be excluded from any program administered by SLCAP. EOA \u00a7 210(e), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2790(e). Beyond its participation in the creation of the SLCAP, the state is integrally involved in SLCAP\u2019s actual operation. One third of the members of the governing board of SLCAP are local public officials, as required by federal law. EOA \u00a7 211(b), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2791(b). These public officials serve on the board, not in an honorary or figurehead capacity, but rather to offer \u201cservices and assistance\u201d as public officials, <em>see </em>EOA \u00a7 201(a)(5), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2781(a)(5), in combating poverty, a public concern. Given the state\u2019s extensive involvement in the decision to designate a community action agency and to organize it as a private nonprofit corporation, given the veto power of local officials over community action programs, and given the requirement that one third of the board be composed of public officials who serve the board as representatives of government, we conclude that SLCAP can be fairly considered a state actor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Our conclusion that SLCAP is a state actor does not resolve the issue of whether it engaged in state action in the termination of Mr. Gilmore\u2019s employment. <em>Lugar </em>instructs that, in addition, we must determine whether the deprivation of federal rights that Mr. Gilmore alleges resulted from the exercise of a right, privilege, or rule of conduct having its source in state authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Mr. Gilmore claims that he was deprived of his property interest in employment without due process. He claims that SLCAP personnel policies provided inadequate notice and hearing, and that in any event his termination did not comply with the policies SLCAP set forth. Our examination of the facts surrounding these claims reveals no basis for attributing the alleged deprivation to the exercise of rights, privileges, or decisions originating in the state. While we acknowledge that SLCAP is a state actor, we also recognize that not all actions by state actors are state action.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See Lugar, </em>457 U.S. at 927 n. 6, 102 S.Ct. at 2748-49 n. 6. <em>Lugar </em>requires that at a minimum there must be a showing that the deprivation was in some sense attributable to a governmental decision. 457 U.S. at 938 &amp; n. 20, 102 S.Ct. at 2755 &amp; n. 20. <em>See, e.g., Coleman v. Turpen, </em>697 F.2d 1341, 1345 (10th Cir.1982). In this case, the appellant has failed to show that the alleged deprivations resulted from a governmental rule, policy, or decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">It is true that the personnel policies were formulated by a board of trustees partially composed of public officials; indeed, we considered the composition of the board highly relevant in our determination that SLCAP is a state actor. However, this characteristic of the board, standing alone, does not compel an inference that the personnel practices formulated by the board are the product of a state policy or decision. Although the public officials serve on the board as representatives of local govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ment and as advocates of governmental objectives, there are no allegations that they represent or advocate a governmental position on personnel policy. Likewise, there is no indication that the Executive Director\u2019s decision to terminate Mr. Gilmore\u2019s employment in any way reflected a governmental policy or decision. Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant has failed to meet one of the two prongs of the <em>Lugar </em>test, and we hold that there is no state action in this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In conclusion, we hold that SLCAP\u2019s termination of Mr. Gilmore\u2019s employment was not federal action. Federal funding and regulation of SLCAP are insufficient to establish federal action. We also hold that the termination was not state action. While we conclude that SLCAP is a state actor, we find that this personnel decision did not result from any rule, policy, or decision attributable to the state. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-4\">. Section 1983 provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. IV 1980). Section 1983 provides a remedy only for acts \u201cunder color\u201d of state law. However, state action under the fourteenth amendment is a species of action under color of state law. <em>Lugar v. Ed-mondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 935 &amp; n. 18, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2753 &amp; n. 18, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). Hence, the latter need not be separately proved for a cause of action under \u00a7 1983 and the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">. See <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) (providing a cause of action for violation of federal constitutional rights by federal agents).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">. The appellees pose a threshold procedural challenge. The appellees claim that Mr. Gilmore failed to file a notice of appeal within the 30-day time limit prescribed by the federal rules. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4. The district court entered a final judgment on December 30, 1980, and Mr. Gilmore served a \u201cMotion to Vacate Judgment\u201d on January 9, 1981. This application to the court constituted a timely motion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment. It was clearly designated a Rule 59(e) motion, and it called into question the correctness of the judgment on material questions of fact and law. <em>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>684 F.2d 691, 693 (10th Cir.1982). Contrary to the appellees\u2019 contentions, there is no requirement that a motion need raise new issues, facts or law to fall within Rule 59.

Constitutional restrictions that apply to the government alone provide a double-edged protection of individual liberty.

In <em>Polk County, </em>the Supreme Court held that a public defender\u2019s actions, when performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel in a state criminal proceeding, would not support a \u00a7 1983 suit. The Court concluded that the public defender\u2019s employment by the state was insufficient to meet the \u201cunder color of state law\u201d requirement of \u00a7 1983. The Court later noted in <em>Lugar </em>that a public defender\u2019s employment by the state, standing alone, was insufficient to meet the state action requirement of the fourteenth amendment as well. <em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. at 935 n. 18, 102 S.Ct. at 2753-54 n. 18. Indeed, given <em>Lugar\u2019s </em>holding that state action is a species of action under color of state law, this result is ineluctable: an act that is not taken under color of state law cannot be state action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b726-10\">.

It provides no independent cause of action to the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b727-11\">. The Eighth Circuit recently reached a similar conclusion in <em>McVarish v. Mid-Nebraska Community Mental Health Center, </em>696 F.2d 69 (8th Cir.1982). In that case, twelve of the sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>enteen members of the community mental health center\u2019s board of trustees were public officials. The court concluded that \u201c[w]here the government is so closely involved in supervising a given activity, state action exists.\u201d 696 F.2d at 71. We agree with the Eighth Circuit to the extent that we find that SLCAP is a state actor. When public officials serve on a governing board of an institution, there is always some risk that the officials may advance governmental objectives through the institution. When the officials serve on the board to offer service and assistance <em>qua </em>governmental officials, when their presence on the board is a requirement for federal funding, and when the decisions of the board often involve issues of public interest, there exists a substantial risk that governmental objectives can influence institutional action. Accordingly, the institution becomes a state actor even if, as here, the public officials maintain only a minority representation on the governing board. The potential for government influence cannot be directly calibrated to the number of officials on the board; the officials, by virtue of the requirement of their presence and the power of their positions, can exercise influence far in excess of their proportional representation. But unlike the Eighth Circuit, we do not find the presence of public officials on the board sufficient to support a finding of state action. Instead, we adhere to the two-part <em>Lugar </em>test and examine the particular action of the board for the presence of a governmental policy or decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">. It may seem anomalous that not all action by state actors is state action; however, <em>Lugar </em>clearly contemplates this result. In discussing <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>described <em>ante </em>note 10, the Supreme Court stated that \u201calthough state employment is generally sufficient to render the defendant a state actor under our analysis, ... it was \u2018peculiarly difficult\u2019 to detect any action of the State in the circumstances of that case.\u201d <em>Lugar, </em>457 U.S. at 935 n. 18, 102 S.Ct. at 2753 n. 18. <em>Compare Branti v. Finkel, </em>445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1981) (firing of other state employees by a public defender is state action under the fourteenth amendment). The finding that a state actor is not engaged in state action seems most likely to occur when a nominally private party is imputed to be a state actor by participation in an activity with state officials. By establishing a two-part test for state action, <em>Lugar </em>requires not only a characterization of the party as a state actor, but also a finding that the alleged deprivation is related to a governmental objective. In contrast, if the sued party is a state official who purports to act under state authority, his action is conclusively state action. <em>Griffin v. Maryland, </em>378 U.S. 130, 135, 84 S.Ct. 1770, 1772, 12 L.Ed.2d 754 (1964). <em>See Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). <em>Lugar </em>does not overrule these cases. <em>See </em>457 U.S. at 936, 102 S.Ct. at 2754.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b729-15\">.
