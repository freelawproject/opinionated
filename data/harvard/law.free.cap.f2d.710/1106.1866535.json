In the case, <em>sub judice, </em>appellee Jean Hylton\u2019s exercise of this inalienable right was made the basis of an indictment charging her with corruptly endeavoring to intimidate and impede two Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents by filing criminal trespass complaints against them with the local Justice of the Peace and County Attorney in Chambers County, Texas. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since we conclude that Jean Hylton\u2019s actions represented an exercise of the right to petition for a redress of griev-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>anees in its pristine form, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment absolving her from criminal sanction for the exercise of her constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">1. <em>Facts and Course of Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">Jean C. Hylton and her husband, V.R. Hylton, residents of Chambers County, Texas, have a lengthy history of speaking out politically against governmental policies with which they disagree. The Hyltons have argued strenuously against the tax laws of the United States and have feuded with the IRS for several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">The Hyltons and the IRS have had a long standing bitter dispute. Several years ago, the Hyltons recorded a declaration with Chambers County that stated that federal agents were not to trespass upon their property. The IRS received notice from the Hyltons informing them that they were not welcome on the Hyltons\u2019 property. This notice was placed in the IRS file concerning the Hyltons and was readily accessible to the IRS agents. Indeed, the district court noted that the Hyltons had adorned their private property with \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs and that \u201cresponsible officials\u201d were well aware of the Hyltons\u2019 desire to exercise their right to privacy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-24\">In the fall of 1981, the IRS undertook a criminal investigation into the tax activities of the Hyltons\u2019 son, David. Then, in November of 1981, IRS agents intensified their search for the Hyltons\u2019 son. On November 4, IRS Special Agents Michael E. Rentsch and Thomas E. Artru entered the Hylton premises to inquire of the whereabouts of David. The special agents, in total disregard of the \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs and the Hyltons\u2019 previous letters requesting that their privacy rights be respected, proceeded toward the Hyltons\u2019 front door without a warrant, where they were met on the front porch by Jean Hylton. A conversation ensued after which the agents departed. Both the agents and Jean Hylton recorded the conversation, and there is no doubt as to the total content of the conversation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>The next day, Jean Hylton filed a criminal complaint against the IRS agents with Chambers County Attorney Eugene T. Jen-son.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> County Attorney Jenson testified that he filed the criminal informations against the IRS agents since the complaints indeed appeared to allege violations of the Texas criminal trespass statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">On January 20, 1982, a two-count indictment was filed in federal district court against Jean Hylton. The indictment charged Hylton with corruptly endeavoring to impede IRS agents in their official capacity and with obstruction of justice, violations of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1510. Hylton immediately waived her right to a jury trial and filed numerous pretrial motions, including a motion to dismiss on first amendment grounds. The motion was denied, the Government insisted upon a jury trial, and the case was tried before the jury on only one count, the count alleging that Hylton corruptly endeavored to intimidate and impede IRS agents in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>their official capacity by filing her non-fraudulent criminal complaints. After a verdict of guilty was returned by the jury, the district court granted a motion for acquittal, finding Hylton\u2019s conduct to have been protected under the first amendment. This appeal by the Government followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">II. <em>Jurisdiction and Double Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">At the outset, this Court is presented with appellee Hylton\u2019s argument that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal by the Government from the district court\u2019s judgment of acquittal, since the district court\u2019s judgment of acquittal constituted a finding of insufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. Indeed, the district court did enter a \u201cjudgment of acquittal\u201d after the jury returned a verdict of guilty. However, it is abundantly clear that the district court entered this judgment not due to a finding of insufficient evidence, but due to the district court\u2019s determination that Hylton\u2019s conduct was constitutionally protected as a matter of law, even if the Government had demonstrated a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a) with sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">It is well established that the district court\u2019s characterization of its actions does not control the classification of such actions for purposes of determining appellate jurisdiction. See <em>United States v. Kehoe, </em>516 F.2d 78, 82 (5th Cir.1975). Although the district judge characterized his actions as a \u201cjudgment of acquittal,\u201d it is clear that he did not enter the judgment due to a finding of insufficient evidence. As the district court, 558 F.Supp. 872, stated in its memorandum opinion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-7\"><em>Even assuming the evidence to have established beyond any doubt that the defendant acted with the sole purpose of obstructing the investigation of the two IRS agents, </em>the Court finds that the application of the criminal law to the facts and circumstances of this case constitutes an impermissible infringement upon the first amendment right of the defendant to petition the Government for the redress of grievances. Accordingly, <em>even construing the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in a manner supportive of the jury\u2019s verdict, the Court holds that the defendant has committed no offense proscribed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-12\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-13\">This Court would elevate form over substance if it characterized the district court\u2019s actions as a finding of insufficient evidence. We hold that the district court\u2019s judgment, although termed as a judgment of acquittal, was a finding as a matter of law that Hylton\u2019s conduct was constitutionally protected, even assuming that the Government had proved a technical violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a). Certainly, the Government can appeal a district court\u2019s ruling on constitutional protections without running afoul of the double jeopardy clause. If this Court concluded that the district court had reached an erroneous legal conclusion, and we do not so hold, we simply would be required to render judgment on the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. No new trial would be necessary. Hence, this appeal is not barred by the double jeopardy clause, this Court has jurisdiction, and, therefore, we proceed to the merits of the Government\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-14\">III. <em>The Nonfraudulent Complaints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-15\">The Government contends that the trial court erroneously took away from the jury the ultimate issue of the good faith of the defendant after the jury had concluded that Hylton acted in bad faith in filing her complaint against the IRS agents. However, this argument mischaracterizes the district court\u2019s actions. The district court did conclude that Hylton\u2019s motivations in filing the criminal complaints were \u201cquestionable.\u201d Nevertheless, the district court went on to conclude that even if Hylton enjoyed the trouble her complaints may have caused the IRS agents, her conduct still was constitutionally protected since her complaints were not frivolous, but, in fact, were factually accurate. We find no error in the district court\u2019s actions in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-16\">The district court concluded that \u201cthere were no triable issues of fact\u201d with respect to any contention that Hylton\u2019s criminal trespass complaints were frivolous and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>conclusion is unarguably supported by the record. The County Attorney who filed the complaints testified that he filed the complaints since the complaints alleged violations of the Texas criminal trespass statute. The record adequately indicates that Hyl-ton\u2019s complaint was filed upon accurate factual allegations that did constitute a basis for a criminal trespass complaint. Once again, the district court did not circumvent the jury\u2019s finding on good faith, the district court concluded only that the complaints were nonfraudulent, even if Hylton took pleasure in the annoyance her complaints may have caused the IRS agents. Thus, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the complaints were nonfraudu-lent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">IV. <em>The Right to Petition for the Redress of Grievances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">In the Government\u2019s final point of error, the Government contends that the district court erred by concluding that Hylton\u2019s filing of the nonfraudulent complaints was constitutionally protected. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">As the United States Supreme Court has held, the right to petition for redress of grievances is \u201camong the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the bill of rights.\u201d <em>See United Mineworkers of America, District 12 v. Illinois State Bar Association, </em>389 U.S. 217, 88 S.Ct. 353, 356, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967). Inseparable from the guaranteed rights entrenched in the first amendment, the right to petition for re<em>dress </em>of grievances occupies a \u201cpreferred place\u201d in our system of representative government, and enjoys a \u201csanctity and a sanction not permitting dubious intrusions.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Collins, </em>323 U.S. 516, 65 S.Ct. 315, 322, 89 L.Ed. 430 (1945). Indeed, \u201c[i]t was not by accident or coincidence that that rights to freedom in speech and press were coupled in a single guarantee with the rights of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for redress of grievances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323. Moreover, the Supreme Court has held expressly that the first amendment right to petition protects the individuals right to file an action with a \u201creasonable basis\u201d in a state tribunal. <em>Bill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. </em>NLRB, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 103 S.Ct. 2161, 2169, 76 L.Ed.2d 277 (1983).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, we are presented with the issue of whether Hylton may be convicted of violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a) for filing a factually accurate, nonfraudulent criminal complaint against federal agents with the appropriate local law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-14\">Having thoroughly reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s holding, we have concluded that Hylton\u2019s actions represent a legitimate and protected exercise of her right to petition for the redress of grievances. The record clearly reveals that Hylton placed a high value upon her right to personal privacy and genuinely attempted to protect her rights through the orderly pursuit of justice \u2014 the filing of citizen complaints with a reasonable basis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>we do not condone the Hyltons\u2019 continued opposition to this Nation\u2019s tax laws, we likewise cannot condone the imposition of criminal sanction for Hylton\u2019s exercise of her constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">We emphasize that we do not find the provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a) to be in violation of the first amendment in all cases. Certainly, the Government may seek criminal sanction against those who illegally impede the due administration of this Nation\u2019s tax laws. Moreover, were it demonstrated that Hylton\u2019s complaints were frivolous and based upon contrived allegations, a totally different result might follow. However, in the context of this case, we simply cannot disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hylton\u2019s activities were constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Finally, in response to the Government\u2019s contention that Hylton\u2019s activities were not constitutionally protected since her non-fraudulent complaints were motivated by a desire to impede the IRS agents\u2019 investigation, we simply quote from the Seventh Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Stern v. United States Gypsum, Inc., </em>547 F.2d 1329, 1343 (7th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-6\">Likewise, we consider it irrelevant to the applicability of the right to petition that its exercise might have the effect of causing professional injury to the official about whom complaints are made, or even that the complainer may be aware of or pleased by the prospect of such injury. Whenever substantial charges of any credibility are made, a shadow of doubt, at least, may fall upon their object. This effect follows too naturally from its cause for its presence to vitiate the propriety of the use of First Amendment rights, if those rights are to retain meaning. The possibility that a citizen who feels himself to have been abused by a particular federal official may take satisfaction when the official gets his perceived due is too human for First Amendment protection to depend on its absence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\"><em>Accord Bill </em>Johnson's <em>Restaurants v. NLRB, </em>___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 2169.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">V. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">This Court affirms the district court\u2019s holding that Hylton\u2019s conduct constitutes a legitimate exercise of her constitutional right to petition for redress of grievances. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1197-12\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-13\">Whoever corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any threatening letter or communication) endeavors to intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the United States acting in an official capacity under this title, or in any other way corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any threatening letter or communication) obstructs or impedes, or endeavors to obstruct or impede, the due administration of this title, shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both, except that if the offense is committed only by threats of force, the person convicted thereof shall be fined not more than $3,000, or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.

The record reveals that the Hyltons have posted as many as six \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs on their property. Moreover, \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs as large as four feet by six feet have been placed near the entrance to the Hylton\u2019s property. Although the Government contended in its original complaint against Hylton that no \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs were posted at the time of the agents\u2019 entrance, the district court concluded that the evidence \u201coverwhelmingly points to a contrary conclusion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1198-8\">.

City of Chicago, </em>394 U.S. 111, 89 S.Ct. 946, 948, 22 L.Ed.2d 134 (1969) (\u201cShortly after the original Constitution was adopted, again undoubtedly in an attempt to \u2018secure the Blessings of Liberty,\u2019 the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution, in which the first amendment, later made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment, provides that \u2018Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievance.\u2019 \u201d); <em>California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, </em>404 U.S. 508, 92 S.Ct. 609, 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979) (\u201cWe conclude that it would be destructive of rights of association and of petition to hold that groups with common interest may not, without violating the antitrust laws, use the channels and procedures of <em>state </em>and federal agencies and courts to advocate their cases ....\u201d) (emphasis added); and <em>Bigelow v. Virginia, </em>421 U.S. 809, 95 S.Ct. 2222, 2227, 44 L.Ed.2d 600 (1975) (\u201cThe first amendment, of course, is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1201-16\">. Of course, whether the IRS agents conduct was privileged or immunized as a matter of federal law is an issue to be determined in the criminal trespass proceeding against the IRS agents. However, the fact that the agents may have a valid defense does not vitiate Hylton\u2019s right to petition for a redress of grievances in a nonfraudulent complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
