In a 5 to 4 decision the Court held that the entire property may be sold, but that there is a degree of discretion vested in the District Court and certain specified factors to be considered in determining the appropriate action for protection of non-delinquent third parties. In <em>Rodgers </em>the Court remanded for exercise of equitable discretion by the District Court in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">In our opinion the same course should be followed in the case at bar.
