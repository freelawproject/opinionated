Reynolds was convicted on Count II and was sentenced to a four year prison term; he was acquitted on Count III and a mistrial was declared on all remaining counts when the jury was unable to reach verdicts on those counts. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">. This case arises out of the theft of two airplanes, a Cessna 404 Titan Courier and an Aero Commander 500 Shrike, from the Long Beach, California airport, and the use of these planes to import approximately 1,000 pounds of marijuana into the United States from Mexico. Evidence introduced at trial described a series of meetings and transactions that transpired between five primary participants during the period from February to May of 1981. Two of the five persons indicted, William Miller and Gary Baerenwald, entered into plea agreements and testified for the government. Miller testified that he stole the two aircraft and piloted the planes to and from Mexico. Baerenwald testified that he introduced appellants Reynolds and Ramirez, and that he participated in the effort to find planes that could be stolen as well as in the search for suitable \u201cclandestine\u201d airfields in the United States. Robert Peterson, charged with off-loading and delivering shipments of marijuana once they reached the United States, was tried with appellants but was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Ramirez, however, was convicted as the instigator and financier of the criminal scheme. The government\u2019s evidence against Ramirez was designed to show only that Ramirez directed the criminal scheme from behind the scenes. He played a minor role in actually implementing the scheme through the theft of airplanes and the delivery of marijuana. His defense rested on the alleged weakness of the government\u2019s evidence of his connection to the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Reynolds\u2019 part was considerably more complex. Before February of 1981, the approximate time when the charged conspiracy was formed, Reynolds had been working as an informer for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The relationship was not a happy one. Reynolds admits compromising one narcotics investigation by warning the suspect, a friend of Reynolds. Other attempts by the LAPD to set up drug arrests through Reynolds were likewise unsuccessful. Sergeant Fred McNight of the LAPD testified at the trial below that by January 1981, the LAPD had decided that Reynolds was not trustworthy and that he would be regarded as a double agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">One month later, the activities charged in the present indictment commenced. Unlike Ramirez, Reynolds freely admitted at trial that he participated fully in the overt acts taken to implement the goals of the conspiracy. Also between February and June of 1981 Reynolds informed the LAPD of impending meetings so that the police could observe. It is this latter activity that makes this case somewhat unique. Reynolds\u2019 principle defense at trial was that at all times during the admitted criminal scheme he was acting as a police informer and that as such he did not have the specific criminal intent necessary for conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">On appeal, Reynolds and Ramirez both allege instances of reversible error on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>part of the district court, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain their convictions. We shall consider Reynolds\u2019 appeal first.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">APPELLANT REYNOLDS</p>\n<p id=\"AiF\">Reynolds advances six grounds for reversing his conviction for foreign transportation of stolen aircraft (Count II). He contends that the district court erred by: (1) denying a motion to dismiss the indictment for outrageous police misconduct; (2) improperly admitting appellant\u2019s confession into evidence; (3) failing to give jury instructions requested by appellant; (4) denying appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial on grounds of improper jury coercion; (5) refusing to strike \u201cprejudicial surplusage\u201d from the indictment; and (6) failing to direct that he be acquitted on the ground of insufficient evidence to sustain the verdict. We hold that none of the claims of error justifies reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">A. <em>Denial Of Motion To Dismiss Indictment For \u201cOutrageous Police Misconduct\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Appellant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment because of \u201coutrageous police conduct\u201d which the district court took under submission. At the close of testimony appellant renewed the motion and it was denied. Appellant advances two theories to justify dismissal of his indictment. One is that the conduct of the police violated the Due Process Clause. The second, and alternative theory, is that the police conduct justifies an invocation of the inherent supervisory power of the district court to dismiss indictments or take other remedial action. Under both theories the alleged misconduct is that police coerced Reynolds into acting as an informer, played an active role in the resulting criminal enterprise, and then prosecuted Reynolds for doing only what the police had instructed him to do. We reject both of appellant\u2019s theories because the police conduct in this case was within permissible limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">1. <em>Due Process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">The existence of police misconduct that contravenes the constitutional due process is a question of law. <em>United States v. Wylie, </em>625 F.2d 1371, 1378 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1080, 101 S.Ct. 863, 66 L.Ed.2d 84 (1981); <em>United States v. McQuin, </em>612 F.2d 1193, 1196 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 955, 100 S.Ct. 1608, 63 L.Ed.2d 791 (1980). As a defense it is a close relative of entrapment and has been applied where the involvement of undercover agents and informers in contraband offenses reaches \u201csuch proportions as to bar conviction of a predisposed defendant as a matter of due process.\u201d <em>Hampton v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 484, 493, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 1651, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring); <em>see United States v. McQuin, </em>612 F.2d at 1196. An example is where government agents engineer and direct the criminal enterprise from start to finish.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">The due process defense, while potentially broad, has in fact been severely restricted. <em>See United States v. Bagnariol, </em>665 F.2d 877, 881-83 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 962, 102 S.Ct. 2040, 72 L.Ed.2d 487 (1982) (tracing development of the defense both in this circuit and in the Supreme Court). Prosecution is barred \u201conly when the government\u2019s conduct is so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>548 F.2d 782, 789 (9th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 965, 97 S.Ct. 1644, 52 L.Ed.2d 356 (1977). The Supreme Court has never reversed a criminal conviction on this ground. <em>See United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973); <em>Hampton v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 484, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Only twice have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>federal circuit courts done so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In both cases the outrageous misconduct was, in effect, the generation by police of new crimes merely for the sake of pressing criminal charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">That did not happen in this case. The government did not create the crime\u2014 Reynolds and his associates did that. Reynolds informed the agents of the criminal enterprise, but that did not enmesh the government in the criminal activity in an unconstitutional manner. Nonetheless, appellant contends that pervasive misuse of police authority here implicates due process concerns and points to dictum in our cases which suggests that indictments might be dismissed where police conduct constitutes \u201caction <em>malum in se.\u201d See United States v. Gonzales, </em>539 F.2d 1238, 1239-40 (9th Cir.1976). While we do not preclude the possibility that police involvement in crime that falls short of sharing in the creative act might violate the due process clause,- the police conduct here meets constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We acknowledge that the relationship between the police and Reynolds was not shiny-bright. Reynolds asserts that the police illegally bribed and coerced him into working as an informer, with specific instructions to enter into a criminal conspiracy in order to set up a narcotics bust. There is some support for this allegation in the record. In June of 1980,' Sergeant McNight of the LAPD arrested Reynolds, who was then on federal parole, in an unrelated case. Reynolds testified at trial that McNight threatened to report parole violations to Reynolds\u2019 parole officer unless Reynolds agreed to work as a police informant. McNight corroborated this allegation, at least in part, by testifying that he used the fact of Reynolds\u2019 federal parole status as an inducement to get Reynolds to cooperate in future police investigations. Reynolds testified that McNight further encouraged his cooperation by promising to allow him to sell marijuana as part of his undercover activities and to keep the profit. While McNight\u2019s testimony to some degree refutes this allegation, there is evidence in the record that suggests that officers were aware on at least one occasion that Reynolds was selling illegal drugs to William Miller, one of the alleged coconspirators in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Reynolds further contends that though he used his best efforts to set up a narcotics arrest, the police repeatedly lied to him and made phony inducements while all the time intending to arrest him once appellant's usefulness had ended. Again, Reynolds\u2019 contention is not entirely without substantiation. Sergeant McNight testified that the LAPD lost its trust in Reynolds due to several instances where Reynolds compromised ongoing police investigations. Following this the police determined to continue using Reynolds to gain any information possible from him while at the same time to mislead or misdirect him as much as possible. The aura these facts emanate is one familiar to readers of spy novels.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Appellant argues, in effect, that this aura demonstrates that his prosecution is fundamentally unfair, justifying dismissal of the indictment. The government, in rebuttal, cites numerous instances where Reynolds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>while purporting to work as an informer, instead double-crossed the LAPD, compromised ongoing narcotics investigations, and lied to law enforcement officers. The crux of the government\u2019s case is that Reynolds was a \u201cdouble agent\u201d using the cloak of police authority to cover his intention to complete the plane theft and marijuana importation scheme and to leave the LAPD \u201cout in the cold.\u201d The government argues that under these circumstances the police acted within permissible limits when, in order to break up the smuggling operation, they continued to utilize Reynolds and did nothing to remove him from the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We have carefully reviewed the record in this case and hold that it substantiates the district court\u2019s conclusion that police investigatory practices employed here did not violate Reynolds\u2019 due process rights. We have repeatedly held that government agents may use informants and pay them, <em>United States v. Wylie, </em>625 F.2d at 1378, and that, when working undercover, they may in proper circumstances supply contraband to a suspect to gain his confidence, <em>United States v. Gonzales-Benitez, </em>537 F.2d 1051 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 923, 97 S.Ct. 323, 50 L.Ed.2d 291 (1976). Also the government may use artifice and strategem to ferret out criminal activity. <em>See Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 441, 53 S.Ct. 210, 212, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932). Only extreme misconduct constitutes a due process violation. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>539 F.2d at 1240. Here, we do not find the police conduct \u201cso grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>548 F.2d at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">2. <em>Supervisory power.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Reynolds\u2019 appeal to the supervisory power of the federal courts as an alternative ground for dismissal of his indictment is likewise unavailing. The district court declined to exercise its power. The issue is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>691 F.2d 1310, 1322 (9th Cir.1982), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>51 U.S.L.W. 3884 (U.S. June 14, 1983) (No. 82-1944); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>602 F.2d 1073, 1076-77 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 952, 100 S.Ct. 427, 62 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979). We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Supervisory power is commonly viewed as an inherent power to preserve the integrity of the judicial process. <em>United States v. Gonsalves, </em>691 F.2d at 1316 (tracing the development of the supervisory power since it first appeared as an independent basis of decision in <em>McNabb v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943)). In <em>United States v. Owen, </em>580 F.2d 365 (9th Cir.1978), we held explicitly that a federal court is empowered, pursuant to its inherent supervisory power, to dismiss an indictment in appropriate cases on the basis of governmental misconduct. The power, however, has been infrequently utilized, <em>id. </em>at 367; <em>see Hampton v. United States, </em>425 U.S. at 493-95, 96 S.Ct. at 1651-52 (Powell, J., concurring), and a dismissal should be granted only when there is a clear basis in fact and law for doing so, <em>see United States v. Chanen, </em>549 F.2d 1306, 1313 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 825, 98 S.Ct. 72, 54 L.Ed.2d 83 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">In determining whether there was a sound basis for invoking the supervisory power we are guided by <em>United States v. Hasting, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983), where the Supreme Court listed three purposes which may properly underlie use of the power: (1) to implement a remedy for violation of recognized rights; (2) to preserve judicial integrity by ensuring that a conviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before the jury; and (3) as a remedy designed to deter illegal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1978 (citations omitted). Here, we have held that actions on the part of law enforcement officers did not exceed the bounds of permissible investigatory conduct. We need inquire no further. None of the purposes recognized by the Supreme Court would be furthered by the exercise of the supervisory power in the present case. It follows that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to invoke its inherent power to dismiss appellant\u2019s indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>B. <em>Admission Of Appellant\u2019s Confession Was Not Reversible Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Appellant next contends that the government did not lay an adequate foundation regarding appellant\u2019s receipt and waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that certain incriminating statements should have been excluded from evidence. Significantly, appellant did not move to suppress the inculpatory statements either before or during trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(5). Nor does he seriously argue on appeal that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were in fact violated or that the incriminating statements were involuntarily given. Rather, appellant contends merely that admission of his confession was reversible error because the government failed to first make an affirmative showing that he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that the incriminating statements were voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Our recent decision in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>638 F.2d 131 (9th Cir.1981), is controlling. There the defense conceded prior to trial that the defendant\u2019s statements were admissible with the caveat that an attack would be made on their weight or credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 133. Despite this concession defense counsel nonetheless sought to bar admission of defendant\u2019s statements on the ground that the prosecutor had failed to lay an adequate foundation to show that the confession was voluntary. We found that despite appellant\u2019s objection for inadequate foundation, no issue of inadmissibility as a matter of law had been raised at trial. <em>Id. </em>In such cases, \u201cthe only preliminary foundation that need be laid by the prosecutor is that proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given <em>and the elucidated rights were waived.\" Id. </em>(Italics supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Here, the government elicited evidence of Reynolds\u2019 incriminating statements from FBI Special Agent Hawkins. Hawkins testified that appellant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights through the use of a <em>Miranda </em>card. Counsel for appellant objected to further testimony on the ground of \u201clack of foundation as to the <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d The district court overruled the objection, holding that <em>Miranda </em>rights had been adequately established, and agent Hawkins\u2019 testimony was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Appellant is correct when he asserts that the record, at the point of Hawkins\u2019 testimony, shows that appellant had been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights but not that he had waived them. At that point there is no evidence that speaks to the waiver issue. While waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights need not be explicit, <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 1757, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979), \u201c \u2018[presuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible,\u2019 \u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1628, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) <em>(quoting Carnley v. Cochran, </em>369 U.S. 506, 516, 82 S.Ct. 884, 890, 8 L.Ed.2d 70 (1962)). A waiver cannot be presumed simply from the fact that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were <em>given and </em>a confession was eventually obtained. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. at 1628; <em>see North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. at 373, 99 S.Ct. at 1757. Thus, the district court erred when it admitted testimony of inculpatory statements prior to establishing a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The error, however, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Evidence introduced both by the government and by the defense subsequent to Agent Hawkins\u2019 testimony supplements the otherwise inadequate foundation and shows conclusively that appellant did indeed waive his rights under <em>Miranda. </em>Appellant testified that he remembered being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and further that he had responded affirmatively when asked if he wanted to say anything: \u201cI indicated I did. I wanted to clarify this.\u201d Additionally, Sergeant Perry of the San Bernadino Sheriff\u2019s Office, who was present at appellant\u2019s interview, testified during the government\u2019s rebuttal case that he had personally read appellant each of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that appellant stated that he both understood the rights, and was willing to talk about the charges against him. This evidence is adequate to show that appellant\u2019s statements were the product of a knowing and intelligent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. This cured the defect. <em>See Kear v. United States, </em>369 F.2d 78, 83 (9th Cir.1966). The premature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>entry into evidence of appellant\u2019s statements could in no way have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. Consequently, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. </em>Hasting, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1979, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">C. <em>Refusal To Give Requested Jury Instructions Was Not Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Appellant claims that the district court erred in failing to give two jury instructions proposed by the defense, each of which spelled out appellant\u2019s claimed defense that he was working as a police undercover agent at all times during his participation in the crimes charged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both instructions were refused, and appellant contends that such refusal was reversible error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The governing law was stated in <em>United States v. Kaplan, </em>554 F.2d 958 (9th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>434 U.S. 956, 98 S.Ct. 483, 54 L.Ed.2d 315 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">While it is clear that the trial judge must instruct the jury as to the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, the instructions given need not be in the precise language requested by the defendant. The refusal to give a requested instruction is not error \u201cif the charge as a whole adequately covers the theory of the defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Id. at 968 (citations omitted). Here, appellant contends that the jury was not adequately instructed on the legal significance of his theory of defense. Two prior decisions of this court refute this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">First, in <em>United States v. Lee, </em>589 F.2d 980 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 969, 100 S.Ct. 460, 62 L.Ed.2d 382 (1979), the defendant was charged with selling information relating to the national defense. Lee\u2019s theory of defense was that he either was working or believed that he was working for the CIA. The defense requested an instruction requiring the jury to acquit unless convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Lee did not have a reasonable belief that he was working for the CIA.. We held that failure to give the instruction was not error because the district court had instructed on criminal intent. The jury could not convict Lee if they believed his defense because that defense negated the necessary finding of intent. <em>Id. </em>at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>626 F.2d 619 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1065, 101 S.Ct. 793, 66 L.Ed.2d 611 (1980), the theory of defense was that the sale of government property charged in the indictment had been authorized by government agents. The trial court denied a proposed instruction similar to those proposed in <em>Lee, </em>as well as those Reynolds urges here. We again held that intent instructions gave the defendant the opportunity to have his defense considered by the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">Appellant would distinguish <em>Lee </em>and <em>Hughes </em>on the basis that in neither case was there any credible evidence to support the defense theory. Appellant misunderstands the thrust of our decisions. The district court below instructed the jury that the crimes charged required specific intent to convict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the jury had believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>appellant never intended to abandon his role as a police informer, then they could not have found the necessary intent as explained in the district court\u2019s instructions. The district court\u2019s instructions placed appellant\u2019s defense squarely before the jury. Failure to give the proposed defense instructions was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">D. <em>The District Court Did Not Improperly Coerce The Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Appellant next asserts that the district court intruded improperly into the jury\u2019s deliberations. The dispute arose when the jury, after deliberating for approximately twelve hours, returned verdicts as to defendants Peterson and Ramirez and also presented the court with a completed \u201cverdict form\u201d for appellant Reynolds showing that for each count, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. After a conference at side bench the district court had the following response for the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the verdict form returned with respect to Mr. Reynolds is unacceptable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">You are accordingly ordered to return here tomorrow morning at 9:30 to continue deliberation with respect to Mr. Reynolds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">We will be in contact with you sometime after that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">You are ordered to return here at 9:30 tomorrow morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">Appellant moved immediately for a mistrial arguing that the court\u2019s use of the term \u201cunacceptable\u201d could cause the jury to think that they had no choice but to reach a verdict. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Appellant here relies principally on <em>Jenkins v. United States, </em>380 U.S. 445, 85 S.Ct. 1059, 13 L.Ed.2d 957 (1965) (per curiam). There the jury deliberated for only two hours before notifying the court that they were unable to reach a verdict. In the course of his response the trial judge stated: \u201cYou have got to reach a decision in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 85 S.Ct. at 1060. The Supreme Court remanded for a new trial because \u201cin its context and under all the circumstances the judge\u2019s statement had the coercive effect attributed to it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-15\"><em>Jenkins </em>means that the trial court may not insist upon a dispositive verdict. When reviewing allegedly coercive instructions or comments our inquiry is \u201c \u2018whether in its context and under all the circumstances of this case the statement was coercive.\u2019\u201d <em>Marsh v. Cupp, </em>536 F.2d 1287, 1290 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 981, 97 S.Ct. 494, 50 L.Ed.2d 590 (1976) (quoting <em>Jenkins, </em>380 U.S. at 446, 85 S.Ct. at 1060); <em>see Locks v. Sumner, </em>703 F.2d 403, 406-07 (9th Cir.1983). Here, we do not find the same coercive influence that mandated reversal in <em>Jenkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-16\">First, the district court in this case did not tell the jurors that they had to reach a dispositive verdict. <em>See Walsh v. United States, </em>371 F.2d 135, 136 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>388 U.S. 915, 87 S.Ct. 2130, 18 L.Ed.2d 1357 (1967). Nor did the jury understand the court to be insisting on a dis-positive verdict. The jury deliberated for a full day after receiving the court\u2019s admonition. <em>Compare United States v. Beattie, </em>613 F.2d 762, 765 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 982, 100 S.Ct. 2962, 64 L.Ed.2d 838 (1980) (no coercion where jury deliberated for three and one-half hours after <em>Allen </em>charge), with <em>United States v. Contreras, </em>463 F.2d 773 (9th Cir.1972) (coercion found where jury deliberated only 35 minutes after <em>Allen </em>charge). Second, and more important, the jury ultimately reached dispositive verdicts on only two of the seven counts charged against appellant. These two facts show that the district court\u2019s statement did not have a <em>\u201cJenkins </em>\u201d effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-17\">E. <em>Appellant\u2019s Indictment Did Not Contain Prejudicial Surplusage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">Prior to trial appellant moved pursuant to Rule 7(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to have certain language stricken as \u201csurplusage\u201d from his indictment. The purpose of Rule 7(d) is to protect a defendant against prejudicial or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>inflammatory allegations that are neither relevant nor material to the charges. <em>United States v. Poore, </em>594 F.2d 39, 41 (4th Cir.1979). Thus it has been invoked to strike aliases from indictments where the alias was not relevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s identification, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Wilkerson, </em>456 F.2d 57 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>408 U.S. 926, 92 S.Ct. 2507, 33 L.Ed.2d 337 (1972), and to strike prejudicial language describing the nature of a prior felony conviction (carrying a handgun) from an indictment charging defendant with possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon, <em>e.g., United States v. Poore, </em>594 F.2d at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Here, appellant seeks to extend the Rule to traditional language of the indictment, the sole purpose of which is to formally commence the government\u2019s case against a defendant. That is, he seeks to delete the signatural phrase \u201ca true bill,\u201d the names and signatures of the Grand Jury foreperson and the United States Attorney, and the introductory phrase \u201cthe Grand Jury charges.\u201d Appellant contends that this language prejudiced him by telling the jury in effect that a higher jury, the grand jury, has found the facts in the indictment to be true and that the United States Attorney concurs in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention is frivolous. The trial court properly instructed the jury both at the outset and at the completion of the trial that the indictment is not evidence against the accused and affords no inference of guilt or innocence. The refusal to strike did not constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">F. <em>The Evidence Was Sufficient To Sustain The Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal we view the evidence and all inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. Our inquiry is to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found all essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Buras, </em>633 F.2d 1356, 1359 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Reynolds asserts that no rational jury could have found that he had the specific intent required to convict for the transportation of stolen aircraft in foreign commerce (Count II). We disagree. Reynolds admits his participation in the charged offense. His defense is based on the theory of entrapment, and on the assertion that he was at all times operating as an undercover police informer. The evidence, however, including Reynolds\u2019 own confession that he intended to leave the police out in the cold, is fully sufficient for the jury to conclude that Reynolds abandoned his informer\u2019s role and thereafter did have the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">APPELLANT RAMIREZ</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">Appellant Roy Moreno Ramirez was convicted on all seven counts included in the indictment. He advances two grounds for reversal: (1) that he was prejudiced by the joint trial in this case and thus that the district court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion for severance; and (2) that evidence admissible against appellant is insufficient to support his conviction. Neither ground is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">A. <em>Denial Of Motion For Severance Was Not Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">Under Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the district court may order a severance when it appears that a defendant may be significantly prejudiced by a joint trial with his codefendants. Generally, defendants jointly charged are to be jointly tried. <em>United States v. Gay, </em>567 F.2d 916, 919 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 999, 98 S.Ct. 1655, 56 L.Ed.2d 90 (1978); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(b). Whether severance is necessary is within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Gee, </em>695 F.2d 1165, 1169 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">The district court in the present case denied appellant\u2019s pretrial motion for severance as well as two renewals of the motion during the trial. Our task is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>determine \u201cwhether a joint trial was so manifestly prejudicial as to require the trial judge to exercise his discretion in but one way, by ordering a separate trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Abushi, </em>682 F.2d 1289, 1296 (9th Cir.1982). Appellant bears the burden of proving such prejudice. To do this he must show more than that a separate trial would have given him a better chance for acquittal; he must show that the magnitude of the prejudice denied him a fair trial. <em>United States v. Gee, </em>695 F.2d at 1169-70; <em>United States v. Escalante, </em>637 F.2d 1197, 1201 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 856, 101 S.Ct. 154, 66 L.Ed.2d 71 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">In assessing the prejudicial effect of a joint trial, our focus is on \u201cwhether the jury can reasonably be expected to compartmentalize the evidence as it relates to separate defendants in the light of its volume and limited admissibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Brady, </em>579 F.2d 1121, 1128 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1074, 99 S.Ct. 849, 59 L.Ed.2d 41 (1979); <em>accord, United States v. DeRosa, </em>670 F.2d 889, 898 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 353, 74 L.Ed.2d 391 (1982); <em>United States v. Escalante, </em>637 F.2d at 1201. A variety of factors can be relevant to this determination depending upon the facts of the particular case. Hpre, appellant raises three such factors, each of which we now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">1. <em>Antagonistic defenses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Ramirez contends first that his defense, which relied on the insufficiency of the government\u2019s evidence against him, was irreconcilable with the defense of Reynolds, who admitted the acts charged but claimed that he was working as a government informant, and outrageous police conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Reynolds\u2019 reliance on these claims does not, by itself, justify reversal of a trial court\u2019s decision not to sever. Antagonism between defenses is not enough, even if the defendants seek to blame one another. <em>United States v. Brady, </em>579 F.2d at 1128. Rather, it must be shown, on the facts of the individual case, that the defenses \u201care antagonistic to the point of being mutually exclusive.\u201d <em>United States v. Marable, </em>574 F.2d 224, 231 (5th Cir.1978). Only where the acceptance of one party\u2019s defense will preclude the acquittal of the other party does the existence of antagonistic defenses mandate severance. <em>See United States v. Salomon, </em>609 F.2d 1172, 1175 (5th Cir.1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ziperstein, </em>601 F.2d 281, 285 (7th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1031, 100 S.Ct. 701, 62 L.Ed.2d 667 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Here, it is clear that the jury\u2019s acceptance or nonacceptance of Reynolds\u2019 \u201cinformer\u201d defense was largely irrelevant to the determination of Ramirez\u2019 guilt or innocence. Three witnesses \u2014 Reynolds, Miller, and Baerenwald \u2014 testified at trial that they had participated in the criminal enterprise. The question of Ramirez\u2019 guilt depended on the prosecutor\u2019s success in establishing that Ramirez had also participated. Reynolds\u2019 \u201cinformer\u201d defense, even if accepted by the jury, neither relieved the prosecutor of this burden nor ensured his success. Significantly, defendant Peterson like Ramirez relied for his defense on the weakness of the evidence tying him to the charged conspiracy. Despite Reynolds\u2019 allegedly antagonistic defense the jury acquitted Peterson on all counts. Ramirez cannot show mutual exclusivity and, on that ground, has not established prejudice sufficient to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">Ramirez contends that Reynolds\u2019 use of the \u201cinformer\u201d defense severely prejudiced Ramirez even if the defenses were not mutually exclusive. Reynolds testified in his own defense at trial. During cross-examination he repeatedly denied Ramirez\u2019 complicity in the crimes charged. Appellant argues that Reynolds\u2019 attempt to exonerate appellant had the opposite effect. To support this novel argument appellant asserts that Reynolds was so confusing and contradictory that it would be difficult for a jury to compartmentalize the evidence between these two defendants. He also asserts that Reynolds\u2019 testimony enabled the government to introduce otherwise inadmissible hearsay testimony of Sergeant McNight and Officer Perry regarding prior inconsistent statements in which Reynolds had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>named Ramirez as the financier for the marijuana importation scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Reynolds\u2019 testimony, and its impeachment by the government, perhaps reduced Ramirez\u2019 chance for acquittal. That does not demonstrate a need for severance, however. First, the same situation might have occurred at a separate trial of Ramirez; the government could have called Reynolds to testify at Ramirez\u2019 trial with similar consequences had severance been granted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, even if it be assumed that Reynolds would not have testified \u00e1t a separate trial, appellant still falls short of demonstrating abuse of discretion because he has failed to show that the joint trial led to violation of his substantive rights. <em>United States v. Escalante, </em>637 F.2d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">2. <em>Disparity in the weight of evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Appellant\u2019s second theory of prejudice from joint trial relies on <em>United States v. DeRosa, </em>670 F.2d 889 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 353, 74 L.Ed.2d 391 (1982), where we stated that in reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for severance \u201cwe must be wary of situations where a jury might impute the guilt of some defendants to other defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 898 (citation omitted). Appellant asserts that the evidence against Reynolds was so strong that it \u201cspilled over\u201d and caused the jury to find Ramirez guilty by association. That contention is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Although appellant is correct when he states that the evidence of Reynolds\u2019 participation in the events charged was overwhelming, there is little chance that the evidence against Reynolds \u201cspilled over.\u201d The guilt or innocence of Ramirez depends on the government\u2019s success in convincing the jury that it was Ramirez who was financing and directing the criminal enterprise from behind the scene. Proof on that issue is entirely separate from proof that Reynolds committed the specific acts in the indictment. We find no indication that the jury was unable to compartmentalize the evidence and reach their verdict as to Ramirez on a fair evaluation of the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">3. <em>Statements of coconspirators.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">Finally, appellant contends that a joint trial prejudiced him because certain testimony of coconspirators Miller and Baerenwald would not have been admitted at a separate trial because a proper foundation as to the existence of a conspiracy was not established in this trial and would not have been in a separate trial. This is not so. Baerenwald testified to statements made by Ramirez during a meeting between the two. As such, the testimony was admissible as a party-admission. Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A). Miller testified to statements by Reynolds that tended to establish Ramirez\u2019 connection with the conspiracy. This testimony was also admissible against Ramirez, because it related statements by a coconspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy. Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). The record as a whole adequately establishes the foundation required for admission of evidence pursuant to Rule 801(d)(2)(E). <em>See United States v. Brock, </em>667 F.2d 1311, 1315 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1271, 75 L.Ed.2d 493 (1983). It follows that the testimony of Miller and Baerenwald would be admissible against Ramirez at a separate trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">We find that the district court\u2019s failure to sever was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-18\">B. <em>The Evidence Was Sufficient To Sustain The Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-19\">Appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish his connection with the conspiracy alleged in this case. As we have said on other occasions, \u201c[c]onspiracy is established when there is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>agreement between two or more persons to engage in criminal activity, coupled with one or more overt acts in furtherance of the illegal purpose and the requisite intent necessary to commit the underlying substantive offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Abushi, </em>682 F.2d at 1293. Also we have said the conspiracy may be proven by circumstantial evidence; no formal agreement need be shown; and the agreement may be inferred from the acts of the parties. <em>Id. </em>Here, the government\u2019s proof, including the testimony of coconspirators Baerenwald and Miller, was clearly adequate to show the existence of a conspiracy the goal of which was to import marijuana through the use of stolen aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Once the existence of a conspiracy is shown, \u201cevidence establishing beyond a reasonable doubt a connection of a defendant with the conspiracy, even though the <em>connection is slight, </em>is sufficient to convict him with knowing participation in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>564 F.2d 348, 357 (9th Cir.1977) (emphasis in original); <em>see United States v. Kenny, </em>645 F.2d 1323, 1335 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 920, 101 S.Ct. 3059, 69 L.Ed.2d 425 (1981). There was substantial evidence introduced at trial documenting that Ramirez associated with conspirators Reynolds, Baerenwald, and Peterson throughout the period that events <em>in furtherance </em>of the conspiracy took place. More than mere association was established; association to further the conspiracy was also established.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">The indictment charged that it was Ramirez who organized and financed the scheme to import and distribute marijuana from Mexico. The evidence which tends to prove the charge is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">On appeal we view the evidence and all inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. On the basis of the evidence set forth in the margin, we hold that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed as charged in the indictment, and that Ramirez knowingly participated in that conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The convictions of appellant Reynolds on Count II and of appellant Ramirez on Counts I through VII are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">. Both appellants as well as defendant Miller were charged in all seven counts of the indictment. Defendant Peterson was charged in Counts I, V, and VII and defendant Baerenwald was charged in Counts I and II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\">. Baerenwald and Miller entered into plea agreements and testified at appellants\u2019 trial on behalf of the government. Peterson was tried with appellants and acquitted on all counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">. Indeed, Justice Rehnquist, writing the plurality opinion in <em>Hampton, </em>suggests that the Due Process Clause would never prevent the conviction of a predisposed defendant. Because five Justices expressed explicit disagreement with this portion of Justice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion, however, we have held that <em>Hampton </em>\u201cleft open the possibility that the conviction of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>predisposed defendant may be reversed where the government\u2019s involvement in the criminal scheme reaches such an outrageous level as to violate due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzales-Benitez, </em>537 F.2d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>429 U.S. 923, 97 S.Ct. 323, 50 L.Ed.2d 291 (1976); <em>accord United States v. McQuin, </em>612 F.2d at 1196.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">. In <em>United States v. Twigg, </em>588 F.2d 373 (3d Cir.1978), the indictment was dismissed where the government, through an informer, provided the location and all necessary chemicals and equipment for a \u201cspeed\u201d laboratory. The informant was in complete charge of the laboratory; defendant\u2019s assistance was minimal and at the specific direction of the informant. Similarly, in <em>Greene v. United States, </em>454 F.2d 783 (9th Cir.1971), this court reversed conspiracy and bootlegging convictions where government undercover agents helped to reestablish, and then sustain, criminal bootlegging operations that had been shut down by prior criminal convictions. \u201cWe do not believe the Government may involve itself so directly and continuously over such a long period of time in the creation and maintenance of criminal operations, and yet prosecute its collaborators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\">.

Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), for the proposition that Reynolds\u2019 testimony would not have been admitted at a separate trial is misplaced. <em>Bruton </em>held only that the admission of the statements against one defendant violates a codefendant\u2019s right of confrontation where the defendant against whom the statements were introduced failed to testify. <em>See United States v. Salomon, </em>609 F.2d at 1176 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b638-5\">. The prosecution introduced the following evidence at trial to prove that Ramirez was a knowing participant in the criminal conspiracy:</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">a. The first meeting between any of the alleged conspirators was between Baerenwald and Ramirez in February, 1981. Baerenwald testified that Ramirez asked his assistance in locating a pilot and airplane to move some \u201cmerchandise,\u201d which Baerenwald understood to mean marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">b. Two months later, in April 1981, Baeren-wald introduced Reynolds to Ramirez. Ramirez insisted upon speaking to Reynolds alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">c. On April 9, 1981, Reynolds met with William Miller and proposed that Miller steal a Cessna 404 airplane to be delivered to Mexico in exchange for marijuana. Reynolds testified during cross-examination that he told Miller that he was working for Roy Ramirez, though Reynolds denied at trial that he was in fact working for Ramirez. Miller testified that on this occasion Reynolds mentioned the name Roy a few times.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">d. On April 20, 1981, Baerenwald met with Ramirez and received $3,000 from him. Baer-enwald and Reynolds used the money to pay some of their personal bills. Sergeant McNight testified that he was surveilling Baerenwald and observed the transfer of money. Immediately following his meeting with Ramirez, Baer-enwald met Reynolds and together they drove to the Long Beach airport where, according to Baerenwald\u2019s testimony, they examined various twin-engine aircraft \u201cwhich could be used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">e. Also in April, Baerenwald\u2019s testimony shows that he contacted Ramirez in an effort to locate a ground man to unload \u201cmerchandise.\u201d Ramirez introduced Baerenwald to Peterson, whom Ramirez said could possibly fill the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">f. On May 13, after the first airplane theft charged in the indictment, but before the second, Reynolds again met with Ramirez. Sergeant McNight testified that while on surveillance he saw Ramirez pointing out locations on an air chart to Reynolds. Later, on May 17, Sergeant McNight observed a second meeting between Reynolds and Ramirez which lasted approximately 50 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">g. Miller testified that on May 20, he stole a second plane from Long Beach airport. Between May 20, 1981 and May 30, 1981, Reynolds and Miller made three trips to Mexico and each time loaded a shipment of marijuana. Miller testified that Reynolds used the names Roy or Ramirez at various points during these ten days, in conversations both with the men who delivered the shipments of marijuana in Mexico and with the \u201cload man\u201d who received the shipments in the United States. On the third trip from Mexico, on May 30, Miller and Reynolds were forced to make an emergency landing in Mexico. Miller testified that after returning to the United States, leaving the plane in Mexico, Reynolds called Roy Ramirez. Reynolds told Miller that Ramirez would try to recover the airplane so that the load would not be lost.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
