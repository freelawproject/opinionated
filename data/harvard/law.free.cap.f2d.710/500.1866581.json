On September 14, 1981, a complaint was issued alleging that the company had engaged in unfair labor practices in violation of section 8(a)(1) of the Act when it discharged Ray on July 10, 1981, because she engaged in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid and protection of employees. After a hearing, the administrative law judge held that: (1) the charges filed by Ray adequately supported the complaint which was issued, and (2) Ray was discharged because of her protected concerted activity, of which any insubordinate language was a protected part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 30,1982, the Board filed its decision and order affirming the rulings, findings and conclusions of the administrative law judge, and adopting, as modified, the judge\u2019s recommended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">This court must enforce the Board\u2019s order if the Board \u201ccorrectly applied the law and if its findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Mark I Tune-up Centers, </em>691 F.2d 415, 416 (8th Cir.1982). <em>See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). After carefully considering the briefs, arguments, and the entire record in the instant case, we conclude that the Board correctly applied the law and that its findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s order is enforced. <em>See </em>8th Cir.R. 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-11\">. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-22\">. On July 10, 1981, Ray complained to her supervisor about the fact that she and the other non-union office employees were not paid for the July 4, 1981 holiday. During this conversation Ray made a statement to the effect that she was \u201ctired of being lied to.\u201d Shortly thereafter that same day she was fired.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
