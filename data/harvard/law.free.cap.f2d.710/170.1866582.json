WINTER, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"ADq\">Faced with a broad-ranging and intricate constitutional challenge to Maryland\u2019s certification process governing the operation of a private teacher training school, the district court abstained, dismissing the suit. Plaintiffs appeal, contending principally that this suit is not among the various situations in which abstention is warranted. We agree. Plaintiffs also contend that they were entitled to a default judgment. Although we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for default judgment, we reverse the judgment of dismissal and remand to the district court to allow the case to proceed. We do not pass upon plaintiffs\u2019 contention that they are entitled to interim injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">This suit stems from efforts by Lee Hav-is, the owner and executive director of co-plaintiff Educational Services, Inc., to obtain a certificate of approval from the Maryland State Board for Higher Education (Board) for the operation of a post-secondary teacher training school under the name International Montessori Society (IMS).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Havis, who also owns a private tutoring school named Capital Tutoring, Inc., first applied for the Board\u2019s certificate in February, 1980. After extensive administrative review, the Board, on July 2, 1981, affirmed as final the consistent denial of a certificate of approval for operation of the school. Havis thus unsuccessfully exhausted all administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">On September 28, 1981, Havis <em>pro se </em>brought this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, alleging the denial of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights in the Board\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> refusal to certify the IMS. Although couched in language invoking a variety of constitutional provisions, at bottom Havis alleges two principal theories of unconstitutional action. His principal claim is that the certification powers delegated to the Board under \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 <em>et seq., </em>Ann. Code of Maryland, Education (1982 Cum.Supp.), permit the Board unconstrained discretion to deny certification to unconventional or controversial applicants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Havis\u2019s second major contention is that the statutory exemption for religious non-public \u201cnoncollegiate educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tional\u201d institutions found in \u00a7 2-206(e)(4) of the Education Article violates the Establishment Clause because secular non-public schools such as Capital Tutoring remain fully subject to Board certification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">On the basis of these allegations and supporting affidavits, Havis moved for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the certifications laws against him. The Board in turn moved the district court to abstain from the exercise of federal question jurisdiction and to dismiss the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Granting the Board\u2019s motion, the district court first concluded that the federal constitutional questions raised by Havis could be avoided by state court interpretation of the statutes and regulations called into question, and that the interpretation of those statutes and regulations was unsettled. As a consequence, the district court held the abstention doctrine enunciated in <em>Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941) to be applicable. The district court further concluded that any ruling on Hav-is\u2019s claims would amount to federal interference with a complex state regulatory scheme, and therefore invoked the <em>Burford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because it had deemed both <em>Burford </em>and <em>Pullman </em>abstention appropriate, the district court applied the harsher of the two, and dismissed the suit. <em>See </em>17 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Jurisdiction \u00a7 4245 (1978). Havis now appeals from that dismissal and from the denial of his earlier motion for default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">The cases recognize several doctrines of abstention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In considering the propriety of abstention in this case, we note initially that it lacks one predicate common to at least two varieties of that doctrine, the pendency of state judicial proceedings concerning the same matters. Thus, many of the cases relied upon by the district court or cited to us by the Board are inapposite. <em>See, e.g., Cox v. Planning District I Community Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services Board, </em>669 F.2d 940 (4 Cir. 1982); <em>Harris County Commissioners Court v. Moore, </em>420 U.S. 77, 80, 95 S.Ct. 870, 873, 43 L.Ed.2d 32 (1975) (state court action begun but \u201cabandoned\u201d in favor of federal court action); <em>Kelser v. Anne Arundel County Dept. of Social Services, </em>679 F.2d 1092, 1093 (4 Cir.1982) (numerous pending state court custody proceedings); <em>see also Fruchtman v. N.Y. State Bd. of Law Examiners, </em>534 F.Supp. 692, 694-96 (S.D.N.Y.1982) (N.Y. Court of Appeals, though acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>administratively, had referred plaintiff back to bar review board for further proceedings prior to initiation of federal court action). As a consequence, we have only to consider <em>Burford </em>and <em>Pullman </em>abstention, and we turn to them in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><em>Burford </em>Abstention</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The Board urges us to adopt the proposition that, because regulation of nonpublic schools furthers important state educational policies, any case arising from such regulation must be considered as involving the kind of complex state regulatory scheme which merits Burford-type abstention. While we acknowledge the important and sensitive nature of state educational regulation, we do not see abstention as its logical entailment. The Board\u2019s position sweeps too broadly; if followed it would displace federal jurisdiction over all challenges to state educational regulation. As then Chief Judge Swygert of the Seventh Circuit noted in an analogous vein, \u201cThe fact that the alleged denial of constitutional rights is set in the context of the public education system cannot be determinative.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Burford </em>abstention rests on additional concerns beyond the mere presence of an important state administrative regime, concerns not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The salient feature in <em>Burford </em>was that, in addition to extensive state regulation of a field, \u201cthe State had established its own elaborate review system for dealing with the geological complexities of oil and gas fields\u201d by concentrating judicial oversight in specially authorized state courts. <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 815, 96 S.Ct. at 1245. Review by a federal court \u2014 or, indeed, by any unspecialized state court \u2014 of the administrative actions questioned in <em>Burford </em>\u201cwould have had an impermissibly disruptive effect on state policy for the management of those fields.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The premise underlying the <em>Burford </em>doctrine is that the very act of review by a court other than the one purposely made familiar with the particularly complex resource regulation issues involved would upset a carefully crafted and integrated state system. <em>See Alabama Pub. Serv. Comm. v. Southern Railway, </em>341 U.S. 341, 71 S.Ct. 762, 95 L.Ed. 1002 (1951); <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 814-16, 96 S.Ct. at 1244-45; <em>Knudsen Corp. v. Nevada State Dairy Commission, </em>676 F.2d 374, 376-77 (9 Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Here, by contrast, the Maryland state courts do not stand in any special relationship of technical oversight or concentrated review to the educational certification process the way the Texas or Alabama resource review courts did in <em>Burford </em>and <em>Alabama PSC. </em>Once having completed the administrative process, Havis had the opportunity to bring his constitutional challenges in state court under Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; he chose instead to file his complaint in federal court. An adjudication that the Board\u2019s actions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>unconstitutional in any of the ways claimed by Havis will be equally disruptive of the regulatory scheme challenged whether the decision emanates from a federal or a state court. <em>Cf. Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 379 n. 5, 98 S.Ct. 673, 677 n. 5, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978). Federal court adjudication cannot intrusively displace that by a state court acting as \u201can integral part of the regulatory process\u201d, <em>Alabama PSC, supra, </em>341 U.S. at 348, 71 S.Ct. at 767, because no such court exists in Maryland. <em>See </em>Field, Abstention in Constitutional Cases: The Scope of the Pullman Abstention Doctrine, 122 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1071,1156 (1974). Dismissal of Havis\u2019s suit under the <em>Burford </em>rationale was therefore improper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The Board also suggests that in addition to the <em>Burford </em>doctrine, abstention follows here on the strength of our decision in <em>AFA Distributing Co., Inc. v. Pearl Brewing Co., </em>470 F.2d 1210 (4 Cir.1973). Unlike the case before us, however, <em>Pearl Brewing </em>involved an \u201cexceedingly difficult and incredibly ambiguous statute\u201d regulating the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages. <em>Id. </em>at 1211. That statute was \u201crecently enacted\u201d and susceptible to multiple interpretations; which view the state courts would choose was in doubt, as the statute had never been interpreted and lacked even a guiding history of administrative application. Moreover, dismissal of the action on abstention grounds was influenced by the fact that no federal question was pled in that diversity case. Rather, a federal question was only \u201clurking within the statute ... as a defense contention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">All of the elements converging in <em>Pearl Brewing </em>to prompt dismissal are in reality the opposite of those present here, where we face a statute first enacted in similar form some thirty-six years ago, the language of which has been upheld by the state\u2019s highest court,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which carries a long history of authoritative administrative construction, and which is challenged on constitutional grounds. This is not among the \u201crelatively rare instances\u201d contemplated by <em>Pearl Brewing </em>as a proper case for abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\"><em>Pullman </em>Abstention</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The Board alternatively asks for affirmance of the district court\u2019s ruling that <em>Pullman-type </em>abstention would be appropriate in this case. To apply the <em>Pullman </em>doctrine, at a minimum it must appear that there is (1) an unclear issue of state law presented for decision (2) the resolution of which may moot or present in a different posture the federal constitutional issue such that the state law issue is \u201cpotentially dis-positive\u201d. <em>Donohoe Construction Co., Inc. v. Montgomery County Council, </em>567 F.2d 603, 607 (4 Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>438 U.S. 905, 98 S.Ct. 3123, 57 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1978); <em>Cox, supra, </em>669 F.2d at 942. In this case, however, the only state law questions suggested as unclear by the Board are ones either not in issue or in effect duplicative of the constitutional claims alleged by Havis.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">The Board argues that an \u201cunsettled\u201d question is presented by the possibility that a state court hearing this matter might rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>that the definitions of \u201cnoncollegiate educational institution\u201d found in \u00a7 2-206 or \u201cinstitution of postsecondary education\u201d in \u00a7 12-201 of the Maryland Education Article do not apply to Havis\u2019s schools. Yet the Board throughout has treated Havis\u2019s schools as within those sections, and Havis has conceded that his tutoring school and teacher training center meet the statutory definitions of \u00a7\u00a7 2-206 and 12-201 and thereby are subject to the attendant certification requirements, if valid. In short, there is no one litigating the issue which the Board suggests might somehow be found unclear. As we said in <em>Donohoe Construction, supra, </em>567 F.2d at 607, \u201cIt is obvious that where no issue of state law exists, the federal constitutional issue cannot be avoided by \u2018a definitive ruling on the state issue ....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">As part of its rationale for finding <em>Pullman </em>abstention appropriate, the district court looked to a different state law matter, equating an \u201cunsettled issue\u201d of state law with one supposedly not yet squarely presented to a state court. The court\u2019s view was that because Havis in part challenges the certification scheme as applied to him on \u201cvagueness\u201d grounds, there is the potential for a state court to give a narrowing construction to the statutory grant empowering the State Board for Higher Education to consider the \u201ceducational qualifications and standards\u201d of an applicant. \u00a7 12-203(b). But challenges to state statutes on \u201cvagueness\u201d grounds are really of two varieties, with abstention permissible only where \u201cthe case turns on the applicability of a state statute or regulation to a particular person or a defined course of conduct\u201d. <em>Procunier v. Martinez, </em>416 U.S. 396, 401 n. 5, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1805 n. 5, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); see <em>also Public Citizen Health Research Group v. Commission on Medical Discipline of Maryland, </em>573 F.2d 863 (4 Cir.1978) (abstention warranted pending state court interpretation of whether undefined statutory term \u201cadvertise\u201d encompassed activity at issue). As already noted, there is no challenge in this case to the applicability of the implicated state statutes to Havis\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The other variety of \u201cvagueness\u201d challenge is that present here, one in which it is the degree of discretionary authority vested in the administering state official by the empowering statute that assertedly violates due process. \u201cIn such a case no single adjudication by a state court could eliminate the constitutional difficulty. Rather, it would require \u2018extensive adjudications, under the impact of*a variety of factual situations,\u2019 to bring the challenged statute' or regulation \u2018within the bounds of permissible constitutional certainty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Procunier, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 401 n. 5, 94 S.Ct. at 1805 n. 5 (citations omitted). No single interpretation of the statutory language questioned by Havis could conceivably narrow the Board\u2019s criteria in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \u201ceducational qualifications and standards\u201d to the point where the constitutional issue, whatever its merits, could be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Moreover, the state courts cannot be expected to undertake any such course of discretion-narrowing interpretation. The Maryland Court of Appeals has already held the virtually identical language in the precursor statute to \u00a7 12-201 to be sufficiently definite and unambiguous to permit it to stand as proper legislative gdidance to the State Board for Higher Education. <em>Schneider v. Pullen, </em>198 Md. 64, 81 A.2d 226 (1951). In <em>Schneider, </em>a barber challenged the language about which Havis complains as an unlawful delegation of legislative power \u201cbecause it provides no definite standards by which the State Superintendent of Schools is to be guided in issuing his regulations and in granting permits.\u201d The Court of Appeals rejected the argument and approved the reasonableness of the broad language given the purpose of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad7\">To cover all types of trade schools, as well as other educational institutions, there could be no one set of standards prescribed, but that need not invalidate the delegation of power if the general standards, broad though they may be, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>sufficiently explicit to limit the State Superintendent of Schools in his actions, and not permit him to exercise arbitrary power. The wording, already quoted, from subsection (b) is that the schools must have conditions of entrance, scholarship, educational qualifications, standards and facilities adequate and appropriate for the purposes, program, training and .courses to be taught.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">We think the standards prescribed for so broad a subject are sufficiently definite for us to hold that the statute is not subject to constitutional objection on this ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">81 A.2d at 229. In light of <em>Schneider, </em>there is no state law basis for deciding this case that avoids the federal constitutional issue raised.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Pullman </em>abstention therefore also was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Citing the requirement of Rule 12(a), F.R.Civ.P., that the defendant \u201cshall serve his answer within 20 days after the service of the summons and complaint upon him\u201d, Havis argues that the Board was in default because no \u201canswer\u201d was served as of the time he moved for default judgment roughly 40 days after service of the summons and complaint.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Board responds by noting the extensive discovery requests that accompanied service of the complaint and motion for preliminary injunction, as well as by pointing out that its response in opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction set forth most of its defense so that it was tantamount to the answer required by the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">We need not here depart from the general rule that a motion or a response to one is not deemed a \u201cresponsive pleading\u201d for the purposes of the time limits set out in the Rules.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>5 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 1348, pp. 536-37 (1969); <em>cf. Atlantic Steamers Supply Co. v. International Maritime Supplies Co., Ltd., </em>268 F.Supp. 1009, 1011 (S.D.N.Y.1967) (defendant\u2019s time allotted for service of responsive pleading ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>tended only by making of motion under Rule 12). For, even had the district court granted Havis\u2019s motion, under our standard for striking a default judgment the district court here would have been virtually compelled to do so upon a Rule 60(b) motion by the Board. <em>See United States v. Moradi, </em>673 F.2d 725, 727 (4 Cir.1982). We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion for default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Finally, Havis contends that we should direct the district court to grant plaintiffs a preliminary injunction to prevent defendants from enforcing the Maryland statutes against them. Despite having developed a fairly extensive record at the preliminary injunction hearing and other proceedings, the district court never ruled on the merits of Havis\u2019s preliminary injunction motion. Instead, the district court found \u201cthat the abstention issue raised by the defendants is dispositive\u201d and dismissed the action. We thus lack any written findings of fact and conclusions of law to review, <em>see </em>Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P., and so have no basis upon which to consider the merits of the motion. In reversing the district court\u2019s decision to abstain, we express no opinion on the substantive issues raised by Havis. Those should be decided by the district court in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-11\">.

Named as defendants were the Board, its seven members in their official capacities, the Board Commissioner and various staff members, the state Board of Education, and the state Superintendent of Schools. The defendants will be referred to simply as the \u201cBoard.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-13\">. Havis alleges that he is such an applicant in that the proposed IMS curriculum is \u201cunique in application and approach, outside the normally accepted standards and content of otherwise comparable conventional or traditional curricula.\u201d In particular, Havis asserts that the language of \u00a7 12-203(b), requiring the Board to evaluate the \u201cfacilities, conditions of entrance and scholarship, <em>and educational quaii\u00f1cations and standards\" </em>(emphasis added) of IMS, admits of abuse through academic content censorship, and that such a standardless and subjective review of content occurred in the denial of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">Havis also asserts that the regulations promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 12-201 \u2014 Code of Maryland Regulations \u00a7\u00a7 13A.50.01 <em>et seq. </em>\u2014 do not confine the statutory discretion of the Board, but rather institutionalize it. Using its discretion under these regulations, the Board referred Havis\u2019s application for comment and evaluation to various educators, among them practitioners of the Montessori educational philosophy at other institutions employing the Montessori label in their titles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\">. Although somewhat obtuse in alleging what harm has befallen him, inasmuch as Capital Tutoring appears to enjoy currently valid state certification, Havis points out that the regulations pursuant to \u00a7 2-206 require, <em>inter alia, </em>that teachers \u201cin schools adhering to the Montessori philosophy\u201d shall have both an accredited bachelor\u2019s degree and \u201ca Montessori diploma\u201d from a state accredited teacher training institution. C.M.R. \u00a7 13A.09.09.05(c)(2). Hav-is alleges that he is thereby prevented from using teachers trained in his proposed IMS training school in his tutoring school, whereas were he to operate a religious tutoring school he would be exempt from state oversight of his teachers\u2019 qualifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\">. <em>Burford v.

Board of Regents of the State of Florida, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b264-5\">. The district court also supported its dismissal by reference to <em>Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, </em>360 U.S. 25, 79 S.Ct. 1070, 3 L.Ed.2d 1058 (1959), but the narrow <em>Thibodaux </em>doctrine has no application here. <em>Thibodaux </em>is generally understood as resting on the special nature of eminent domain as a peculiarly local concern, although by any measure the case is something of an anomaly. <em>See </em>C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 309-310 (4th ed. 1983); Field, Abstention in Constitutional Cases, <em>supra, </em>at 1150; <em>Crawford v. Courtney, </em>451 F.2d 489, 492 (4 Cir.1971). For the same reasons, abstention here is not supported by <em>Kent Island Joint Venture v. Smith, </em>452 F.Supp. 455 (D.Md. 1978), another eminent domain case urged upon us by the Board to justify dismissal of Havis\u2019s suit. Even were the <em>Thibodaux </em>doctrine to suggest some form of abstention, by that case\u2019s own terms federal jurisdiction is retained but merely postponed pending resolution of an unclear state law issue. 360 U.S. at 29, 79 S.Ct. at 1073; <em>see also, Fralin &amp; Wal-dron, Inc. v. City of Martinsville, Virginia, </em>493 F.2d 481 (4 Cir.1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b264-12\">. <em>See, infra, </em>at text accompanying note 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\">. There is certainly no ambiguity in the statutory exemption from certification requirements of religious schools, \u00a7 2-206(e)(4), which Havis also challenges. The situation as to this section is thus like that addressed in <em>Harman v. Forssenius, </em>380 U.S. 528, 535, 85 S.Ct. 1177, 1182, 14 L.Ed.2d 50 (1965), where the Supreme Court stated: \u201cIf the state statute in question, although never interpreted by a state tribunal, is not fairly subject to an interpretation which will render unnecessary or substantially modify the federal constitutional question, it is the duty of the federal court to exercise its properly invoked jurisdiction.\u201d (citation omitted) Moreover, even if the Board\u2019s statutory discretion in the evaluation of Havis\u2019s educational qualifications and standards could be narrowed and the attendant constitutional issue thereby avoided through a state court adjudication, the constitutionality of this religious exemption could not, and a constitutional issue central to this case would remain. As the Supreme Court stated in rejecting a belated proffer of a state law issue as \u201cunsettled\u201d, \u201cabstention would be pointless\u201d where \u201cthe state issues put forward ... are plainly insufficient to merit such treatment.\u201d <em>Mayor v. Educational Equality League, </em>415 U.S. 605, 628, 94 S.Ct. 1323, 1337, 39 L.Ed.2d 630 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b266-12\">. Havis filed his complaint with the district court on September 28, 1981, and contemporaneously filed his motion for a preliminary injunction. On October 19, 1981, the Board filed a response in opposition to the preliminary injunction motion, but did not file anything styled as an answer. On November 9, 1981, Havis moved for default judgment. The motion was denied the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Although Havis provided the district court with postal return receipts for all defendants stamped no later than October 3, 1981, the court noted that its denial of the motion for default judgment was \u201cfor failure to prove service.\u201d However, Rule 55(a) permits proof of a party\u2019s failure to plead or defend to be \u201cmade to appear by affidavit or otherwise\u201d. In addition to the postal receipts, the Board\u2019s own response to Havis\u2019s preliminary injunction motion was filed on October 19, showing that the Board had been served more than 20 days prior to the motion for default judgment. We will therefore assume that Havis had properly proven that service had occurred more than 20 days before he moved for default judgment on November 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b266-14\">.
