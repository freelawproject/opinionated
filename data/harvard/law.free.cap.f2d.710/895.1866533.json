(Kohl) for enforcement of a settlement agreement signed by the parties. This agreement was incorporated in a May 11, 1981 district court order that Rockland acquire by eminent domain Kohl\u2019s entire legal interest in a thirty acre parcel of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-21\">Rockland advances three arguments on appeal, namely: (1) the district court\u2019s interpretation of the agreement renders it unconstitutional and illegal; (2) the order of the district court cannot be enforced legally because the Rockland County legislature authorized only the acquisition of a permanent easement over Kohl\u2019s property and therefore the County Executive is powerless to \u201ctake\u201d an interest greater than that approved by the legislature; and (3) the district court\u2019s interpretation of the settlement agreement is incorrect both as a matter of fact and law. We are not persuaded by these arguments and accordingly affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b987-23\">Evidence was never presented in the underlying case because the parties settled their dispute prior to trial. However, there is no dispute with respect to the relevant facts. During March 1973, Kohl purchased sixty acres of land in Rockland County. Approximately one year prior to this acquisition, Rockland had authorized a feasibility study to determine the most appropriate measures to prevent flooding in the general area of the Kohl property. After the study was completed, Rockland decided to implement a plan whereby approximately thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>acres of the Kohl property would be acquired through eminent domain and used as a retention basin for the Nauraushaun Brook. Consistent with this objective, the County in 1977 prepared a legal description of the Kohl property and commissioned a private firm to survey the acreage. Kohl was thereafter notified that Rockland intended to acquire the thirty acre parcel through eminent domain. In January 1980, Rockland with the legislature\u2019s approval offered Kohl $850,000 plus absolution of back taxes in exchange for the property. The offer was acceptable to Kohl, but the legislature subsequently withdrew its approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">After considerable foot-dragging by Rockland, Kohl commenced a federal court action in November 1980. The gravamen of Kohl\u2019s complaint was that Rockland officials had delayed eminent domain proceedings in an effort to acquire the thirty acre parcel without just compensation. Kohl specifically charged that even though its property was no longer commercially marketable given Rockland\u2019s announced intention to acquire it, the County nonetheless continued to tax this parcel at its former value. According to plaintiff, County officials hoped to delay eminent domain proceedings until Kohl\u2019s interest in the acreage was foreclosed for nonpayment of taxes. Kohl maintained that Rockland\u2019s conduct was actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. IV 1980) as an unconstitutional \u201ctaking\u201d of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Prior to trial, a settlement agreement was reached and a stipulation of settlement and discontinuance was duly executed and incorporated in an order entered by the district court on May 11, 1981. The order provided that Rockland would (1) engage an appraiser to determine the fair market value of the thirty acre parcel; (2) commence condemnation proceedings with the understanding that Kohl would be compensated for the appraised value of its land; and (3) simultaneous with its filing of the condemnation petition, <em>\u201cacquire title </em>to the subject property.\u201d <em>See </em>J. App. at 19 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Rockland subsequently petitioned the County legislature and received permission to acquire the Kohl property by eminent domain. In the interim, however, counsel for the County apparently determined that Rockland could accomplish its anti-flooding objective more economically by obtaining an easement over the portion of the property needed for the retention basin. Rock-land thereafter obtained legislative approval to acquire the easement and, on motion by the County, Justice Sullivan of the New York State Supreme Court, Rockland County, approved Rockland\u2019s petition to condemn a permanent easement. <em>See </em>J. App. at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Kohl then petitioned the district court pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6) to vacate the stipulation and reinstate the original action on grounds that Rockland had breached the settlement agreement. Kohl charged that the settlement agreement obligated Rockland to acquire a fee interest in the disputed acreage and, by refusing to condemn more than an easement, Rockland had failed to satisfy the terms of the agreement. The court agreed that a breach had occurred, but nonetheless denied Kohl\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion, explaining that plaintiff\u2019s original action was extinguished upon execution of the settlement agreement and could not be reinstated on a Rule 60(b)(6) motion. The court noted, however, that the decision was without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s making a motion for enforcement of the settlement agreement. <em>See </em>J. App. at 136. Kohl moved for enforcement of the agreement and the court, after finding a breach by Rockland, ordered the County to condemn Kohl\u2019s fee interest in the 30 acres.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ATi\">A. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">Although not raised by the parties, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction warrants brief discussion. Section 1983 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-5\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. IY 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (1976), the jurisdictional predicate for section 1983 actions, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-8\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-9\">(3) To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">Where the plaintiffs complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action under section 1983, the jurisdictional requirements of section 1343 are satisfied, provided the claim alleged is not \u201cobviously frivolous,\u201d \u201cwholly insubstantial,\u201d or \u201cessentially fictitious.\u201d <em>See Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 532, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1911, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981); <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 249-50, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1044-45, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978); <em>Hagans v.

Piphus, </em>435 U.S. at 253, 98 S.Ct. at 1047 (citing <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 417, 96 S.Ct. 984, 988, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976)). To state a cause of action under that section, plaintiff must allege that defendant, while acting under color of state law, <em>Gomez v. Toledo, </em>446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980); <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 152, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1605, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>Graseck v. Mauceri, </em>582 F.2d at 204 &amp; n. 5, 207; <em>see Moose Lodge No. 107 v.

Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 172, 81 S.Ct. 473, 476, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">Official acts of a county satisfy the \u201cunder color of state law\u201d component of section 1983. <em>See Morrison v. Jones, </em>607 F.2d 1269, 1273 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 962, 100 S.Ct. 1648, 64 L.Ed.2d 237 (1980); <em>Redcross v. County of Rensselaer, </em>511 F.Supp. 364, 369 (N.D.N.Y.1981); <em>see also Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (\u201cOur analysis of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 compels the conclusion that Congress <em>did </em>intend municipalities and other local government units to be included among those persons to whom \u00a7 1983 applies.\u201d) (footnote omitted). We also find that Kohl\u2019s complaint alleges sufficient facts, at least for purposes of jurisdictional pleading, to sustain the claim that it has been deprived of a constitutionally protected right. The gravamen of Kohl\u2019s complaint is that Rockland wrongfully used its governmental powers intending ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>mately to \u201ctake\u201d the disputed thirty acres without just compensation. Kohl specifically charges that its property was rendered commercially unmarketable when Rockland announced its intention to acquire this land by eminent domain. According to Kohl, the County intentionally delayed eminent domain proceedings while continuing to tax the Kohl parcel at full value with the expectation that this squeeze play ultimately would cause Kohl to forfeit its property interest through foreclosure for nonpayment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The eminent domain power of the state has long been recognized as a necessary and important incident of its sovereignty. <em>People v. Adirondack Railway, </em>160 N.Y. 225, 236-37, 54 N.E. 689, 692 (1899), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>176 U.S. 335, 20 S.Ct. 460, 44 L.Ed. 492 (1900); <em>Heyward v. New York, </em>7 N.Y. 314, 324 (1852). Although largely unrestrained, the governmental right to \u201ctake\u201d private property for a public use is subject to the constitutional limitation that just compensation be paid to the individual whose property is acquired by the government. <em>See </em>U.S. Const.Amends. V, XIV; N.Y. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 7. Reported decisions in New York have consistently reaffirmed the constitutional right to just compensation when property is taken by the state. <em>See People v. Adirondack Railway, </em>160 N.Y. at 239, 54 N.E. at 693 (\u201cSafeguards become necessary only when the question of compensation is reached, and then the courts are careful to see that the owner receives all that he is entitled to.\u201d); <em>City of New Rochelle v. Sigel, </em>65 Misc.2d 962, 964-65, 319 N.Y.S.2d 208, 211 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The New York courts have duly recognized that judicial intervention is necessary where the state seeks to circumvent its constitutional duty to pay fair compensation for private property condemned through eminent domain: \u201cThe limits of police power may be extensive, although ill-defined, but common justice requires that such power should not be used to circumvent the constitutional inhibition against appropriating private property for a public use without compensation.\u201d <em>Her-kimer Pulp &amp; Packaging Corp. v. McMorran, </em>45 Misc.2d 127, 134-35, 256 N.Y.S.2d 377, 384 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1964), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>24 A.D.2d 929, 264 N.Y.S.2d 848 (3d Dep\u2019t 1965); <em>see Wolfe v. New York, </em>53 Misc.2d 14, 19, 277 N.Y.S.2d 985, 990 (N.Y.Ct.C1.1967) (\u201cThe ultimate responsibility for protection of private property rights lies with the courts, and the courts have a duty to do more than defer to the Legislature.\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>22 N.Y.2d 292, 292 N.Y.S.2d 635, 239 N.E.2d 517 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Kohl asserts in its complaint that Rockland intended, through use of governmental taxing and eminent domain power, to \u201ctake\u201d its property without just compensation. We are satisfied that the constitutional deprivation alleged here is not \u201cobviously frivolous,\u201d <em>see Hagan v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. at 536-37, 94 S.Ct. at 1378-79, and is sufficient to meet the pleading requirements of section 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (1976). Since the district court entered a settlement order in a case over which it had jurisdiction, it is not open to us to examine the merits of the now-extinguished original lawsuit. Having found subject matter jurisdiction to hear this dispute, we hold that the district court has the power to enforce the settlement agreement entered into by the parties and formally approved through court order. <em>See Meetings &amp; Expositions, Inc. v. Tandy Corp., </em>490 F.2d 714, 717 (2d Cir.1974), <em>cited with approval in Sanchez v. Maher, </em>560 F.2d 1105, 1108 (2d Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">B. <em>Substantive Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">1. <em>Constitutionality of Taking</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">Counsel for Rockland crafts a creative, albeit unpersuasive, constitutional argument in an effort to evade its obligation under the settlement agreement. The County asserts that its eminent domain powers are limited by the constitutional prohibition against \u201ctaking\u201d private property in excess of that amount necessary to accomplish the intended public use. Rock-land notes that it could satisfy its anti-flooding objective simply by \u201ctaking\u201d an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>easement in the Kohl property and hence the acquisition of a fee simple interest would amount to an unconstitutional taking of a property interest greater than that necessary to achieve its public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">We agree that a county has no <em>right </em>under its eminent domain power to condemn an estate in excess of that which is needed to accomplish the intended public purpose. <em>See Hallock v. New York, </em>32 N.Y.2d 599, 605, 347 N.Y.S.2d 60, 64, 300 N.E.2d 430, 432 (1973); <em>Mayo v. Windels, </em>255 A.D. 22, 27, 5 N.Y.S.2d 690, 693 (2d Dep\u2019t 1938), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>281 N.Y. 837, 24 N.E.2d 494 (1939). This constitutional restriction does not, however, preclude the county from negotiating and then acquiring, <em>with the owner\u2019s consent, </em>an estate greater than necessary to satisfy the immediate public interest. <em>See Sherman v. McKeon, </em>38 N.Y. 266, 274 (1868); <em>Embury v. Conner, </em>3 N.Y. 511, 518 (1850); see <em>also Winslow v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, </em>208 U.S. 59, 62, 28 S.Ct. 190, 191, 52 L.Ed. 388 (1908) (owner of private property cannot complain of unconstitutional taking where owner consents to that taking); <em>Mayo v. Windels, </em>255 A.D. at 27, 5 N.Y.S.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">The \u201cconsent doctrine,\u201d first adopted by the New York courts in <em>Embury v. Conner, </em>3 N.Y. 511 (1850), recognizes that the constitutional limitation on the state\u2019s eminent domain power was intended to protect the private property owner from the misuse of that power, <em>not </em>shield the government from its contractual obligations under the guise of concerns about excessive taking. <em>Id. </em>at 518; <em>see Mayo v. Windels, </em>255 A.D. at 27, 5 N.Y.S.2d at 693. The state occupies a position of disproportionate strength when wielding its eminent domain power. Indeed, as an incident of its sovereignty, the state may take all property necessary for public use as long as just compensation is paid. The private property owner is at the mercy of the state; he cannot forestall the taking by objection or court decree as long as his property is necessary for a public use. A wholly different case is presented when the private property owner consents to the proposed condemnation. In that situation, the constitutional limitation on the state\u2019s eminent domain power is not needed to protect the property owner from an excessive taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">The reported decisions fully support the view that the constitutional limitation on the state\u2019s eminent domain power was intended to protect the property owner, <em>not </em>the government. <em>See, e.g., Embury v. Conner, </em>3 N.Y. at 511; <em>see also Hallock v. New York, </em>32 N.Y.2d at 605, 347 N.Y.S.2d at 64, 300 N.E.2d at 432; Mayo <em>v. Windels, </em>255 A.D. at 27, 5 N.Y.S.2d at 693. Appellant cites no case, and we find none, where the state has relied on the \u201cnecessity\u201d doctrine to evade a contractual obligation. We will not allow Rockland to be relieved from its lawful obligation because, now, with the benefit of hindsight, it wants to renege on its agreement. Absent a showing of collusion or fraud, when the parties have consented to the taking, the constitutional limitation on the state\u2019s power of eminent domain is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">2. <em>Legality of Taking</em></p>\n<p id=\"An0\">Rockland asserts that the district court erred by ordering it to condemn a property interest greater than that necessary for public use. Rockland claims that the acquisition of more than an easement in the Kohl property would be wasteful and illegal and hence potentially would subject the County to a citizen\u2019s suit on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">We are not persuaded by this argument. Rockland has not shown that it would be liable for waste or illegality for condemning a fee interest rather than an easement. The New York courts show due deference to the state when it exercises sovereign powers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-10\">In the absence of illegality, fraud, collusion, corruption or bad faith, the Court has no power to restrain the city from entering into or carrying out any agreement which it chooses to make. The terms \u2018waste\u2019 and \u2018injury\u2019, as used in the statute, comprehend only wrongful, dishonest or illegal official acts, and are not intended to subject the action of an administrative official, acting within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>limits of his authority and jurisdiction, to the scrutiny and control of a judicial tribunal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-4\"><em>Hanrahan </em>v. <em>Corrou, </em>12 N.Y.S.2d 536, 539, 170 Misc. 922, 925 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1938), <em>quoted in Borek v. Golder, </em>190 Misc. 366, 390, 74 N.Y.S.2d 675, 697 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Rockland cites no case where the exercise of the county\u2019s eminent, domain power has been successfully challenged through citizen suit on grounds of waste or illegality. Rather, the County relies on cases where the plaintiff alleges a wrongful award of a government contract, <em>see Campbell v. City of New York, </em>244 N.Y. 317, 328, 155 N.E. 628, 629 (1927), and charges wrongful distribution of cable television franchises, <em>see Orth-O-Vision, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>101 Misc.2d 987, 989-90, 422 N.Y.S.2d 781, 784 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1979). The absence of direct authority is not surprising, however, because the courts have traditionally accorded the state considerable discretion when exercising its \u201ctaking\u201d power. <em>People v. Adirondack Railway, </em>160 N.Y. 225, 239-40, 54 N.E. 689, 693 (1899), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>176 U.S. 335, 20 S.Ct. 460, 44 L.Ed. 492 (1900); <em>see Berman v. Parker, </em>348 U.S. 26, 32, 75 S.Ct. 98,102, 99 L.Ed. 27 (1954) (once the legislature has declared a condemnation to be for a public use, the role of the courts is an extremely narrow one). In a representative democracy, extravagance and waste in the use of eminent domain are remedied better at the ballot box than at the courthouse. Rockland is not barred on grounds of illegality or waste from fulfilling its obligations under the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">.3. <em>Compliance with District Court Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Rockland advances two additional theories under New York eminent domain law to support its claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">a. <em>Legality of Compliance Under State Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">The County asserts that it cannot legally comply with the district court order mandating that it \u201ctake\u201d by eminent domain Kohl\u2019s entire fee interest in the disputed acreage. Rockland points out that under New York law it must obtain the approval of the County legislature before exercising its \u201ctaking\u201d powers. Thus, according to Rockland, since the legislature has indicated that it will approve only the condemnation of an easement over the Kohl property, compliance with the district court order would require it to act beyond its legal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">But the County legislature <em>did </em>approve the settlement agreement signed by Rockland and Kohl. <em>See </em>J.App. at 107-09. Indeed, the legislature specifically authorized Rockland to <em>acquire </em>the Kohl parcel abutting the Nauraushaun Brook. <em>See </em>J.App. at 107. Thus, there is no legal bar under this theory to prevent Rockland from condemning a fee interest in the Kohl property.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">b. <em>Prior Legislative Approval</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">Section 204 of the New York Eminent Domain Procedure Law, N.Y.E.D.P.L. \u00a7 204 (McKinney 1979), requires a con-demnor to certify and approve the intended public use of a property <em>before </em>commencing eminent domain proceedings. Rockland asserts that the district court usurped the County\u2019s governmental function under section 204 by ordering the County to \u201ctake\u201d an interest without certification and approval as necessary for the public good.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-15\">This argument is circular. The district court did not usurp the County\u2019s governmental function under section 204, it merely accepted a settlement agreement voluntarily entered by the parties and approved by the County legislature, pursuant to section 204.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>4. <em>Interpretation of Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Finally Rockland asserts that the parties could not have contemplated the \u201ctaking\u201d of an entire fee simple interest because the Kohl property was encumbered by several outstanding easements. Hence, according to Rockland, the Court should interpret the parties\u2019 use of the term \u201cacquire title\u201d as a reflection of their intent to condemn an easement as opposed to a fee interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">This argument is frivolous. As with any settlement agreement or contract, we look first at the plain language of the agreement. <em>Sanchez v. Maher, </em>560 F.2d 1105, 1108 (2d Cir.1977). The agreement, as incorporated in the district court order, provides that Rockland will \u201cacquire title to the subject property.\u201d <em>See </em>J.App. at 29. When no limiting language is included in the conveyance document, \u201ctitle\u201d is understood to mean a fee interest, not an easement. 2 G. Thompson, Law of Real Property \u00a7 319 (1980); <em>see generally Hallock v. New York, </em>32 N.Y.2d at 605, 347 N.Y.S.2d at 64, 300 N.E.2d at 432 (\u201cWe note in particular that the statute, under which the State would carry out the Authority\u2019s determination as to what real property is reasonably necessary for the project, explicitly authorized the acquisition of <em>\u2018interests in such property less than full title, such as easements\u2019 </em>\u201d) (citing Highway Law, \u00a7 30, subd. 2) (emphasis added). When a prospective purchaser seeks to acquire an easement, New York courts require that party to identify with specificity the location and intended use for the estate. <em>See Clark v. Devoe, </em>124 N.Y. 120, 125-26, 26 N.E. 275, 276 (1891); <em>see also Raymond v. New York, </em>208 Misc. 43, 46, 143 N.Y.S.2d 354, 358 (Ct.C1.1955), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>4 A.D.2d 62,162 N.Y.S.2d 838 (4th Dep\u2019t 1957), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>4 N.Y.2d 961, 175 N.Y.S.2d 829, 151 N.E.2d 624 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Here, Rockland never identified in the settlement agreement the type of estate that it expected to \u201ctake\u201d from Kohl except to note that it would \u201cacquire title.\u201d Because, in the absence of limiting language, \u201ctitle\u201d is commonly und\u00e9rstood to mean a fee interest, Rockland cannot now be heard to complain when it failed to specify its intent to condemn a lesser estate. Moreover, Rockland\u2019s conduct during the settlement negotiations belies its assertion that at the time the agreement was executed it intended only to condemn an easement in the Kohl property. <em>See Raymond v. New York, </em>208 Misc. at 46-47, 143 N.Y.S.2d at 358 (where there is uncertainty in the description of the property to be taken by eminent domain, the \u201ccourt will look at the circumstances existing when the proceedings commenced,\u201d the \u201csubject matter of the documents involved,\u201d and the \u201cintention should be determined from the various instruments in connection with acts of parties\u201d). On January 25, 1980, in one of the early communications leading to the settlement, counsel for Rockland informed Kohl that it \u201cwill acquire in fee [the Kohl parcel].\u201d <em>See </em>J.App. at 111. While the negotiations were in progress, the County legislature authorized Rockland to \u201cacquire title.\u201d <em>See </em>J.App. at 107-09. Finally, and most persuasive, Rockland\u2019s special counsel advised the County attorney in a letter dated July 16,1981, that: \u201cAs we discussed on the telephone, I would like the County to consider taking a step which I believe could result in a potential substantial saving. I would like the County to consider <em>changing the nature of the taking from fee to permanent easement.\u201d See </em>J.App. at 133 (emphasis added). This letter, written <em>after </em>the settlement agreement was executed in May 1981, completely discredits Rockland\u2019s position here.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>The record reveals that at the time the agreement was executed, the County fully intended to acquire Kohl\u2019s entire legal interest in the disputed acreage. After agreeing to \u201ctake\u201d this property interest by eminent domain, the County apparently decided that it could accomplish its public purpose more economically by condemning only an easement. But Rockland had previously entered into a valid settlement agreement and it is bound by the terms of that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-6\">. In his first decision Judge Gagliardi found that the settlement agreement obligated Rock-land to acquire from Kohl a fee simple absolute interest in the disputed parcel. It was later brought to the attention of the court that several easements encumbered the acreage in question and hence it would be impossible for Rock-land to take a fee simple absolute from Kohl. The court duly noted this fact and ordered Rockland to acquire Kohl\u2019s total interest subject to outstanding encumbrances. <em>See </em>J.App. at 168, 169.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b992-8\">. We reject Rockland\u2019s argument that a public hearing should be held to ascertain the appropriate estate necessary for public use. Section 206 of the E.D.P.L. provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-16\">The condemnor shall be exempt from compliance with the provisions of this article when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-17\">(A) pursuant to other state, federal, or local law or regulation it considers and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>mits factors similar to those enumerated in subdivision (B) of section two hundred four [i.e. public use, environmental effects, etc.], to a state, federal or local governmental agency, board or commission before proceeding with the acquisition and obtains a license, a permit, a certificate of public convenience or necessity or other similar approval from such agency, board, or commission____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-9\">N.Y.E.D.P.L. \u00a7 206 (McKinney 1979). Rock-land presented its plan of acquisition to the County legislature in April 1981. The legislature considered Rockland\u2019s request and approved the \u201ctaking\u201d of \u201ctitle\u201d to the Kohl property. No hearings are necessary. <em>Aswad v. City School District of Binghamton, </em>74 A.D.2d 972, 972-73, 425 N.Y.S.2d 896, 898 (3d Dep\u2019t 1980).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b994-5\">NEAHER, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AMO\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">I respectfully dissent. The federal courts should not permit \u00a7 1983 to be used as a means to obtain undeserved payment from public funds. In this action, Kohl never had a valid claim; the complaint alleges an uncompensated \u201ctaking\u201d, but presents no facts which would allow a court to find a fifth amendment violation. Moreover, the relief Kohl seeks, an order compelling the condemnation of a fee simple interest, is not a remedy any court could provide to Kohl. As discussed below, this action should be remanded to the district court for the purpose of entertaining a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Despite Kohl\u2019s allegations of extensive activity by Rockland, no formal steps toward condemnation were ever taken. Most importantly, none of the actions taken by Rockland, nor the totality of its conduct, amounts to a <em>de facto </em>taking of the Kohl property. Ordinarily, a taking does not result before formal condemnation proceedings are commenced. As courts have repeatedly acknowledged public projects often go through many formative steps and alterations, and may even be abandoned, before condemnation proceedings are necessary. The state simply does not incur liability for a taking each time it speculates as to whether a particular property owner\u2019s land might be made subject to eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">In <em>Danforth v. United States, </em>308 U.S. 271, 285, 60 S.Ct. 231, 236, 84 L.Ed. 240 (1939), for example, the Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201c[a] reduction or increase in the value of property may occur by reason of legislation for or the beginning or completion of a project. Such changes in value are the \u2018incidents\u2019 of ownership. They cannot be considered as a \u2018taking\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d More recently, in <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon, </em>447 U.S. 255, 100 S.Ct. 2138, 65 L.Ed.2d 106 (1980), the Court primarily considered and rejected allegations that certain zoning ordinances rose to the level of a taking. Addressing additional contentions that an \u201caborted attempt to acquire the land through eminent domain had destroyed the use of the land during the pendency of the proceedings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 259 n. 3, 100 S.Ct. at 2140 n. 3 the Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmH\">\u201cThe State Supreme Court correctly rejected the contention that the municipality\u2019s good-faith planning activities, which did not result in successful prosecution of an eminent domain claim, so burdened the appellants\u2019 enjoyment of their property as to constitute a taking.. .. Even if the appellants\u2019 ability to sell their property was limited during the condemnation proceeding, the appellants were free to sell or develop their property when the proceedings ended. Mere fluctuations in value during the process of governmental decision-making, absent extraordinary delay, are \u2018incidents of ownership.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263 n. 9, 100 S.Ct. at 2143 n. 9 (citation omitted; quoting <em>Danforth, supra).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">The <em>Danforth </em>and <em>Agins </em>decisions both concerned condemnation proceedings which had been commenced and abandoned. More specific to the Kohl action, the highly regarded, well-reasoned New York Court of Appeals decision in <em>City of Buffalo v. J. W. Clement Company, </em>28 N.Y.2d 241, 321 N.Y.S.2d 345, 269 N.E.2d 895 (1971), held that when no formal condemnation proceedings have begun, no taking can ever result.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>J.W. Clement Company (\u201cClement\u201d), the owner of the property condemned in <em>City of Buffalo, </em>had purchased it in 1946, had made extensive improvements, and for years had operated a worldwide printing company from that location. In late 1954, the City of Buffalo began investigating an urban renewal project, and by 1957, Clement was formally notified that its property would be taken sometime between 1960 and 1962. In 1960, public officials stated that Clement\u2019s property must be vacated within three or four years; in 1961, the proposed time for condemnation was set at between eighteen and twenty-four months; in the summer of 1962, the mayor of Buffalo stated that condemnation would occur in the spring of 1963; early in 1963, written notification to Clement proposed public acquisition in May 1963. Because its business utilized massive machinery, Clement began relocating in 1961, and had fully moved its operations by April 1963. At that time, the court observed, the property was \u201cboth unsaleable and unrentable, ... and all efforts to procure even a short-term tenant proved unsuccessful. Clement, however, as owner in fee, continued to pay taxes and insurance and to maintain the property at its own expense while urging the city to complete the condemnation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 321 N.Y.S.2d at 352, 269 N.E.2d at 900. Formal condemnation did not occur until 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Rejecting Clement\u2019s argument that a <em>de facto </em>taking actually occurred in April 1963, the Court of Appeals held that the threat of condemnation could never constitute a taking. The court distinguished a <em>de facto </em>taking, which it found to involve \u201ca physical entry by the condemnor, a physical ouster of the owner, a legal interference with the physical use, possession or enjoyment of the property or a legal interference with the owner\u2019s power of disposition of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 321 N.Y.S.2d at 357, 269 N.E.2d at 903. The court also clarified the legal impact of \u201ccondemnation blight,\u201d which allows an owner whose property is condemned to recover compensation \u201cbased on the value of the property <em>at the time of the taking, </em>as if it had not been subjected to the debilitating effect of a threatened condemnation.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>321 N.Y.S.2d at 357, 269 N.E.2d at 903 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">The court found meritless assertions that a <em>de facto </em>taking could result from extensive municipal planning, and refused to award damages based on losses incurred at any time during the planning period. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-13\">\u201cWe simply have a manifestation of an intent to condemn and such, even considering the protracted delay attending final appropriation, cannot cast the municipality in liability upon a theory of a \u2018taking\u2019 for there was no appropriation of the property in its accepted legal sense....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-14\">\u201cMoreover, strong policy considerations prohibit a finding of a <em>de facto </em>taking in the instant case. To hold the date of the <em>announcement </em>of the impending condemnation, whether directly to the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>demnee or by the news media, constitutes a <em>de facto </em>taking at that time, would be to impose an \u2018oppressive\u2019 and \u2018unwarranted\u2019 burden upon the condemning authority. At the very least, it would serve to penalize the condemnor for providing appropriate advance notice to a property owner. And to so impede the actions of the municipality in preparing and publicizing plans for the good of the community, would be to encourage a converse policy of secrecy which \u2018would but raise [greater] havoc with an owner\u2019s rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255-56, 321 N.Y.S.2d at 357-58, 269 N.E.2d at 903-04 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Not only is Kohl\u2019s action controlled by <em>City of Buffalo, </em>but Kohl presents a far less compelling allegation of hardship than that case. The record here is devoid of any indication of Kohl\u2019s ability or desire at any time to develop this land; apparently, Kohl never sought to improve, rent, or sell the property, and in fact purchased it well after Rockland\u2019s flood control plans were being investigated. The complaint reveals that Kohl failed to pay property taxes for some time in 1977 and 1978, and that Rockland had already obtained all of the Kohl property through a tax sale, subject to Kohl\u2019s right to redemption within three years. The settlement agreement presently at issue itself reveals that Kohl\u2019s imminent loss of the property, resulting from its own inability to pay its taxes, precipitated this lawsuit: Kohl\u2019s two concerns were that Rock-land would obtain title through condemnation before the end of the redemption period, and that Kohl would be absolved of liability for unpaid taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Certainly nothing in the Constitution protects Kohl from the burden of paying taxes. Furthermore, whatever Kohl\u2019s plans when it purchased this property, Rockland cannot be made liable simply because Kohl mis-predicted the timing of the condemnation: \u201cThe just compensation clause ... [is] certainly not intended to relieve real estate developers of the burdens of business decisions that do not turn out to be correct.\u201d <em>Thompson, supra </em>n. 1, 496 F.Supp. at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Kohl\u2019s claim was dismissed initially, however, not because it was meritless, but because the parties settled. To enforce that settlement, however, the district court would be required to order Rockland to condemn more of Kohl's property than the county legislature has found to be necessary for the public use. <em>See Hallock v. State, </em>32 N.Y.2d 599, 605, 347 N.Y.S.2d 60, 64, 300 N.E.2d 430, 432 (1975) (\u201cIn general there may not be the acquisition of a fee when only an easement is required.\u201d); <em>e.g., Kupersmidt v. New York Telephone Co., </em>54 Misc.2d 332, 336, 282 N.Y.S.2d 605, 609 (Sup.Ct., Suffolk County, 1967) (condemnation of road bed resulted in acquisition of permanent easement; private owner retained fee title).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">The timing of condemnation, and the extent and nature of the estate to be condemned, are decisions which can be made only by a legislature. <em>E.g., In re Board of Water Supply of the City of New York, </em>277 N.Y. 452, 455, 14 N.E.2d 789, 790 (1938); <em>Cinco v. City of New York, </em>58 Misc.2d 828, 296 N.Y.S.2d 26, 30 (Sup.Ct., Queens County, 1968). The Rockland County legislature has authorized condemnation of a permanent easement over approximately thirty acres of Kohl\u2019s sixty-acre estate, and the state court has already condemned that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Kohl now asks that a federal court supplant that legislative decision and state court action with its own order. No court could force Rockland to exercise its powers of eminent domain when it has expressly chosen not to do so. Absent a <em>de facto </em>taking by state action, no court could condemn an interest in property without legislative authorization. However commendable the district court\u2019s efforts to settle this action, the settlement agreement simply cannot be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Moreover, Kohl\u2019s insistence on the condemnation of a fee interest rather than a permanent easement seeks a windfall at Rockland\u2019s expense. The parties agree that a permanent easement and a fee simple would be valued so as to result in the same compensation, and Rockland has agreed to assume the tax obligations, if any, Kohl may incur by remaining the technical owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>of the estate. At issue is the impact of the condemnation on the thirty acres of Kohl\u2019s estate not taken by Rockland.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">By retaining a fee interest in the condemned thirty acres, Kohl would be entitled to develop its remaining thirty acres according to a density allowance based upon the entire sixty acres. If Rockland instead condemned a fee interest, the density allowance would be reduced accordingly, and Kohl would be entitled to consequential damages. Because the thirty acres retained by Kohl do not appear conducive to this developmental opportunity, Kohl is attempting to manufacture the increased consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Kohl has already received more through its settlement of this meritless action than it ever was entitled to by law. To assist Kohl in its efforts to obtain increased and undeserved consequential damages through a highly questionable exercise of judicial authority would be to encourage similar actions brought in an abuse of \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction. I cannot condone such a result, and I am compelled to dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-8\">. <em>Accord, e.g., Chacon v.
