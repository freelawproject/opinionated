International Harvester Co., </em>658 F.2d 1137, 211 USPQ 11 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 969, 102 S.Ct. 514, 70 L.Ed.2d 386 (1981). In an unpublished decision, the district court held that the 15% figure constituted a \u201creasonable royalty\u201d pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284, but denied Deere prejudgment interest on Deere\u2019s claim of patent infringement. We affirm-in-part, reverse-in-part, and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-6\">A \u201ccorn head\u201d is an apparatus commonly attached to a mobile crop-processing machine, or combine, for use in harvesting corn. Generally, a corn head comprises a series of gathering devices (row units) mounted side-by-side in the front of the combine at intervals corresponding to the spacing of corn rows in the field, thereby permitting the simultaneous harvesting of the rows and the .continuous feeding of corn ears into the combine for further processing. The arrangement of combine with corn head is illustrated below:</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-7\">A. COMBINE</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-8\">B. CORN HEAD</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-9\">C. ROW UNITS</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-10\">D. DRIVE SHAFT</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-11\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-12\">In April, 1976, Deere instituted a suit for patent infringement as a result of the commercial introduction by IH two years earlier of its IH 800 series corn head. In 1978, the district court concluded that a patent assigned to Deere (Schreiner patent)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was valid and infringed by the IH 800 corn head. The district court enjoined further manufacture and sale of the IH 800 series and, moreover, awarded Deere treble damages (then undetermined), including interest, costs, and attorneys fees, on the ground that IH\u2019s conduct constituted an \u201cexceptional case of wilful infringement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-14\">During subsequent proceedings, including two appeals to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the district court\u2019s judgment on validity and infringement was sustained, but its ruling on the case\u2019s \u201cexceptional\u201d nature was reversed by the Seventh Circuit, which found \u201c[n]o evidence of bad faith conduct\u201d by IH. Thereafter, the cause was remanded to the district court for an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>\n<em>District Court Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-4\">At the accounting trial, Deere argued that it had suffered lost profits with respect to approximately 21% of IH\u2019s production of the IH 800 series between 1974 and 1980. As to the remainder of IH\u2019s production, Deere contended it was entitled to a royalty of 20% of net IH sales (an average of about $270 per row unit), plus an award of prejudgment interest and an adjustmient for inflation over the infringement period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-5\">In response, IH opposed both an inflation adjustment and an award of prejudgment interest, and urged that Deere had not proved it had suffered a determinable amount of lost profits. Furthermore, IH argued that an \u201cestablished royalty\u201d of $7.50 per row unit (or, alternatively, a \u201creasonable royalty\u201d in essentially the same amount) was applicable, with a ceiling on Deere\u2019s recovery of $1,000,000. In support of an established or reasonable royalty in the case, IH referred to various licenses in the farm equipment field, including a license covering the Schreiner patent granted in 1977 by Deere to White Motor Corporation, a competitor of Deere\u2019s which had held 8% or less of the market during the relevant period. The license agreement (White license), which was negotiated during the pendency of Deere\u2019s suit against IH, specified a royalty rate of something less than 1%, with decreases in the rate in the event one or more patent claims were held invalid in the course of Deere\u2019s action against IH. IH also presented evidence of two offers by Deere, made, respectively, in 1978, before IH commercialized the infringing IH 800 series, and in 1977, after Deere commenced the present action, to license the Schreiner patent to IH at a royalty rate of approximately 1%.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-6\">While agreeing with IH that Deere had failed to establish lost profits, the district court held there was no established royalty in the case. Specifically, the court concluded that the White license was \u201cirrelevant\u201d to determining either an established royalty or a reasonable royalty, and, in fact, was inadmissible under Rule 408, Federal Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The offers by Deere to license IH were similarly characterized as not relevant, and, in any case, inadmissible under Rule 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-10\">Having thus rejected IH\u2019s proffered evidence concerning Deere\u2019s licensing and offers to license the Schreiner patent, the district court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1644-11\">In determining a reasonable royalty, such factors as increased profitability, market share, cost savings, and collateral benefits from the sales of related products are to be considered. In addition, the reasonable royalty allowed should take into consideration that which would be accepted by a prudent licensee who wished to obtain a license but was not so compelled, and by a prudent patentee who wished to grant a license but was not so compelled. The \u201cnegotiations\u201d of such theoretical parties should not be viewed, however, as taking place in a vacuum. Each party would weigh the expected benefits against the expected costs of entering into a license agreement, and all known existing economic factors would be considered by them and would enter into their respective decision-making processes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1644-12\">The court expressly found \u201cno significant help on the problem here in other licenses between other parties involving other patents in the farm equipment industry, or in the assertion that \u2018almost invariably\u2019 past license agreements between Deere and IH had included a ceiling or paid-up amount.\u201d Rather, the district court emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4r7\">Corn being by far the largest crop in the United States, corn heads made possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>the harvesting of corn with a combine and thus created a vast additional market for combines. To be a viable supplier of combines, it is absolutely essential for an agricultural equipment manufacturer to have desirable corn heads to go with them, because the corn crop is harvested primarily by combines fitted with corn heads. In IH\u2019s case, some 70% of its combines are sold with corn heads, and if unable to supply acceptable corn heads, IH\u2019s combine production would have to be reduced by about 60%. Because the profit realized from combine sales is about three times that derived from corn head sales, there is a powerful economic incentive to protect combine sales.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1645-5\">* * jjc jf: * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1645-6\">At the time infringement began, Deere was making, and stood to make in the future, a profit of over 35% of net selling price on each corn head it sold; but it was running into plant capacity problems which could limit its production. So, as a prudent patent holder, Deere should have desired to license a substantial manufacturer at a percentage royalty, which would be something less than 35% of the licensee\u2019s sale price but would maximize Deere profits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1645-7\">Foreseeing the dismal future of [IH\u2019s own, noninfringing] corn head and the bright future of the infringing 800 Series, * * * as a prudent licensee, IH should have been willing to pay a very substantial percentage of net sales royalty, even exceeding its expected profit on corn heads, to protect its combine sales and profits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1645-8\">In view of the foregoing, the district court found that, \u201c[u]nder all the circumstances of this case, fifteen percent of net sales is the reasonable royalty rate, at or above which the damage award is mandated by the statute (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284). Anything less would be unreasonable.\u201d The district court concluded, however, that \u201c[u]nder the law of this case, and generally in this [the Seventh] Circuit, there is no \u2018exceptional circumstance\u2019 justification for prejudgment interest, or for any further adjustment for inflation.\u201d (citations omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-10\">\n<em>Arguments on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-11\">IH\u2019s challenge to the findings and conclusions of the district court proceeds along two basic fronts. First, IH argues that the royalty rate of 15% of net sales is excessive in light of the proffered evidence of Deere\u2019s actual licensing behavior and is otherwise not supported by the record. More specifically, IH contends that the district court erred by \u201crefusing to consider\u201d the White license and the two offers by Deere to license IH as \u201cthe most relevant evidence\u201d or an established royalty (or, alternatively, a reasonable royalty) in the neighborhood of 1%, rather than 15%. According to IH, the district court erroneously excluded the evidence of Deere\u2019s licensing practices, and compounded that error by preventing discovery directed to the amount for which Deere would have been willing to license the Schreiner patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-12\">As the second ground for its appeal, IH argues that the district court improperly based its award of a reasonable royalty on the premise of hypothetical negotiations during which the \u201cwilling licensor\u201d engaged in conduct which, in fact, would have constituted patent misuse and a violation of antitrust law. In particular, IH alleges that \u201cthe district court based its award, at least in large part, on Deere\u2019s supposed right to receive compensation for sales of combines, a collateral product.\u201d According to IH, the district court thus erred \u201cby basing its royalty award on the IH 800\u2019s entire market value,\u201d as a consequence of the court\u2019s holding, also erroneously, \u201cthat under the willing buyer and willing seller rule, the willing seller is entitled to compensation both for its patented product and for any leverage that product affords over un-patented products.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-13\">For its part, Deere takes issue with the district court\u2019s denial of what Deere calls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>\u201cdelay compensation,\u201d that is, compensation from early 1974 for the delay involved in Deere\u2019s action against IH. Arguing that this court is not bound by Seventh Circuit case law on the subject, Deere contends the requirement of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d for an award of delay compensation penalizes the patentee and contravenes the mandate of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 regarding \u201cadequate compensation\u201d and \u201cinterest,\u201d as construed in <em>Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., </em>377 U.S. 476, 505-06, 84 S.Ct. 1526, 1542, 12 L.Ed.2d 457 (1964).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1646-4\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-5\">\n<em>Deere\u2019s Actual Licensing Practices</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-6\">At the outset, we note that the district court was careful to delineate its pronouncements on relevance and admissibility, respectively, seemingly to preserve each issue separately for appellate review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court did not make a distinction, however, between evidence of little probative value and evidence considered not relevant, the latter being inadmissible under Rule 402, Federal Rules of Evidence. Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s purposeful treatment of IH\u2019s proffered evidence in the alternative, its failure to mention Rule 402, and its citation of court opinions dealing with evidence variously found to be unpersuasive (as opposed to irrelevant) convince us that the district court did not rule the proffered evidence inadmissible under both Rule 408 and Rule 402 and, hence, not to be considered in either case. Rather, we read the pertinent findings and conclusions of the district court together as stating that the proffered evidence on Deere\u2019s licensing practices was deemed to be inadmissible under Rule 408 or, alternatively, to be of little or no significance to the issues of an established royalty or a reasonable royalty. We will address these assertions seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-10\">(1) <em>Admissibility Under Rule 408: </em>The district court\u2019s rationale for ruling inadmissible IH\u2019s evidence of Deere\u2019s 1973 and 1977 offers to license the Schreiner patent was succinctly stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1646-11\">An offer to license a patent, which does not result in agreement because considered unacceptably high by the offeree, is an attempt to compromise a disputed claim, at least as to amount, and is also made in compromise negotiations. Hence, such an offer cannot be admissible on the issue of \u201cestablished royalty\u201d or reasonable royalty, under Rule 408, Federal Rules of Evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1646-12\">Rule 408, however, expressly relates to evidence of efforts toward \u201ccompromising or attempting to compromise a <em>claim </em>which was disputed as to either validity or amount.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 408 (emphasis added). While Deere\u2019s 1977 offer to grant IH a license may be properly considered an offer to settle a \u201cclaim\u201d (patent infringement) which was then in dispute, both as to validity and amount, we cannot identify a similar \u201cclaim\u201d over which the parties were in disagreement when Deere first offered to license the Schreiner patent in 1973. Indeed, the parties agree that IH was not infringing the Schreiner patent at the time of the 1973 offer, and the district court so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-13\">It may well be, as Deere urged during oral argument, that the past dealings between Deere and IH were such that an eventual court battle involving the Schrein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>er patent was an acknowledged possibility or even probability. Nevertheless, Rule 408, on its face, is limited to actual disputes over existing claims and, accordingly, cannot be applicable to an offer, albeit one ultimately rejected, to license an, as yet, uncontested patent. We conclude, therefore, that the district court erred as a matter of law by ruling evidence of Deere\u2019s 1973 offer inadmissible under Rule 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-5\">Similarly, we believe the district court erred in applying Rule 408 to the White license. Neither the district court\u2019s findings nor any evidence of record suggests that White Motor Corporation ever infringed the Schreiner patent or that Deere entertained some other, disputed claim against White Motor Corporation which might have been settled by Deere\u2019s granting the White license. Therefore, we can discern no basis for treating the White license as inadmissible evidence under Rule 408 of a completed compromise with a third party not involved in the present litigation. Moreover, the fact that the White license was negotiated while IH and Deere were locked in dispute over validity and infringement of the Schreiner patent does not render the White license itself inadmissible evidence of a settlement by Deere of a \u201cdisputed\u201d claim. Rule 408, therefore, is simply inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-6\">(2) <em>Probative Value: </em>In support of its conclusion on the weight to be given the White license, the district court cited <em>Rude v. Westcott, </em>130 U.S. 152, 165, 9 S.Ct. 463, 468, 32 L.Ed. 888 (1889), and <em>Saf-Gard Products v. Service Parts, </em>491 F.Supp. 996, 1008, 206 USPQ 976, 986 (D.Ariz.1980), apparently for the proposition that a single license, paid or secured by one, relatively minor competitor after the onset of the complained infringement, may be rejected as a measure of damages against an infringer. We have no doubt that this is an accurate statement of the relevant law, nor can we find error in its application by the district court to the White license, to the extent that the court considered the probative value of the White license to be vanishingly small.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1647-12\">In the absence of any evidence indicating a general acceptance within the farm equipment industry of a particular market value for the Schreiner patent, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s conclusion of no established royalty in this case is erroneous. <em>See Rude v. Westcott, </em>130 U.S. at 165, 9 S.Ct. at 468. Moreover, as the White license was negotiated against a backdrop of continuing litigation and IH infringement of the Schreiner patent, the district court could properly discount the probative value of the White license with regard to a reasonable royalty. <em>See, e.g., Tights, Inc. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., </em>442 F.Supp. 159, 164-65, 195 USPQ 750, 75-4-55 (M.D.N.C.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-14\">Similarly, the district court\u2019s finding no significant persuasive value in Deere\u2019s 1973 offer to license the Schreiner patent is not erroneous. In 1973, Deere faced a major competitor that had, on its own initiative, approached Deere for a license under an untested patent of indeterminate value. For the district court to consider Deere\u2019s royalty offer under such circumstances to be of little or no usefulness in determining a reasonable royalty does not constitute error as a matter of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1647-15\">(3) <em>Summary: </em>In our analysis to this point, we have concluded that the district court erred in ruling the White license and Deere\u2019s 1973 offer inadmissible under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>408 as evidence of an established or reasonable royalty. But we have also concluded that the district court\u2019s determination that the White license and the 1973 offer are of little or no probative value to the damages question should be sustained. Accordingly, we hold that the district court\u2019s erroneous application of Rule 408 did not affect the substantial rights of the parties and, therefore, constituted harmless error under Rule 61, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"aiv-dedup-0\">\n<em>Discovery Sought by IH</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-4\">In its briefs and again during oral argument before this court, IH has alluded to the district court\u2019s alleged error \u201c[p]re-venting discovery on the key issue of the amount for which Deere would have been willing to license the Schreiner patent.\u201d The precise nature of the court\u2019s \u201cerror\u201d in this context is unclear. IH has identified three instances where it says discovery was improperly cut off,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but the extreme breadth of the requested discovery, as well as the arguably privileged nature of some of the material sought, undercuts IH\u2019s contention. Suffice it to say that, in the absence of more detailed and convincing allegations, we are unpersuaded that the district court abused its broad discretion in delimiting discovery before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-5\">\n<em>The District Court\u2019s Determination of a Reasonable Royalty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-6\">Aside from challenging the district court\u2019s weighting of the proffered evidence on Deere\u2019s licensing practices, IH argues that the record before the district court did not support the award of a 15% royalty rate. Also, IH contends that the district court failed to identify the evidence it relied on to arrive at that figure. We find both positions unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-11\">The district court expressly identified numerous factors to be considered in determining a reasonable royalty, including increased profitability and cost savings, which were the subject of extensive investigation at trial. The district court heard, for example, the testimony of Dr. Conway, Deere\u2019s expert, concerning the \u201cbreakeven\u201d royalty rate a prudent business entity in 1973 would have used in licensing the Schreiner patent, had the entity been in the position of IH (14.7%) or Deere (17%).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court also expressly found that Deere was making, and stood to make in the future, a profit on the net selling price of its corn head in excess of 30%, a figure for which the record below provided support. The record similarly supported the district court\u2019s finding that Deere, facing limits on its own corn-head production, would have been willing to license \u201ca substantial manufacturer\u201d at something less than 35% of the licensee\u2019s sajes price, and that IH, recognizing \u201cthe dismal future\u201d of its own corn head and \u201cthe bright future of the infringing 800 series,\u201d would have been willing to pay a royalty comprising \u201ca very substantial percentage of [IH\u2019s] net sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-12\">In view of the foregoing, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s findings supportive of the reasonable royalty award are clearly erroneous, or that the 15% royalty rate is excessive as a matter of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A22\">\n<em>The District Court\u2019s Consideration of Collateral Sales</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-13\">We need not pause long in disposing of IH\u2019s argument that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>somehow presupposed patent misuse and antitrust violations by a hypothetical willing seller in basing its royalty award on what IH terms \u201cthe IH 800\u2019s entire market value.\u201d In fact, the district court did nothing more or less than take into account the impact of anticipated collateral sales of an admittedly noninfringing product line on the respective bargaining positions of the parties engaged in the theorized licensing negotiations. We consider this an eminently reasonable approach to the willing seller-willing buyer analysis, <em>see Union Carbide Corp. v. Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>282 F.2d 653, 671-72, 127 USPQ 3, 17 (7th Cir.1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>365 U.S. 812, 81 S.Ct. 695, 5 L.Ed.2d 691 (1961), <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. United States Plywood Corp., </em>318 F.Supp. 1116, 1131-32 (S.D.N.Y.1970), <em>modified and aff\u2019d, </em>446 F.2d 295, 170 USPQ 369 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 870, 92 S.Ct. 105, 30 L.Ed.2d 114 (1971), particularly in this case, where the worth of the contested patent cannot be realistically divorced from the value both IH and Deere placed on their respective shares in the combine market. Recognition of this fact by the district court does not constitute the court\u2019s imprimatur on a tying arrangement, implicit or otherwise. Contrary to IH\u2019s argument, the district court in no way assumed that a willing licensor would <em>condition </em>the grant of a license under the Schreiner patent on the purchase of any unpatented product. Compare <em>Rex Chainbelt v. Harco Products, </em>512 F.2d 993, 1000-03, 185 USPQ 10,14-16 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 831, 96 S.Ct. 52, 46 L.Ed.2d 49 (1975) (label license on container of unpatented epoxy resin, as sole noninfringing means to use patented invention employing resin, constituted tying of resin to right to practice patented invention).</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-5\">\n<em>Prejudgment Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-6\">In denying Deere prejudgment interest, the district court expressly relied on Seventh Circuit precedent to the effect that, under \u00a7 284, prejudgment interest should not be awarded in the absence of \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d See, <em>e.g., Columbia Broadcasting System v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>537 F.2d 896, 192 USPQ 68 (7th Cir.1976). Since the district court handed down its decision, however, the United States Supreme Court has held that, \u201c[o]n the face of \u00a7 284, a court\u2019s authority to award interest is not restricted to exceptional circumstances, and there is no warrant to imposing such a limitation.\u201d <em>General Motors Corp. v. Devex </em>Corp., ___ U.S. ___, ___, 103 S.Ct. 2058, 2061, 76 L.Ed.2d 211 (1983). The Supreme Court also has stated that \u00a7 284 provides \u201cthat interest shall be \u2018fixed by the court,\u2019 and in our view it [\u00a7 284] leaves the court some discretion in awarding prejudgment interest.\u201d ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 2063.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-12\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of prejudgment interest based on the absence of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d is reversed, and the case is remanded for further consideration in light of <em>General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-13\">MODIFIED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1643-13\">.

Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is likewise not admissible.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1646-7\">. In relevant part, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1646-8\">Upon finding for the claimant the court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1646-14\">. For example, the district court stated in a footnote that \u201cthe matters [pertaining to the Deere offers and the White license] are considered irrelevant, and evidence thereof is held to be inadmissible under Rule 408, Federal Rules of Evidence. Those facts are found, nevertheless, should a court of review disagree on the admissibility of the evidence supporting same and/or the relevance thereof on the issue of damages herein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1647-7\">. IH takes the position that the district court erroneously <em>refused </em>to consider the White license and other evidence of Deere\u2019s licensing behavior. We have already determined, however, that the district court treated the evidence as inadmissible (and, hence, not to be considered) or, alternatively, without significant evidential weight. Accordingly, we find that the district court duly considered IH\u2019s evidence and decided it was unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1647-17\">. <em>A fortiori, </em>it follows that the district court\u2019s weighting of the 1977 offer, which was tendered in the midst of litigation in which Deere held no clear edge, could not be considered erroneous even had evidence of the offer been ruled admissible below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1648-7\">. The instances involved an IH interrogatory to Deere seeking details of all Deere licenses pertaining to farm equipment granted between 1970 and the date Deere became aware of IH\u2019s infringing activities, an IH request for all documents relating to any offers by Deere to license its com head patents, and trial subpoenas directed by IH to Deere\u2019s President, General Counsel, Senior Vice President, and several of Deere\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1648-8\">. IH maintains that Dr. Conway\u2019s testimony was \u201cinconsistent with and indeed contrary to the economic reality of Deere\u2019s licensing practices.\u201d But as we have already concluded, the district court\u2019s assessment of the evidence concerning Deere\u2019s actual licensing behavior was not erroneous. Similarly, we cannot say that the district court erred in its counterbalancing of Dr. Conway\u2019s testimony against the other evidence before it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1648-15\">. Indeed, the district court, as quoted above, recognized that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 expressly mandates \u201cdamages adequate to compensate\u201d for patent infringement, and that, under the statute, a \u201creasonable royalty\u201d is the minimum permissible measure of damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1649-14\">DAVIS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ahc-dedup-0\">dissenting in part.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1649-15\">1. Unlike the court, I think the District Court never treated Deere\u2019s offer to IH and Deere\u2019s license to White as other than wholly inadmissible (and therefore not to be considered at all) \u2014 and never decided, even alternatively, that that offer and license were of little or lesser probative value (and therefore outweighed by the other evidence in the case). The court\u2019s findings of fact and legal conclusions show that this was the trial judge\u2019s position. Footnote 5 says squarely that the facts of the IH offer and White license \u201care considered irrelevant, and evidence thereof is held to be inadmissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>ble under Rule 408, Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d As the majority rules (and I agree), the holding of inadmissibility under Rule 408 was erroneous. As for \u201cirrelevance\u201d (or the synonym \u201cnot relevant\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), Rule 402 of the Rules of Evidence provides that \u201cEvidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d I conclude therefore that the District Court simply held these two circumstances \u2014 the IH offer and the White license \u2014 to be entirely inadmissible, <em>i.e., </em>not to be weighed at all. Nothing else in the court\u2019s findings or conclusions of law persuades that, although the court used (apparently deliberately) the accepted legal term \u201cirrelevant,\u201d it really meant \u201cof little probative value.\u201d The fact that the court said in footnote 5 that it found those particular facts because a reviewing court might \u201cdisagree on the admissibility of the evidence supporting same and/or relevance thereof on the issue of damages herein\u201d means no more than a statement that the appellate court should know the facts if it considered the trial court\u2019s legal holdings erroneous and therefore wished to consider reversing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-4\">2. The IH offer and the White license should have been considered. On the error of excluding under Rule 408 the IH offer and the White license I need add nothing to the majority opinion. Relevance under Rule 402 is also plain. The Court of Claims held that \u201cone or more\u201d licenses (even in settlement with others) furnish a relevant component for determining recovery. <em>Bendix Corp. v. United States, </em>676 F.2d 606, 616 (Ct.C1.1982); <em>Pitcairn v. United States, </em>547 F.2d 1106, 1118, 212 Ct.Cl. 168, 192 USPQ 612, 622 (Ct.C1.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1051, 98 S.Ct. 903, 54 L.Ed.2d 804 (1978); <em>Saulnier </em>v. <em>United States, </em>314 F.2d 950, 161 Ct.Cl. 223, 137 USPQ 222 (Ct.C1.1963). <em>See also Columbia Broadcasting Systems, Inc. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>537 F.2d 896, 898, 192 USPQ 68, 70 (7th Cir.1976); <em>Beatty Safway Scaffold Co. v. Up-Right, Inc., </em>306 F.2d 626, 632, 134 USPQ 379, 384 (9th Cir.1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 934, 83 S.Ct. 881, 9 L.Ed.2d 766 (1963). <em>Pitcairn, supra, </em>also ruled that a deliberate prelitigation offer by the patentee is to be taken into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-10\">3. The District Court\u2019s error in failing to consider the IH offer and the White license was not insignificant. These were the only offers or licenses by Deere (with respect to this patent) that were before the court below. They clearly had a substantial bearing on the reasonable compensation to which Deere was entitled for infringing use of the invention. <em>See Trio Process Corp. v. L. Goldstein\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>612 F.2d 1353, 1358, 204 USPQ 881, 884 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 827, 101 S.Ct. 91, 66 L.Ed.2d 30 (1980). I do not say that they demonstrated the upper limit of Deere\u2019s recovery, or that Deere was restricted to the specific rate provided in that offer and license. <em>Cf. Tektronix, Inc. v. United States, </em>552 F.2d 343, 347-351, 213 Ct.Cl. 257, 193 USPQ 385, 390-93 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1048, 99 S.Ct. 724, 58 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978); <em>Panduit Corp. v. Stahlin Bros. Fibre Works, Inc., </em>575 F.2d 1152, 1158, 197 USPQ 726, 731 (6th Cir.1978). I do say that that evidence was pertinent and should have formed an important basic factor in the trial court\u2019s evaluation of the proper compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-11\">4. Another important error of the District Court was its loading into its determination of the 15% royalty rate of a <em>\u201cvery substantial percentage </em>of net sales royalty, <em>even exceeding [IH\u2019s] expected profit in corn heads, </em>to protect its combine sales and profits\u201d (emphasis added). (Fdg. 29).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since neither Deere\u2019s nor IH\u2019s combines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>was at all covered by the Schreiner patent (which pertained only to corn heads), this amounts to holding that IH would have foregone all of its profits on the patented article \u2014 and even eaten into its corn head costs, thus incurring a loss on the patented article \u2014 in order to save its own combine business. Conceivably, IH might in fact have voluntarily (though possibly without legal basis) agreed to such a drastic arrangement, but to me it seems improper for a court to impose that component in a \u201cwilling buyer-willing seller\u201d analysis. Deere could not explicitly condition a license under the corn head patent upon IH\u2019s paying such tribute to Deere either on IH\u2019s combine sales or on Deere\u2019s loss of combine sales. <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., </em>395 U.S. 100, 136-37, 89 S.Ct. 1562, 1583, 23 L.Ed.2d 129 (1969); <em>Rex Chainbelt, Inc. v. Harco Products, Inc., </em>512 F.2d 993, 1000-1003, 185 USPQ 10, 14-16 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 831, 96 S.Ct. 52, 46 L.Ed.2d 49 (1975). But what the District Court did here was, in effect, to mandate just such an improper tieing relationship, in the guise of assuming that IH would agree to it. <em>See Velo-Bind, Inc. v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>647 F.2d 965, 972, 211 USPQ 926, 933 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1093, 102 S.Ct. 658, 70 L.Ed.2d 631 (1981). The court either allowed Deere to recover in this suit a good portion of its own lost combine sales or the court gratuitously transferred from IH to Deere a portion of the former\u2019s combine profits \u2014 each factor being forbidden to the patentee under our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-4\">5. For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment below in No. 83-565 and remand for a determination, on the proper basis, of Deere\u2019s compensation for infringement of its corn head patent. <em>See Bandag, Inc. v. Gerrard Tire Company, Inc., </em>704 F.2d 1578 (Fed.Cir.1983). As indicated above (footnote *), I join in reversal as to No. 83-566 (pre-judgment interest).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1649-16\"> I agree with (1) the court\u2019s discussion upholding the admissibility under Rule 408, Federal Rules of Evidence, of Deere\u2019s offer to International Harvester (IH) and of Deere\u2019s license to White Motor Company (White), and (2) the court\u2019s discussion and disposition of Deere\u2019s appeal on pre-judgment interest (No. 83-566).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1650-5\">. Conclusion of Law No. 5 declares that the White license is \u201cnot relevant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1650-6\">. In finding 10, the District Court found the following with respect to the relationship between sales of com heads and of combines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1650-7\">The substantial reduction in revenue from com head sales that IH faces is self-evident from its own projections. However, their full significance can only be appreciated by placing them [corn head sales] in the context of the relationship between corn head and combine sales. Com being by far the largest crop in the United States, corn heads made possible the harvesting of com with a combine and thus created a vast additional mar-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>ket for combines. To be a viable supplier of combines, it is absolutely essential for an agricultural equipment manufacturer to have desirable com heads to go with them, because the com crop is harvested primarily by combines fitted with com heads. In IH\u2019s case, some 70% of its combines are sold with com heads, and if unable to supply acceptable com heads, IH\u2019s combine production would have to be reduced by about 60%. Because the profit realized from combine sales is about three times that derived from com head sales, there is a powerful economic incentive to protect combine sales. IH\u2019s Vice President of Harvesting Technology, Mr. Wells, agreed that whoever is going to sell combines must have an acceptable corn head, and that it would have been an \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d for IH not to have been able to sell its combines.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
