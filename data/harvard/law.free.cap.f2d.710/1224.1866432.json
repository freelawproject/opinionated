The district court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for failure to prosecute the actions and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2)(C)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for failure to cooperate in discovery. The court further denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from the dismissal order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">The plaintiff, as a black male, was employed by Greyhound Lines as a bus driver in 1966. In August of 1973, Stevens was discharged from his employment with Greyhound for allegedly hitting a fellow Greyhound employee, Valerie Billups, but after an arbitration hearing, was reinstated in January of 1974. Greyhound again terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment seven months later in July of 1974, this time for allegedly falsifying his time records and for becoming \u201cinvolved in an altercation with a [Greyhound] terminal employee which resulted in [Stevens] receiving a gun shot wound .... \u201d Stevens again went to arbitration and was ordered reinstated to his employment. Four years later, while in Greyhound\u2019s employ, Stevens filed his first federal district court suit alleging that Greyhound had discriminated against him on the basis of race in terminating his employment in 1973 and 1974.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court set a trial date of August 11, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-15\">Sometime in 1979,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiff received a third and final discharge for allegedly harassing a fellow employee at the Greyhound terminal. On August 7, 1980, four days before the lawsuit arising from the 1973 and 1974 employment discharge was scheduled for trial, Stevens filed a second lawsuit in the district court, alleging that he had been discharged a third time because of his race and also because he had previously sued Greyhound for racial discrimination. The court granted Stevens\u2019 motion to consolidate both racial discrimination actions, and set a trial date of September 21, 1981 for the consolidated actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>On July 14, 1981, approximately two months before the scheduled trial date, the plaintiff filed a formal complaint against his attorney with the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission, alleging that his attorney \u201cdidn\u2019t care about handling [the] case\u201d and that his attorney had made disparaging racial remarks concerning him (Stevens). After the filing of this complaint, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney moved the district court for permission to withdraw from representing the plaintiff. Stevens opposed the withdrawal motion, even though he had previously expressed his dissatisfaction with his attorney to the Disciplinary Commission. In light of the contested withdrawal motion, the court once again continued the September 21,1981 trial date, and reassigned the case for trial to begin on December 14, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">At an October 30, 1981 pre-trial conference, the trial court granted Stevens\u2019 attorney\u2019s leave to withdraw and instructed the plaintiff to secure new counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Late in the week preceding the December 14, 1981 trial date, the court learned that the plaintiff in fact had failed to obtain new counsel as of this date and would be without counsel for trial on December 14. Nevertheless, the court held an on-the-record conference on December 14, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">At the conference the plaintiff stated that while he had made efforts to obtain new counsel through the NAACP, he informed the court that he had not yet formally retained a lawyer. The primary reasons the plaintiff gave for his lack of counsel were his inability to obtain his records from his former counsel and lack of funds sufficient to retain new counsel. In an effort to remedy the situation, Judge Steck-ler had his clerk arrange with the lawyer for the return of Stevens\u2019 records. The attorney also agreed to waive any outstanding fees for representing Stevens. The court advised Stevens that he could obtain his records from the attorney, after which the following discussion took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1316-6\">\u201cThe Court: Well, all I can say, now we will give a new trial date, and I will tell you, Mr. Stevens, I will have no alternative except to dismiss your lawsuit if we don\u2019t go to trial on the next trial date. Now, when can you get a lawyer? I\u2019m going to let you tell me. I\u2019m trying to accommodate you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1316-9\">\u201cMr. Stevens: I think it will take me\u2014 well, I can get a lawyer, but the fact by the time he reads the files, and I think it will probably take me a month to go back to trial, by the time I pay a lawyer, borrow money to pay a lawyer and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1316-10\">\u201cThe Court: Do you have a date?

I was just trying to \u2014 the week of the 29th of March is fine, and we will be prepared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-8\">\u201cThe Court: Well, the case is reset for March 29th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-9\">\u201cMr. Halberstadt: 9:30 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-10\">\u201cThe Court: And if we don\u2019t get it tried then, I don\u2019t know how we will be by the time we get to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-11\">\u201cMr. Stevens: I will be prepared, sir. The file was all I needed. I will be prepared. If I don\u2019t, it won\u2019t be no excuse as far as I am concerned, because you did give me that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1317-12\">On March 1, 1982, the defendant served the plaintiff with a notice to take his personal deposition on March 16, 1982 along with a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>requesting the plaintiff to bring with him copies of all documents he intended to submit as exhibits at trial. After Stevens appeared at the deposition empty-handed, without counsel and without copies of the documents, the following exchange between the defendant\u2019s attorney and Stevens took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-13\">\u201cQ: This is a subpoena for you to appear at the offices of John Connor &amp; Associates, Court Reporters, on Tuesday, March 16,1982 at 9 o\u2019clock a.m. for deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-14\">\u201cA: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-15\">\u201cQ: This document provides to bring with you copies of all documents that you as plaintiff intend to submit as exhibits at trial of the above causes of action; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-16\">\u201cA: That\u2019s what it says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-17\">\u201cQ: Do you have with you copies of the documents that you intend to submit as exhibits at trial of this cause of action on March 29, 1982?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-18\">\u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-19\">\u201cQ: Are you represented by an attorney today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-20\">\u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-21\">\u201cQ: Do you have an' attorney presently representing you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-22\">\u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-23\">\u201cQ: Are you willing to proceed with deposition today without counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-24\">\u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-25\">\u201cQ: You are indicating that even though you have been given notice of the deposition and served with subpoena that you are refusing to proceed with deposition today, March 16, 1982?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-26\">\u201cA: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-27\">\u201cMr. Maley: I would like to introduce as part of the record these exhibits 1 and 2 being the notice to take the deposition and the subpoena duces tecum to give deposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-28\">\u201cQ: Do you have any objection to those two documents 'being made part of the record to be submitted to the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-29\">\u201cA: Don\u2019t make me no difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-30\">\u201cQ: You do understand that a copy of this proceeding that we have had this morning is going to be submitted to Judge Steckler?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-31\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-32\">\u201cQ: Knowing that, it is still your position that you will not proceed with deposition today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-33\">\u201cA: That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1317-34\">The next day Greyhound moved the court to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s actions pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2)(C) and 41(b), and on March 18 the court granted Greyhound\u2019s motion, dismissing the actions with prejudice \u201cfor failure to prosecute pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) and for failure to make discovery. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(C).\u201d On April 9, 1982, Attorney Loren J. Comstock appeared before the court on behalf of the plaintiff and filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) for relief from the court\u2019s dismissal order. The trial court denied the Rule 60(b) motion. The plaintiff appeals from the court\u2019s dismissal order and from the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">The first issue in this case is whether the district court properly relied on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b) in dismissing the plaintiffs action after Stevens failed to deliver the subpoenaed material and refused to proceed with his deposition. In its dismissal, the court cited Rule 37(b)(2)(C), which provides that a suit may be dismissed if \u201ca party .. . fails to obey an <em>order </em>to provide or permit discovery .... \u201d (emphasis added). As the court stated in <em>Fox v. Studebaker-Worthington, Inc., </em>516 F.2d 989, 994 (8th Cir.1975): \u201cFed.R.Civ.P. Rule 37(b) provides comprehensively for sanctions for failure to obey discovery orders. It has no application if there has not been a court order.\u201d <em>Accord, </em>8 <em>Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure </em>Section 2289. Since the trial court did not issue a discovery order directing the plaintiff to submit to deposition prior to dismissing the suit, the trial court\u2019s reliance on Rule 37(b)(2)(C) in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s suit was misplaced. Furthermore, even though the court did not cite Rule 37(d) as a basis for its dismissal order, it is clear that Rule 37(d) also fails to provide a basis for dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s suit. Under Rule 37(d), the court may impose sanctions directly, without first issuing an order to compel discovery where \u201ca party ... fails ... to appear before the officer who is to take his deposition after being served with a proper notice.... \u201d Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(d); <em>Charter House Ins. Brokers v. New Hampshire Ins., </em>667 F.2d 600, 604 (7th Cir.1981). Rule 37(d) had been construed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1318-5\">\u201c[W]e believe that the term \u2018appear\u2019 as used in Rule 37(d) must be strictly construed, limiting it to the case where a defendant literally fails to show up for a deposition session. Where a defendant does in fact appear physically for the taking of his deposition but refuses to cooperate by being sworn and by testifying, the proper procedure is first to obtain an order from the court, as authorized by Rule 37(a), directing him to be sworn and testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1318-8\"><em>Securities and Exch. Comm. v. Research Automation Corp., </em>521 F.2d 585, 588-89 (2d Cir.1975).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Accord, Securities and Exchange Comm. v. American Beryllium &amp; Oil Corp., </em>303 F.Supp. 912, 920 (S.D.N.Y.1969). Since the plaintiff in this case did <em>appear </em>for his deposition (though he then refused to answer any questions), we conclude that dismissal under Rule 37(d) would not have been appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-9\">We next consider whether the district court properly dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s suit under Rule 41(b) for failure to prosecute. Appellate review of a Rule 41(b) dismissal order for failure to prosecute is limited to whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s actions. <em>Link v. Wabash, </em>370 U.S. 626, 629-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1388-89, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962); <em>Jafree v. Scott, </em>590 F.2d 209, 212 (7th Cir.1978). \u201cNo exact rule can be laid down as to when a court is justified in dismissing a case for failure to prosecute. Each case must be looked at with regard to its own particular procedural history and the situation at the time of dismissal.\u201d <em>Scarver </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>457 F.2d 308, 309 (7th Cir.1972), quoting <em>Sandee Manufacturing Company </em>v. <em>Rohm and Haas Company, </em>298 F.2d 41, 43 (7th Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-10\">Our resolution of this case is governed by the principles set forth in this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Locascio v. Teletype Corporation, </em>694 F.2d 497 (7th Cir.1982). In <em>Locas-cio, </em>the plaintiff brought a class action suit alleging age discrimination. The plaintiff\u2019s first attorney withdrew from the case ten days after filing the suit, and more than three years later, the plaintiff\u2019s second attorney also withdrew from the case because of a \u201cprogressive deterioration in the attorney/client relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498. Upon granting the second attorney\u2019s request to withdraw, the district court instructed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>plaintiffs to secure replacement counsel to represent them at a status conference scheduled two weeks later and warned the plaintiffs that \u201cdrastic consequences ... would ensue should they fail to obtain an attorney to represent them at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499. However, the plaintiffs failed to secure new counsel to represent them at the status conference two weeks before trial, despite the court\u2019s instruction to do so. Furthermore, the plaintiffs failed to advise the district court that any efforts were being made to secure new counsel. On the day set for trial, an attorney appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs failed to arrive in time for a motion call to set a new trial date. Based on this course of behavior, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action for failure to prosecute, and this court affirmed the dismissal order. We quote the <em>Locascio </em>opinion at length because of its direct bearing on this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1319-5\">\u201cWhile there are no clear-cut rules governing the exercise of discretion on a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute, this circuit has adhered to a standard which looks to the question of arbitrariness on the part of the trial court in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion warranting reversal. <em>Link. </em>In general we will not set aside a trial court\u2019s discretionary order unless it is clear that no reasonable person could concur in the trial court\u2019s assessment of the issue under consideration. <em>Beshear v. Weinzapfel, </em>474 F.2d 127 (7th Cir.1973) (adopting the standards set forth in <em>Particle Data Laboratories, Inc. v. Coulter Electronics, Inc., </em>420 F.2d 1174, 1178 (7th Cir.1969), governing appellate review of actions within a trial .court\u2019s discretion).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1319-6\">\u201cThe instant case is a close and difficult one, due to the number of plaintiffs involved, external factors such as the congestion of the trial court\u2019s docket, and the severity of the sanction imposed. The interests of justice require that the use of such an extreme and final solution as dismissal with prejudice be held in abeyance until it is clear that lesser sanctions either have not been or will not be effective to remedy the dilatory conduct. However, this court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the trial court simply because it might have acted differently in the trial judge\u2019s place. The record indicates a lack of prosecutive intent on plaintiffs\u2019 part in their inability to secure and retain counsel whom they were willing to allow to effectively prosecute their action, and in their failure to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the trial court that they had been and were continuing to make a concerted good faith effort to obtain an attorney to represent them at trial. Judge Getzendanner warned them of the drastic consequences that would ensue should they fail to secure a replacement for their trial attorney .... \u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akd\">In this case the trial court admonished the plaintiff on two separate occasions, October 30 and December 14, 1981, to retain other counsel to represent him. In fact, on December 14, the court specifically informed Stevens \u201cthat I will have no alternative except to dismiss your lawsuit if we don\u2019t go to trial on the next trial date.\u201d Stevens responded by stating: \u201cI will be prepared. If I don\u2019t, it won\u2019t be no excuse as far as I am concerned, because you did give me that time.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, three months later and less than two weeks before the trial date, Stevens appeared for his deposition hearing without an attorney, without the documents requested in the subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>and refused to proceed. Even though he had had three months to retain an attorney, he failed to do so and made no effort to inform the court that he had attempted to or was unable to secure counsel. In light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>trial court\u2019s two separate instructions to Stevens to secure replacement counsel, even one untrained in the law should have realized the need to inform the court of his inability to retain an attorney, and to explain why he was unable to do so. <em>See Anthony v. Marion County General Hospital, </em>617 F.2d 1164, 1169 (5th Cir.1980). Even after his actions had been dismissed, Stevens provided the court with at the most a very limited and vague affidavit reciting only unsubstantiated allegations that financial problems precluded him from securing replacement counsel. It is significant that on December 14, 1982, before his case was dismissed, Stevens told the court that he would be prepared to go to trial on March 29, 1983, yet his failure to retain counsel and his refusal to cooperate in trial preparation (the March 16,1983 deposition) demonstrated that it was virtually certain that the plaintiff would have been unprepared to proceed with trial on the scheduled trial date. Furthermore, in failing to heed the court\u2019s instructions to retain an attorney and in refusing to cooperate in trial preparation (the deposition), the plaintiff not only demonstrated that he would be unprepared for trial, but he also frustrated the defendant in its attempt to adequately prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">Viewing this case \u201cwith regard to its own particular procedural history and the situation at the time of dismissal\u201d, the district court could reasonably have concluded that Stevens\u2019 conduct, viewed in its entirety, indicated \u201ca lack of prosecutive intent ... \u201d, <em>Locascio, </em>694 F.2d at 499, sufficient to justify dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s actions less than two weeks before the scheduled trial date. Although his refusal to cooperate at the deposition hearing did not <em>of itself </em>justify dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s suit, we conclude, based on the totality of the facts and circumstances in this case, including the plaintiff\u2019s forcing the court on two separate occasions to grant a continuance due to the plaintiff\u2019s failure to retain counsel and prepare for trial, that \u201ca reasonable person could concur in the trial court\u2019s assessment of the issue under consideration,\u201d <em>Locascio, </em>694 F.2d at 499. Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action under Rule 41(b) prior to the scheduled trial date since (1) the lawsuit had been pending for over four years and the court was forced to grant three continuances, two of which were necessary because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to secure counsel and prepare for trial; (2) each delay in trying the case resulted in additional expense for the defendant and inconvenience for witnesses; (3) the court instructed the plaintiff on two separate occasions to obtain replacement counsel; (4) the court unequivocally warned the plaintiff of the consequences of a failure to obtain replacement counsel; (5) the plaintiff stated that he understood the consequences of failing to secure new counsel; (6) Stevens failed to advise the court over a three-month period that he was allegedly unable to secure new counsel; and (7) Stevens subsequently provided only vague generalized reasons for not securing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">While we recognize that dismissal is a harsh sanction only to be imposed in extreme circumstances and that the law favors giving plaintiffs their day in court, <em>Scarver v. Allen, </em>457 F.2d at 310, we must bear in mind that if our heavily burdened court system is to operate in an efficient manner and protect the interests of all litigants, including those long awaiting a trial date, courts must have at their disposal the sanction of dismissal in order to ensure that litigants who are vigorously pursuing their cases are not hindered by those who are not. The trial court demonstrated great patience with the plaintiff and a willingness to afford the plaintiff an opportunity to have his case heard. When it granted a continuance on December 14, 1981, the court stated: \u201cI want to give him plenty of time. I want the case prepared; I want to try it. If he wants another year, we will give him another year.\u201d However, it is critically important that a trial court be able to maintain control over its calendar and that a trial date once set must be adhered to unless there are compelling reasons for granting a continuance. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>\u201c[T]he most severe in the spectrum of sanctions provided by statute or rule must be available to the district court in appropriate cases, not merely to penalize those whose conduct may be deemed to warrant such a sanction, but to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANuL\">427 U.S. 639, 643, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">Our review of plaintiffs motion seeking relief from the district court\u2019s dismissal order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) is likewise limited to whether or not the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States v. $48,595, </em>705 F.2d 909 (7th Cir.1983); <em>Planet Corporation v. Sullivan, </em>702 F.2d 123 (7th Cir.1982). \u201cRule 60(b) provides for extraordinary relief and may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Planet Corporation v. Sullivan, </em>702 F.2d at 125. (citations omitted). The crux of Stevens\u2019 argument with regard to his Rule 60(b) motion seeking relief from the district court\u2019s dismissal order is that his failure to secure counsel amounts to excusable neglect on his part, and that because of \u201cmistake and inadvertence\u201d Stevens did not understand the severity of the sanctions which might be imposed against him. We reject Stevens\u2019 argument since the trial court on two separate occasions (October 30 and December 14, 1981) instructed the plaintiff to secure replacement counsel; the record of the December 14, 1981 hearing makes it eminently clear that Stevens was not only expressly advised that his case could be dismissed but, in fact, Stevens stated that he understood that his case would be dismissed if he failed to secure new counsel in a timely fashion. We hold that the plaintiff has failed to make a showing of exceptional circumstances justifying relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant the plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from the dismissal order. We Affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-9\">\u201c(b) Involuntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof. For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him.... Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">.

A similarly strict construction of the term \u201cappear\u201d is equally appropriate where the sanction is a dismissal of a plaintiff\u2019s suit as in this case. We express no opinion as to the proper construction of the term \u201cappear\u201d in cases involving sanctions less severe than default judgment or dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1319-7\">.

Reversing the district court, Chief Judge Robinson stated that \u201c[w]e might well assess the situation differently if this had not been his first infraction and especially if the court in addition to pinpointing his next appearance date, had informed Camps specifically of the consequences of late arrival.\u201d 692 F.2d at 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1319-11\">.
