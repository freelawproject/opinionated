The applicable statute of limitations (insofar as relevant here) provides that this action</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj0\">shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action accrues ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a). The district court held that the government\u2019s \u201cright of action accrue^]\u201d before December 5, 1973 (six years before the complaint was filed) and it dismissed the action. The government appeals. After examining the positions taken by district courts and some circuit courts of appeals on the question of accrual date, we conclude that, for most of the payments here at issue, the statute of limitations began to run when the administrative body made the \u201cfinal retroactive adjustment\u201d to the Nursing Home\u2019s account. <em>Compare United States v. Pisani, </em>646 F.2d 83, 89 (3d Cir.1981) (cause of action accrues at time of final audit); <em>United States v. Withrow, </em>593 F.2d 802 (7th Cir.1979) (same); <em>and United States v. Normandy House Nursing Home, Inc., </em>428 F.Supp. 421 (D.Mass.1977) (same); <em>with United States v. Gravette Manor Homes, Inc., </em>642 F.2d 231 (8th Cir.1981) (cause of action accrues at time of final adjustment); <em>United States v. White House Nursing Home, Inc., </em>484 F.Supp. 29 (M.D.Fla.1979) (same); <em>United States v. Graham, </em>471 F.Supp. 123 (S.D.Tex.1979) (same); <em>and United States </em>v. <em>Gottlieb, </em>424 F.Supp. 417 (S.D.Fla.1976) (treating final adjustment and audit as simultaneous); <em>cf. United States </em>v. <em>Bragg, </em>493 F.Supp. 470 (M.D.Fla.1980) (for payments for medically unnecessary services, cause of action accrues when payment is made). Since that adjustment was made within the relevant six-year period, the government may proceed with its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b982-17\">The government\u2019s cause of action \u201caccrues\u201d and the statute of limitations starts to run when the government (through Blue Cross, the \u201cfiscal intermediary\u201d) can legally require the provider to repay the overpayment. <em>See United States v. One 1961 Red Chevrolet, </em>457 F.2d 1353, 1358 (5th Cir.1972); <em>Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Bendix Westinghouse Automotive Air Brake Co., </em>372 F.2d 18, 20 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 U.S. 930, 87 S.Ct. 2053, 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>L.Ed.2d 992 (1967) (a cause of action accrues with the occurrence of the final significant event necessary to make the claim suable). The district court found it helpful to view government and provider as having entered into a \u201ccontract.\u201d This is a useful analogy; and, in any event, the Medicare statutes, rules and regulations create the basic \u201ccontractual terms\u201d that the government claims the provider breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">Insofar as relevant here, those statutes and regulations provide the following service and payment obligations: The program itself is designed to guarantee health care providers a steady flow of income sufficient to provide service, while ensuring that the government pays no more than the reasonable costs of that service. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395h(a), 1395x(v)(l)(A); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.401, 405.402(b)(l)-(2), 405.454(a)-(b). Accordingly, the \u201cfiscal intermediary\u201d (here, Blue Cross) is to make \u201cinterim payments\u201d to the providers, at least monthly. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395g; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.454(b). These interim payments are based upon estimates of the provider\u2019s costs. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.405, 405.454. At the end of each year, the provider is to give the intermediary a statement of its actual costs, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.406(b); the intermediary will then make an \u201cinitial retroactive adjustment\u201d bringing the money that the provider received in line with its costs as revealed in the statement. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.454(f)(2). Subsequently, the intermediary is to audit the cost reports, to determine the actual \u201creasonable cost\u201d of the services. This audit \u201cconstitute[s] the basis\u201d for a <em>final </em>\u201cretroactive adjustment.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-1803(b); see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A)(ii). In addition to this basic scheme of monthly payments, the intermediary may make \u201caccelerated payments\u201d to a provider with cash flow problems, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.454(h), and, prior to May 29, 1973, the intermediary could grant interest-free loans to needy providers, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.454(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">For purposes of this appeal, we assume that the Home was overpaid. The issue is when the government\u2019s claim to recover the overpayment accrued: (1) at the time the Home received the money initially; (2) at the time the intermediary made the \u201cinitial retroactive adjustment\u201d; (3) when the intermediary made the final audit; or (4) when the intermediary made the \u201cfinal retroactive adjustment\u201d on the basis of the audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">The district court chose the first of these times; it chose the date when the Home first received the money. In keeping with the \u201ccontract\u201d theory, it analogized the situation to one party to a contract overpaying another by mistake. In such circumstances, the statute of limitations typically begins to run \u201cupon the receipt of payment without regard to when the mistake is discovered.\u201d <em>City of New Bedford </em>v. <em>Lloyd Investment Associates, Inc., </em>292 N.E.2d 688, 692 (Mass.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">While the district court\u2019s analogy is tempting, we do not believe it consistent with the rules and regulations that determine the parties\u2019 obligation. Rather, those regulations suggest that nearly all of the claims set forth in the government\u2019s complaint did not accrue prior to the final audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">For one thing, the regulations indicate that no \u201cmistake\u201d was involved. The initial interim payments to providers typically depart from actual costs, not through \u201cmistake,\u201d but because the Medicare program\u2019s administrators consciously have determined that estimated payments should be placed directly in the hands of the providers quickly (so that they have funds with which to operate) even though so doing concededly will lead to \u201cunderpayments\u201d or \u201coverpay-ments\u201d throughout the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">Moreover, the Department of Health and Human Services has developed a specific payment adjustment procedure that entitles the provider (or the intermediary) to keep any overpayment (or underpayment) until a specified cost statement is filed, or a final audit takes place, or a final \u201cadjustment\u201d is made. Here, the \u201cinitial retroactive adjustment\u201d created no liability to the government because that adjustment is determined by taking at face value the provider\u2019s cost data statements. The government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>claims here are not based upon discrepancies between the provider\u2019s statement and the interim payments; rather, for the most part, they rest upon the later audit that allegedly revealed, among other things, that the Home had claimed excessive costs and that it owed Blue Cross \u201cexcess accelerated depreciation,\u201d <em>see </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.415(d)(3). The government can require the provider to repay any \u201cinitial adjustment\u201d overpayment at once, but the provider remains subject to further liability for any additional discrepancy revealed by the audit, <em>see United States v. Gottlieb, </em>424 F.Supp. at 420, and it is this further discrepancy that is here at issue. With a single exception, discussed in Part II, no statute, rule or regulation gives the government any right to collect any additional overpayment of the sort described above before a final audit, formally determining its existence, takes place. <em>Cf. Crown Coat Front Co. v. United States, </em>386 U.S. 503, 515, 87 S.Ct. 1177, 1184, 18 L.Ed.2d 256 (1967) (cause of action under disputes clause in a government contract accrues upon completion of administrative proceedings required by the contract). Whether or not Blue Cross suspects, believes, or even knows that, for example, the Nursing Home\u2019s claimed costs are inflated, under existing regulations it has no definite claim to recover the overpayment before the audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Further, to look to the regulatory scheme to decide when the fiscal intermediary can require the Home to repay does not give the government undue power to control the timing of a lawsuit. The government has no direct incentive to delay the audit, the \u201cfinal adjustment,\u201d or any subsequent suit. Ordinarily, any such delay will simply reduce its ultimate chances of recovery. In fact, the government, as a specific aniidote to bureaucratic indifference, has granted to a provider who does not receive a final determination within 12 months of filing its cost report the right to obtain a hearing from the Provider Reimbursement Review Board. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(a); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1835. While this 1973 regulation came too late to help appellees, it minimizes the risk that reliance on the regulations rather than the date of payment will unfairly delay the cause of action accrual date.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">While these considerations make clear that the government\u2019s claims did not accrue before the \u201cfinal audit,\u201d we must still decide whether they accrued at that time (unrevealed in the record) or later, when the \u201cfinal retroactive adjustment\u201d was made (Jan. 29,1975). Some courts have chosen to rely on the date of the audit, <em>United States v. Pisani, supra; United States v. Withrow, supra; United States v. Normandy House Nursing Home, Inc., supra, </em>while others have chosen the date of the final adjustment. <em>United States v. Gravette Manor Homes, Inc., supra; United States v. White House Nursing Home, Inc., supra; United States v. Graham, supra. </em>We agree with the Eighth Circuit in <em>United States v. Gra-vette Manor Homes, Inc., </em>that the \u201cfinal adjustment\u201d date governs. As that court pointed out, the audit does not fix liability until \u201cthe official of the intermediary who has the authority to approve and certify the yearly audits has done so.\u201d <em>Gravette, </em>642 F.2d at 234. Moreover, this certification is not simply a matter of form, for \u201c[sjignifi-cant changes\u201d may be made between audit and formal certification, \u201cinvolving either corrections of the amount due for the year in question, or revisions with respect to other years, either prior or subsequent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In following <em>Gravette </em>on this point, we note that none of the \u201caudit date\u201d cases explicitly focused on the difference between the audit and the final adjustment. Apparently they assume that the dates of these \u2022 two events virtually coincided, or that the difference was not relevant to the cases before them. Thus, we do not consider them as serious authority to the contrary. To the extent that our present decision is at odds with <em>United States v. Normandy House Nursing Home, Inc., </em>428 F.Supp. 421 (D.Mass.1977), that case is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">In sum, the government\u2019s cause of action accrued when, under its regulations, it became entitled to demand its money back from the Home. And, those regulations indicate that it became entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>demand most of the money once the \u201cfinal adjustment\u201d was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">We note one exception to our \u201cfinal adjustment\u201d conclusion. One of the items which the government seeks to recover is a \u201ccurrent financing payment\u201d \u2014 a form of loan that the government no longer provided to anyone after May 29, 1973. This payment is described in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-454(g), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-7\">Any current financing payments outstanding on May 29,1973, constitute over payments which are due and payable to the Social Security Administration as of such date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">The words \u201cdue and payable,\u201d present only in respect to this type of payment, indicate that the government could have demanded repayment of the amount of the current financing payment in May, 1973, over six years before the December, 1979 commencement of the present lawsuit. We believe this language sufficiently definite to indicate that the government\u2019s cause of action accrued on May 29, 1973. Hence its claim for recovery of those funds now is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Appellee Walter Hughes, an individual defendant, to whom the government looks (on a constructive trust theory) for return of the funds, argues that laches bars the government\u2019s personal claim against him. A virtually unbroken line of authority, however, holds that a private defendant cannot assert laches against the government. <em>Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, </em>304 U.S. 126, 132, 58 S.Ct. 785, 788, 82 L.Ed. 1224 (1938) (\u201cThe rule <em>quod nullum tempus occurrit regi ... </em>appears to be a vestigial survival of the prerogative of the Crown.... [T]he source of its continuing vitality ... [is] public policy .... \u201d); 14 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 3652 (1976) (citing numerous cases). <em>But see Lane v. United States, </em>633 F.2d 1384, 225 Ct.Cl. 209 (Ct.C1.1980) (apparently rejecting prior precedent but without discussion). We see no reason to depart from that long line of authority in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">\n<em>The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
