Yount was convicted in 1966 of first degree murder and rape in the Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery of Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. On direct appeal the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined that petitioner had not received adequate warnings against self-incrimination. It reversed the judgment of sentence and granted a new trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Yount, </em>435 Pa. 276, 256 A.2d 464 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 925, 90 S.Ct. 918, 25 L.Ed.2d 104 (1970) <em>(\u201cYount I\u201d). </em>After a retrial before the same court, petitioner was convicted of first degree murder and was again sentenced to life imprisonment. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on direct appeal affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v. Yount, </em>455 Pa. 303, 314 A.2d 242 (1974) <em>(\u201cYount II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\">In 1981 petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in United States District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his conviction had been obtained in violation of his fifth and fourteenth amendment privilege against self-incrimination and his sixth and fourteenth amendment right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The federal magistrate concluded that petitioner\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination had not been violated, but recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>that the petition be granted because petitioner had been denied a fair and impartial jury. App. at 124a-41a. The district court agreed on the former issue, rejected the magistrate\u2019s recommendation on the latter issue, and denied the petition. <em>Yount v. Patton, </em>537 F.Supp. 873 (W.D.Pa.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">We agree with the district court that petitioner\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination was not infringed. We conclude, however, that the petitioner\u2019s right to trial by a fair and impartial jury was violated. We will therefore remand that portion of the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">I. SELF-INCRIMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">A. <em>Facts</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">During the early evening of April 28, 1966, the body of Pamela Rimer, an 18-year old high school student, was found in a wooded area near her home in Luthersburg, Clearfield County. There were numerous wounds about her head, apparently caused by a blunt instrument. There were also cuts caused by a sharp instrument on her throat and neck. One of her stockings was knotted and tied around her neck. An autopsy showed that she had died of strangulation when blood from the throat and neck wounds was drawn into the lungs. Except for her stocking and shoe she remained fully clothed. The autopsy revealed no indication that she had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">Neighbors gave state police a description of a station wagon which they had seen at approximately the time and place at which the body was found. <em>E.g., </em>Testimony of Trial beginning November 17,1970, at 143-48 (\u201cT.T.\u201d). Sometime after two o\u2019clock on the morning of April 29, 1966, state policemen learned that petitioner, the victim\u2019s high school mathematics teacher, had on prior occasions been seen in a station wagon fitting that description. T.T. at 290-93; Transcript of Proceedings \u2014 August 17, 1970, at 17-18, 20-21 (\u201cT.P.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">At approximately 5:45 that morning, petitioner voluntarily appeared at the State Police Substation in DuBois, Clearfield County. The occupants of the substation had participated in the investigation of the Rimer homicide, T.T. at 198-201, 203-05, 255-56, but had gone to sleep unaware of any link between the homicide and petitioner or his vehicle. T.T. at 275, 277; T.P. at 13, 20.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner rang the doorbell. A trooper awoke, opened the door and asked whether he could be of assistance. Petitioner stated, \u201cI am the man you are looking for.\u201d The trooper asked petitioner to repeat what he had said, app. at 11a; T.T. at 250-51, and then asked whether petitioner was referring to \u201cthe incident in Lu-thersburg.\u201d Petitioner said yes. The trooper then asked petitioner to come in and be seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">Leaving petitioner unattended, the trooper went to a back bedroom and roused a detective and a second trooper. The first trooper informed them that \u201cthere was a man in the front that said we are looking for him\u201d in connection with the Luthers-burg incident. <em>See </em>T.T. at 276; T.P. at 6. The first trooper then returned to the front office where petitioner had removed his coat, hat and gloves. The trooper asked petitioner for his identification. Petitioner gave the trooper his wallet, which the trooper returned after removing petitioner\u2019s automobile operator\u2019s license. T.T. at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Shortly thereafter, the detective and the second trooper entered the front office. The detective was handed petitioner\u2019s license and learned that petitioner was Jon Yount. App. at 12a; T.T. at 259, 262-63, 271. The detective requested that petitioner be seated inside a smaller adjacent office, and gave petitioner something to eat. <em>See Yount I, </em>435 Pa. at 278, 256 A.2d at 465; T.P. at 15. The detective asked, \u201cWhy are we looking for you?\u201d Petitioner replied, \u201cI killed that girl.\u201d Upon hearing that answer, the detective inquired, \u201cWhat girl?\u201d, and petitioner responded, \u201cPamela Rimer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">The detective then asked, \u201cHow did you kill this girl?\u201d Petitioner answered, \u201cI struck her with a wrench and I choked her.\u201d At that time the detective undertook to advise petitioner of his rights. The detective, however, failed to tell petitioner of his right to court-appointed counsel if he could not afford his own attorney. The detective then conducted an interrogation regarding the details of the crime. At some point the second trooper searched petitioner and confiscated his penknife. T.T. at 265-66, 267-68, 272-73.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner gave his first written confession to the detective. Later the district attorney, after giving similarly inadequate warnings, questioned petitioner and obtained another written confession.</p>\n<p id=\"A-6\">B. <em>State Proceedings and Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">Before the first trial petitioner moved to suppress his statements and confessions as violative of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). After' a hearing the motion was denied. The petitioner\u2019s statements and confessions were admitted in the first trial over petitioner\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the warnings given by the detective and district attorney were inadequate under <em>Miranda. Yount </em>I, 435 Pa. at 279, 256 A.2d at 465 (Roberts, J., plurality opinion). The court rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the confessions were volunteered. \u201cAfter indicating a willingness to talk, [petitioner] was <em>interrogated </em>about details of the crime, and his formal confession followed.\u201d 435 Pa. at 279-80, 256 A.2d at 465 (emphasis in original); <em>see </em>435 Pa. at 281, 256 A.2d at 468 (Jones, C.J., concurring). The court found the confessions invalid and granted a new trial. 435 Pa. at 281, 256 A.2d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">Prior to the second trial petitioner requested that his oral and written statements be suppressed. The trial court on the authority of <em>Yount I </em>suppressed the written confessions, as well as the question \u201cHow did you kill this girl?\u201d and its answer. The trial court ruled, however, that petitioner\u2019s statement \u201cI killed that girl\u201d and his identification of \u201cthat girl\u201d as \u201cPamela Rimer\u201d were admissible under <em>Yount I. </em>App. at 748a, 755a. It concluded that petitioner\u2019s statements were made before petitioner was in custody. App. at 755a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">On appeal the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not determine whether petitioner was in \u201ccustody\u201d when he made the statements to the detective. <em>Yount II, </em>455 Pa. at 311 n. 4, 314 A.2d at 247 n. 4. Instead it ruled that the statements were volunteered and not the product of interrogation. The court said that the detective\u2019s first question, \u201cWhy are we looking for you?\u201d, was simply an extemporaneous response \u201cof neutral character.\u201d 455 Pa. at 310, 314 A.2d at 246. In the court\u2019s view the detective\u2019s question \u201cWhat girl?\u201d after petitioner had responded, \u201cI killed that girl,\u201d was merely \u201ca clarifying inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The supreme court therefore concluded that the questions were not calculated, expected or likely to elicit an incriminating response. 455 Pa. at 309, 314 A.2d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, petitioner again argued that his fifth and fourteenth amendment privilege against self-incrimination had been violated by the admission of his responses to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>detective\u2019s questions. The magistrate ruled that the responses were properly admitted because only after those responses, when \u201cthe police recognized that petitioner was present to confess his participation in a crime, did his presence become custodial.\u201d App. at 132a. The magistrate did not consider whether the questions constituted interrogation. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings. 537 F.Supp. at 875.</p>\n<p id=\"ABm\">C. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\"><em>Miranda </em>held that unless the government has advised a defendant of his rights, it cannot put into evidence statements stemming from the \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d of the defendant. 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. The Supreme Court defined \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-6\">questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A93\"><em>Id. </em>(note omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">Petitioner argues on appeal that his statements \u201cI killed that girl\u201d and \u201cPamela Rimer\u201d must be excluded as the products of custodial interrogation. He contends that the detective\u2019s questions constituted \u201cinterrogation,\u201d and asserts that the state policemen would not have allowed him to leave the substation when the questions were posed. We need not consider whether the questions \u201cWhy are we looking for you?\u201d and \u201cWhat girl?\u201d constituted interrogation under <em>Miranda </em>because we conclude that petitioner was not in \u201ccustody\u201d until after he had answered those questions. <em>See Beckwith v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 341, 345-46, 96 S.Ct. 1612, 1615-1616, 48 L.Ed.2d 1 (1976); <em>United States v. Mesa, </em>638 F.2d 582, 588 (3d Cir.1980) (opinion of Seitz, C.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">To determine whether an individual is in custody, we use the \u201cobjective test of whether the \u2018government has in some meaningful way imposed restraints on [a person\u2019s] freedom of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Steigler v. Anderson, </em>496 F.2d 793, 798 (3d Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Jaskiewicz, </em>433 F.2d 415, 419 (3d Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 1021, 91 S.Ct. 582, 27 L.Ed.2d 632 (1971)), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1002, 95 S.Ct. 320, 42 L.Ed.2d 277 (1974). Where, as here, the individual has not been openly arrested when the statements are made,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aa8-dedup-0\">something must be said or done by the authorities, either in their manner of approach or in the tone or extent of their questioning, which indicates that they would not have heeded a request to depart.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 799 (quoting <em>United States v. Hall, </em>421 F.2d 540, 545 (2d Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 1123, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970)); accord <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 714, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (per curiam); see Mesa, 638 F.2d at 587 n. 4 (opinion of Seitz, C.J.). When the questioning occurs in a police station we must scrutinize the circumstances surrounding the statements with extreme care for any taint of psychological compulsion or intimidation. <em>Steigler, </em>496 F.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">In making our determination, we are mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s caution that \u201ccustody\u201d must not be read too broadly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-15\">[P]olice officers are not required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to everyone whom they question. Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amh-dedup-0\"><em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. at 495, 97 S.Ct. at 714; <em>accord Steigler, </em>496 F.2d at 799. In particular we note the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Miranda:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-16\">There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime, or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statements he desires to make. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-17\">384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630 (note omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-18\">Petitioner came voluntarily and on his own initiative to the substation. The state police did not know why he was there. The first trooper left petitioner unattended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>while petitioner on his own accord removed his outer clothing. The detective testified that before he posed the questions he would have returned petitioner\u2019s operator\u2019s license and allowed him to leave had petitioner so requested. T.P. at 15-16. On this record we have no difficulty in concluding that petitioner was not in custody when the detective asked, \u201cWhy are we looking for you?\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>666 F.2d 478, 482 (11th Cir.1982); <em>see Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. at 495, 97 S.Ct. at 714; <em>Orozco v. Texas, </em>394 U.S. 324, 325, 89 S.Ct. 1095, 1096, 22 L.Ed.2d 311 (1969); <em>Barfield v. Alabama, </em>552 F.2d 1114, 1118 (5th Cir.1977). The admission of petitioner\u2019s response to that question therefore did not violate his fifth and fourteenth amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Petitioner\u2019s response, \u201cI killed that girl,\u201d was obviously highly incriminating. Although such an incriminating response undoubtedly heightened the detective\u2019s suspicion, it is police compulsion, and not the strength of police suspicions, which places a suspect in custody. <em>See Beckwith, </em>425 U.S. at 346-47, 96 S.Ct. at 1616-1617.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-5\">The more cause for believing the suspect committed the crime, the greater the tendency to bear down in interrogation and to create the kind of atmosphere of significant restraint that triggers <em>Miranda </em>.... But this is simply one circumstance, to be weighed with all the others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acq-dedup-0\"><em>Steigler, </em>496 F.2d at 799-800 (quoting <em>Hall, </em>421 F.2d at 545).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">The detective testified that petitioner remained free to leave the substation when the detective asked, \u201cWhat girl?\u201d T.P. at 5. The detective explained that only after petitioner gave the name of the girl and how he had killed her could the detective determine that the petitioner was not merely seeking personal aggrandizement by confessing to a sensational crime in which he had no part. T.P. at 3-4. Petitioner, on the other hand, does not allege that the state police did \u201canything different\u201d after he had stated, \u201cI killed that girl.\u201d <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioner on Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus at 19-20, 22-23 (\u201cBrief for Petitioner\u201d). Instead petitioner takes the position that he was in custody from the moment he identified himself, and that \u201ceither all the statements were voluntary or all were involuntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19; <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 33. In addition, we can find no evidence that the detective at that juncture used any additional \u201cforce or intimidation, physical or psychological, actual or implied,\u201d <em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Berne, </em>412 F.2d 1055,1060 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 837, 90 S.Ct. 96, 24 L.Ed.2d 87 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">Both the state trial court and the federal magistrate concluded that petitioner was not in custody until he responded, \u201cPamela Rimer.\u201d The district court agreed. After examining the peculiar factual circumstances of this case we cannot conclude that the district court erred. We therefore hold that petitioner\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination was not violated by the admission of his statements \u201cI killed that girl\u201d and \u201cPamela Rimer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">II. FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">A. <em>Facts and State Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">Clearfield County is a rural county with a population of approximately seventy thousand served by two newspapers with a total circulation of approximately twenty-five thousand. On April 29, 1966, each of the newspapers devoted its front page to the Rimer homicide and to petitioner\u2019s appearance at the substation. Both newspapers gave front-page coverage to the pre-trial proceedings, the voir dire of 104 veniremen, and the nine-day trial. In the DuBois <em>Courier Express </em>the publicity culminated in seventeen consecutive editions each bearing banner headlines and carrying at least two feature articles. The Clearfield <em>Progress </em>gave the case similarly intense coverage. As the papers related, public interest in the proceedings was unprecedented; <em>The Progress </em>later adjudged petitioner\u2019s trial the top news item of 1966.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>The coverage was as detailed as it was extensive, <em>see </em>app. at 135a, 136a. The newspapers related in full petitioner\u2019s detailed written confessions as well as his testimony at trial retelling the. homicide. They also detailed petitioner\u2019s defense of temporary insanity, the charge and evidence of rape, and finally petitioner\u2019s conviction on October 7,1966, of both rape and first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Petitioner\u2019s cause continued to receive front-page coverage at every step of his appeal. Banner headlines announced the reversal of the conviction in <em>Yount I. </em>The dissent was reprinted in full, and a local radio program became a forum in which callers expressed their hostility to petitioner. As the second trial approached, newspaper coverage increased. The selection of each juror merited an article and often a profile. By the close of voir dire the two newspapers had printed sixty-six front-page articles on the appeal and retrial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Petitioner was returned to Clearfield for retrial before the same judge. On May 5, 1970, petitioner requested a change of venue. He claimed that the publicity which had saturated the county since the murder, and the continuing discussion of the case among residents, made a fair trial in Clear-field County impossible. In particular, petitioner alleged that the dissemination of prejudicial information outside of evidence was so widespread that it could not be eradicated from the minds of potential jurors. The prosecution argued in response that the case had received so much publicity across the state that it would be useless to change the venue. The trial court found that after the initiation of the appeal the newspapers had merely publicized the actions of the courts \u201cwithout editorial comment of any kind.\u201d App. at 748a-49a. It denied the petition for change of venue on September 12, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">Jury selection began on November 4, 1970, and took ten days, seven jury panels, 292 veniremen and 1186 pages of testimony. One hundred and twenty-five of the 292 veniremen were excused because they had not been chosen properly. Four others were dismissed for cause before they were questioned on the case. Of the 163 remaining veniremen who were questioned, all but two had read of the case in the newspapers, had heard about it on radio or television, or were otherwise familiar with it. <em>See </em>app. at 135a, 137a. When asked whether they had discussed the case, had heard it discussed, or had heard others express their opinion as to petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence, over ninety percent said that they had. <em>See </em>app. at 135a, 137a.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-13\">Of the 163 veniremen questioned on the case, 121 were dismissed for cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ninety-six of those 121 veniremen were successfully challenged after they testified that they had firm and fixed opinions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which could not be changed regardless of what evidence was presented. <em>See </em>app. at 135a <em>&amp; </em>n. 13.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An additional 21 of the 121 veniremen were dismissed for cause after they said that they had an opinion which they could change only if the petitioner could convince them to do so. <em>See </em>app. at 135a-36a &amp; nn. 14, 15.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus 117 out of the 163 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>veniremen questioned were successfully challenged for cause after they said they could not set their opinion aside before entering the jury box.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">There were also nine other veniremen, unsuccessfully challenged for cause by petitioner, who indicated that they had an opinion which they could change only if the petitioner could convince them to do so.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When we combine those nine with the 117 veniremen dismissed for cause, we find that a total of 126 out of the 163 veniremen questioned on the case were willing to admit on voir dire that they would carry their opinion into the jury box.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">Voir dire gave other indications of the depth of community sentiment. One venireman, the wife of a minister, testified that she had heard too many opinions to be sure of her own. She was then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-6\">Q. Would your presence in serving as a juror create a difficulty in your parish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-7\">A. Why yes \u2014 when people heard my name was on for this \u2014 countless people of the church have come to me and said they hoped I would take \u2014 the stand I would take in case I was called. I have had a prejudice built up from the people in the church.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-8\">Q. Is this prejudice, has it been adverse to Mr. Yount?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-9\">A. Yes it was. They all say he had a fair trial and he got a fair sentence. He\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t get the chair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-11\">[T]he church people \u2014 I haven\u2019t asked for any of this but they discuss it in every group \u2014 but they say now since you are chosen and you will be there we expect you to follow through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-12\">Q. Notwithstanding what the court would tell you, you feel you would be subject to the retributions or retaliation of these people\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-15\">A. I think I would hear about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuNb\">App. at 410a, 412a. Another prospective juror said that his opinion had been erased by the passage of time, but his daughter-in-law later testified that he had left for jury duty voicing great animosity toward petitioner. App. at 430a, 527a-28a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-16\">After the first jury panel was exhausted, petitioner again moved for a change of venue. Although more than three quarters of the veniremen already questioned had admitted that they would carry an opinion into the jury box, the court orally denied the motion. On November 14, 1970, the trial court rejected petitioner\u2019s written motion for a change of venue. In its memorandum opinion, the trial court explained that the still-incomplete voir dire had taken so much time and covered so many veniremen because the court had been lenient in permitting extended examination of prospective jurors and in granting challenges for cause. App. at 194a-95a. It said that \u201calmost all, if not all, jurors seated had no prior or present fixed opinions.\u201d App. at 196a. The court noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-17\">that it has been 4 years since the first trial of this cause, and so far as this Court can recall, there has been little, if any, talk in public concerning the trial from that time to the time when it was announced that a trial date had been fixed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-18\"><em>Id. </em>The trial judge found the publicity was not unfair to the petitioner. App. at 197a. He added that few spectators had attended voir dire, which he took as some indication \u201cparticularly in a community as small as ours\u201d that the publicity had not had a great effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-19\">In fact the publicity had reached all but one of the twelve jurors and two alternates finally empanelled.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Juror No. 1 said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>he had read about the case and heard others express their opinions, but had never come to a \u201ctrue\u201d opinion. App. at 202a-04a, 207a. Juror No. 2 testified that he had recently discussed the case with others and had formed an opinion which was not firm and fixed and could be set aside. App. at 212a-15a, 218a-19a. The next of the jurors to be selected, Juror No. 4,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> had recently moved into Clearfield County and had never heard about the case. App. at 246a-52a. Juror No. 5 said that she \u201cremembered that they had said he was guilty before\u201d and wondered why petitioner was getting a new trial, but had no opinion and would try to forget what she knew. App. at 259a-63a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">Juror No. 6, James F. Hrin, testified that he had an opinion. He was then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-5\">Q. Would you be able to change your mind regarding your opinion before becoming a juror in this case? That\u2019s the way I must have you answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-6\">A. If the facts were so' presented I definitely could change my mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-7\">Q. Would you say you could enter the jury box presuming him to be innocent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-8\">A. It would be rather difficult for me to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-9\">Q. Can you enter the jury box with an open mind prepared to find your verdict on the evidence as presented at trial and the law presented by the Judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-10\">A. That I could do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayn-dedup-0\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-11\">Q. Did I understand Mr. Hrin you would require some \u2014 you would require evidence or something before you could change your opinion you now have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-12\">A. Definitely. If the facts show a difference from what I had originally had been led to believe, I would definitely change my mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-16\">Q. But until you\u2019re shown those facts, you would not change your mind \u2014 is that your position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-17\">A. Well \u2014 I have nothing else to go on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqo-dedup-0\">App. at 271a-73a. After repeatedly reiterating that he would need evidence to change his opinion, Juror Hrin said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the answer you want.\u201d App. at 275a. Finally when asked yet again whether he could set his opinion aside, he replied, \u201cI have to.\u201d App. at 276a. The court denied petitioner\u2019s challenge for cause, app. at 274a-75a, and petitioner did not exercise a peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-18\">Juror No. 7 said that he had formed an opinion but added that he was not sure that he still had an opinion or that he could forget what he knew. App. at 285a-88a, 298a-99a. Juror No. 8 had heard others discussing the case and had had an opinion. App. at 304a-05a. She testified that she had none at present except \u201cwhat he said himself \u2014 that he was guilty.\u201d App. at 309a-10a. She then said that she did not think she would consider in deliberations what she already knew. App. at 312a-13a. Juror No. 9 said that she had thought petitioner was guilty and wondered why a new trial was necessary, but added that now she would have to hear both sides before she could decide. App. at 322a-24a. Juror No. 10 had heard the opinions of others and had expressed his own. He admitted that it would be difficult to strike what he\u2019d heard before, but stated that he felt petitioner should \u201chave every opportunity to prove his innocence.\u201d App. at 336a, 338a-39a. Juror No. 11 testified that he had read about the case but had not formed an opinion. App. at 347a, 349a, 357a.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-19\">After petitioner had exhausted his peremptory challenges, two jurors and two alternates were seated over his challenges for cause. Both Juror No. 12 and replacement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>Juror No. 3 testified that they had heard about the case but had no opinion. App. at 362a-65a, 224a-28a. Alternate No. 1 stated that he had expressed an opinion which remained firm and fixed and which he would not put out of his mind until evidence was presented. App. at 380a-85a. Alternate No. 2 said that she had a definite opinion which she could not dismiss and which only evidence could change. App. at 395a-97a. Both alternates were sequestered with the jury; the jurors were told that they were free to discuss the case with other jurors when sequestered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">The trial lasted for four days. The prosecution presented quite a different case than it had at the first trial. Because of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Yount I, </em>the Commonwealth was unable to put into evidence petitioner\u2019s detailed written confessions. As a result, it chose not to retry petitioner on the rape charge. <em>See </em>537 F.Supp. at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">The change in the defense was even more marked. Petitioner did not take the stand to retell and explain the events revealed in the now-excluded confessions. He did not renew his claim of temporary insanity. Instead petitioner relied solely upon cross-examination and character witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">After he was again sentenced to life imprisonment, petitioner filed a post-conviction motion for a new trial on November 27, 1970. He claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred in rejecting several of his challenges for cause and in denying his petitions for a change of venue. The trial court rejected those arguments and dismissed the motion on January 15, 1973. It stated that there had been \u201cpractically no publicity\u201d during the four years between trial and retrial, and \u201cpractically no public interest\u201d shown at the second trial as few had attended on some days. App. at 751a. Voir dire had taken such a long time, it explained, because petitioner \u201craised so many questions and the court exercised its discretion to assure that there could be no complaint about the final jury empanelled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court adopted the trial court\u2019s post-conviction findings and affirmed the judgment of sentence on January 24, 1974. <em>Yount II, </em>455 Pa. at 311-12, 314 A.2d at 247. It ruled that the petitions for a change of venue were directed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and found no abuse of that discretion because \u201cthe record fails to disclose undue community prejudice.\u201d <em>Id., </em>455 Pa. at 312-14, 314 A.2d at 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">B. <em>Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, petitioner claimed that his conviction was obtained in violation of his right to a fair, impartial, and \u201cindifferent\u201d jury. In particular, he alleged that the trial court erred by refusing his motions for a change of venue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">After two days of evidentiary hearings, the United States Magistrate recommended that the petition be granted. He noted that the case involved a sensational homicide in a small rural community and that extensive publicity had surrounded both trials. App. at 136a, 141a. He found \u201ca strong community hostility toward the petitioner\u201d as well as \u201cpervasive community knowledge of the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141a. He characterized this case as one where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuF\">the public has been fully informed of the fact that the charged defendant had confessed to the crime, and that he had been previously tried and convicted of both rape and murder, and where on retrial the confession is suppressed but the public remains very much aware of the circumstances surrounding the case and has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>formed definite opinions as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\"><em>Id. </em>The magistrate calculated that over 70 percent of the veniremen and several of the jurors had testified that they had a fixed opinion, and stated that \u201ca certain pall is cast upon those in the minority who testified that they had not formed a fixed opinion and could judge the case on its merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140a-41a. In his view, the empan-elled jury was incapable of deciding the case solely on the evidence before it \u201cbut rather at best required the petitioner to prove his innocence or at least overcome strong preconceived notions as to his guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141a. The magistrate concluded that petitioner could not have received a fair trial by an impartial jury in Clearfield County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">The district court rejected the recommendation of the magistrate. Although the court recognized the community\u2019s \u201csubstantial knowledge\u201d of the case, it decided after an independent review of the record that the publicity had not been vicious or excessive. 537 F.Supp. at 877. It noted that the trial court had granted extensive latitude in the voir dire and stated that the exhaustion of the first panel of veniremen was not remarkable. <em>Id. </em>at 877, 882. The district court in its independent review also determined that all the jurors at some point said they could set aside their opinions. <em>Id. </em>at 877-82. Throughout it emphasized that the factual findings of the state court judge were presumptively correct under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1976). The district court concluded that petitioner had failed to 'carry his burden of establishing that actual prejudice had rendered a fair trial impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"aem-dedup-1\">C. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">Petitioner argues on appeal that the exposure of the venire to prejudicial pretrial publicity, and the refusal to grant a \u25a0 change of venue, violated his sixth amendment rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The sixth amendment guarantees to the accused the right to be tried \u201cby an impartial jury.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. Under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, the states are required to effectuate that right by giving \u201ca fair trial to the accused by a panel of impartial, \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors,\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 1642, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961); <em>accord Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 799, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2036, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975), \u201ccapable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 217, 102 S.Ct. 940, 946, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982); <em>see Sheppard v. Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 351, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 1516, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-10\">To satisfy that constitutional standard the jurors need not be totally ignorant of the facts of a case. <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 799-800, 95 S.Ct. at 2035-2036. A juror who has read about the case, even one who has conceived some notion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, may nonetheless serve \u201cif the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799, 95 S.Ct. at 2035 (quoting <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643); <em>see Martin v. Warden, </em>653 F.2d 799, 804, 806 (3d Cir.1981), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1151, 102 S.Ct. 1019, 71 L.Ed.2d 306 (1982). At the same time, a juror\u2019s assurance that he can enter the jury box without an opinion is not dis-positive if the accused can demonstrate \u201cthe actual existence of such an opinion in the mind of the juror as will raise the presumption of partiality.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 800, 95 S.Ct. at 2036 (quoting <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643); <em>see United States v. Provenzano, </em>620 F.2d 985, 995 (3d Cir.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number><em>cert, denied, </em>449 U.S. 899, 101 S.Ct. 267, 66 L.Ed.2d 129 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">The petitioner challenging his state court conviction in a habeas corpus proceeding must shoulder a particularly heavy burden. Unlike a defendant seeking review of his federal conviction, the petitioner cannot argue that simply because his jury has read of extra-record facts with a high potential for prejudice, a federal court must presume that the jury was prejudiced. <em>Cf. Marshall v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 310, 313, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250 (1959) (per curiam) (federal conviction reversed under supervisory power). A federal court reviewing a state conviction on habeas corpus may presume prejudice only in extraordinary cases where \u201cthe influence of the news media, either in the community at large or in the courtroom itself, pervaded the proceedings.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 798-99, 95 S.Ct. at 2035-2036; <em>see, e.g., Sheppard, </em>384 U.S. 333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (extremely inflammatory publicity and a courthouse given over to carnival); <em>Estes v. Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965) (trial in circus atmosphere); <em>Rideau v. Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 10 L.Ed.2d 663 (1963) (twenty-minute confession repeatedly broadcast on television). The publicity in this case, though it had a high potential for prejudice, did not utterly corrupt the trial atmosphere in that fashion. <em>See Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 798, 95 S.Ct. at 2035; <em>Martin, </em>653 F.2d at 805. Petitioner must therefore show \u201cthat the publicity has been so extreme as to cause <em>actual prejudice </em>to a degree rendering a fair trial impossible.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>653 F.2d at 805 (emphasis added); <em>See Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 797-799, 95 S.Ct. at 2034-2036; <em>Estes, </em>381 U.S. at 542-44, 85 S.Ct. at 1632-1634; <em>Martin, </em>653 F.2d at 804-06; <em>United States ex rel. Greene v. New Jersey, </em>519 F.2d 1356, 1357 (3d Cir. 1975) (per curiam).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">To determine whether actual prejudice has been shown, we must examine the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d for any indication that petitioner\u2019s trial was not fundamentally fair. <em>Dobbert v. Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 303, 97 S.Ct. 2290, 2303, 53 L.Ed.2d 344 (1977); <em>see Sheppard, </em>384 U.S. at 352, 86 S.Ct. at 1517. In <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 712, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961), the Supreme Court established the method by which such examinations are conducted. <em>See, eg., Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 800-03, 95 S.Ct. at 2036-2038; <em>Beck v. Washington, </em>369 U.S. 541, 556-57, 82 S.Ct. 955, 963-964, 8 L.Ed.2d 98 (1962); <em>see also Dobbert, </em>432 U.S. at 302-03, 97 S.Ct. at 2302-2303. First, the Court in <em>Irvin </em>considered the extent and content of the publicity because it was indicative of \u201cthe then current community pattern of thought.\u201d <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 725-27, 81 S.Ct. at 1644-1645. The Court then reviewed the voir dire. In the opinions expressed by potential jurors and the difficulty encountered in finding veniremen who could at least claim impartiality, the Court discovered evidence of a pattern of prejudice in the community. <em>Id. </em>at 727, 81 S.Ct. at 1645. Finally the Court looked to see whether that pattern of prejudice was reflected, in the testimony of the jurors ultimately seated in the jury box. <em>Id. </em>at 727-28, 81 S.Ct. at 1645-1646. Considering all these factors, the Court then concluded that the jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality had to be discounted. <em>Id., </em>366 U.S. at 728, 81 S.Ct. at 1645.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">1. The Publicity</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">The publicity preceding petitioner\u2019s trial was extensive and had great potential for prejudice. As in <em>Irvin, </em>petitioner\u2019s ease was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>a <em>\u201ccause celebre\u201d </em>in a rural community which had been subjected to a barrage of publicity concerning a sensational murder. <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 725, 81 S.Ct. at 1644; <em>see Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 798, 95 S.Ct. at 2035. That publicity, although accurate, factual in nature, and without editorial comment, <em>see Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 800 n. 4, 802, 95 S.Ct. at 2036, n. 4, 2037; <em>Beck, </em>369 U.S. at 556, 82 S.Ct. at 963; revealed prejudicial information \u201cnever heard from the witness stand\u201d in the second trial. <em>See Sheppard, </em>384 U.S. at 356, 86 S.Ct. at 1519.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">First, the publicity disclosed that the jury in the first trial had convicted petitioner of the murder. New revelations could be so damning to an accused. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>568 F.2d 464, 471 (5th Cir.1978). Possibly even more prejudicial was the disclosure of petitioner\u2019s written confessions and his testimony at the first trial. <em>See Rideau, </em>373 U.S. 723, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 10 L.Ed.2d 663; <em>United States v. Haldeman, </em>559 F.2d 31, 61 (D.C.Cir.1976) (in banc) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 933, 97 S.Ct. 2641, 53 L.Ed.2d 250 (1977); <em>see also United States ex rel. Doggett v. Yeager, </em>472 F.2d 229, 231 (3d Cir.1973). The confessions and testimony detailed in a highly unfavorable light petitioner\u2019s actions and thoughts at the time of the homicide. They were sworn revelations of information which petitioner\u2019s properly admitted oral statements simply did not convey. <em>Cf. Stroble </em>v. <em>California, </em>343 U.S. 181, 195, 72 S.Ct. 599, 606, 96 L.Ed. 872 (1952) (confession printed in newspaper was introduced into evidence); <em>see also United States v. D\u2019Andrea, </em>495 F.2d 1170, 1172-73 (3d Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 855, 95 S.Ct. 101, 42 L.Ed.2d 88 (1974). Finally, the publicity revealed that petitioner at the first trial had pled temporary insanity and had been convicted of rape. Such highly inflammatory facts carried too great a risk of prejudice to be directly offered as evidence. <em>See Marshall, </em>360 U.S. at 312-13, 79 S.Ct. at 1172-1173; <em>United States ex rel. Greene v. New Jersey, </em>519 F.2d 1356 (3d Cir.1975) (per curiam). \u201cThe exclusion of such evidence in court is meaningless when the news media makes it available to the public.\u201d <em>Sheppard, </em>384 U.S. at 360, 86 S.Ct. at 1521; <em>see Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 802, 95 S.Ct. at 2037.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">The publicity was understandably most extensive and most potentially prejudicial before and during petitioner\u2019s first trial, which was four years before his second trial. The passage of time may work to erase highly unfavorable publicity from the memory of a community. <em>See, e.g., Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 802, 95 S.Ct. at 2037; <em>Beck, </em>369 U.S. at 556, 82 S.Ct. at 963. In this case, however, voir dire revealed that more than 98 percent of the veniremen questioned remembered the case. In part this was due to the repeated community exposure provided by newspaper coverage of the appeal and retrial<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which helped keep fresh the imprint of the case in the minds of the public.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> More important, the publicity attending the homicide and first trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>had been so extensive and intensive that the case was firmly implanted in the memories of Clearfield County residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">Petitioner has established that the publicity before his second trial had revealed prejudicial information from his first trial, information which was not officially in evidence against him. The widespread dissemination of such extra-record information, while not rendering the jury presumptively prejudiced, poisoned the \u201cgeneral atmosphere of the community\u201d in which petitioner was retried. <em>See Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 802, 95 S.Ct. at 2037. If petitioner can show that that atmosphere caused actual prejudice in the jurors, their assurances of impartiality can be disregarded. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\"><em>2. </em>The Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">The difficulty of voir dire may provide crucial evidence that the sentiments of the community were so poisoned against an accused as to impeach the asserted indifference of his jurors. <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 803, 95 S.Ct. at 2037. \u201cThe length to which the trial court must go in order to select jurors who appear to be impartial\u201d reveals a great deal about those jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-7\">In a community where most veniremen will admit to a disqualifying prejudice, the reliability of the others\u2019 protestations may be drawn into question; for it is then more probable that they are part of a community deeply hostile to the accused, and more likely that they may unwittingly have been influenced by it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUN3\"><em>Id. </em>at 802-03, 95 S.Ct. at 2037-2038.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">In this case, as in <em>Irvin, </em>\u201cimpartial jurors were hard to find.\u201d <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 727, 81 S.Ct. at 1645. In the long and difficult voir dire<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> 163 veniremen were questioned on the case. Our independent examination of the voir dire testimony shows that 126 prospective jurors, or 77 percent of the 163 veniremen questioned, admitted that they would carry an opinion into the jury box. The trial court itself excused on challenges for cause 117 of those veniremen, or 72 percent of the 163, after they stated that they could not set aside their opinion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Only when petitioner had exhausted his peremptory challenges could enough jurors be found to fill the jury box. <em>Cf. Dobbert, </em>432 U.S. at 302, 97 S.Ct. at 2302-03 (peremptory challenges not exhausted); <em>United States v. Gorel, </em>622 F.2d 100, 103-04 (5th Cir.) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 943, 100 S.Ct. 1340, 63 L.Ed.2d 777 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">In <em>Irvin </em>the trial court dismissed for cause 268 of 430 veniremen, or 62 percent, because they had fixed opinions concerning the petitioner\u2019s guilt. Almost 90 percent of those examined entertained some opinion as to guilt. 366 U.S. at 727, 81 S.Ct. at 1645. In those circumstances the Supreme Court \u201creadily found actual prejudice against the petitioner to a degree that rendered a fair trial impossible.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 798, 95 S.Ct. at 2035; <em>accord United States ex rel. Bloeth v. Denno, </em>313 F.2d 364, 368-69 (2d Cir.1962) (in banc) (31 of 38 veniremen questioned had formed opinion), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 978, 83 S.Ct. 1112,10 L.Ed.2d 143 (1963). By contrast, in <em>Murphy </em>the Court found no basis to cast doubt on the juror\u2019s assurances of impartiality where only 20 of 78 veniremen questioned, or 26 percent, were excused because they disclosed an opinion as to guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 803, 95 S.Ct. at 2037; <em>accord Beck, </em>369 U.S. at 556, 82 S.Ct. at 963 (14 of 56 veniremen might have had opinions); <em>Martin, </em>653 F.2d at 806 (23 of 81 veniremen questioned had opinions); <em>Brinlee v. Crisp, </em>608 F.2d 839, 845 (10th Cir.1979) (19 of 47 veniremen ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>tioned had opinions), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1047, 100 S.Ct. 737, 62 L.Ed.2d 733 (1980); <em>Haldeman, </em>559 F.2d at 70 &amp; n. 56 (29-36 percent of veniremen arguably had opinions), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>431 U.S. 933, 97 S.Ct. 2641, 53 L.Ed.2d 250 (1977); <em>Mastrian v. McManus, </em>554 F.2d 813, 818 (8th Cir.) (41 of 92 veniremen questioned had opinions), <em>cert. denied, </em>433 U.S. 913, 97 S.Ct. 2985, 53 L.Ed.2d 1099 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">In the instant case voir dire revealed other indications of a deep and bitter prejudice present in the community. One venireman apparently veiled his strong feelings when testifying. Another said that her fellow parishioners tried to influence her to vote guilty. Many veniremen volunteered opinions of guilt, and over 90 percent of those asked said they had discussed the case or heard others express their opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">We believe that the voir dire in this case more strongly resembles that of <em>Irvin </em>than that of <em>Murphy. See Martin, </em>653 F.2d at 806. Three-quarters of the veniremen admitted to an opinion of guilt which they could not set aside. \u201cWhere so many, so many times, admitted prejudice, [a juror\u2019s] statement of impartiality can be given little weight.\u201d <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 728, 81 S.Ct. at 1645; <em>Martin, </em>653 F.2d at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">3. The Jurors Selected</p>\n<p id=\"Au5\">The prejudice permeating the voir dire and the community was reflected in the voir dire testimony of the majority of the twelve jurors and two alternates ultimately placed in the jury box.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> All but one of the jurors were familiar with the case, and several explicitly recalled petitioner\u2019s conviction or confessions. Eight out of fourteen jurors would admit that, before hearing any testimony, they had formed an opinion as to petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>Cf. Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 727, 81 S.Ct. at 1645 (8 of 12 had formed opinions); <em>Denno, </em>313 F.2d at 367-68 (8 of 16 had formed opinions).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-10\">With such an opinion permeating their minds, it would be difficult to say that each could exclude this preconception of guilt from his deliberations. The influence that lurks in an opinion once formed is so persistent that it unconsciously fights detachment from the mental processes of the average man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\"><em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 727, 81 S.Ct. at 1645 (citation omitted). Indeed, when asked whether they could set their opinions aside and forget what they had heard, many of the jurors gave uncertain and ambiguous answers. Even such equivocal assurances of impartiality were preferable to the open admissions of prejudice made by Juror Hrin and the two alternates, who went \u201cso far as to say that it would take evidence to overcome their belief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728, 81 S.Ct. at 1645; <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 798,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> 95 S.Ct. at 2035.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>It is hardly surprising that the assurances of impartiality given by petitioner\u2019s jurors \u2022were equivocal or negative. It is more surprising that some could indeed give blanket-assurances of impartiality. Petitioner\u2019s jurors were members of a community barraged by publicity .and alive with discussion, a community where three quarters of those called would admit to a disqualifying prejudice. Those jurors were then asked to forget that petitioner had been convicted of the murder, and rape, of Pamela Rimer. They were asked to forget how petitioner twice in writing and once' on the stand had retold in detail that he had killed her, and. how he had offered no defense except for temporary insanity. Those jurors were asked to forget all they knew and put their impressions and opinions aside. Such a request took insufficient account of \u201cthe frailties of human nature.\u201d <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 728, 81 S.Ct. at 1645.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">\u201cImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724, 81 S.Ct. at 1643 (quoting <em>United States v. Wood, </em>299 U.S. 123, 145, 57 S.Ct. 177, 185, 81 L.Ed. 78 (1936)). We must view the jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality in light of the pretrial publicity, the difficulty of voir dire, and the testimony of the jurors selected. We conclude that despite their assurances of impartiality, the jurors could not set aside their opinions and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court. Petitioner has shown that the pretrial publicity caused actual prejudice to a degree rendering a fair trial impossible in Clearfield County. After examining the totality of circumstances, we hold that petitioner\u2019s retrial was not fundamentally fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"A92\">We will affirm that part of the district court\u2019s order holding that petitioner\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination was not violated by the admission into evidence of his oral statements. We will vacate that part of its order holding that retrial in Clearfield County did not infringe petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">Petitioner\u2019s detention and sentence of life imprisonment are in violation of the Constitution of the United States. He is therefore entitled to be freed from that detention and sentence. Petitioner is still subject to custody under the indictment, however, and he may be retried on this or another indictment. <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 728, 81- S.Ct. at 1645.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">We will remand the case to the district court with the direction that a writ of habe-as corpus shall issue unless within a reasonable time the Commonwealth shall afford petitioner a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">.

Petitioner in his brief separates his challenge based on pretrial publicity from his challenge based on the refusal to change venue. We consider the arguments to be inseparable. \u2022 <em>See Mart\u00edn v.

The pretrial publicity and its effects were the basis for petitioner\u2019s motions for a change of venue. Our inquiry in this habeas corpus proceeding is restricted to whether the refusal to change venue amounted to a violation of petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 804; <em>see Rideau v. Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 726, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 1419, 10 L.Ed.2d 663 (1963). There could be no constitutional violation unless petitioner was denied his constitutional right to an impartial jury because of pretrial publicity. <em>Beck v.

In addition, because petitioner is challenging a state conviction on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the factual findings of the state courts are presumed to be correct unless petitioner can establish by convincing evidence that the factual findings were erroneous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1976); <em>see Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981). At the same time, we have a duty as a federal appellate court \u201cto make an independent evaluation of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Sheppard, </em>384 U.S. at 362, 86 S.Ct. at 1522. In particular, because the nature and strength of a venireman\u2019s opinion is a mixed question of law and fact, <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643, we must \u201cindependently evaluate the voir dire testimony of the impaneled jurors\u201d and the potential jurors. <em>Id.; Martin, </em>653 F.2d at 807; <em>see Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 341-42, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1714-1715, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">. The state trial court, though the record contained at least 17 front-page articles, said that between trial and retrial \u201cthere was practically no publicity given to this matter through the news media ... .except to report that a new trial had been granted by the Supreme Court.\u201d App. at 751a. We believe, however, that petitioner has established by convincing evidence that the state court\u2019s characterization of the coverage was erroneous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1976). The record on this petition indicates that 66 front-page articles were published covering the appeal and second trial. <em>Cf. Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. at 547, 101 S.Ct. at 769 (federal and state court had identical record). We agree with the magistrate who after two days of evidentiary hearings found that the second trial \u201cwas surrounded with publicity, but not to the same degree\u201d as the first trial. App. at 136a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">. The trial court stated that \u201cas far as this Court can recall\u201d there was little talk in public concerning the second trial. App. at 196a. Veniremen during voir dire indicated, however, that there had been public discussion of the case, particularly in last weeks before retrial. Such discussion apparently did not reach the attention of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">The trial court also noted that few spectators had attended trial on some days, particularly during voir dire. Because petitioner alleges prejudice not from a \u201ccircus atmosphere\u201d in the courtroom, see <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 798, 95 S.Ct. at 2035; <em>Martin, </em>653 F.2d at 805, but from public knowledge of extra-record facts, occasional low attendance is a factor of limited significance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">. The trial court explained that the voir dire was lengthy because petitioner was permitted to ask so many questions. App. at 194a-95a, 751a. The court did indeed extend great leniency to petitioner in his questioning of the veniremen. Such leniency was commendable. It was also necessary under the circumstances, and does not explain away the difficulty of the voir dire as a real factor in our consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">. The trial court stated that the difficulty in selecting a jury was due in part to his leniency in granting challenges for cause. App.at 195a, 751a. In our independent evaluation, each of the 117 veniremen dismissed for cause by the trial court had expressed a disqualifying prejudice which required dismissal. In fact, as we have noted, the trial court refused to dismiss several veniremen who had expressed a disqualifying prejudice, and permitted some of them to sit as jurors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">. The alternate jurors were dismissed and did not participate in the jury\u2019s deliberations. An alternate who did not deliberate does not contaminate a jury unless there is reason to believe that the jury had been exposed to the alternate\u2019s prejudicial information or opinion. See <em>United States v. Vento, </em>533 F.2d 838, 860-70 (3d Cir.1976). In this case the jurors were told they could discuss the case among themselves when sequestered. For four days the two alternate jurors were seated and sequestered with the regular jurors. Even though there is no evidence that the prejudiced alternates talked to the regular jurors, such a sustained condition of \u201ccontinuous and intimate association\u201d operates to subvert the requirement that the jury\u2019s verdict be based on evidence developed from the witness stand. See <em>Turner v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 466, 472-73, 85 S.Ct. 546, 549-550, 13 L.Ed.2d 424 (1965) (jurors guarded by deputy sheriffs who were witnesses); <em>see also United States ex rel. Owen v.

Because Pennsylvania at the time \u25a0 of retrial required that objection be made before the jury retired to deliberate, Pa.R.Crim.P. 1106(d) (1975), petitioner\u2019s failure to challenge a juror for cause waived objection to that particular juror, <em>Provenzano, </em>620 F.2d at 996 n. 15, unless petitioner can show cause for failing to object and prejudice therefrom. <em>Rogers v.

United States, </em>218 U.S. 245, 248, 31 S.Ct. 2, 4, 54 L.Ed. 1021 (1910), established that it is permissible to empanel a jury composed of 12 persons, all of whom have a preconceived opinion that the defendant is guilty, as long as each promises to \u201clay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643. <em>Accord Murphy v.

I cannot see why it is \u201cimpossible\u201d to obtain jurors who do not begin with a bias. The test I suggest would not disqualify a juror merely because he has been exposed to pretrial publicity; rather, only those who represent that they have formed an opinion \u2014 irrespective of the degree of its fixation \u2014 must be excluded automatically from jury participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">There can be but two possible explanations for the <em>Irvin </em>standard. The first is that it presumes to be meaningful: that a promise to lay aside an opinion, for example, that an accused high school teacher brutally killed one of his own students is either believable or enforceable. Definitive refutation of this precept as a psychological matter is, of course, beyond my capabilities, but I would venture that no one of us would want to gamble our freedom on the ability of a person to erase a preformed opinion as to guilt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, even if such self-imposed amnesia is possible as a cognitive event, surely its prediction is not reliable \u2014 that is, we cannot expect a person to know with any degree of accuracy at the time of voir dire whether or not he will be able to lay aside an opinion, however desirous he is of achieving that end. I see no reason to subject our jury system to the hazards of guesswork, particularly where the alternative is so easily achieved. Thus, I reject the <em>Irvin </em>standard as a means to insure impartial jurors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>The second conceivable rationale for the <em>Irvin </em>test is that it is a practical necessity, without which the empanelling of juries would be impossible. I simply refuse to believe that in a land\u2019 as populous as ours, where potential jurors abound, the only way to assemble a group of 12 impartial persons is to allow those with advance opinions to sit as long as they give a proper incantation of their ability to lay aside those opinions. If a jury cannot be selected without resort to persons with preformed views of a defendant\u2019s guilt, it should be a simple matter to transfer the case to another county. There is simply no societal interest advanced by seating a juror who has openly stated that he has a view concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt, notwithstanding that it can be \u201claid aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">The vulnerability of the <em>Irvin </em>\u201claying aside\u201d standard is only heightened where attempts to temper its potentially devastating consequences for a criminal defendant are examined. The <em>Murphy </em>Court pointed out that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-5\">[T]he juror\u2019s assurances that he is equal to this task Paying aside prior opinion] cannot be dispositive of the accused\u2019s rights, and it remains open to the defendant to demonstrate \u201cthe actual existence of such an opinion in the mind of the juror as will raise the presumption of partiality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\"><em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 800, 95 S.Ct. at 2036 (quoting <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643). I am at a loss to understand how a defendant would ever be able to demonstrate that despite a venireman\u2019s assurance that he is able to lay aside a preconception of defendant\u2019s guilt, there actually exists in the potential juror\u2019s mind a \u201cfixed\u201d opinion which cahnot be extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">My view of the proper standard by which to measure the propriety of seating a particular juror does away with the distinction between opinions that are \u201cfixed\u201d and those that are something less so, as a spectral analysis empty of meaning. A person with any opinion going to the issue of a defendant\u2019s guilt is simply unfit to serve on a jury. It is incredible to me that anyone would want to take the contrary view. Further, in a highly publicized case, I would discredit the denial of preconceived opinions where a significant percentage of those polled state that they hold opinions concerning the defendant. While the Court has recognized that veniremen prejudice may be presumed in the face of protestations to the contrary where most of the other prospective jurors admit to a disqualifying bias, <em>compare Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 727, 81 S.Ct. at 1645 (nearly 90 percent of veniremen have some opinion regarding defendant\u2019s guilt; prejudice in remainder presumed), <em>with Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 802, 95 S.Ct. at 2037 (roughly 26 percent of veniremen have an opinion; no presumption regarding remainder), I would not allow any jury to be empanelled where more than 25 percent of the veniremen state that they hold an opinion concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt. Where over one quarter of those polled indicate such bias, I have grave doubts as to the sincerity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>representations of impartiality by others in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">It has long been the foundation of our legal system that, \u201c[N]o man\u2019s life, liberty or property be forfeited as criminal punishment for violation of that law until there ha[s] been a charge fairly made and fairly tried in a public tribunal free of prejudice, passion, excitement, and tyrannical power.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Florida, </em>309 U.S. 227, 236-37, 60 S.Ct. 472, 476-477, 84 L.Ed. 716 (1940). I do not see how we can live by this ideal while continuing to apply the <em>Irvin </em>test. I would adopt a different standard, originating at the confluence.of sense and simplicity, which would prevent any person from entering the jury box and becoming a. judge of the facts if he has any preconceived view of the merits of the case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">.

Various veniremen, all of whom indicated a preformed opinion of some degree, revealed a variety of strategies by which they felt they could rid themselves of their initial partiality.

Hrin, who sat in judgment of the petitioner, Jon Yount, admitted during his <em>voir dire </em>that until he was shown facts establishing Yount\u2019s innocence, he would find it difficult to change his opinion about Yount\u2019s guilt. Because I conclude that Hrin, by so testifying during the <em>voir dire, </em>demonstrated \u201cthe actual existence of such an opinion in the mind of [one of Yount\u2019s] juror[s] as will raise the presumption of partiality,\u201d <em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 800, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2036, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975); <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 723, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 1643, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961), I concur in the judgment of the court that a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">My concurrence, however, is limited to' the issue raised by Yount\u2019s charge that Jur- or Hrin had been improperly impaneled. Thus, while I agree with Judge Hunter that Yount\u2019s fifth amendment rights were not violated when his inculpatory statements were admitted at his second trial, I do not agree with Judge Hunter that pre-trial publicity required a change of venue. As I read the record, it was the failure of the trial judge to apply the principles of <em>Irvin, supra, </em>in excusing jurors for cause that resulted in an unfair trial. Thus, I restrict my vote for a remand and new trial solely to the issue of Juror Hrin\u2019s impaneling as a juror, and do not agree with Judge Hunter\u2019s thesis that the district court erred in denying a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-13\">As the majority notes, Yount had been convicted of murder and rape in 1966. After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court set aside both of these convictions in 1969, Yount was tried a second time for murder in November of 1970. The voir dire in this second trial exhausted ten days and 167 veniremen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, 121 of whom were dismissed for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-14\">Among the twelve jurors and two alternates selected to try Yount, six testified that they had formed no opinions as to Yount\u2019s guilt. Five jurors stated that they had formed opinions about the case, but that they could lay those opinions aside and keep an open mind. Finally, three jurors\u2014 both of the alternates and Juror James F. Hrin \u2014 testified that they had opinions of Yount\u2019s culpability but could change these opinions if the proper evidence were presented.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-15\">Juror Hrin\u2019s voir dire examination by the prosecution disclosed that Hrin was uncertain whether he could render a verdict based solely on the evidence adduced at trial. Responding to two questions by the prosecutor, Hrin asserted that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say for sure\u201d whether he could \u201cerase or remove the opinion\u201d he held, but stated a second time that he eould do so. Hrin\u2019s answers were punctuated with suggestions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>that he thought he \u201cpossibly could\u201d render a fair verdict, and that \u201c[i]t would be rather difficult for me to answer\u201d whether he \u201ccould enter the jury box presuming [Yount] to be innocent.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdVW\">Under cross examination by counsel for the defendant Yount, Hrin asserted that he would require the production of evidence before he would abandon any opinion of Yount\u2019s guilt. Hrin stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-4\">Q. Did I understand Mr. Hrin you would require some \u2014 you would require evidence or something before you could change your opinion you now have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-5\">A. Definitely. If the facts show a difference from what I had originally had been led to believe, I would definitely change my mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-6\">Q. But until you\u2019re shown those facts, you would not change your mind \u2014 is that your position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-7\">A. Well \u2014 I have nothing else to go on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEcQ\">Q. I understand. Then the answer is yes \u2014 you would not change your mind until you were presented facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-8\">A. Right, but I would enter it with an open mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-9\">Q. In other words, you\u2019re saying that while facts were presented you would keep an open mind and after that you would feel free to change your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aje-dedup-1\">A.

Right....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-21\">Yount promptly challenged Juror Hrin for cause, a challenge the trial court denied because \u201che declared he could go in there with an open mind.\u201d The trial court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-22\">I deny the challenge for cause because he declared he could go in there with an open mind; and Commonwealth against <em>[Commonwealth </em>v.] <em>Bentley </em>[287 Pa. 539, 135 A. 310 (1926)] sets forth that \u2014 any juror is incompetent who has a fixed and definite opinion which cannot be erased by hearing and evidence \u2014 and he said he could disregard it and be guided by the law and evidence, and I believe he stated he could go in with an open mind. I would accept that as being sufficient to overcome the conviction that you proposed that he has a fixed opinion that he could not put aside and I think his answers were unequivical [sic] enough as to any fixation as to opinion as he declared although he had a solid opinion it is not quite as solid as it used to be which indicates that it is not solid. His expression is such that there is not now a fixed opinion and therefore I so accept it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An_\">On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded summarily that \u201c[t]he record shows that none of the jurors had a fixed opinion as to appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence, or was otherwise legally unable to serve.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Yount, </em>455 Pa. 303, 314, 314 A.2d 242, 248 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>On January 8, 1981, Yount filed <em>pro se </em>a petition for habeas corpus. Paragraph 12-B of the petition asserted in part that \u201ctwo [jurors] stated that they would require Petitioner to prove his innocence.\u201d In light of the record in this case, it is patent that one of the jurors referred to in paragraph 12-B is Juror Hrin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court reviewed pertinent portions of each of the jurors\u2019 voir dire testimony, including Hrin\u2019s, but did not concentrate on Hrin\u2019s testimony in particular, and made no findings respecting it. <em>See Yount v. Patton, </em>537 F.Supp. 873, 880 (WD.Pa.1982). Yount argues before us on appeal that Hrin had abandoned the presumption of innocence, and that Yount could not constitutionally be convicted by a panel containing such a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">As the Supreme Court in <em>Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart </em>stated, \u201cpretrial publicity \u2014 even pervasive, adverse publicity\u2014 does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\u201d 427 U.S. 539, 554, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 2800, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976). In order to explain fully why I do not believe the district court erred in denying a change in venue due to alleged prejudicial publicity, it is useful to review those circumstances in which jury exposure to adverse publicity does require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">First, the accused may demonstrate the actual existence of prejudice attributable to pretrial publicity on the part of one or more members of the jury. <em>See Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 723, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 1643, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961). Such prejudice must be shown \u201cnot as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality,\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Darcy v. Handy, </em>351 U.S. 454, 462, 76 S.Ct. 965, 970, 100 L.Ed. 1331 (1956), and is usually established by reliance on the jurors\u2019 <em>voir dire </em>responses. <em>See United States v. Chagra, </em>669 F.2d 241, 250 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 102, 74 L.Ed.2d 92 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">Second, in extreme cases of highly inflammatory pretrial publicity which saturates the community from which the jury is drawn, the accused may rely on a presumption of partiality, and need not prove actual bias. <em>See Rideau v. Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 726-27, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 1419-20, 10 L.Ed.2d 663 (1963); cf. <em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 802-03, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2037-2038, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975); <em>Mayola v. Alabama, </em>623 F.2d 992, 997 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 913, 101 S.Ct. 1986, 68 L.Ed.2d 303 (1981). This presumption is rebuttable, however, and the prosecution may demonstrate the impartiality of the jury by reliance on the <em>voir dire </em>testimony. <em>See United States v. Chagra, supra, </em>669 F.2d at 250, 252-54; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>584 F.2d 148, 154 (6th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 918, 99 S.Ct. 1239, 59 L.Ed.2d 469 (1979); <em>United States v. Gullion, </em>575 F.2d 26, 29-30 (1st Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">Third, the accused can demonstrate \u201ca significant possibility of prejudice,\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>583 F.2d 190, 196 (5th Cir.1978), and that the <em>voir dire </em>procedure was inadequate to permit its discovery. <em>See United States v.

Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966), and <em>Estes v. Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965), the Supreme Court condemned the conduct of trials \u201cutterly corrupted by press coverage.\u201d <em>See Dobbert v. Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 303, 97 S.Ct. 2290, 2303, 53 L.Ed.2d 344 (1975). In these cases, the presence of the press during trial rendered the conduct of a fair trial impossible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A similar intrusion into the trial process occurs when members of the jury are exposed to publicity <em>during </em>the trial. <em>See Marshall v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 310, 311, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 1172, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250 (1959); <em>Goins v. McKeen, </em>605 F.2d 947, 952-54 (6th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>568 F.2d 464, 468 (5th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>542 F.2d 186, 194-97 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 922, 96 S.Ct. 2629, 49 L.Ed.2d 375 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">In this case, no juror was exposed to adverse publicity during trial, and the record reflecting the publicity' preceding Yount\u2019s second trial, in my opinion, was not so inflammatory as to give rise to a presumption of partiality. In addition, it is conceded that the trial court \u201cextend[ed] great leniency to [Yount] in his questioning of the veniremen,\u201d Maj. op., at 970 n. 23, and no argument is raised that the <em>voir dire </em>was less than ample to expose the prejudices of potential jurors. Therefore, the only basis for upsetting Yount\u2019s conviction is the existence of the \u201cactual prejudice\u201d of one or more members of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">An accused may demonstrate \u201cactual prejudice\u201d on the part of the jury in two ways. First, the defendant may establish, by means of the <em>voir dire </em>testimony, that one or more jurors had a preconceived opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt which could not be set aside in order to \u201crender a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, supra, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643. In such a case, the trial court would err by not granting a challenge to this juror for cause. A change of venue, however, would not be required if the challenge for cause were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">Second, in extremely rare circumstances the accused may establish \u201cactual prejudice\u201d by inference. <em>See Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 803, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2038, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975). In such a case the defendant must demonstrate \u201ca community with sentiment so poisoned against petitioner as to impeach the indifference of jurors who displayed no animus of their own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the only Supreme Court case to rely on this ground, <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>ninety percent of those examined on the point had a preconceived notion of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and eight persons who actually sat in judgment of the defendant thought the defendant guilty. 366 U.S. at 727, 81 S.Ct. at 1645. Indeed, just recently this court refused to apply the <em>Irvin </em>principle to reverse a conviction in which only 23 of 71 persons known to be exposed to pretrial publicity had fixed opinions of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Martin v. Warden, </em>653 F.2d 799, 806 (3d Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1151, 102 S.Ct. 1019, 71 L.Ed.2d 306 (1982). Thus while I agree that if the defendant establishes the existence of a community \u201cso poisoned against the [defendant] as to impeach the indifference of jurors who displayed no animus,\u201d then a change of venue is required, I do not agree that merely because a number of prospective jurors harbor opinions of guilt, that the <em>voir dire, </em>fairly conducted, cannot screen the biased from the fair-minded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">A showing of actual prejudice by this method is not to be lightly accomplished. As the Fifth Circuit stated in <em>United States v. Dozier, </em>672 F.2d 531, 546 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 256, 74 L.Ed.2d 200 (1982), \u201cdetection of actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>prejudice is not accomplished through juggling statistics.\u201d <em>Irvin </em>does n'ot establish a bright-line rule that a venire containing a percentage of biased talesmen above a certain level is presumptively bad. Rather, the court must examine the totality of the circumstances, including the adequacy of the <em>voir dire </em>in ferreting out biased jurors, in order to establish whether a change of venue is constitutionally required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">A thorough and skillfully conducted <em>voir dire </em>should be adequate to identify juror bias, even in a community saturated with publicity adverse to the defendant. As the District of Columbia Court of Appeals noted, \u201cvoir dire has long been recognized as an effective method of rooting out such bias, especially when conducted in a careful and thoroughgoing manner.\u201d <em>In re Application of National Broadcasting Co., </em>653 F.2d 609, 617 (D.C.Cir.1981) (footnotes omitted). For this reason the courts of appeals have repeatedly expressed \u201cconfidence in the effectiveness of a skillful voir dire to counteract the threat of pretrial publicity.\u201d <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>598 F.2d 839, 865-66 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 871, 100 S.Ct. 148, 62 L.Ed.2d 96 (1979). Reviewing the conviction of Lieutenant William Calley for the killing of civilians at My Lai, a trial that generated considerably more pretrial publicity than Yount's second trial in 1970, the Fifth Circuit observed that \u201c[tjhere has been a greater willingness to uphold a trial court\u2019s determination that jurors were capable of rendering an impartial verdict where that conclusion was reached after deliberate, searching, and thorough <em>voir dire.\u201d Calley v. Callaway, </em>519 F.2d 184, 209 n. 45 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 911, 96 S.Ct. 1505, 47 L.Ed.2d 760 (1976). <em>See also Graham v. Mabry, </em>645 F.2d 603, 611 (8th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Capo, </em>595 F.2d 1086, 1091-92 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1012, 100 S.Ct. 660, 62 L.Ed.2d 641 (1980); <em>Margoles v. United States, </em>407 F.2d 727, 729-31 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 833, 90 S.Ct. 89, 24 L.Ed.2d 84 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">As <em>Irvin </em>makes plain, a juror\u2019s subjective affirmation of impartiality is not dispositive of the question of juror bias. It has always been clear that \u201cmerely going through the form of obtaining jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality is insufficient.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Bloeth v. Denno, </em>313 F.2d 364, 372 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 978, 83 S.Ct. 1112, 10 L.Ed.2d 143 (1963). Instead, the trial court must determine independently and objectively whether the jurors\u2019 assurances are credible. <em>See United States v. Blanton, </em>700 F.2d 298, 307-08 (6th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Gerald, </em>624 F.2d 1291, 1296-97 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 920, 101 S.Ct. 1369, 67 L.Ed.2d 348 (1981). The American Bar Association\u2019s, Standards for.Criminal Justice provide that the <em>voir dire </em>\u201cshall be conducted for the purpose of determining what the prospective juror has read and heard about the case and how any exposure has affected that person\u2019s attitude toward the trial.\u201d <em>ABA Standards for Criminal Justice </em>\u00a7 8-3.5 (2d ed. 1978). The objective evaluation of this information, however, rests with the trial court. In <em>Irvin, </em>the trial court (which itself questioned the jurors challenged for cause) did not engage in a searching and thorough <em>voir dire. </em>Instead, the court erroneously credited the jurors\u2019 subjective opinions that each could render an impartial verdict notwithstanding his or her opinion. <em>Irvin v. Dowd, supra, </em>366 U.S. at 724, 81 S.Ct. at 1643.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">Yount\u2019s case, however, differs significantly from <em>Irvin v. Dowd. </em>First, counsel themselves conducted the <em>voir dire </em>in Yount\u2019s trial and, as Judge Hunter concedes, were afforded great leniency in the questioning of veniremen. Second, Yount challenged only three jurors for cause, and. two of those jurors, according to the district court\u2019s findings, \u201cindicated that they harbored no fixed opinion.\u201d <em>Yount v. Patton, supra, </em>537 F.Supp. at 878. Third, the trial court permitted questioning on the exposure of each juror to publicity and the degree of fixation of each juror\u2019s opinion. Six of the jurors testified that they had no preconceived opinion of Yount\u2019s guilt at all. Among the remaining six jurors, Yount challenged only one \u2014 Juror James F. Hrin, whom I discuss below \u2014 for cause. The scope and depth of the <em>voir dire, </em>and the absence of challenges for cause to each jur- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>or except Hrin, was adequate to support an independent and objective determination that, with the exception of Hrin, the jurors could \u201clay aside [their] impression[s] or opinion[s] and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, supra, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">Judge Hunter, however, discounts the extensive <em>voir dire </em>conducted in Yount\u2019s 1970 trial and the absence of challenges for cause to each juror except Hrin. Rather, Judge Hunter\u2019s opinion places great weight on the finding that \u201c77 percent of the 163 veniremen questioned admitted that they would carry an opinion into the jury box.\u201d Maj. op., at 970. To my mind, this reliance on statistics, without regard to the scope of the <em>voir dire </em>or the absence of challenges for cause, elevates to talismanic significance the percentage of veniremen <em>as a whole </em>with opinions about a defendant\u2019s guilt. I do not believe <em>Irvin v. Dowd </em>was ever intended to be read in this fashion. If the scope of the <em>voir dire </em>is ample \u2014 as it con-cededly is in this case \u2014 the fact that a large percentage of persons who are <em>not </em>on the jury have prejudices should carry little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">There are undoubtedly many communities in which large percentages of the veniremen have been exposed to pretrial publicity and have a notion of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The well-publicized trials of the Watergate defendants, <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Haldeman, supra, </em>and of Lieutenant Wil-liam Calley, <em>see Calley v. Callaway, supra, </em>are undoubtedly of this character. But, the very function of the <em>voir dire </em>is to root out such persons with preconceived prejudices and identify only those who can, by the trial court\u2019s independent determination, lay aside any prejudices and render a verdict based solely on the evidence adduced during trial. Thus, given a <em>voir dire </em>which is concededly adequate and which functions to achieve its designed purpose, a venue change is not constitutionally required simply because many of the persons who will <em>not </em>serve on the defendant\u2019s jury may harbor prejudices as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">For these reasons, I do not join Judge Hunter\u2019s holding that a change of venue in Yount\u2019s case was constitutionally required. Nevertheless, I concur in the judgment of the court because I conclude, for the reasons that follow, that Juror James F. Hrin should not have been impaneled in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">In <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961), the Supreme Court held that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused is not, without more, sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality. <em>Id. </em>at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643. As the Court observed, however, the adoption of such a rule does not \u201c \u2018foreclose inquiry as to whether, in a given case, the application of that rule works a deprivation of the prisoner\u2019s life or liberty without due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Lisenba v. California, </em>314 U.S. 219, 236, 62 S.Ct. 280, 290, 86 L.Ed. 166 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-10\">The test of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality, articulated in <em>Reynolds v. United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878), and reiterated in <em>Dowd, supra, </em>is whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2F\">\u201cthe nature and strength of the opinion formed are such as in law necessarily ... raise the presumption of partiality.... The affirmance of the issue is upon the challenger. Unless he shows the actual existence of such an opinion in the mind of the juror as will raise the presumption of partiality, the juror need not necessarily be set aside.\u201d <em>[Reynolds v. United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 156-57, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-11\"><em>Irvin v. Dowd, supra, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643. <em>See Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 800, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2036, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-12\">Hrin\u2019s voir dire testimony, taken as a whole, demonstrates the \u201cactual existence of such an opinion in the mind of the juror as will raise the presumption of partiality.\u201d Even the testimony adduced by the prosecution raised serious doubts whether Hrin entered the jury box with an open mind. The record reveals that Hrin asserted simultaneously that he could keep an open mind and that he could not \u201csay for sure\u201d wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>er he could do so. In response to the question whether Hrin \u201ccould enter the jury box presuming [Yount] to be innocent,\u201d Hrin conceded that \u201c[i]t would be rather difficult for me to answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">Testimony adduced by the defense further revealed that Hrin would require Yount to produce evidence before Hrin would abandon his preconceived opinion of Yount\u2019s guilt. Hrin affirmed that he \u201cwould not change [his] mind until [he] was presented [with] facts.\u201d Having so stated, Hrin abandoned the presumption of innocence. While the law permits a juror to affirm that he or she will enter the jury box with an open mind, a juror cannot require that the defendant produce evidence to wipe clean a prior perception or opinion. The jurors must be impartial when sworn. They cannot agree to be impartial only if the defendant convinces them to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">In this case, a juror, by his own admission, required the production of evidence to change his preconceived opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and agreed to keep an open mind about this evidence if and when he heard it. As a matter of law, this admission raises a presumption of partiality. A defendant cannot constitutionally be convicted by a jury containing one such juror. <em>Irvin v. Dowd, supra, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643; <em>id. </em>at 728, 81 S.Ct. at 1645 (\u201csome [jurors went] so far as to say that it would take evidence to overcome their belief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">In concluding as a matter of law that Juror Hrin\u2019s testimony raises a presumption of impartiality under <em>Irvin v. Dowd, supra, </em>I am fully cognizant that in a federal habe-as corpus proceeding, the findings of a state court \u201cshall be presumed to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear .... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1976); see <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 551, 101 S.Ct. 764, 771, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981). Under <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>however, an opinion of a prospective juror raises a presumption of partiality by operation of law, and therefore poses a mixed question of law and fact. As the Court in <em>Dowd </em>stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-10\">the test is \u2018whether the nature and strength of the opinion formed are such as in law necessarily ... raise the presumption of partiality. The question thus presented is one of mixed law and fact.... As was stated in <em>Brown v. Allen, </em>344 U.S. 443, 507 [73 S.Ct. 397, 446, 97 L.Ed. 469], the \u201cso-called mixed questions or the application of constitutional principles to the facts as found leave the duty of adjudication with the federal judge.\u201d It was, therefore, the duty of the Court of Appeals to independently evaluate the <em>voir dire </em>testimony of the impaneled jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-11\"><em>Irvin v. Dowd, supra, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">In this case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that \u201cnone of the jurors had a fixed opinion as to [Yount\u2019s] guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Yount, supra, </em>455 Pa. at 314, 314 A.2d at 248. Nevertheless, the trial court found that Hrin had a \u201csolid opinion [although] not quite as solid as it used to be.\u201d Neither the trial court nor the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, considered the legal effect of Hrin\u2019s requirement that the defendant put on evidence to disabuse Hrin of this opinion. This latter requirement raises a presumption of partiality as a matter of law, and therefore does not implicate 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). <em>Cf. Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 218, 102 S.Ct. 940, 946, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982) (in which no such presumption by operation of law applied); <em>see </em>id. at 222 n. *, 102 S.Ct. at 948 n. * (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-14\">The sixth amendment guarantees to each defendant a fair and impartial trial by a jury of his or her peers. The right to trial by impartial jury, old as the Magna Carta, is fundamental to our system of justice. <em>See Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 151-56, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1448-1451, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968). Consistency with this constitutional provision requires that each juror lay aside a prior perception or opinion and \u201crender a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, supra, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643. Consequently, no juror may enter the jury box with an opinion that can be changed only upon the presentation of evidence by the defense. Juror Hrin admitted to requiring such evidence, and therefore could not constitutionally sit in judgment of Yount. Accordingly, while I dissent from the view expressed in Judge Hunter\u2019s opinion that a change of venue was constitutionally required, I concur in the judgment of the court, which directs that the writ of habeas corpus be issued unless Yount is retried within a reasonable time. I do so, however, only for the reason that Juror Hrin was improperly seated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">. Two hundred ninety-two persons were selected as talesmen for Yount\u2019s second trial, 125 of whom the court dismissed as improperly chosen after learning that the Clearfield County sheriff had selected friends and acquaintances of his own in order to obtain a full complement of jurors. The court dismissed an additional four jurors for cause before questioning. Although the Magistrate\u2019s report lists 168 jurors who were questioned, I agree with Judge Hunter that the record reveals only 167.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1065-17\">.

Dozier, </em>672 F.2d 531, 545-46 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 256, 74 L.Ed.2d 200 (1982), <em>Sheppard </em>and <em>Estes </em>should be recognized as analytically distinct from <em>Rideau. Rideau </em>represents the only instance in which the Supreme Court has reversed a conviction solely on the basis of the extent and nature of pretrial publicity without a showing of actual prejudice. <em>See Mayola v. Alabama, supra, </em>623 F.2d at 997. <em>Sheppard </em>and <em>Estes, </em>in contrast, represented intrusions into the trial process which undermined the integrity of the trial. <em>See United States v. Chagra, supra, </em>669 F.2d at 249 n. 10; <em>United States v. Haldeman, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 61 n. 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
