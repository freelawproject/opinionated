Rookard claims that HHC, in violation of her First Amendment right to free speech, demoted and eventually fired her because she disclosed illegal and wasteful practices at Harlem Hospital. Judge Gagliardi dismissed Rookard\u2019s claim after a two-day bench trial, concluding that Rookard had not, as required by <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), proven that an official HHC policy caused her demotion or discharge. The central issue on appeal is the sufficiency of Rookard\u2019s proof under <em>Monell. </em>We disagree with Judge Ga-gliardi. Rookard presented sufficient evidence that her injuries resulted from an HHC policy to chill the exercise of First Amendment rights by punishing those who dare complain of corruption and mismanagement. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">Rookard\u2019s evidence consisted of her own testimony and numerous exhibits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of Rookard\u2019s case, HHC rested, and presented no evidence. The facts, as testified to by Rookard, and supported by her documentary evidence, may be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">In October, 1980 Rookard began employment, at a salary of $42,000, as Harlem Hospital\u2019s Director of Nursing. In this position Rookard supervised a staff of approximately 1,000 persons, including 600 registered and practical nurses. Rookard was hired by Anthony Summers, the hospital\u2019s Acting Executive Director. Shortly after Rookard began work Summers asked her to sign permits that would authorize unlicensed nurses employed by outside commercial agencies to work at Harlem Hospital. Rookard believed that such permits could lawfully be issued only to nurses directly employed by the hospital, and she refused to sign. Summers resented Rookard\u2019s decision and thereafter ostracized her. Rook-ard noted a number of other irregularities in the hospital\u2019s nursing department. She found that many nurses abused the hospital\u2019s \u201csign-in\u201d procedures, and either failed to sign the register, or signed for hours they had not worked; that the hospital had not kept adequate records of its use of licensed agency nurses, and could not accurately evaluate bills submitted by agencies; that nurses who worked overlapping, consecutive shifts, one shift each for the hospital and an agency, frequently were paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>both employers for the time of overlap; that Harlem Hospital, for no apparent reason, hired most of its agency nurses through a single agency (Gotham Registry); that agency nurses hired to work in specialized areas often lacked proper credentials; and that some of the foreign nurses working at the hospital had not adequately documented their immigration status. Rookard reported all of these problems to Summers, who ignored her. She took steps to eliminate the problems, and to improve efficiency, and thereby earned the enmity of a number of her nurses. She began to receive anonymous, threatening phone calls and letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Illness kept Rookard out of her office from' February to May, 1981. During Rook-ard\u2019s absence one of her subordinates, at Summers\u2019 direction, signed the permits authorizing unlicensed agency nurses to work at the hospital. Rookard, upon returning to work, refused to use the permits. She returned the permits to the State Education Department and advised the Department that they had been invalidly issued. Summers resigned his post as Harlem Hospital\u2019s Acting Executive Director in May, 1981, and was succeeded by Carl Carter as Executive Director. In July, 1981 Rookard told Carter that she planned to inform HHC\u2019s Inspector General\u2019s Office of the threats against her and of some of the problems she had found. Carter said \u201cfine,\u201d and did not object. Later that month Rookard met with HHC Inspector General Conrad Johns and told him of the threats, the dispute over unlicensed agency nurses, and the fact that nurses sometimes left work before completing their shifts. Johns, or his staff, promised an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In early August, Carter met Rookard at HHC headquarters in Manhattan and told Rookard of his decision to relieve her as Director of Nursing, and to transfer her to headquarters as an assistant to Grace Mat-sunaga, the Director of Nursing, Corporate Office. Carter told Rookard that she had been \u201cbattered enough\u201d at Harlem Hospital, and that she would be reinstated as Director of Nursing when matters \u201ccooled down,\u201d but gave no other reason for the transfer. Rookard objected to the transfer, but began work in her new position, at her previous salary, late in August. Matsunaga assigned Rookard a windowless cloak room for an office and informed her of her displeasure that Rookard\u2019s salary was higher than hers. Rookard worked on \u201cspecial projects\u201d for Matsunaga into early 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">On January 28, 1982 HHC\u2019s Inspector General\u2019s Office reported on the investigation of Harlem Hospital it had conducted following Rookard\u2019s transfer. The Inspector General\u2019s report stated that Gotham Registry had overcharged Harlem Hospital $518,686.18 between September, 1977 and May, 1981. Harlem Hospital, the report found, had repeatedly paid Gotham for full working shifts when Gotham\u2019s nurses actually worked only part shifts. Although Rookard had, by January, 1981, reduced the number of tours serviced by Gotham nurses by 43%, the hospital\u2019s use of Gotham nurses returned to previous levels when, in March, 1981, illness kept Rookard away from work. The report also found that Summers\u2019 plan to use unlicensed agency nurses \u201cwas clearly in violation of state rules and regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">On March 9, 1982 Carlotta Brantley, HHC\u2019s Vice President for Corporate Affairs, informed Rookard that Matsunaga no longer would tolerate an assistant earning more than she earned, that budget cuts necessitated personnel changes within HHC, and that she, Rookard, would have to find a new position. Brantley offered to employ Rookard as an entry-level nurse, an offer which Rookard indignantly refused. By letter dated March 19, 1982 Brantley gave Rookard notice of discharge, effective April 30, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Rookard retained counsel, who requested HHC\u2019s General Counsel to stay the scheduled discharge. On April 28th the General Counsel informed Rookard\u2019s attorney that a stay would not be granted. On April 29th Rookard filed suit in the Southern District for an injunction against discharge. Judge Gagliardi denied the injunction; Rookard was discharged; and Rookard\u2019s claim against HHC for reinstatement as Director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>of Nursing and damages was tried on May 17th and 18th.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Under <em>Monell v. Department of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), a plaintiff suing a municipal corporation, such as HHC, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 must prove that the constitutional wrong complained of resulted from the corporation\u2019s official policy, custom, ordinance, regulation, or decision. As a municipal corporation cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 on a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory, <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 691-94, 98 S.Ct. at 2036-37, proof that the corporation employed a tortfeasor will not, standing alone, establish liability. <em>Monell </em>thus required Rookard to show that an official HHC policy of punishing \u201cwhistle-blowers,\u201d in violation of her First Amendment right to free speech, caused her transfer and discharge. The district judge ruled Rookard\u2019s evidence insufficient to establish the existence of any relevant HHC policy, and so dismissed the case. .We disagree with the judge\u2019s ruling and find, as a matter of law, that Rookard\u2019s proof was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">A single unlawful discharge, if ordered by a person \u201cwhose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,\u201d <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. at 2037, may support an action against the municipal corporation. The difficulty, of course, lies in identifying those officials whose actions, because they may fairly be treated as the municipality\u2019s own actions, establish policy. Where an official has final authority over significant matters involving the exercise of discretion, the choices he makes represent government policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Bowen v. Watkins, </em>669 F.2d 979, 989 (5th Cir.1982). An official has final authority if his decisions, at the time they are made, for practical or legal reasons constitute the municipality\u2019s final decisions. <em>See Familias Uni-das v. Briscoe, </em>619 F.2d 391, 404 (5th Cir. 1980). An allegation of policy-making authority thus requires proof of the official\u2019s scope of employment and his role within the municipal or corporate organization.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An official\u2019s title, though not dispositive of his authority to make policy, <em>see Schneider v. City of Atlanta, </em>628 F.2d 915, 920 (5th Cir.1980), is relevant for the inferences fairly to be drawn therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Having evaluated Rookard\u2019s evidence under the principles above, we conclude that Rookard sufficiently established both Carter\u2019s and Brantley\u2019s authority to make policy. Rookard proved that Carter held the post of Executive Director of Harlem Hospital; that Rookard herself, as Director of Nursing, held a high position and supervised approximately 1,000 employees; that Carter ordered her transfer; and that the transfer occurred. This evidence establishes that Carter held a top level position with HHC and had authority to order the transfer. Rookard similarly proved that Brantley held the post of Vice President for Corporate Affairs and had authority to order her discharge. Equally important, there was evidence that Carter\u2019s and Brantley\u2019s authority over personnel decisions was final. On August 7, 1981, several days after Carter transferred Rookard, HHC President Stanley Brezenoff received an anonymous telegram warning him that the \u201cEstablishment\u201d wanted to \u201cremove\u201d Rookard because \u201cshe exposed frauds.\u201d Brezenoff referred this telegram to Carter. In April, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>1982, when Rookard\u2019s counsel requested a stay of the scheduled discharge, HHC\u2019s General Counsel declined to grant a stay or to reverse the transfer. The reluctance of HHC\u2019s President and General Counsel to intervene, or even to inquire into Rookard\u2019s claims, confirms that Carter and Brantley had final authority in personnel matters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, HHC\u2019s counsel conceded at trial that HHC is \u201chighly decentralized.\u201d We think that this evidence, in the absence of rebuttal evidence from HHC, sufficiently established Carter\u2019s and Brantley\u2019s policy-making authority. We accordingly hold, on the present record, that if Carter transferred Rookard, and Brantley fired her, because she brought evidence of malfeasance and corruption to HHC\u2019s Inspector General, they established HHC policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Of course, to prevail, Rookard must prove more than the existence of an official policy. Under <em>Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), she also must prove that her speech (1) was constitutionally protected and (2) was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the action taken against her. Because the district judge dismissed under <em>Monell, </em>he did not consider the sufficiency of Rookard\u2019s evidence under <em>Mt. Healthy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The First Amendment protects a government employee from discharge for speech upon matters of public concern, <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983), unless, under all the circumstances, the employee\u2019s interest in free comment is outweighed by the State\u2019s interest in the efficiency of its public services. <em>See Pickering v. Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1734, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). In striking the balance between these interests, a court should consider whether the speech impaired the employee\u2019s ability to perform his duties, disrupted working relationships requiring personal loyalty and confidence, or otherwise impeded the regular operation of the employing agency. <em>See Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 569-70 &amp; 572-73, 88 S.Ct. at 1735 &amp; 1736-37. Tested under these principles, Rookard\u2019s complaint to HHC\u2019s Inspector General clearly is constitutionally protected. An allegation of corrupt and wasteful practices at a large municipal hospital, made to the city official empowered to investigate such charges, obviously involves a matter of public concern. The matters of which Rookard complained were her proper concern; as Director of Nursing, it was her duty to do as she did. There is no suggestion that Rookard\u2019s speech impaired her ability to perform her job, or impeded the regular operation of Harlem Hospital. Rookard attempted to minimize the disruption of working relationships by giving Carter advance notice of her intention to speak to the Inspector General. That Rookard\u2019s speech was made privately, rather than publicly, did not remove it from First Amendment protection. <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consol. School Dist., </em>439 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Rookard also has shown that her complaint was a substantial factor behind the transfer. Without having previously expressed discontent with Rookard\u2019s work, Carter ordered the transfer shortly after Rookard spoke to the Inspector General. Carter gave no reason for the transfer except to remark that Rookard had been \u201cbattered enough.\u201d The record contains no evidence that the transfer was for cause. In light of Rookard\u2019s long and distinguished career as a nursing administrator, and her previous successful service as Director of Nursing at a different HHC hospital, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>treatment can only be explained as retaliation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Brantley was responsible for Rookard\u2019s discharge on April 30, 1982. As Vice President for Corporate Affairs she must have known of the Inspector General\u2019s report resulting from Rookard\u2019s transfer and Rookard\u2019s earlier treatment by Carter. The conclusion is inescapable that Brantley\u2019s shabby treatment of Rookard and the discharge were both intended to make it clear to HHC personnel that blowing the whistle would not be tolerated and would be met with swift retribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We thus conclude that Rookard met all the requirements of <em>Monell </em>and <em>Mt. Healthy. </em>The district judge should not have granted judgment to HHC, and a remand is necessary. We do not, of course, hold that Rookard has conclusively established a case against HHC. Upon remand, both parties will be free to present evidence regarding the points discussed above and the issues not reached because of the dismissal following the plaintiff\u2019s case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-12\">. Rookard also presented two witnesses who testified only to her professional qualifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\">. Rookard\u2019s complaint named both HHC and the City of New York as defendants. All claims against the City of New York were dismissed by consent of the parties at the close of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-10\">. The issue raised by <em>Monell </em>is not whether a particular official generally may be characterized as a policy-maker, but whether that official\u2019s particular decision established a policy fairly attributable to the municipality. Thus municipal liabiility may be predicated upon the unconstitutional acts of a subordinate official who has been delegated final authority in limited areas. <em>See generally, </em>Schnapper, Civil Rights Litigation After Monell, <em>79 Colum.L.Rev. 213, 219-24 (1979).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b135-13\">. Mayors may be treated as policy-makers without proof of their specific powers and responsibilities. <em>See Quinn </em>v. <em>Syracuse Model Neighborhood Corp., </em>613 F.2d 438, 448 (2d Cir. 1980). Lesser officials, however, cannot similarly be presumed to embody plenary municipal power.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\">. The President\u2019s and General Counsel\u2019s failure to intervene is relevant not as a ratification of the transfer and discharge, but as indirect evidence of the scope of Carter\u2019s and Brantley\u2019s authority. If Carter and Brantley had not had final authority, Rookard\u2019s high position, combined with the Inspector General\u2019s report finding merit in her allegations about Harlem Hospital, could reasonably have been expected to prompt an investigation of the claim of retaliatory discharge. This is not a case where a high official notified of a pending discharge claimed to be unlawful could reasonably decline to investigate because of the claim\u2019s apparent lack of merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b137-10\">. The controversy that Rookard\u2019s allegations created at Harlem Hospital may explain Carter\u2019s decision to order the transfer. Apparently, many hospital employees and community members supported Rookard\u2019s efforts at reform. As noted, on August 7, 1981 anonymous persons who signed themselves as \u201cConcerned employees of Harlem Hospital,\u201d sent HHC President Brezenoff a telegram stating that Rookard\u2019s success in \u201cexpos[ing] frauds\u201d had turned the \u201cEstablishment\u201d against her. Six days later, on August 13, 1981, anonymous persons who signed themselves as \u201cThe Harlem Community and the Concerned Staff of Harlem Hospital Center,\u201d sent Mayor Koch a telegram stating that Harlem Hospital was \u201cin crisis\u201d because Carter was \u201cunqualified\u201d and because Rookard, \u201ca brave and honest woman,\u201d had been removed from her job. The Mayor\u2019s Office referred this second telegram to HHC Inspector General Johns. In late August, Carter told an investigator from the Inspector General\u2019s Office that Rookard\u2019s allegations were false and that she would retract them in a letter to the \u201cBlack Voice.\u201d Carter thus was aware in late August, and presumably was aware before the transfer, of community support for Rookard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b137-15\">. Of course, upon remand, HHC will be entitled to reopen its case and to present evidence. The course of proceedings at trial compels this result. After Rookard rested, HHC moved to dismiss under <em>Monell </em>The district judge clearly stated his belief that Rookard\u2019s proof was insufficient under <em>Monell, </em>and did so in words that left no doubt that dismissal would follow. The district judge then asked HHC\u2019s attorney if he rested his case, and the attorney replied that he did rest. HHC\u2019s answer alleged that Rook-ard would have been fired without regard to her speech, and simple fairness requires that HHC be allowed to present evidence on that defense and on other relevant points.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b137-8\">VAN GRAAFEILAND, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ali\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Although, had I been in Judge Gagliardi\u2019s shoes, I probably would have done exactly as he did, I concur in my colleagues decision to vote for reversal. In voting to decide this very close question in appellant\u2019s favor, I am influenced somewhat by (1) testimony that appellant was treated most unfairly, (2) evidence of corruption and misfeasance in a publicly funded and supervised institution, and (3) the inadequacy of appellant\u2019s legal representation in the district court. I want to make clear, however, that, although I concur in the decision to reverse, I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that appellant proved as a matter of law the existence of an official HHC policy of punishing \u201cwhistle-blowers\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Appellee is a public benefit corporation created by Chapter 1016 of the Laws of 1969. N.Y.Unconsol. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 7381-7406 (McKinney 1979). It is administered by a sixteen member board of directors consisting of New York City\u2019s Administrator of Health Services, Chief Administrative Officer of Health Functions, Director of Community Mental Health Services, Administrator of Human Resources, and Deputy Mayor-City Administrator, together with the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, and ten mayoral appointees, five of whom are designated by the City Council. \u00a7 7384.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">Appellant\u2019s action against the corporation was commenced on April 29, 1982. An amended complaint was served on May 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>1982, and the case went to trial on May 17, 1982, one day before appellee\u2019s answer was filed. Much of the 17-day interval between the bringing of the suit and the start of trial was devoted to the taking of depositions, transcripts of which apparently had not been completed and exchanged when the case went to trial. No deposition was offered in evidence by appellant\u2019s attorney. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the district court asked in obvious surprise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">You have no further witnesses? Have you had a chance to read and digest the <em>Monell </em>case? I suggest you go to the library either right now or sometime this afternoon and read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">I will adjourn this case until tomorrow morning at 10:00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">This was a red-flag warning to appellant\u2019s counsel that the district court was not satisfied with the proof he had offered. Nonetheless, counsel rested. It is not at all surprising that the district court thereafter granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Appellant\u2019s skimpy proof showed that on August 7, 1981, Stanley Brezenoff, appel-lee\u2019s president, received an anonymous telegram informing him of Harlem Hospital frauds uncovered by appellant and her fear of removal by the \u201cestablishment\u201d. Mr. Brezenoff immediately filed a \u201cConfidential Committee Report\u201d with appellee\u2019s \u201cOffice of the Inspector General\u201d requesting \u201cany and all information regarding the aforementioned disclosures.\u201d A five-month investigation followed, evidenced by 160 pages of reports. These undisputed facts hardly are indicative of a corporate policy to punish whistle-blowers. Indeed, the very existence of the Office of the Inspector General is indicative of a contrary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The reports from the Inspector General\u2019s office disclosed, among other things, that Carl Carter, whom my colleagues find to be a policy-making official, was not even aware of the fact that he had to put appellant\u2019s relief from duty in writing until a confidential investigator told him to do so. Reporting further on his investigation of Carter, the confidential investigator stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">The C.I. asked Mr. Carter about the allegations of misconduct mentioned in the complaint. He stated that none of the allegations were [sic] true and that Ms. Rookard is supposed to write a letter to the \u201cBlack Voice\u201d saying that they are not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">Mr. Carter was asked how Ms. Rookard was dismissed from Harlem Hospital. He stated that Ms. Rookard and himself mutually agreed that she would- be relieved of her duties. He continued that Ms. Rookard was unable to get across to Staff. Several times she has been threatened. A nurse actually slapped her according to Carter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">He informed the C.I. that a letter is in her personnel folder indicating that she was reassigned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">These, I suggest, do not read like reports of interviews with a policy-making corporate official.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">The report of the investigator\u2019s conversation with appellant reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">She also stated that while she was employed at Harlem Hospital, she was threatened many times with physical harm. The threats began after she was there for a month. According to Ms. Rookard the staff (nursing) was not accountable to anyone for anything and there was a lack of performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-15\">j}s * :}: <em>% </em>:}s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-16\">She further stated that each time an administrator is removed by a particular faction of individuals it adds fuel to their fire and makes it impossible for a good administrator to survive at Harlem Hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-17\">I find it difficult to equate the phrase \u201ca particular faction of individuals\u201d with the officials and administrators who made corporate policy for the association. In sum, I do not agree with the majority that \u201cRook-ard presented sufficient evidence that her injuries resulted from an HHC policy to chill the exercise of First Amendment rights by punishing those who dare complain of corruption and mismanagement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">One thing is clear, however, and that is that conditions at Harlem Hospital were chaotic and had been so since appellee as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>sumed jurisdiction over it. In the eleven year period between 1970 and 1981, appellee had five different presidents, and Harlem Hospital had at least eleven Executive Directors. Dr. Summers was replaced after it was learned that he had used $2,000 of Harlem Hospital money to provide a summer job for his son at another hospital. This, however, was only the tip of the iceberg. As Judge Lumbard has pointed out, the Hospital had been bilked of funds in excess of one half million dollars. This was wrongdoing which could exist only if public disclosure was suppressed. If this condition was caused by a lack of supervision or training so severe as to amount to deliberate indifference or gross negligence on the part of top echelon corporate officials, resulting in a deprivation of appellant's constitutional right to speak out for what was right, section 1983 liability may be found to exist. <em>Doe v.
