Hudson, appeals the Superior Court\u2019s <em>(Mangones, </em>J.) denial of his motion for partial summary judgment, and its decision to grant the defendant\u2019s companion motion for summary judgment. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>In September 1994, the plaintiff, a dairy farmer in Hinsdale, made a claim against an insurance policy issued by the defendant, the Farm Family Mutual Insurance Company, for property damage to his dairy cattle from stray voltage. Stray voltage typically results when \u201cneutral-to-earth\u201d voltage is present in elevated levels. <em>See ZumBerge v. Northern States Power Co., </em>481 N.W.2d 103, 107 (Minn. Ct. App. 1992). A farm\u2019s milking equipment, fences, watering troughs, and other implements may become electrically charged by this energy. <em>See Fox v. Interstate Power Co., </em>521 N.W.2d 762, 763 (Iowa Ct. App. 1994); <em>Hoover\u2019s Dairy, Inc. v. Mid-America Dairymen, </em>700 S.W.2d 426, 429 (Mo. 1985). While stray voltage can be present on a farm for years without being detected by humans, prolonged exposure can lead to behavioral changes in cows who unwittingly become an integral part of an electrical circuit and receive an electrical shock each time they come into contact with a charged structure. <em>See Fox, </em>521 N.W.2d at 763. Not surprisingly, the cows begin to avoid these structures, and may, for example, become reluctant to drink out of their watering troughs, resulting in dehydration and an inability to produce milk. <em>See Kolpin v. Pioneer Power &amp; Light Co., </em>469 N.W.2d 595, 598 (Wis. 1991). Other health problems may also result from stray voltage, and the cows may ultimately become useless as dairy animals. <em>See Fox, </em>521 N.W.2d at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The plaintiff informed the defendant that tests performed on his farm revealed the presence of significant stray voltage. As a result of further testing, Public Service Company of New Hampshire installed a \u201cblocker,\u201d which, the plaintiff reports, effectively ended the stray voltage problems. The plaintiff asserted that prior to this corrective action his cows had developed various medical problems as a result of the stray voltage, and that some cows had died and others had to be slaughtered. He claimed damages in excess of $100,000. He sought coverage under the \u201cSpecial Farm Package 10\u201d insurance policy which he first purchased from the defendant some twenty years ago. The plaintiff argued that the following sections of the policy provided coverage for his losses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">This policy insures against direct physical loss to covered property caused by the following perils, but only for those perils in the Peril Group shown on YOUR schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">R. Sudden and Accidental Damage from Artifically [sic] Generated Electrical Current. We do not cover loss to a tube, transistor or similar electronic component.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>V LIVESTOCK. WE cover loss or damage to LIVESTOCK caused by perils A through R and, in addition, loss or damage to LIVESTOCK caused by electrocution 1 . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The defendant denied coverage on the grounds that the losses did not fall within any of the policy\u2019s enumerated perils. The plaintiff brought a declaratory judgment action in superior court challenging the defendant\u2019s denial of coverage and, thereafter, moved for partial summary judgment. The defendant countered with its own motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and denied the plaintiff\u2019s. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The plaintiff argues that the injury to his cows constituted both \u201cSudden and Accidental Damage from Artific[i]ally Generated Electrical Current\u201d and \u201closs or damage to LIVESTOCK caused by electrocution.\u201d The defendant counters that long-term exposure to an electrical current is not \u201csudden and accidental,\u201d and that the term \u201celectrocution\u201d unambiguously refers to exposure to electricity that results in immediate death. Neither term is defined in the policy. Because we find the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d ambiguous, and interpret the policy to provide coverage, we need not address the parties\u2019 disparate interpretations of the term \u201celectroc\u00fation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">This court interprets an insurance policy in the same manner as any other contract. <em>Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. 764, 770, 423 A.2d 980, 984 (1980). If the language of a policy is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation and one interpretation favors coverage, the policy will be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer. <em>Green Mt. Ins. Co. v. George, </em>138 N.H. 10, 14, 634 A.2d 1011, 1014 (1993). <em>See generally </em>Abraham, <em>A Theory of Insurance Policy Interpretation, </em>95 MICH. L. REV. 531 (1996) (noting the policies behind this rule). By statute, the burden is on the insurance carrier to prove a lack of coverage. RSA 491:22-a (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In support of their positions on both clauses of the policy, the parties have assembled a bevy of dictionaries, many of which support their respective interpretations. In such a case, it is easy to understand why this court has in the past questioned the role of dictionaries in the interpretive process, <em>e.g., J &amp; W Industries, Inc. v. Frank Enterprises, Inc., </em>111 N.H. 372, 373-74, 284 A.2d 907, 909 (1971), and this and other courts have maintained that, to some degree, language is always imprecise, <em>see Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>G. W. Thomas Drayage &amp; R. Co., </em>442 P.2d 641, 643-44 (Cal. 1968); <em>URS Corporation v. Ash, </em>427 N.E.2d 1295, 1299 (Ill. App. Ct. 1981); <em>Spectrum Enterprises, Inc. v. Helm Corp., </em>114 N.H. 773, 776, 329 A.2d 144, 146 (1974). Dictionaries are of some value, however, to the extent they inform us of the common understanding of terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\">When disputed terms are not defined in the policy, we read them in context and interpret the language \u201cas would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy.\u201d <em>High Country Assocs. v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>139 N.H. 39, 41, 648 A.2d 474, 476 (1994); <em>see Weaver v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>140 N.H. 780, 782, 674 A.2d 975, 977 (1996). While a claimed ambiguity need not be apparent on the face of the policy, <em>Lapierre v. Cabral, </em>122 N.H. 301, 305, 444 A.2d 522, 525 (1982), we will not perform amazing feats of linguistic gymnastics to find a purported ambiguity, <em>see Int\u2019l Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Mfgs. &amp; Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>140 N.H. 15, 20, 661 A.2d 1192, 1195 (1995). The trial court\u2019s interpretation of the policy, including its determination that certain language is or is not ambiguous, is reviewed by this court <em>de novo. See Raudonis v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>137 N.H. 57, 59, 623 A.2d 746, 747 (1993); <em>see also Holden Eng\u2019g and Surveying v. Pembroke Rd. Realty Trust, </em>137 N.H. 393, 395, 628 A.2d 260, 262 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">As the parties note in their briefs, the term \u201csudden and accidental\u201d has been extensively litigated in connection with pollution exclusion clauses in general liability policies. <em>See Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Republic Ins. Co., </em>929 P.2d 535, 541 nn.3-4 (Wyo. 1996) (citing over three dozen cases that have reached varying results on this issue). The courts that have interpreted the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d have done so in myriad ways, but the principal dispute has centered on the word \u201csudden.\u201d Some courts have held that \u201csudden\u201d connotes an event which occurs quickly or abruptly. <em>E.g., Aeroquip Corp. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., Inc., </em>26 F.3d 893, 894 (9th Cir. 1994) (per curiam); <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. v. Belleville Ind., </em>555 N.E.2d 568, 572 (Mass. 1990); <em>Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>905 P.2d 760, 763-64 (Okla. 1995); <em>Sharon Steel v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur., </em>931 P.2d 127, 135 (Utah 1997). Others courts, while acknowledging that \u201csudden\u201d may contain a temporal component, have concluded that the term may also be read to be synonymous with \u201cunexpected.\u201d <em>E.g., Hecla Min. Co. v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>811 P.2d 1083, 1092 (Colo. 1991); <em>St. Paul Fire v. McCormick &amp; Baxter, </em>923 P.2d 1200, 1217 (Or. 1996); <em>Queen City Farms v. Central Nat. Ins. Co., </em>882 P.2d 703, 720 (Wash. 1994); <em>Just v. Land Reclamation, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>Ltd., </em>456 N.W.2d 570, 573 (Wis. 1990). Accordingly, many of these courts have determined that the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d is ambiguous and interpreted the language in favor of providing coverage. <em>See St. Paul Fire, </em>923 P.2d at 1218; <em>Just, </em>456 N.W.2d at 573; <em>see also Claussen v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>380 S.E.2d 686, 688, 690 (Ga. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">The policy before us provides coverage when an insured suffers loss or damage to livestock that is caused by \u201cSudden and Accidental Damage from Artificially Generated Electrical Current.\u201d'The plaintiff argues that the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d is interchangeable with the phrase \u201cunexpected and unintended.\u201d The defendant counters that adoption of the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s position that \u2018sudden\u2019 means only \u2018unexpected\u2019 or \u2018unintended\u2019 would . . . make it synonymous with and redundant to \u2018accidental.\u2019\u201d We think the defendant has misread the plaintiff\u2019s argument. \u201cSimply put, sudden means unexpected, and accidental means unintended.\u201d <em>New Castle County v. Hartford Acc. and Indem. Co., </em>933 F.2d 1162, 1194 (3rd Cir. 1991). The plaintiff is not arguing that \u201csudden,\u201d standing alone, should mean <em>both </em>\u201cunexpected and unintended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, defining \u201csudden\u201d to include unexpected events does not strip the word of its independent meaning and significance. While it is certainly possible to read the term \u201caccidental\u201d to include unexpected events, <em>see High Country Assocs., </em>139 N.H. at 44, 648 A.2d at 477-78, the joint use of the words \u201csudden and accidental\u201d serves distinct purposes not accomplished by either word standing alone. <em>See, e.g., Queen City Farms, </em>882 P2d at 720 (noting that the exclusion of \u201csudden and accidental\u201d events denies coverage to an event that, while unintentional, resulted from the insured\u2019s turning a \u201cblind eye\u201d to festering problems). Even if we were to find the words to be partially coextensive, we note that \u201c[\u00a1Insurance policies routinely use words that, while not strictly redundant, are somewhat synonymous.\u201d <em>New Castle County, </em>933 F.2d at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In a different context, a leading text on insurance law instructs that \u201c\u2018sudden\u2019 is not to be construed as synonymous with instantaneous.\u201d 10A M. RHODES, COUCH ON INSURANCE 2D \u00a7 42:396 (rev. ed. 1982) (\u201cWhen coverage is limited to a sudden \u2018breaking\u2019 of machinery the word \u2018sudden\u2019 should be given its primary meaning as a happening without previous notice\u201d). While not determinative, such an interpretation suggests that the term \u201csudden and accidental\u201d is at least reasonably susceptible to an interpretation consistent with \u201cunexpected and unintended.\u201d <em>Cf. Ala. Plating v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar., </em>690 So. 2d 331, 336 (Ala. 1996). Finally, even if the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201csudden\u201d is given the temporal connotation the defendant advances, in this policy it is not clear if in order to be covered the <em>onset </em>of damages must occur \u201csuddenly\u201d or if the <em>aggregate </em>damage must occur \u201csuddenly.\u201d <em>See Morton Intern., Inc. v. General Acc. Ins. Co., </em>629 A.2d 831, 847 (N.J. 1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>512 U.S. 1245 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">In short, the term \u201csudden and accidental\u201d is, at the very least, not \u201cso clear as to create no ambiguity which might affect the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>Cacavas v. Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co., </em>128 N.H. 204, 208, 512 A.2d 423, 425 (1986). We therefore construe \u201csudden and accidental\u201d in such a way as to provide coverage to the insured on the basis that the phrase includes events that are \u201cunexpected and unintended.\u201d <em>See Green Mt. Ins. Co., </em>138 N.H. at 14, 634 A.2d at 1014. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment should have been granted, and the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
