The plaintiffs appeal the denial of their request for attorney\u2019s fees. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">In January 1995, the board of education established a task force to review special education laws and policy in the State. The task force was divided into five subcommittees, whose responsibilities included producing reports concerning recommended changes in various aspects of special education. Each subcommittee submitted its report to the task force in July 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">On September 29, 1995, the attorney for the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants requesting access to records related to the task force. <em>See </em>RSA 91-A:4, IV (1990). The parties essentially agree that the plaintiffs\u2019 request encompassed two general classes of documents: (1) written communications between and among task force participants, members of the board of education, and employees of the department of education concerning task force activities; and (2) reports and documents, including drafts, generated by the subcommittees in developing their recommendations to the task force.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">On October 11, 1995, the defendants responded to the plaintiffs\u2019 request without providing any records. <em>Cf. id. </em>(directing public body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>or agency to respond \u201cwithin 5 business days of request\u201d). The defendants stated that the \u201cDepartment of Justice has advised us that RSA 91-A:4 does not apply to internal draft documents but applies only to completed documents.\u201d After receiving no additional response from the defendants, the plaintiffs, on October 23, 1995, filed a petition in superior court to obtain the requested records. <em>See </em>RSA 91-A:7 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">On November 7, 1995, the plaintiffs received a draft of the task force\u2019s report, which, the superior court determined, \u201cincorporated in some form\u201d the final recommendations of the subcommittees. On November 16, 1995, the defendants provided a further response to the plaintiffs\u2019 request and produced documents responsive to one part of that request: documents evidencing written communications between and among specified persons concerning activities of the task force. The defendants\u2019 attorney acknowledged that the defendants\u2019 letter of October 11 \u201cdid not really address\u201d that aspect of the plaintiffs\u2019 request. The defendants, however, maintained their \u201cposition that \u2018works in progress,\u2019 drafts, or preliminary ideas which represent the thought process or decision making process of a government board or agency [are] not subject to\u201d disclosure under RSA chapter 91-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In their subsequent response to the petition, the defendants challenged disclosure of the draft documents and asserted that the portion of the request concerning written communications had been \u201cinadvertently overlooked initially.\u201d Accordingly, the principal area of continuing dispute concerned the reports developed by the subcommittees of the task force. During the hearing on the petition, the defendants\u2019 attorney explained that the inadvertence with respect to the communications documents resulted from the defendants\u2019 primary focus on objecting to disclosure of the reports of the subcommittees.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Rejecting the defendants\u2019 position that the subcommittee reports were exempt from disclosure, the superior court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition. As to the plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">In this case, the defendants refused the [plaintiffs\u2019] request for the subcommittees\u2019 reports on the advice of the Department of Justice. The Court finds that the defendants\u2019 delay in providing the other requested materials to the [plaintiffs] was due to inadvertence. Thus, the defendants\u2019 conduct does not rise to the level of \u201cknowing violation\u201d and attorney\u2019s fees are not proper in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The plaintiffs appeal the ruling on attorney\u2019s fees, arguing that the court erred: (1) in holding that inadvertence justifies a denial of attorney\u2019s fees; (2) in finding that the defendants\u2019 failure to promptly provide requested documents was, in fact, inadvertent; and (3) in failing to conclude that the defendants\u2019 dilatoriness in responding and complying, especially as to the communications documents, <em>see </em>RSA 91-A:4, IV, required an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The interpretation of a statute, including the Right-to-Know Law, \u201cis to be decided ultimately by this court.\u201d <em>Union Leader Corp. v. City of Nashua, </em>141 N.H. 473, 475, 686 A.2d 310, 312 (1996) (quotation omitted). The superior court\u2019s legal conclusions and its application of law to fact are ultimately questions for this court. <em>Fleet Bank-N.H. v. Chain Constr. Corp., </em>138 N.H. 136, 139, 635 A.2d 1348, 1350 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The provision of the Right-to-Know Law concerning the award of attorney\u2019s fees states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">If any body or agency or employee or member thereof, in violation of the provisions of this chapter, refuses to provide a public record or refuses access to a public proceeding to a person who reasonably requests the same, such body, agency, or person shall be liable for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in a lawsuit under this chapter provided that the court finds that such lawsuit was necessary in order to make the information available or the proceeding open to the public. Fees shall not be awarded unless the court finds that the body, agency, or person knew or should have known that the conduct engaged in was a violation of this chapter ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">RSA 91-A:8, I.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Accordingly, an award of attorney\u2019s fees requires two findings by the superior court: (1) that the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit was necessary to make the information available; and (2) that the defendant knew or should have known that its conduct violated the statute. In this case, the record indicates that the defendants provided the communications documents only <em>after </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 petition was filed and that they maintained their opposition to disclosing the subcommittees\u2019 drafts and reports until the ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 petition; the superior court, however, never addressed whether the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit was <em>necessary </em>to obtain the requested records. Furthermore, the court denied attorney\u2019s fees based on a conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>defendants\u2019 conduct was not a \u201cknowing violation,\u201d and failed to analyze whether the defendants <em>should have knoion </em>that their conduct violated the statute. <em>See </em>RSA 91-A:8, I.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"> We hold that the superior court utilized an incorrect legal standard in resolving the plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees. As to the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments, we agree that the word \u201cshall\u201d in the statutory provision concerning attorney\u2019s fees, <em>see id., </em>acts as a mandate if the necessary findings to support an award of attorney\u2019s fees are made. <em>See City of Manchester v. Doucet, </em>133 N.H. 680, 683, 582 A.2d 288, 290 (1990) (\u201cshall\u201d is a statutory command, requiring mandatory enforcement). The record, however, provides us with no basis to question the superior court\u2019s characterization of the defendants\u2019 conduct as inadvertent or to determine, in the first instance, whether the defendants\u2019 alleged inadvertence and delayed responses require an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion, including determinations concerning the necessity of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit and the significance, under the \u201cshould have known\u201d standard, of the defendants\u2019 alleged inadvertence with respect to the communications documents and their reliance on legal advice as to the subcommittees\u2019 drafts and reports, <em>cf. Voelbel v. Town of Bridgewater, </em>140 N.H. 446, 448, 667 A.2d 1028, 1029 (1995). Should there be a resulting award, it should be tailored to properly reflect the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in relation to the conduct giving rise to the award. We leave it to the trial court on remand to determine whether it can make the findings and rulings required in light of this opinion on the record before it, or whether it will require additional evidence from the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
