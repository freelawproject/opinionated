He also challenges the board\u2019s decision to limit its consideration of new evidence he raised on appeal. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">The claimant suffered a back injury on May 20, 1991, when he fell from a truck while working for his employer, Stonyfield Farm, Inc. The respondents, Stonyfield Farm and its insurance carrier, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, voluntarily paid the claimant temporary total disability benefits until 1993. In May 1993, the respondents requested that the claimant\u2019s benefits be terminated pursuant to RSA 281-A:48 (Supp. 1997) because he was no longer totally disabled, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:28 (Supp. 1997), and he failed to cooperate with vocational rehabilitation, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:25, V (Supp. 1997). In July 1993, the claimant prevailed on both issues after a hearing before a department of labor hearing officer. The respondents did not appeal this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">In April 1994, the respondents sought termination of the claimant\u2019s benefits based on the same issues raised in the July 1993 hearing. In his response, the claimant alleged that the respondents failed to pay his medical bills. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:23 (Supp. 1997). In December 1994, a department of labor hearing officer found that the claimant was not totally disabled and reduced his benefits to the diminished earning capacity rate. The hearing officer also ordered the respondents to pay the claimant\u2019s medical bills, and concluded that although the claimant cooperated with vocational rehabilitation, he lacked \u201cmotivation to improve his vocational problems\u201d and thus was no longer entitled to vocational rehabilitation assistance. The parties appealed to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>After a <em>de novo </em>hearing in March 1996, the board concluded that the claimant was not totally disabled, was entitled to compensation at' the diminished earning capacity rate, and cooperated with vocational rehabilitation. The board denied the claimant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s'fees. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:44, I.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">During his hearing before the board, the claimant presented evidence of his March 1995 back surgery to establish his current disabled condition. The board, however, limited its consideration of the March 1995 surgery to the claimant\u2019s condition as of December 1994, which was the issue previously before the department of labor hearing officer and appealed to the board. The claimant appeals. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:43, 1(c) (Supp, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">On appeal, the claimant argues that the board erred in: (1) ruling that evidence relating to the claimant\u2019s March. 1995 surgery was only relevant to the extent of his disability as of December 1994; (2) ruling that the issue of the respondents\u2019 failure to pay the claimant\u2019s medical bills was not properly before it; and (3) denying the claimant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">We will overturn the board\u2019s decision only for errors of law, or if we are satisfied by a clear preponderance of the evidence before us that the decision is unjust or unreasonable. RSA 541:13 (1997); <em>Appeal of Kehoe, </em>141 N.H. 412, 415, 686 A.2d 749, 752 (1996). The claimant, as the. appealing party, bears the burden of demonstrating that the board\u2019s decision was erroneous. RSA 541:13.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">We .first address the claimant\u2019s argument that the board erroneously limited its consideration of the evidence regarding his March 1995 back surgery as relevant only to the issue of whether the claimant was disabled as of December 1994, when the department of labor hearing officer considered the matter. The claimant argues that the extent of his disability, including his current medical condition, was. the issue on appeal before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">\u201cThe [board\u2019s] <em>de novo </em>review of department of labor workers\u2019 compensation decisions is limited to issues raised in the [department of labor] proceedings being appealed.\u201d <em>Leccacorvi v. N.H. Workers\u2019 Comp. Commission, </em>135 N.H. 91, 94, 601 A.2d 165, 167 (1991) (decided under prior version of RSA 281-A:43, I (Supp. 1997)). A department of labor hearing officer\u2019s decision is \u201can adjudication as to the condition of the injured [employee] at the time it was entered,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>131 N.H. 698, 701, 559 A.2d 838, 840 (1989) (quotation and brackets omitted), and \u201cis not a judgment as to the claimant\u2019s future condition,\u201d <em>Morin v. J.H. Valliere Co., </em>113 N.H. 431, 434, 309 A.2d 153, 155 (1973). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Accordingly, the issue decided by the department of labor hearing officer and appealed to the board was the claimant\u2019s condition as of December 1994, the date of the hearing before the department of labor hearing officer, and the board correctly considered the claimant\u2019s March 1995 surgery to be relevant only to that issue. Any change in the claimant\u2019s condition as a result of his March 1995 surgery may constitute adequate grounds for filing a new petition with the department of labor, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:48,1; <em>Appeal of Elliott, </em>140 N.H. 607, 610, 675 A.2d 204, 206 (1996), which the claimant did after his 1996 hearing before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We next address the claimant\u2019s assertion that the board erred in ruling that the issue of the respondents\u2019 obligation to pay the claimant\u2019s medical bills was not properly before it. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:23. Responding to the claimant\u2019s motion for rehearing on this issue, <em>see </em>RSA 541:3 (1997), the board explained that because \u201c[medical] bills were not put in issue by the parties [at] the hearing, they cannot have been before the Panel for decision and therefore the prior decision of the Department of Labor [hearing officer] . . . must be found to be the final disposition of the matter.\u201d The claimant protests this ruling because unless this issue was before the board, the claimant could not have been a prevailing party entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under RSA 281-A:44, I.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We conclude that the board\u2019s ruling is erroneous because, based on the record before us, the issue of the respondents\u2019 obligation to pay the claimant\u2019s medical bills was properly before the board. The respondents clearly appealed this issue to the board in compliance with RSA 281-A:48, V Although the respondents did not pursue this issue during the appeal hearing, they did not formally withdraw the issue until their objection to the claimant\u2019s motion for rehearing, filed over a month after the board\u2019s decision, in which the respondents stated that they did not dispute the medical bills issue. Meanwhile, the claimant considered the medical bills issue to be contested and, therefore, addressed it in his pleadings and during his hearing before the board. After reviewing the evidence presented at the hearing before the board, we conclude that the claimant prevailed on this issue and is therefore entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. We remand to the board to determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to which the claimant is entitled. <em>City of Manchester v. Doucet, </em>133 N.H. 680, 683, 582 A.2d 288, 290 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Finally, we address the claimant\u2019s argument that the board erroneously denied his request for attorney\u2019s fees. RSA 281-A:44, I, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>[i]n any dispute over the amount of the benefit payable under this chapter which is appealed to the board or supreme court or both, the employee, if such employee prevails, shall be entitled to reasonable counsel fees and costs as approved by the board or court ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Because we have already determined that the claimant prevailed on the medical bills issue, we need only address whether he prevailed concerning the extent of his disability and the vocational rehabilitation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The claimant did not prevail on his claim that he was totally disabled. Although the board did not terminate his benefits, it reduced his temporary total disability benefits to diminished earning capacity rate benefits. The claimant did prevail, however, on the issue of whether he cooperated with vocational rehabilitation. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:25, V. Therefore, pursuant to RSA 281-A:44, I, the claimant is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for this issue. <em>See Doucet, </em>133 N.H. at 683, 582 A.2d at 290. We note that if the claimant seeks attorney\u2019s fees for his appeal to this court, he must file a separate request.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">In sum, we affirm the board\u2019s decision to limit the use of the claimant\u2019s evidence regarding his March 1995 back surgery. We reverse the board\u2019s ruling that the issue of the claimant\u2019s medical bills was not properly before it, as well as its failure to award the claimant attorney\u2019s fees for the vocational rehabilitation issue. We hold that the claimant prevailed on both of these issues, and remand for a determination of the reasonable amount of attorney\u2019s fees that the claimant should receive from the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b836-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
