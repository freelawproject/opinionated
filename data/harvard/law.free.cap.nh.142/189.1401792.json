Hoepp, filed a declaratory judgment action to determine coverage under a personal liability umbrella policy issued by the defendant, State Farm Insurance Company. He appeals the decision of the Superior Court <em>(Groff, </em>J.), denying coverage under the policy\u2019s \u201cbusiness operations\u201d exclusion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-16\">The plaintiff and John Nightingale became acquainted as members of a ski club in Waterville Valley. On Nightingale\u2019s invitation, the plaintiff joined him in three real estate investments between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>1987 and 1990. Because the plaintiff is a surgeon with a very active practice, he wanted no role in managing the investments. Consequently, the plaintiff merely provided a portion of the start-up money required for each project, while Nightingale was the managing partner and made all decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The third project ultimately failed, the bank foreclosed on the property, and the plaintiff lost his investment. When the plaintiff learned that Nightingale had mishandled funds in the third project, he reported the misconduct to the attorney general\u2019s office. Although the State initiated criminal proceedings against Nightingale, the charges were later dismissed. Nightingale responded to the criminal action by suing the plaintiff for malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking coverage for the malicious prosecution action under the personal liability umbrella policy issued by the defendant. The trial court determined that the policy\u2019s \u201cbusiness operations\u201d exclusion barred coverage because \u201cthe purchasing, holding, and developing of real property is a business operation under the policy.\u201d The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\"> The sole issue on appeal is whether the \u201cbusiness operations\u201d exclusion bars coverage for the malicious prosecution action. On appeal, the interpretation of the exclusionary language is a question of law for this court to decide. <em>Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mitchell, </em>138 N.H. 229, 231, 637 A.2d 903, 904 (1994). \u201cIf the policy language is ambiguous or where conflicting interpretations exist, we construe the policy in favor of providing coverage to the insured.\u201d <em>Weaver v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>140 N.H. 780, 781-82, 674 A.2d 975, 977 (1996). The doctrine that ambiguities in an insurance policy must be construed against the insurer \u201cis rooted in the fact that insurers have superior understanding of the terms they employ.\u201d <em>Heniser v. Frankenmuth Mut. Ins., </em>534 N.W.2d 502, 506 (Mich. 1995). Additionally, interpreting the language in favor of the insured and against the insurer is particularly applicable when ambiguities are found in an exclusionary clause. <em>Cf. M. Mooney Corp. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>136 N.H. 463, 470-71, 618 A.2d 793, 797 (1992); <em>see Merchants Ins. Group v. Warchol, </em>132 N.H. 23, 27, 560 A.2d 1162, 1164 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">We turn first to the language of the policy itself. The policy expressly excludes coverage \u201cfor any loss caused by your <em>business </em>operations or arising out of <em>business property.\u201d </em>\u201cBusiness\u201d is defined in the policy as a \u201ctrade, profession, or occupation\u201d; \u201coperations,\u201d however, is undefined. Although we have previously interpreted the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion commonly found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>homeowners\u2019 policies, <em>see Haley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>129 N.H. 512, 514, 529 A.2d 394, 396 (1987), the interpretation of the \u201cbusiness operations\u201d exclusion in the umbrella policy here is an issue of first impression, <em>cf. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Crouch, </em>140 N.H. 329, 331, 666 A.2d 964, 966 (1995) (applying \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion analysis to \u201cbusiness activities\u201d exclusion, where parties agreed that analysis was identical).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The defendant asserts in its brief that \u201c[t]he business operations exclusion is for all intents and purposes identical to the business pursuits exclusion found in homeowners\u2019 policies.\u201d Consequently, the defendant maintains, because the plaintiff\u2019s involvement in the real estate investments contained the critical elements of profit motive and continuity, <em>see Haley, </em>129 N.H. at 514, 529 A.2d at 396, the exclusion applies. <em>See, e.g., Vallas v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>624 So. 2d 568, 571-72 (Ala. 1993) (concluding \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d includes passive investment); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Drasin, </em>199 Cal. Rptr. 749, 752 (Ct. App. 1984) (determining that \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d need not be insured\u2019s sole or primary occupation).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The plaintiff counters, however, that \u201cbusiness operations\u201d differs from \u201cbusiness pursuits.\u201d Specifically, he maintains that the \u201cbusiness operations\u201d exclusion in his umbrella policy is narrower than the more common \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion. Thus, he contends, the exclusion does not bar coverage for the malicious prosecution action. <em>See, e.g., Eyler v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>824 S.W.2d 855, 859 (Ky. 1992) (activity not a \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d where insured\u2019s \u201cparticipation was limited to investing money and protecting his investment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Both interpretations of the exclusion are reasonable. As the defendant argues, at least one court has concluded that \u201cbusiness operations\u201d means essentially the same as \u201cbusiness pursuits.\u201d <em>See State Farm, Fire and Cas. Co. v. Geary, </em>699 F. Supp. 756, 761 (N.D. Cal. 1987). On the other hand, the plaintiff\u2019s argument that \u201cbusiness operations\u201d is narrower than \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d also has merit, given the active involvement that the term \u201coperation\u201d implies.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Because both interpretations of the \u201cbusiness operations\u201d exclusion are reasonable, we conclude that the policy language is ambiguous. <em>See Weaver, </em>140 N.H. at 783, 674 A.2d at 978. A more than casual reading of the policy might suggest to the insured that the \u201cbusiness operations\u201d exclusion applied only to his principal business \u2014 his active surgical practice. <em>See High Country Assocs. v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>139 N.H. 39, 41, 648 A.2d 474, 476 (1994); <em>Brickell v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>436 So. 2d 797, 801 (Miss. <em>1983). </em>Although extensive involvement in investment activities could bring an insured within the purview of the policy exclusion, the plaintiff\u2019s minimal involvement in the investments here did not. <em>See Crouch, </em>140 N.H. at 333, 666 A.2d at 966-67. Accordingly, the \u201cbusiness operations\u201d exclusion does not bar coverage for the malicious prosecution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-6\">THAYER and HORTON, JJ., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
