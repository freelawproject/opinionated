Cletus Kijek, in July 1995 for filing a complaint with the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">The following facts were adduced at the NHDOL hearing. In the summer of 1995, Kijek was employed at Osram\u2019s production plant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Exeter. On more than one occasion, Kijek complained to his supervisor that the temperatures where he worked were excessive and reaching dangerous levels. On July 15, 1995, after management failed to remedy the heat problem to his satisfaction, Kijek informed his supervisor that he intended to file a claim with OSHA alleging a violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654 (1994) (OSHA Act). On July 17, 1995, Kijek filed a claim with OSHA\u2019s Concord office. He was terminated on July 26, 1995. While Kijek\u2019s termination letter states only that it was \u201capparent\u201d that his employment at Osram was \u201cnot acceptable to either party,\u201d Osram asserted at the hearing that Kijek was terminated for filing a fraudulent workers\u2019 compensation claim and that the decision to terminate him had actually been made in 1994. The NHDOL found Osram\u2019s assertions not credible. Kijek filed a complaint pursuant to the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act with the NHDOL on August 2, 1995, alleging that he had been terminated in retaliation for filing the safety complaint with OSHA. He filed a similar complaint with the United States Department of Labor (USDOL) pursuant to section 11(c) of the OSHA Act. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(c) (1994). After a hearing on the merits, the NHDOL ordered Osram to pay Kijek back wages and reinstate him to his former position. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On appeal, Osram argues that: (1) the NHDOL should have deferred to the USDOL\u2019s jurisdiction; (2) Kijek failed to satisfy the statutory elements of RSA 275-E:2; (3) Kijek failed to follow the grievance procedures mandated by the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act; and (4) the NHDOL erred in ordering Kijek\u2019s reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">\n<em>I. Primary Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Osram argues that under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the NHDOL erred in refusing to defer its ruling pending a decision by the USDOL on Kijek\u2019s whistleblower complaint filed under section 11(c) of the OSHA Act. \u201c[W]e have long recognized the doctrine of primary jurisdiction; namely, that a court will refrain from exercising its concurrent jurisdiction to decide a question until it has first been decided by a specialized agency that also has jurisdiction to decide it.\u201d <em>N.H. Div. of Human Services v. Allard, </em>138 N.H. 604, 607, 644 A.2d 70, 72 (1994) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\"> Assuming, without deciding, that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is applicable in cases where two administrative agencies possess concurrent jurisdiction, we find no error. Primary jurisdiction did not vest with the USDOL because its own administrative rules allow for postponement of proceedings by the USDOL and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>deference to other forums, <em>see 29 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1977.18(a) (1997), where the claim asserted and factual issues underlying the claim are substantially the same, and \u201cthe forum hearing the matter . . . [has] the power to determine' the ultimate issue of discrimination,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1977.18(b) (1997); <em>cf. Bd. of Trustees v. Keene State Coll. Educ. Assoc., </em>126 N.H. 339, 342, 493 A.2d 1121, 1124 (1985) (court must defer where statute conferred primary jurisdiction to the PELRB). Here, both the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act and section 11(c) claims and the underlying facts are virtually identical. Furthermore, RSA 275-E:4 empowers the NHDOL to render judgment and order the appropriate remedy should it find a violation of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act. Accordingly, by the terms of the USDOL\u2019s own regulations, it- was appropriate for the NHDOL to proceed with its hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">\n<em>II. Elements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Osram next argues that Kijek failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act. RSA 275-E:2 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">I. No employer shall discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against any employee regarding such employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, location, or privileges of employment because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">(a) The employee, <em>in good faith, </em>reports or causes to be reported, verbally or in writing, what the employee has <em>reasonable cause to believe </em>is a violation of any law or rule adopted under the laws of this state, a political subdivision of this state, or the United States ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">(Emphasis added.) Osram argues that the \u201crecord contains no credible, objective evidence that Kijek acted in good faith or had reasonable cause to believe that [Osram] was violating any law when he filed his OSHA complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\"> As a preliminary matter, we agree with Osram that in a Whistleblowers\u2019 Act hearing before the NHDOL, the employee bears the burden of establishing discrimination. <em>Cf. Appeal of Briand, </em>138 N.H. 555, 557, 644 A.2d 47, 48 (1994) (in workers\u2019 compensation cases, claimant has burden of proving compensable accidental injury and extent of disability). On appeal, our review is governed by RSA 541:13 (1997). <em>See </em>RSA 275-E:4, II; <em>Appeal of N.H. Dept. of Employment Security, </em>140 N.H. 703, 708, 672 A.2d 697, 701 (1996). Accordingly, the party challenging the NHDOL\u2019s decision must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>ruling was clearly unreasonable or unlawful. The NHDOL\u2019s factual findings are presumed to be <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable and will not be overturned absent a showing that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support them. <em>See Appeal of Campaign for Ratepayers Rights, </em>133 N.H. 480, 483, 577 A.2d 1230, 1232 (1990). Questions of law will be resolved in a way which best effectuates the manifest purposes of the act, <em>see Appeal of Bio Energy, </em>135 N.H. 517, 519, 607 A.2d 606, 608 (1992); namely, \u201cto encourage employees to come forward and report violations without fear of losing their jobs and to ensure that as many alleged violations as possible are resolved informally within the workplace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521, 606 A.2d at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Osram first argues that the NHDOL failed to find, and the record does not support, that Kijek acted in good faith in making his complaint to OSHA. We disagree. While the NHDOL order did not explicitly state that Kijek acted in good faith, it did state that Kijek\u2019s report of the alleged OSHA violation was \u201cin compliance with RSA 275-E:2 I (a).\u201d While the term \u201cgood faith\u201d is not defined in the statute, \u201c[w]e give a statutory term that is not defined its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Board of Water Comm\u2019rs, Laconia Water Works v. Mooney, </em>139 N.H. 621, 626, 660 A.2d 1121, 1125 (1995). In the context of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act, we define \u201cgood faith\u201d as \u201cabsence of malice\u201d and \u201chonesty of intention.\u201d <em>See </em>BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 693 (6th ed. 1990); <em>cf. Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice v. Terrell, </em>925 S.W.2d 44, 60 (Tex. Ct. App. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\"> Ample evidence supports a finding that Kijek reported the alleged violation to OSHA in good faith. There was testimony that Kijek had reported the alleged violation to his supervisor on more than one occasion, and filed the complaint with OSHA because he believed that \u201cthe company just didn\u2019t seem like they were going to do anything.\u201d Furthermore, Kijek had made complaints to OSHA in the past, some of which resulted in remedial action by Osram. While Osram argues that Kijek\u2019s act was simply another complaint filed in the course of an acrimonious employment relationship, we defer to the NHDOL\u2019s conclusion if it is supported by the record. <em>Cf. Appeal of Campaign for Ratepayers Rights, </em>133 N.H. at 483, 577 A.2d at 1232. Whether or not we would have reached a different conclusion, based upon the weight of the evidence, is of no consequence since we will not substitute our judgment for that of the NHDOL. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\"> Osram next argues that no evidence supports a finding that Kijek had reasonable cause to believe that Osram was acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>unlawfully when he filed the OSHA complaint. Whether an employee had \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d is an objective question; namely, whether \u201ca reasonable person might have believed that the employer was acting unlawfully.\u201d <em>Bard v. Bath Iron Works </em>Corp., 590 A.2d 152, 155 (Me. 1991). Osram argues that the NHDOL\u2019s findings were based on \u201cKijek\u2019s personal, subjective beliefs and perceptions, and are insufficient to meet the [Whistleblowers\u2019 Act\u2019s] requirement of objective basis.\u201d While a November 1995 investigation of Osram\u2019s plant failed to find a violation of OSHA\u2019s safety standards, the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act does not require an actual violation, but only that the employee\u2019s belief that the law was violated was objectively reasonable. <em>Cf. Appeal of N.H. Dept. of Employment Security, </em>140 N.H. at 711-12, 672 A.2d at 703. Wb conclude that the record supports a finding that Kijek\u2019s belief that the heat at the plant was dangerously excessive in violation of OSHA standards was objectively reasonable. Specifically, OSHA stated in a letter to Osram that \u201csome conditions were observed which, although not violative of the standards, are considered significant enough to be brought to your attention with the intent of encouraging your efforts to reduce exposure.\u201d Midday temperature readings completed by OSHA ranged from 110 to 174 degrees Fahrenheit in one part of the plant. In a letter to Kijek summarizing OSHA\u2019s contact with Osram, OSHA\u2019s acting director stated that \u201cthe hazards about which you complained are presently being corrected.\u201d Moreover, even Kijek\u2019s supervisor expressed concern about the heat; Osram\u2019s Human Resource Manager testified that after a supervisor had ventured to the second level of the plant, he stated that \u201che didn\u2019t know how this [employee] could work up there\u201d because of the heat.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">\n<em>III. Exhaustion of Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Osram argues that Kijek was not entitled to protection under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act because he failed to pursue the proper grievance procedures, as required by RSA chapter 275-E, after his discharge from the company. RSA 275-E:4, I, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">Any employee who alleges a violation of rights under RSA 275-E:2 or 3, and who has first made a reasonable effort to maintain or restore such employee\u2019s rights through any grievance procedure or similar process available at such employee\u2019s place of employment, may obtain a hearing with the commissioner of labor ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Accordingly, RSA 275-E:4, I, establishes that before a remedy can be pursued under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act, the employee must first attempt, through grievance procedures available at the workplace, to have the employee\u2019s rights restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We will not decide whether Kijek complied with RSA 275-E:4, I, <em>i.e., </em>whether he failed to grieve his discharge from Osram. It is well settled that in an administrative appeal, the appealing party must first file a motion for rehearing \u201cset[ting] forth fully every ground upon which it is claimed that the decision or order complained of is unlawful or unreasonable.\u201d RSA 541:4 (1997). \u201cIssues not raised in the motion for rehearing may not be raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Appeal of Richards, </em>134 N.H. 148, 154, 590 A.2d 586, 590, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 899 (1991). While Osram cited RSA 275-E:4 in its motion for rehearing, it argued only that \u201cKijek never exhausted [Osram\u2019s] procedures regarding his safety concerns\u201d and therefore Kijek was not entitled to relief under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act. <em>See </em>RSA 275-E:2, II. It did not argue, however, that he failed to grieve his discharge, and it accordingly cannot raise that issue on appeal. Furthermore, while the issue of whether Kijek had properly grieved the heat was raised in the motion for rehearing, counsel at oral argument stated that on appeal, Osram was only challenging whether Kijek properly grieved his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">\n<em>IV. Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Finally, Osram contends that the NHDOL erred when it ordered reinstatement of Kijek. RSA 275-E:4, I, provides that the NHDOL has the authority to order an appropriate remedy, including, <em>inter alia, </em>reinstatement. The goal of the remedial provisions of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act is to ensure that employees are \u201cmade whole\u201d and restored to the position they would have been in absent the employer\u2019s unlawful acts. <em>Appeal of Bio Energy, </em>135 N.H. at 521-22, 607 A.2d at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Osram argues that reinstatement is inappropriate given the long documented history of \u201canimosity\u201d between Kijek and Osram, and given Osram\u2019s claim that Kijek filed a fraudulent workers\u2019 compensation claim. <em>See Whittlesey v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>742 F.2d 724, 728 (2d Cir. 1984) (reinstatement may not be appropriate where there has been irreparable damage to employment relationship). In order to properly review issues raised in a chapter 541 appeal, we require the NHDOL to make basic findings of fact so that we may adequately address whether its rulings are reasonable. <em>See Foote v. State Personnel Comm\u2019n, </em>116 N.H. 145, 148, 355 A.2d 412, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>414 (1976). While the NHDOL noted that Kijek\u2019s testimony indicated a \u201cless than smooth\u201d employment history, it made no findings with regard to the appropriateness of reinstatement as a remedy. Although we affirm the NHDOL\u2019s ruling that Osram violated the Whistleblowers\u2019 Act, we vacate that portion of its order reinstating Kijek. We remand this case for specific findings and rulings on the issue of whether the breakdown in employer-employee relations is sufficient to deny Kijek\u2019s request for reinstatement. Furthermore, we direct the NHDOL, on remand, to consider additional evidence of rel\u00e9vant facts which have occurred since the hearing, solely on the issue of reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b658-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
