The defendant argues that the superior court erred: (1) in holding that the plaintiff\u2019s travel trailer was a \u201cconsumer good\u201d under the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>see </em>RSA 382-A:9-109(l) (1994); and (2) in denying the defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the repossession and disposition of the travel trailer and in the collection of the deficiency. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The following facts are undisputed, except as noted. In May 1990, the plaintiff entered into a \u201cRetail Installment Contract and Security Agreement\u201d with the defendant for the purchase of .a 1990 Play-Mor travel trailer. The plaintiff agreed to pay approximately $320 monthly for seven years and granted the defendant a security interest in the travel trailer. According to the contract, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to make a timely payment would constitute an event of default, which would authorize the defendant to repossess and sell the travel trailer. In a separate agreement, the defendant leased a site at its campground to the plaintiff for an annual fee of $1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Beginning with the first installment, the plaintiff failed to make payments for the travel trailer on time. The plaintiff also fell behind in payments on the lease. From October 1990 to March 1992, the defendant sent several letters to the plaintiff concerning his payment failures and its repossession rights. By letter dated July 8, 1992, the defendant notified the plaintiff that it intended to repossess the travel trailer unless it received full payment for the travel trailer and campground site by July 20, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The parties dispute the existence of a side agreement between the plaintiff and an employee of the defendant containing payment terms more favorable to the plaintiff than the defendant\u2019s July 8, 1992, letter. The parties also dispute whether the defendant repossessed the travel trailer prior to July 20, 1992. There is no dispute on appeal, however, that the travel trailer was sold to a third party on September 19, 1992, and that the plaintiff received no prior notice of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">After the defendant repossessed the travel trailer, the plaintiff commenced this replevin action in which he also asserted claims under RSA chapter 358-A (1995 &amp; Supp. 1996). The defendant counterclaimed to recover the deficiency remaining after its sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the travel trailer. After learning of the sale, the plaintiff amended his writ to withdraw the replevin claim and to assert additional claims, including a claim that the defendant violated RSA 382-A:9-504(3) (1994) by failing to provide notice of the sale to the plaintiff. Both parties moved for summary judgment as to the plaintiff\u2019s claim under RSA 382-A:9-504(3) and the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for the deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The superior court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff on his RSA 382-A:9-504(3) claim and awarded the plaintiff statutory damages under RSA 382-A:9-507(l) (1994) and attorney\u2019s fees. The court granted summary judgment to the defendant on its counterclaim for the deficiency, but denied the defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. On appeal, the defendant argues that the superior court erred in holding that the travel trailer was a consumer good and in denying the defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In reviewing the superior court\u2019s summary judgment rulings, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party\u2019s capacity as a non-movant, and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether either moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See N.E. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. City of Franklin, </em>141 N.H. 449, 452, 685 A.2d 913, 916 (1996); RSA 491:8-a, III (1997). \u201cThe interpretation of a statute is to be decided ultimately by this court.\u201d <em>Petition of Walker, </em>138 N.H. 471, 474, 641 A.2d 1021, 1024 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\n<em>I. Travel Trailer as a Consumer Good</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The defendant argued below that its repossession and sale of the plaintiff\u2019s travel trailer was not governed by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code because the travel trailer was a motor vehicle governed solely by RSA chapter 361-A (1995 &amp; Supp. 1996) (concerning retail installment sales of motor vehicles) and RSA 261:23-:29 (1993 &amp; Supp. 1996) (governing security interests in vehicles). The defendant also argued that the plaintiff was not entitled to the specific damages provided by RSA 382-A:9-507(l) for consumer goods because the travel trailer was not a consumer good. The superior court assumed without deciding that the travel trailer was a motor vehicle, but rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the motor vehicle statutes rendered the default, repossession, and disposition provisions of Article 9 inapplicable, <em>see </em>RSA 382-A:9-501 <em>et seq. </em>(1994). The superior court further concluded that the travel trailer was a consumer good because the plaintiff used it for personal purposes. <em>See </em>RSA 382-A:9-109(l). Ruling that the defendant failed to provide the notice required by RSA 382-A:9-504(3), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the court awarded the plaintiff the specific damages applicable to consumer goods under RSA 382-A:9-507(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Relying on <em>Laro v. Leisure Acres Mobile Home Park Associates, </em>139 N.H. 545, 548, 659 A.2d 432, 435 (1995), the defendant now \u00e1rgues that the travel trailer was not a consumer good because it \u201cfunctioned essentially as real estate,\u201d not personal property. Assuming without deciding that the defendant\u2019s general challenge below to the travel trailer\u2019s status as a consumer good is sufficient to preserve this new legal theory, <em>cf. Riverwood Commercial Prop\u2019s v. Cole, </em>134 N.H. 487, 490, 593 A.2d 1153, 1155-56 (1991), we conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Laro </em>is misplaced. In <em>Laro, </em>the mobile home at issue was manufactured housing, <em>see Laro, </em>139 N.H. at 546, 659 A.2d at 433, which by statute was treated as real estate, <em>see </em>RSA 477:44 (1992 &amp; Supp. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In this case, the defendant cites no persuasive legal authority to support its contention that a travel trailer is akin to real estate, Both the factual record and decisions from other jurisdictions support the superior court\u2019s conclusion' that the travel trailer was a consumer good. The plaintiff submitted an affidavit stating that \u201c[a]t all times the Travel Trailer was used for personal, family and household purposes.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 382-A:9-109(l). We hol'd that the superior court properly focused on the travel trailer\u2019s use by the plaintiff, <em>see id., </em>and correctly characterized the travel trailer as a consumer good. <em>See In re Elie, </em>11 B.R. 24, 25 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1981) (collecting cases and holding \u201ctent trailer\u201d to be consumer good); <em>cf. In re </em>ASW <em>III Builder-Contractor, Inc., </em>12 B.R. 29, 31-32 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981) (\u201ctravel trailer\u201d could not be characterized as consumer good in the absence of evidence that it was used for personal, family or household purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\n<em>II. Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Although the superior court granted summary judgment to the defendant on its counterclaim for the deficiency, the court, relying on RSA 361-C:2, II (1995), denied the defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. RSA 361-C:2, II states that a retail installment contract that provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees to a retail seller or creditor in an action against a retail buyer or debtor must also provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">[i]f a buyer, borrower or debtor successfully asserts a partial defense or set-off, recoupment or counterclaim to an action brought by the retail seller, lender or creditor, the court may withhold from the retail seller, lender or creditor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the entire amount or such portion of the attorney fees as the court considers equitable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The parties\u2019 retail installment contract, which provided for the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant, contained language in accordance with RSA 361-C:2, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Confining its arguments to the superior court\u2019s authority to withhold attorney\u2019s fees, the defendant asserts that the court lacked discretion to withhold attorney\u2019s fees under RSA 361-C:2, II and that the parties\u2019 contract and RSA 382-A:9-504(l)(a) (1994) required an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The defendant first contends that the court\u2019s reliance on RSA 361-C:2, II was error because the present action was initiated by the retail buyer (the plaintiff and counterclaim defendant), not by the retail seller (the defendant and counterclaim plaintiff). The defendant therefore argues that the present action was <em>not </em>\u201can action brought by the retail seller\u201d within the meaning of the statutory provision. We disagree. The defendant\u2019s counterclaim for the deficiency is properly viewed as an \u201caction\u201d brought by the defendant, <em>cf. Zurback Steel Corp. v. Edgcomb, </em>120 N.H. 42, 45, 411 A.2d 153, 155 (1980) (for purposes of statutes of limitations, \u201caction\u201d includes recoupment and similar cross-demands, such as counterclaim), and the plaintiff\u2019s claim under RSA 382-A:9-504(3) essentially served as \u201ca partial defense or set-off, recoupment or counterclaim,\u201d RSA 361-C:2, II, to the defendant\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s argument that it was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the parties\u2019 contract. As discussed above, the parties\u2019 contract not only authorized an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant, but also incorporated the language required by RSA 361-C:2, II. Thus, the contract conferred discretion on the superior court to withhold attorney\u2019s fees from the defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The defendant next contends that it was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to RSA 382-A:9-504(l)(a), which provides that the proceeds from the secured party\u2019s disposition of the debtor\u2019s collateral \u201cshall be applied\u201d first to \u201cthe reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling and the like and, to the extent provided for in the agreement and not prohibited by law, the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and legal expenses incurred by the secured party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliance on RSA 382-A:9-504(l)(a) is misplaced. First, the defendant\u2019s general request in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>deficiency action for attorney\u2019s fees \u201cincurred in collecting its deficiency as well as the costs and fees incurred in the disposition of the property\u201d fails to recognize the scope of RSA 382-A:9-504(l)(a). That provision addresses attorney\u2019s fees incurred prior to, and in connection with, the disposition of the collateral, not in the collection of the deficiency. Second, the provision only permits attorney\u2019s fees \u201cto the extent provided for in the [parties\u2019] agreement and not prohibited by law.\u201d Since the parties\u2019 contract complied with RSA 361-C:2, II by providing the superior court with equitable discretion to withhold attorney\u2019s fees from the defendant, the court\u2019s exercise of that discretion did not contravene RSA 382-A:9-504(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b342-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
