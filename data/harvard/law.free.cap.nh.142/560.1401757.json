The plaintiffs, Tracey and Gregory Deyette, had petitioned the trial court to determine the extent of underinsured motorist benefits available to the injured insured, Tracey Deyette. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in prohibiting it from reducing benefit payments to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>plaintiffs by the amount they received from the tortfeasor motorist and requiring it to pay attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The trial court found the following facts. Matthew MaCarty (tortfeasor) caused an automobile accident that injured Tracey Deyette. A panel of arbitrators determined that Tracey Deyette suffered bodily injury damages in the amount of $125,000 and Gregory Deyette suffered loss of consortium damages in the amount of $5,000. The tortfeasor\u2019s insurer paid $25,000, the maximum amount under his policy. The plaintiffs submitted a claim to the defendant for the remaining damages. Tracey Deyette\u2019s policy with the defendant provides underinsured motorist coverage in the amount of $100,000 per person with a $300,000 limit for each accident. The defendant paid Tracey Deyette $75,000, the difference between the $100,000 policy limit and the amount paid by the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The plaintiffs filed a petition for declaratory judgment alleging that the defendant is prohibited from reducing its payment by the amount paid by the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer and that the plaintiffs are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The trial court ruled that the defendant may not reduce the benefit payment by the amount the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer paid in this case and, pursuant to RSA 491:22-b (1997), awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred pursuing Tracey Deyette\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> The defendant argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the policy provision limiting the defendant\u2019s liability contravenes RSA 264:15 (1993), and in ruling that an insurer is liable for the difference between the amount of the insured\u2019s damages or the uninsured motorist coverage, whichever is greater, and the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage. We look first at the policy language, which we interpret as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mitchell, </em>138 N.H. 229, 231, 637 A.2d 903, 904 (1994). \u201c[W]e take the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context, and we construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Brouillard v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>141 N.H. 710, 712, 693 A.2d 63, 66 (1997) (quotation omitted). We will enforce a policy provision that limits the insurance company\u2019s liability when the policy language is clear and unambiguous. <em>See id. </em>at 717, 693 A.2d at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The policy included the following limiting clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">With respect to damages caused by an accident with an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d . . . [t]he limit of liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>shall be reduced by all sums paid because of the \u201cbodily injury\u201d by or on behalf of persons or organizations who may be legally responsible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Underinsured motorist insurance coverage typically includes this language. <em>See </em>3 A. WlDISS, UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED MOTORIST INSURANCE \u00a7 41.7, at 287 (2d ed. Supp. 1997). We conclude that the policy language clearly and unambiguously allows the defendant to limit its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">We next consider whether this language is inconsistent with RSA 264:15. \u201cThis court. . . is the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Brouillard, </em>141 N.H. at 714, 693 A.2d at 67 (quotation omitted). The statute requires insurers to provide uninsured motorist coverage equal to the liability coverage elected by the insured. RSA 264:15,1. The purpose of RSA 264:15 is to \u201cprotect [policy holders] against losses caused by irresponsible automobile drivers with insufficient insurance coverage to pay for the [insured\u2019s] injuries.\u201d <em>U.S. Automobile Assoc. v. Wilkinson, </em>132 N.H. 439, 443, 569 A.2d 749, 751 (1989). An insured can \u201creasonably expect[] to be protected against <em>uninsured motorists </em>up to the amount for which he paid.\u201d <em>Vigneault v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>118 N.H. 75, 80, 382 A.2d 910, 914 (1978) (emphasis added). Insurers paying underinsured motorist claims may offset any payment by amounts recovered from \u201cany person or organization legally responsible for the bodily injury for which such payment is made.\u201d RSA 264:15, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court erroneously applied a line of cases involving multiple tortfeasors and the rights of underinsured motorist carriers to offset benefits payable to the insureds by the amounts paid by joint tortfeasors other than the underinsured motorist tortfeasors. These cases, beginning with <em>Raitt v. National Grange Mutual Insurance Co., </em>111 N.H. 397, 285 A.2d 799 (1971), prohibit an insurer from setting off an insured\u2019s compensation by any amount paid by joint tortfeasors, other than an uninsured motorist tortfeasor, unless the compensation would exceed the insured\u2019s actual damages. <em>See, e.g., Bonte v. American Global Ins. Co., </em>136 N.H. 528, 532, 618 A.2d 825, 827 (1992). These cases interpreted RSA 264:15 as granting \u201ccarriers of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage a right of \u2018subrogation\u2019 only as to amounts recovered from the <em>uninsured motorist.\u201d Id. </em>at 531, 618 A.2d at 825 (quotation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In cases involving only a single underinsured motorist tortfeasor, we have held that an insurer is liable on its uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>motorist policy for the \u201cdifference between the amount of [the insured\u2019s] damages or the coverage, whichever is the lesser, and the tort-feasor\u2019s liability coverage.\u201d <em>Vigneault, </em>118 N.H. at 79, 382 A.2d at 913. Recovery by an insured from an underinsured motorist tortfeasor triggers an insurer\u2019s right to reduce payment under uninsured motorist coverage, even though the injured insured has not been fully compensated. <em>Cf. Bonte, </em>136 N.H. at 532, 618 A.2d at 827 (insurer\u2019s subrogation rights against non-motorist tortfeasors triggered only after insured receives full compensation).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The plaintiffs purchased uninsured motorist coverage from the defendant with a limit of $100,000 per person. The plaintiffs essentially guaranteed that any other driver who collided with them would have minimum coverage of $100,000, and the plaintiffs should reasonably expect to recover only up to that amount for any claim against an uninsured or underinsured motorist. <em>See </em>WIDISS, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 41.7, at 297. Accordingly, we hold that the defendant is entitled to reduce its $100,000 payment to the plaintiff by $25,000, the amount the tortfeasor motorist paid to the plaintiff. The trial court erred in ruling otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We also reverse the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs because the plaintiffs have not prevailed on their petition for declaratory judgment. <em>See </em>RSA 491:22-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b601-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
