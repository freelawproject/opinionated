(Thomas) to terminate the parental rights of Jennifer A. (Jennifer) over their son, William A. (William). Jennifer appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">William was born in Manchester in the early summer of 1991. That fall, his mother, Jennifer, placed him in the care of family friends who lived nearby so she could finish high school. In May 1992, just before graduation, Jennifer, who was then living in Kittery, Maine, resumed custody of her son. In November 1992, she and William moved to Georgia with her mother and stepfather, who were raising their own child, who was just six weeks younger than William.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">In February 1993, William\u2019s paternal grandfather flew to Georgia to pick him up for a visit in New Hampshire. While William was visiting his grandparents, Jennifer returned to the seacoast area to find an apartment for herself and her son. After a few days, she retrieved William from his grandparents and left him in the care of a friend for the weekend, while she continued to search for a place to live. William\u2019s grandfather, however, took him from the friend while Jennifer was away. When Jennifer later sought William\u2019s return, his grandparents confronted her, and she reluctantly relinquished her son to their care.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In April 1993, the superior court awarded legal custody of William to Thomas, his natural father, and ordered Jennifer to pay child support. Although she failed to pay the amount required by .court order, she periodically sent money to Thomas and gifts to William. She also attempted to communicate with William by letter and visits. Jennifer later gave birth to a second child, with whom William has had contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In August 1994, Thomas petitioned the probate court to terminate Jennifer\u2019s parental rights to William on the grounds of abandonment and nonsupport. <em>See </em>RSA 170-C:4, I, :5, I, II (1994). At the hearing, Thomas\u2019 wife, Lyne, testified that she favored termination so that she could adopt William; however, she expressed a willingness to permit visitation between William and Jennifer and testified that she believed that the child had a right to know about his mother. Thomas indicated that he, too, would be willing to allow Jennifer continued visitation with William, provided that the visits occurred at his home. William\u2019s guardian ad litem (GAL) recommended that Jennifer\u2019s parental rights not be terminated and testified that Jennifer conditionally agreed to Lyne\u2019s appointment as William\u2019s guardian. The probate court found that Jennifer had abandoned William and failed to support him. <em>See </em>RSA 170-C':5, I, II. It also determined that it was in William\u2019s best interests to terminate her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\u201cWe will not disturb the probate court\u2019s decree unless it is unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>In re Angel N., </em>141 N.H. 158, 161, 679 A.2d 1136, 1138 (1996); <em>see </em>RSA 567-A:4 (1997). On appeal, Jennifer argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the court\u2019s ruling that William\u2019s best interests were served by termination of her parental rights. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Our legislature has declared that \u201cwhenever possible family life should be strengthened and preserved.\u201d RSA 170-C:1 (1994); <em>see State v. Robert H., </em>118 N.H. 713, 715, 393 A.2d 1387, 1389 (1978) (holding that \u201cfamily and the rights of parents over it\u201d are fundamental and within N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 2). We place \u00e1 greater emphasis than do many other States on preserving family relationships. <em>Compare Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 769 (1982) (holding under New York law that clear-and-convincing evidence standard is necessary to terminate parental rights) <em>with In re Taryn D., </em>141 N.H. 376, 378, 684 A.2d 63, 64 (1996) (requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt to terminate parental rights). To terminate the relationship between parent and child, a petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>must not only prove a statutory ground for termination beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>see In re Jessie E., </em>137 N.H. 336, 339, 627 A.2d 591, 593 (1993); RSA 170-C:5 (1994), but also that termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child. <em>In re Matthew G., </em>124 N.H. 414, 416, 469 A.2d 1365, 1366-67 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In this case, the probate court erred in concluding that termination of Jennifer\u2019s parental rights was in William\u2019s best interests. In reaching its conclusion, the probate court observed that Jennifer \u201cwas continuously giving the child to other persons for long periods of time to care for, which resulted in the child being constantly shuffled from home to home.\u201d The probate court concluded that William, who apparently had grown to recognize Lyne as his mother, should remain with his father and stepmother with \u201cno possibility of returning to the lifestyle he experienced\u201d while in Jennifer\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Although keeping William in a stable environment is certainly consistent with his best interests, <em>see In re Diana P., </em>120 N.H. 791, 797, 424 A.2d 178, 181 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 964 (1981), there is no evidence to suggest that this could not be accomplished without terminating Jennifer\u2019s parental rights. Legal custody of William had been awarded to Thomas, who also enjoyed physical custody of his son. Unlike situations where failure to terminate parental rights would leave a child adrift in the foster care system, William was to remain at home with his father and stepmother, absent further court order. <em>Cf. In re Lisa H., </em>134 N.H. 188, 193, 589 A.2d 1004, 1007 (1991) (reasoning best interests favored termination where foster parents sought adoption and child had lived with them for two years and progressed during that time). Accordingly, termination of Jennifer\u2019s parental rights was not necessary to ensure William\u2019s stable and secure environment. <em>Cf. Robert H., </em>118 N.H. at 718, 393 A.2d at 1391 (imperfect parenting, particularly when caused by poverty, is insufficient basis for termination).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The record does not reflect any effort by Jennifer to reacquire legal or physical custody of her son. She merely wanted the right to visit him. The GAL testified that such visitation was consistent with William\u2019s best interests, and the stepmother supported this view. <em>Cf. In re Angel N., </em>141 N.H. at 163, 679 A.2d at 1139 (only mother\u2019s therapist testified that mother and child reunion was a reasonable possibility). Furthermore, the evidence suggests that Jennifer had enhanced her ability to have a positive and supportive relationship with William. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 164, 679 A.2d at 1140 (termination in best interests where foster parents, who intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>adopt child, had ability to meet child\u2019s special needs); <em>In re Sabrina C., </em>137 N.H. 445, 448, 629 A.2d 782, 784 (1993) (lack of evidence of parent\u2019s willingness to provide for child\u2019s emotional and physical well-being supported termination). At the time the termination hearing commenced, in October 1995, Jennifer was enrolled in a parenting class and furthering her education in other areas. She was also raising William\u2019s half-brother, which, according to the GAL, would improve her parenting skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\">The GAL acknowledged that despite William\u2019s recognition of Lyne as his mother, the loss of contact with his natural mother could, in the long term, cause greater harm to the child than temporary confusion over maternal identity. <em>Cf. In re Lisa H., </em>134 N.H. at 193, 589 A.2d at 1007 (child\u2019s identification of foster parents as \u201cmom\u201d and \u201cdad\u201d considered in conjunction with other factors). Moreover, William\u2019s relationship with his stepmother was not at risk if Jennifer\u2019s parental rights were not terminated. In fact, Jennifer consented to Lyne\u2019s appointment as William\u2019s legal guardian. <em>See generally </em>RSA 463:5 (Supp. 1997); <em>In re Jessie E., </em>137 N.H. at 340, 627 A.2d at 593 (granting of guardianship to person other than parent does not terminate parental rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">It cannot be disputed that termination of a parent\u2019s legal bond to a child is a solemn and irreversible event. While termination is sometimes required to protect a child\u2019s best interests, this is not such a case. Consequently, the probate court\u2019s finding that termination was necessary is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b640-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
