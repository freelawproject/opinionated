Following receipt of your resolution on April 29, 1997, we invited interested parties to file memoranda with the court on or before May 27, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">SB 73-FN as amended (the bill) proposes to amend RSA chapter 72 (1991 &amp; Supp. 1996) by inserting after section 8 the following new section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>72:8-a Telecommunications Poles and Wires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">I. Poles and wires that are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">(a) Owned by a person operating as a public utility as defined in RSA 362:2; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">(b) Are employed in the transmission of telephone or cable television service shall be taxed as real estate in the town in which such property or any part of it is situated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">II. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any whole or partial interest in poles and wires employed in the transmission of communications services that are subject to the tax imposed under RSA 82-A, and owned by a retailer as that term is defined in RSA 82-A:2, X, shall be exempt from taxation as real estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In addition, the bill proposes to amend RSA 72:9 (1991) to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">72:9 Where Taxable. If the property described in RSA 72:8 or 72:8-a shall be situated in or extend into more than one town, the property shall be taxed in each town according to the value of that part lying within its limits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">The bill also proposes to amend RSA 72:10 (1991) to read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">72:10 Limitation. Nothing in RSA 72:8, 72:8-a, or 72:9 shall in any way change or affect the laws relating to the taxation of public utilities and other property owned by municipal corporations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">The bill would allow towns to tax poles and wires \u201cemployed in the transmission of telephone or cable television service\u201d as real estate, so long as persons operating as a public utility, <em>see </em>RSA 362:2 (1995), owned such poles and wires. The bill would exempt from such taxation \u201cany whole or partial interest in poles and wires employed in the transmission of communications services that are subject to the tax imposed under RSA 82-A, and owned by a retailer as that term is defined in RSA 82-A:2, X.\u201d RSA chapter 82-A generally taxes intrastate and interstate \u201ccommunications services furnished to a person in this state and purchased at retail from a retailer by such person.\u201d RSA 82-A:3, :4 (1991). The term \u201c[r]etailer\u201d refers to \u201cevery person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this chapter,\u201d RSA 82-A:2, X (1991), and \u201c[s]ale at retail\u201d is defined as \u201cthe transmitting, supplying or furnishing of communications services and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith for a consideration\u201d to private persons, RSA 82-A:2, XII (1991) (identifying public entities to which definition does not apply). RSA chapter 82-A requires retailers to collect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>communications services tax by adding it to their gross charge for communications services. <em>See </em>RSA 82-A:6 (1991). Under the bill\u2019s exemption, retailers responsible for the communications services tax would escape the real estate tax on telecommunications poles and wires.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Your first question asks whether enactment of the bill would \u201c[rjesult in a violation of the \u2018proportional and reasonable\u2019 requirements of article 5, part II of the New Hampshire constitution.\u201d Your second question asks whether enactment of the bill would \u201c[c]reate an impermissible classification of property in violation of article 6, part II of the New Hampshire constitution.\u201d In the interest of clarity, we address your questions in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Under part II, article 6 of the State Constitution, the legislature has broad discretion to classify property for taxation purposes. <em>See Smith v. Dep\u2019t of Rev. Admin., </em>141 N.H. 681, 686, 692 A.2d 486, 491 (1997). \u201cA reasonable classification which is sufficiently inclusive to constitute a distinctive class will be upheld.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>114 N.H. 174, 177, 317 A.2d 568, 570 (1974). We limit our review of legislative taxation classifications to the question whether there exist \u201cjust reasons\u201d for the classification. <em>Smith, </em>141 N.H. at 687, 692 A.2d at 491; <em>see Opinion of the Justices (Current Use Reimbursement Program), </em>137 N.H. 270, 275, 627 A.2d 92, 95 (1993). \u201cA just reason is the equivalent of a reasonable or rational basis.\u201d <em>Cagan\u2019s, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Rev. Admin., </em>126 N.H. 239, 246, 490 A.2d 1354, 1359 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Two of our prior decisions provide some illustration of these principles. In an advisory opinion, we concluded that refined petroleum products constitute a legitimate class of taxable property because \u201c[t]he method of their manufacture is distinctive and the end products are markedly different from all other kinds of fuel and energy,\u201d thus making the incidence of a tax upon these products dependent \u201cupon a characteristic event not common to other property.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>114 N.H. at 178, 317 A.2d at 570. In <em>Cagan\u2019s, Inc., </em>on the other hand, we invalidated a statutory scheme which failed to identify a distinct class of property. The statutory scheme classified, as a taxable entity, prepackaged food \u201cserved\u201d from a vending machine, but not the same food \u201cserved\u201d from a supermarket shelf. <em>See Cagan\u2019s Inc., </em>126 N.H. at 246, 490 A.2d at 1359. Finding \u201cno difference in service sufficient to distinguish between the sales,\u201d we concluded that the taxation classification lacked a rational basis. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 490 A.2d at 1359-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number> As these decisions demonstrate, the constitutionality of a taxation classification depends upon the physical and functional characteristics of the property itself. From the memoranda filed in regard to your questions, it appears there- is significant dispute about the distinctiveness of telecommunications poles and wires. We cannot resolve such factual issues in rendering advisory opinions on legal questions. <em>Cf. Opinion of the Justices, </em>123 N.H. 510, 511, 463 A.2d 891, 892 (1983); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>116 N.H. 358, 360, 360 A.2d 889, 891 (1976). Further, neither the resolution requesting our advice nor the bill itself provides factual information from which we might question the bill\u2019s classification. We therefore confine our analysis to the <em>facial </em>validity of the bill\u2019s classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The legislature has the power to make any kind of property realty for purposes of taxation, <em>see King Ridge, Inc. v. Sutton, </em>115 N.H. 294, 299, 340 A.2d 106, 110 (1975), and it may validly subject to taxation \u201ccertain instruments of production or machines which by their nature are designed for use in connection with real estate whether or not they are part of or attached to the realty,\u201d <em>Public Serv. Co. of N.H. v. Town of Seabrook, </em>126 N.H. 740, 745, 496 A.2d 352, 356 (1985) (quotation omitted). Although we have no factual information before us, it appears reasonable to assume, <em>see Opinion of the Justices, </em>115 N.H. 228, 231, 338 A.2d 553, 555 (1975), that telecommunications poles and wires are used in connection with the provision of telecommunications services and, therefore, share a connection to the provider\u2019s physical plant, <em>see Application of New York Telephone Co., </em>13 N.Y.S.2d 359, 362 (App. Div. 1939), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>26 N.E.2d 805 (N.Y. 1940), which itself is taxable as real estate, <em>see </em>RSA 72:7 (1991). The use of poles and wires as elements in a telecommunications network appears to make this property distinctive. Consequently, we cannot say the bill\u2019s classification of such poles and wires as taxable property is impermissible on its face, and we answer your second question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Proceeding from our opinion that the classification of telecommunications poles and wires as taxable real property appears reasonable on its face, we address your first question. Part II, article 5 provides the legislature the authority \u201cto impose and levy proportional and reasonable assessments, rates, and taxes, upon all the inhabitants of, and residents within, the . . . state.\u201d This provision \u201crequires that all taxes be proportionate and reasonable, equal in valuation and uniform in rate, and just.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>141 N.H. at 686, 692 A.2d at 490-91 (quotation and brackets omitted); <em>see Opinion of the Justices, </em>117 N.H. 749, 755, 379 A.2d 782, 786 (1977). \u201cTogether, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>part II, articles 5 and 6 permit the disproportionality inherent in taxes levied upon classes of property, so long as there is uniformity and proportionality within each class.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>141 N.H. at 686, 692 A.2d at 491 (quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The proposed tax on telecommunications poles and wires appears facially valid under part II, article 5. In acting for the public welfare, the legislature may seek \u201cto provide local government units with broad power to tax real property within their boundaries.\u201d <em>King Ridge, Inc., </em>115 N.H. at 299, 340 A.2d at 110. Allowing towns to tax telecommunications poles and wires would relate to the goal of increasing revenues through the assessment of the local instrumentalities and equipment essential to the provision of telecommunications services. <em>See Public Serv. Co. of N.H., </em>126 N.H. at 745, 496 A.2d at 356. The proposed tax, moreover, would apply \u00faniformly to all similarly-situated owners of telecommunications poles and wires \u2014 that is, all owners of telecommunications poles and wires who are not also retailers of communications services under RSA chapter 82-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The question remains as to the constitutional validity of the exemption from the proposed tax for those owners of telecommunications poles and wires who qualify as retailers under RSA chapter 82-A. The legislature\u2019s power \u201cto classify property into taxable and non-taxable groups includes power to grant reasonable exemptions from taxation.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, 87 </em>N.H. 490, 491, 178 A. 125, 126 (1935); <em>see Smith, </em>141 N.H. at 687, 692 A.2d at 491. An exemption is proper \u201cso long as the legislature relies on a distinction between the taxable and nontaxable property that is a reasonable one, in the sense that it may be deemed to be just.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>141 N.H. at 687, 692 A.2d at 492 (quotation omitted); <em>see Opinion of the Justices, </em>112 N.H. 32, 34, 287 A.2d 756, 757 (1972). The wisdom of particular taxation measures is for the legislature and not the courts to determine. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>115 N.H. at 232, 338 A.2d at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">As discussed above, we have no factual information before us. Looking only to the provisions of the bill itself, we conclude the distinction drawn by the exemption to the proposed tax appears just. Owners of telecommunications poles and wires who are also communications services retailers are responsible for the statewide charge related to communications provision \u2014 the communications services tax established by RSA chapter 82-A. <em>See </em>RSA 82-A:6. While furthering its goal of increasing town revenues, the legislature in its discretion could determine that those owners of telecom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>munications poles and wires who are responsible for the communications services charge should be distinguished from those owners who are not; the legislature could reasonably view the two groups of owners as being differently situated. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>115 N.H. at 231, 338 A.2d at 555-56 (increased tax exemptions for resident owners of advanced age supported by reason of their diminished earning potential). This appears a just reason for any resulting discrimination against unexempted property. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>114 N.H. at 178, 317 A.2d at 570-71; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>87 N.H. at 491, 178 A. at 126. On its face, then, the exemption appears valid, and we answer your first question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We note that our responses to your questions are necessarily qualified, as \u201cwe cannot anticipate every possible fact pattern that may arise and test the limits of the bill.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices (Certain Evidence in Sexual Assault Cases), </em>140 N.H. 22, 27, 662 A.2d 294, 297 (1995). Indeed, a lack of information renders impracticable consideration of \u201call the provisions of the bill in every detail to ascertain whether they may be objectionable.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>137 N.H. at 279, 627 A.2d at 97 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">DAVID A.
