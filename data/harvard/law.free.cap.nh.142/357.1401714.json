On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in: (1) denying his motions to dismiss and for a directed verdict based on insufficient evidence for two of the charges; (2) excluding from trial certain testimony from a proposed defense witness; and (3) denying his pretrial request for <em>in camera </em>review of records of the New Hampshire Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The following facts were adduced at trial. On October 14, 1994, the defendant\u2019s niece, Brandy, and her friend, Sarah, spent the night at the defendant\u2019s house in Seabrook. Both girls were eight years old at the time. After dinner, the girls took a bath, then went into the defendant\u2019s bedroom and got into his bed. Brandy testified that the girls wore no clothing to bed. Sometime later, the defendant, who was also naked, entered the room and got onto the bed with the girls. Brandy testified that the defendant then assaulted her, making her touch his \u201cprivates\u201d with her hands in an \u201cup and down\u201d motion, putting his \u201cprivates\u201d in her mouth, and touching her \u201cprivates\u201d with both his hands and his \u201cprivates.\u201d Although Sarah testified at trial, she was not forthcoming about the events which allegedly took place after dinner, and thus did not corroborate Brandy\u2019s account of the charged assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The day after the incident, Sarah spoke with her mother. Although the details of the discussion were not elicited at trial, Sarah\u2019s mother testified that the conversation prompted her to contact the Seabrook police, who subsequently commenced an investigation of the defendant regarding allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct. These allegations became the basis for the indictments brought against the defendant. The defendant testified at trial and denied committing the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\n<em>I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The defendant argues that the State presented insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions on two of the indictments, 94-S-1999 and 94-S-2000, which alleged that the defendant touched the victim\u2019s vagina with his hand and with his penis, respectively. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>asserts that the victim\u2019s use of the term \u201cprivates\u201d to describe where the defendant allegedly touched her was not sufficiently specific to establish that the defendant touched her vagina as charged. As such, the defendant contends that the jury could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed those charged offenses. <em>See State v. Tarantino, </em>140 N.H. 523, 525, 668 A.2d 45, 47 (1995) (State must prove each element of offense beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we view the evidence presented at trial, and all reasonable inferences drawn-therefrom, in the light most favorable to the State, <em>State v. Chamberlain, </em>137 N.H. 414, 416, 628 A.2d 704, 706 (1993), and uphold the jury\u2019s verdict unless no rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Bissonnette, </em>138 N.H. 82, 84, 635 A.2d 468, 469 (1993). Where, as here, \u201cthe victim\u2019s testimony suffices to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, no corroborating evidence is needed.\u201d <em>State v. O\u2019Neill, </em>134 N.H. 182, 185, 589 A.2d 999, 1002 (1991). Because this case does not rely solely upon circumstantial evidence, the evidence need not \u201cexclude all rational conclusions except guilt.\u201d <em>Cf. State v. Laudarowicz, </em>142 N.H. 1, 5, 694 A.2d 980, 983 (1997). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the evidence was insufficient to prove guilt. <em>State v. Smith, </em>127 N.H. 433, 436, 503 A.2d 774, 776 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We conclude that based on the victim\u2019s testimony, a rational finder of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant touched the victim\u2019s vagina. <em>See Bissonnette, </em>138 N.H. at 84, 635 A.2d at 469. The meaning of the term \u201cprivates,\u201d as used by the victim at trial, was clarified through additional testimony and demonstrative evidence elicited by the State. First, during questioning concerning a separate charged assault, the victim used the term \u201cprivates\u201d to describe the part of the defendant\u2019s body that she touched. To clarify the term, the prosecutor elicited from the victim that the defendant\u2019s \u201cprivates\u201d turned hard when she moved her hand up and down, and that \u201cwhitish\u201d \u201cstuff\u201d came out of it. From this exchange, a rational jury could infer that the victim was referring to the defendant\u2019s genitalia when she said \u201chis privates,\u201d and the victim\u2019s subsequent testimony that the defendant touched <em>her </em>\u201cprivates\u201d could reasonably be construed as referring to her own genitalia, namely, her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The State\u2019s use of a stuffed bunny as a demonstrative aid further supports the inference that the victim used \u201cprivates\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>mean her vagina. <em>Cf. O\u2019Neill, </em>134 N.H. at 186, 589 A.2d at 1002 (no demonstrative aid used to clarify child victim\u2019s testimony). The trial transcript reflects the court\u2019s observation that when asked to show where on the bunny were the \u201cprivates,\u201d the victim pointed to the area between the bunny\u2019s legs; she also touched the bunny\u2019s hand to indicate that the defendant had used his hand to touch her \u201cprivates.\u201d Based on this demonstration, the jury could fairly infer that the victim used the term \u201cprivates\u201d to refer to her genitalia, <em>cf. State v. Devaney, </em>139 N.H. 473, 475, 657 A.2d 832, 834 (1995), and not to another body part such as her leg or buttocks. Finally, we note that the use of \u201cprivates\u201d to connote genitals accords with the common meaning of the word. <em>See </em>WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1805 (unabridged ed. 1961) (defining \u201cprivates\u201d as \u201cgenitalia\u201d); <em>cf. O\u2019Neill, </em>134 N.H. at 187, 589 A.2d at 1003 (prosecutor failed to show that \u201cbum\u201d meant something other than dictionary definition).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that our decisions in <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>134 N.H. 182, 589 A.2d 999, and <em>State v. Fennell, </em>133 N.H. 402, 578 A.2d 329 (1990), control our analysis. In the instant case, the jury was not asked to infer the commission of the charged act from circumstantial evidence of the conduct surrounding the alleged act. <em>Cf. O\u2019Neill, </em>134 N.H. at 186, 589 A.2d at 1002-03. Rather, the jury was asked to find beyond a reasonable doubt, based on the victim\u2019s <em>direct </em>testimony, that she was referring to her vagina when she referred to her \u201cprivates.\u201d Viewing the victim\u2019s testimony and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the State, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant unlawfully touched the victim\u2019s vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\n<em>II. Exclusion of Witness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The defendant next appeals the trial court\u2019s exclusion of testimony from a proposed defense witness. The witness, who allegedly observed the defendant\u2019s genitals three to four days after the charged assaults occurred, would have testified that she observed \u201ccold-sore like blisters on [the defendant\u2019s] penis, some of which were crusted over,\u201d and that his penis \u201clooked very red and swollen and painful.\u201d The State moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony on two grounds: that the witness was not qualified to diagnose any lesions she may have observed, and that her testimony was irrelevant since the assaults occurred prior to the alleged observation. The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion, ruling that a description <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>of the condition of the defendant\u2019s genitals several days after the assaults was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The determination of the relevance of evidence is a matter for the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, and we will not overturn such a determination absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Walsh, </em>139 N.H. 435, 436, 655 A.2d 912, 913 (1995). To show an abuse of discretion, the defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling \u201cwas clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>State v. Hokanson, </em>140 N.H. 719, 721, 672 A.2d 714, 715 (1996). Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401. Evidence that is not relevant is inadmissible. N.H. R. EV. 402. , .</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The defendant argues that the testimony was relevant because it would have corroborated his testimony that he had an active herpes outbreak at the time of the assaults. This evidence tended to establish that the defendant could not have engaged in the charged acts, either because sexual contact involving his penis during an outbreak would have been extremely painful or because the victim would have contracted the herpes virus from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Based on the defendant\u2019s offer of proof, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant failed to establish a medical nexus between the proposed testimony and his own which would support a ruling that the testimony was relevant. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>135 N.H. 524, 527, 607 A.2d 611, 613 (1992). Specifically, the defendant\u2019s medical expert failed to provide any testimony connecting the lay witness\u2019s observations to the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding the condition of his penis on the day of the charged assault. Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the witness\u2019s testimony. <em>See Walsh, </em>139 N.H. at 436, 655 A.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\n<em>III. In Camera Revieio</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Finally, the defendant appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion for <em>in camera </em>review of DCYF records pertaining to the victim. <em>See State v. Gagne, </em>136 N.H. 101, 612 A.2d 899 (1992). \u201c[I]n order to trigger an <em>in camera </em>review of confidential or privileged records, the defendant must establish a reasonable probability that the records contain information that is material and relevant to his defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 612 A.2d at 901; <em>see State v. Locke, </em>139 N.H. 741, 744, 663 A.2d 602, 604 (1995). The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>argues that the trial court misapplied this standard in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The threshold showing necessary to trigger an <em>in camera </em>review is not unduly high. The defendant must meaningfully articulate how the information sought is relevant and material to his defense. To do so, he must present a plausible theory of relevance and materiality sufficient to justify review of the protected documents, <em>cf. Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 58 n.15 (1987), but he is not required to prove that his theory is true. \u201cAt a minimum, a defendant must present some specific concern, based on more than bare conjecture, that, in reasonable probability, will be explained by\u201d the information sought. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>139 N.H. 96, 99, 649 A.2d 375, 376 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">To trigger review, the defendant need not articulate the \u201cprecise nature\u201d of the purported contents of the records. <em>Gagne, </em>136 N.H. at 105, 612 A.2d at 901. Indeed, such a requirement would effectively render review superfluous, as the defendant essentially would have to obtain the information itself in order to meet his burden. The defendant must merely demonstrate a <em>\u201creasonable </em>probability\u201d that the privileged records actually contain the information. <em>See id.; cf. e.g., Bronson v. The Hitchcock Clinic, </em>140 N.H. 798, 802-03, 677 A.2d 665, 669 (1996) (showing of \u201creasonable probability\u201d does not require showing of \u201cmathematical certainty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Neither the State, in its role as prosecutor, nor the defendant has direct access to DCYF records. <em>See </em>RSA 169-C:25, III (1994); RSA 170-G:8-a (1994 &amp; Supp. 1996). <em>Gagne </em>provides a means of discovering, through the limited initial intrusion of <em>in camera </em>judicial review, <em>cf. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 60 (noting that full disclosure would compromise State\u2019s interest in protecting its child-abuse information), whether relevant and material evidence is <em>in fact </em>contained in the records. <em>Gagne, </em>136 N.H. at 105, 612 A.2d at 901. If the bar to <em>in camera </em>review is set too high, we risk depriving the defendant of his constitutional right to due process. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15; <em>Gagne, </em>136 N.H. at 105, 612 A.2d at 901. In contrast, the harm done by disclosing the information to the trial court in the first instance is minimal. <em>Cf. Union Leader Corp. v. City of Nashua, </em>141 N.H. 473, 478, 686 A.2d 310, 314 (1996) (noting that <em>in camera </em>review is appropriate where release of records may cause invasion of privacy).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion without opinion, providing no reasons for its ruling. Having reviewed the transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>of the hearing on the motion, we are unsure, on the record before us, whether the trial court applied the <em>Gagne </em>standard, as explained above, for determining whether to grant <em>in camera </em>review of privileged documents. <em>See Gagne, </em>136 N.H. at 105, 612 A.2d at 901. Under the circumstances of this case, we vacate the court\u2019s ruling and remand for application of that test. If on remand the trial court determines that the defendant has met his burden under <em>Gagne, </em>the court should conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the DCYF records, and then determine whether the records contain evidence that would have been \u201cessential and reasonably necessary\u201d to the defense at trial. If the records do contain such evidence, the court should order a new trial unless it finds that the error of not admitting the evidence in the first trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id. </em>at 106-07, 612 A.2d at 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
