He contends that the Superior Court <em>(Groff, </em>J.) erred: (1) in refusing his requests to admit evidence of prior sexual activity of the victim and for a hearing pursuant to <em>State v. Howard, </em>121 N.H. 53, 426 A.2d 457 (1981); (2) in ruling that the defendant had not met his burden under <em>State v. Gagne, </em>136 N.H. 101, 612 A.2d 899 (1992), to trigger <em>in camera </em>review of the victim\u2019s post-assault counseling records; and (3) by admitting into evidence a portion of a letter that did not meet the threshold requirement of relevancy, <em>see </em>N.H. R. Ev. 401, 402. Because we reverse on the admission of the excerpt from the letter, we decline to reach the defendant\u2019s other arguments, but leave resolution of any questions that may arise on remand to the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The victim and the defendant lived in the same neighborhood in Manchester, and the victim was a close friend of the defendant\u2019s stepdaughter. The defendant and the victim became acquainted through the victim\u2019s visits to his home to see his stepdaughter. In September 1994, when she was fourteen, the victim told a school counselor that she had been sexually assaulted by the defendant during several visits to his home. The victim later met with an employee of the New Hampshire Division for Children Youth and Families and a Manchester police detective. She maintained that the assaults took place between 1991 and 1993 and that on some occasions the defendant\u2019s stepdaughter was present. Based upon the victim\u2019s allegations, the defendant was indicted on ten separate charges in October 1994. An eleventh indictment alleging sexual contact with his stepdaughter was added in November 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">During trial on the charges in superior court, the State sought to introduce an excerpt from a letter written by the defendant\u2019s stepdaughter to the victim in the summer of 1994. Defense counsel made repeated objections as to the letter\u2019s relevance, including an objection that the State had failed to establish \u201cany relevance between this letter and anything that\u2019s gone on in this particular case.\u201d The trial court overruled the objections, stating at one point that the State\u2019s attorney was \u201cworking on\u201d establishing the document\u2019s relevance. The witness then testified that the person she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>referring to at the end of the letter was not the defendant, but the victim\u2019s former boyfriend. Nevertheless, the State moved to. have the letter admitted. The trial court allowed an excerpt from the end of the .letter to be read into evidence. The excerpt reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOR\">Is \u201che\u201d still -bothering you, (you know who I\u2019m talking about) or did you say something to \u201chim\u201d? I hope you said something or if you didn\u2019t that\u2019s okay I just hope he\u2019s leaving you alone and staying' out of your business! Well, [gotta go] don\u2019t [forget to] write back!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Immediately after the excerpt\u2019s admission, the defendant\u2019s stepdaughter again testified that she was not referring to the defendant in the letter, and no other evidence was offered to link the excerpt to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">During its deliberations, the jury submitted a question to the trial juclge regarding \u201cthe reason the letter . . .. [was], not admitted as evidence and made available to the jury.\u201d The jury subsequently convicted the defendant on two of the eleven charges, and this appeal followed. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The defendant asserts that the admission of the excerpt from the Tetter violated New Hampshire Rules of Evidence 401 and 402. To, be relevant, the excerpt must have tended \u201cto make the existence of any fact, that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N-H. R. EV. 401; <em>see State v. Walsh, </em>139 N.H. 435, 436, 655 A.2d 912, 913 (1995); <em>see also </em>1 C. TORCIA, WHARTON\u2019S CRIMINAL EVIDENCE \u00a7 91 at 332-33 (14th ed. 1985). If not relevant, the excerpt should have been excluded. <em>See </em>N.H. R. EV. 402. Evidentiary rulings are within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and we will not reverse its decision absent a showing by the defendant that the ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>See Walsh, </em>139 N.H. at 436, 655 A.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\"> After a review of the record, we hold that the excerpt was not relevant. Evidence may fall short of the threshold requirement of relevancy if the State cannot connect the evidence to the defendant. <em>See State v. Guyette, </em>139 N.H. 526, 529, 658 A.2d 1204, 1206-07 (1995). Here, the only testimony concerning the excerpt specifically refuted the contention that it concerned the defendant. The defendant\u2019s stepdaughter testified that the reference in the letter was to \u201cAl,\u201d the victim\u2019s former boyfriend. The witness stated that \u201cAl\u201d was \u201cfollowing [the victim] everywhere she was going\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>after their relationship ended. The State offered no evidence that the excerpted reference concerned anyone other than \u201cAl.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In addition, no collateral evidence was offered to link the reference in the letter to the defendant. The testimony belied the conclusion that the excerpt referred to the defendant because he was the only male individual with whom both girls were acquainted. In addition to \u201cAl,\u201d the stepdaughter testified that in the letter she inquired whether the victim was still dating a boy named Zeke, or was dating someone else. The witness stated she wrote the victim \u201ca\u201d letter while in North Carolina during the summer of 1994, and there was no evidence to show the girls regularly corresponded about the defendant or any conduct on his part. Finally, the State did not question the victim regarding the excerpt in order to identify the individual in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In the absence of any evidence that the individual referenced in the letter was the defendant, the excerpt allowed the jury to make impermissible inferential leaps \u2014 that the defendant was \u201cbothering\u201d the victim and that the defendant\u2019s stepdaughter knew about this behavior. <em>See id. </em>The erroneous admission of the excerpt thus prejudiced the defendant because it undermined the credibility of the stepdaughter\u2019s denial that she was aware of any sexual assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The State argues that any evidence that the letter\u2019s author was actually referring to someone other than the defendant should have gone only to the weight the jury gave the excerpt. The party wishing to admit evidence bears the initial burden of establishing its relevance. <em>See id. </em>If a proffering party can link evidence to the defendant, thus allowing a court reasonably to find it relevant, the opposing party\u2019s objections go to the weight of the evidence, rather than its admissibility. <em>See Breest v. Perrin, </em>125 N.H. 703, 707, 484 A.2d 1192, 1195 (1984). In the absence of any connection to the defendant, however, the evidence lacks relevancy and must be excluded. <em>See Guyette, </em>139 N.H. at 529, 658 A.2d at 1207; N.H. R. EV. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b181-9\">THAYER, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
