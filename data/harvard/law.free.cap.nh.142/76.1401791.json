The defendant\u2019s convictions also constituted a violation of a previous term of probation. In this consolidated appeal from both the convictions and the probation violation, the defendant argues that the superior court at his criminal trial erred: (1) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ruling, based on offers of proof, that an assistant county attorney could testify concerning a prosecution witness\u2019s character for truthfulness; and (2) in admitting a letter, written by the defendant, whose probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The jury could have found the following facts. On September 8, 1992, the defendant encountered the victim at a restaurant in Rochester and offered her pills for a headache. Previously, the defendant had stated to his girlfriend that he wanted to kill the victim as a result of her actions toward one of the defendant\u2019s friends. At the restaurant, the victim ingested the pills, which the defendant failed to disclose were prescription sedatives. After the victim became unconscious, the defendant took her to his apartment where he brutally beat and kicked her, stabbed her in the leg, forced additional pills down her throat, and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The defendant\u2019s first argument on appeal concerns a \u201cruling\u201d by the trial court concerning the admissibility of proposed testimony from an assistant county attorney. At trial, Shane Grant testified that the defendant told him that the defendant had beaten and raped the victim. According to Grant, who had been incarcerated in the county jail with the defendant following the defendant\u2019s arrest, the defendant made these statements in the presence of another inmate, Brian Ellis. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, the defendant\u2019s attorney informed the trial court of the defense\u2019s intention to rest, rather than call Ellis. According to the defendant\u2019s trial attorney, the decision to rest resulted from a previous \u201cindication\u201d by the trial court, during an unrecorded conference, regarding the admissibility of the prosecution\u2019s evidentiary response to Ellis\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">On the record, the defendant\u2019s attorney asserted that Ellis would have testified that the statements described by Grant were never made by the defendant in Ellis\u2019 presence; that the prosecuting attorney would have countered Ellis\u2019 testimony by calling a colleague, assistant county attorney Harry Starbranch, to testify as to his opinion of Grant\u2019s truthful character; and that the prosecution\u2019s use of an assistant county attorney to testify in such a manner would have been inappropriate. The trial court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">Let me just say we are not even at that point yet. I haven\u2019t heard any of this testimony, and I haven\u2019t even \u2014 obviously, once I hear it, Brian Ellis testifies, and Attorney Starbranch then decides to testify in rebuttal or the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Attorney calls him, in rebuttal, we\u2019ll deal with those issues at the time. I can\u2019t operate in a vacuum on this ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The trial court further cautioned the defendant\u2019s attorney against suggesting that,the court was somehow responsible for the defense\u2019s decision not to call Ellis.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">At that point, the prosecuting attorney interjected, explaining the State\u2019s understanding that Ellis would impeach the credibility of Grant and essentially confirming the state of affairs described by the defendant\u2019s attorney. According to the prosecuting attorney, the assistant county attorney would testify, based on his \u201cseveral contacts and some dealings\u201d with Grant, as to Grant\u2019s character for truthfulness. The trial court again stated that it would not rule on the issue until it actually heard Ellis\u2019 testimony and determined its significance with respect to the proposed rehabilitation testimony of the assistant county attorney. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 608(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Not satisfied with the trial court\u2019s position, the defendant\u2019s attorney pressed the court for a ruling on the appropriateness of the rehabilitation testimony under Rule 608(a) and, more particularly, on the propriety of such testimony from an <em>assistant county attorney </em>who had previously prosecuted the defendant. After further discussion, the trial court stated that the proposed testimony from the assistant county attorney would be permissible \u201cif the proper foundation is laid consistent with Rule 608.\u201d In addition, the trial court apparently concluded that testimony from Ellis directly contradicting Grant\u2019s testimony would constitute the type of attack on Grant\u2019s truthfulness that would authorize rehabilitation evidence concerning Grant\u2019s truthful character. The defendant\u2019s attorney then reiterated that Ellis would not be called as a defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">On appeal, the defendant alleges three errors in the trial court\u2019s \u201cruling\u201d concerning the admissibility of the proposed testimony from the assistant county attorney. First, the defendant argues that the foundation for the rehabilitation testimony was insufficient under <em>State v. Vachon, </em>139 N.H. 540, 543, 659 A.2d 426, 429 (1995), because the assistant county attorney merely had \u201cdealings\u201d and \u201ccontacts\u201d with Grant. Second, the defendant contends that Ellis\u2019 testimony would have directly contradicted Grant\u2019s testimony and, therefore, would not have constituted the type of indirect attack on Grant\u2019s general truthfulness that would have permitted evidence of Grant\u2019s truthful character. <em>Cf. State v. Ross, </em>141 N.H. 397, 400-02, 685 A.2d 1234, 1236-37 (1996). Third, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly condoned the prosecution\u2019s \u201cploy of having a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>fellow prosecutor testify about the credibility of the State\u2019s own witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The State counters that none of these issues is preserved for our review because the trial court never ruled in the context of actual testimony. We agree. Although the record suggests that the trial court ultimately provided a conditional opinion on the admissibility of the assistant county attorney\u2019s testimony, we endorse its initial refusal to \u201coperate in a vacuum.\u201d Because neither Ellis nor the assistant county attorney testified, \u201cwe find the claim of prejudicial error too speculative for adjudication.\u201d <em>State v. Bruneau, </em>131 N.H. 104, 115, 552 A.2d 585, 592 (1988); <em>see also Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 41-42 (1984). Indeed, we have no way of knowing whether the defendant would actually have called Ellis to testify absent the trial court\u2019s \u201cruling,\u201d how Ellis would have testified, whether Ellis\u2019 testimony and the cross-examination of Ellis would have triggered rehabilitation evidence under Rule 608(a)(2), whether the prosecution would have attempted to respond with testimony from the assistant county attorney, whether the prosecution would have established the foundational predicate for such testimony under <em>Vachon, </em>how the trial court ultimately would have ruled if the defendant interposed a specific and timely objection, and how the assistant county attorney would have testified. <em>See United States v. Griffin, </em>818 F.2d 97, 104 &amp; n.5 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 844 (1987); <em>see also Bruneau, </em>131 N.H. at 115, 552 A.2d at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Aware of the general rule against appellate review of hypothetical evidentiary errors, the defendant would have us distinguish this case on the grounds that the parties\u2019 undisputed offers of proof were sufficiently specific to inform this court of the critical <em>facts </em>relating to the evidentiary issue and that the trial court\u2019s \u201cruling\u201d was erroneous as a matter of <em>laiv. </em>Neither ground advanced by the defendant provides a persuasive reason for departing from the general rule. The specificity of the offers of proof is irrelevant because \u201ctrial testimony [can], for any number of reasons, differ from the proffer[s].\u201d <em>Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 41 n.5; <em>see also Griffin, </em>818 F.2d at 104. Characterizing the trial court\u2019s \u201cruling\u201d as an error of law in no way alters the principle that the admissibility of responsive evidence can only be determined after reviewing the <em>actual </em>testimony to which it would respond. <em>See United States v. Nivica, </em>887 F.2d 1110, 1117 (1st Cir. 1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1005 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The defendant next argues, based on New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403, that the trial court erred in admitting a letter because its probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The letter was written by the defendant to an inmate at the county jail after the defendant\u2019s arrest and subsequent transfer from the county jail to the State Prison. In the letter, the defendant refers to his misconduct at the county jail, offers profanity-laced promises of revenge against employees at the county jail, describes himself as a member of \u201cthe new generation of prisoners,\u201d identifies the State Prison as his \u201chome for 6 to 15 years,\u201d and portrays life at.the prison as relatively tolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The State argues that the defendant\u2019s objections at trial failed to preserve the Rule 403 argument that he currently advances. We agree. It is well settled that \u201ca contemporaneous and specific objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate review.\u201d <em>State v. Russo, </em>140 N.H. 751, 753, 674 A.2d 156, 158 (1996) (quotation omitted). At trial, the defendant specifically objected to the letter on relevance grounds, mentioned \u201cbad acts\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d concerns, and referred to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b). An objection on \u201cbad acts\u201d or Rule 404(b) grounds, however, has <em>three </em>potential bases. <em>See State v. Bassett, </em>139 N.H. 493, 496, 659 A.2d 891, 894 (1995) (discussing three-pronged analysis for admissibility under Rule 404(b)). Relevance, the ground specifically raised by the defendant at trial, is only <em>one </em>of these bases; the Rule 403 balancing of probative value and prejudicial effect, a ground never identified by the defendant, is a <em>separate </em>basis. <em>See State v. McGlew, </em>139 N.H. 505, 507, 658 A.2d 1191, 1193 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s specific objection on relevance grounds precludes his current attempt to broaden the scope of his challenge to the letter\u2019s admissibility. <em>Cf. State v. Mills, </em>136 N.H. 46, 49, 611 A.2d 1104, 1105 (1992) (specific objection concerning competency of child witness rendered other related arguments unpreserved). The fact that the trial court actually addressed the letter\u2019s probative value and prejudicial effect is not alone dispositive, given the defendant\u2019s initial failure to raise an objection based \u25a0on prejudice, <em>see State v. Winn, </em>141 N.H. 812, 813, 694 A.2d 537, 538 (1997), and his subsequent failure to object to the trial court\u2019s balancing determination, <em>cf. Mills, </em>136 N.H. at 49, 611 A.2d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Finally, we assume without deciding that the defendant\u2019s briefing of his Rule 403 argument adequately preserves a challenge to the letter\u2019s relevance (the probative nature of the evidence forming part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>of the Rule 403 equation). Our inquiry ends, however, with the defendant\u2019s recognition that the letter\u2019s reference to State Prison as \u201chome for 6 to 15 years\u201d was marginally relevant to the assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b119-6\">HORTON, j., and Broderick, j., concurred specially; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b119-7\">HORTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">concurring specially: I join in part I of the majority\u2019s opinion for the cogent reasons stated therein. I concur in the result reached in part II of the majority\u2019s opinion, but disagree with its conclusion concerning preservation of the defendant\u2019s argument under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403. Accordingly, I write separately to state my reasons for believing that the defendant\u2019s argument concerning the prejudicial effect of the letter was preserved and for concluding that the trial court did not err in admitting the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">As the majority correctly notes, the defendant\u2019s trial attorney specifically objected to the letter on relevance grounds. Additional objections vaguely raised \u201cbad acts\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d concerns and referred to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b). In holding that the defendant\u2019s objections failed to preserve an argument based on the prejudicial effect of the letter, the majority apparently construes the defendant\u2019s specific objections on relevance grounds as circumscribing the scope of his general \u201cbad acts\u201d or Rule 404(b) objections. Stated otherwise, the majority views the defendant\u2019s various objections as raising \u201cbad acts\u201d objections <em>based solely on </em>relevance grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">In my opinion, the defendant objected on <em>both </em>relevance <em>and </em>\u201cbad acts\u201d grounds. I would therefore hold that his objections adequately preserved the defendant\u2019s Rule 403 argument because concerns about prejudicial effect are implicit in \u201cbad acts\u201d or Rule 404(b) objections. <em>See State v. Carter, </em>140 N.H. 1, 4-5, 662 A.2d 289, 291 (1995); <em>cf. State v. Bouchard, </em>138 N.H. 581, 585, 643 A.2d 963, 966 (1994); <em>State v. Judkins, </em>128 N.H. 223, 224-25, 512 A.2d 427, 428 (1986). Moreover, the trial court apparently understood the defendant\u2019s objections as presenting the Rule 403 issue because the court specifically found that the letter\u2019s probative value substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect. <em>See State v. McMinn, </em>141 N.H. 636, 642, 690 A.2d 1017, 1021 (1997). The rationale for the preservation doctrine \u2014 affording the trial court the initial opportunity to address an issue \u2014 was therefore served in this case. <em>See State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>Tselios, </em>134 N.H. 405, 407, 593 A.2d 243, 245 (1991). Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that the defendant should have objected to the trial court\u2019s ruling concerning the letter\u2019s probative value and prejudicial effect. \u201cTaking of exceptions is no longer necessary in matters of evidence.\u201d N.H. R. EV. 103(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Turning to the merits of the defendant\u2019s argument under Rule 403,1 would conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the letter. <em>See State v. Philbrook, </em>138 N.H. 601, 603, 644 A.2d 66, 67 (1994). The letter\u2019s relevance flowed directly from the defendant\u2019s implicit recognition of his culpability through the reference to State Prison as his \u201chome for 6 to 15 years.\u201d The letter\u2019s relevance flowed less directly from its tendency to support the prosecution\u2019s explanation for the defendant\u2019s reason for denying the rape charge in his written statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">On this last point, the prosecution argued that the letter provided the key for understanding the defendant\u2019s numerous inculpatory statements concerning the assault charge but his discrepant statements regarding his culpability on the rape charge. For example, the defendant on separate occasions admitted facts central to the assault charge to his girlfriend, to Shane Grant, to an acquaintance, and to the police in a written statement. In contrast, the defendant admitted the rape to Shane Grant and to an acquaintance, but he emphatically denied that charge in his written statement to the police. According to the prosecution, the letter not only demonstrated that the defendant knew he was going to State Prison on the assault charge, but it also showed that he wanted to be respected at the prison as a \u201ctough guy,\u201d not despised as a rapist. Shane Grant had testified that an inmate\u2019s underlying criminal conviction often determines his reputation at the State Prison: individuals convicted of first degree assault (\u201ctough guys\u201d) have a favorable reputation and receive no harassment from other prisoners, whereas convicted rapists have a \u201cvery low, low reputation.\u201d Although this theory of relevance may not be compelling, I cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in finding the letter relevant and probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">I would also hold that the trial court could properly have concluded that the prejudicial effect of the letter was minimal. The letter essentially contained references to the defendant\u2019s petty misbehavior at the county jail and his rage toward jail employees for their alleged refusal' to return his shaving cream. Thus, the substance of the letter, including its profanity, was not inflammatory when viewed in the context of the serious nature of the charged offenses. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the letter\u2019s prejudicial effect did not substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>outweigh its probative value. <em>See State v. Stayman, </em>138 N.H. 397, 403, 640 A.2d 771, 775 (1994).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b121-5\">BRODERICK, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">concurring specially: I join in part I of the majority opinion and concur in the result reached in part II. I write separately because I agree with Justice Horton that the defendant properly preserved his objection concerning the prejudicial effect of the letter. As the trial court recognized, the defendant\u2019s argument that the letter would be unduly prejudicial was implicit in his objection based upon New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b); \u201c[t]o raise an objection on the ground of prejudice does not necessarily require counsel to utter the word \u2018prejudice.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Judkins, </em>128 N.H. 223, 225, 512 A.2d 427, 428 (1986). Though I believe the prejudicial effect of the letter was not insubstantial, the error in admitting this evidence was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The prejudicial effect of the letter substantially outweighed its probative value. It is speculative to infer a culpable state of mind from the defendant\u2019s reference to State Prison as his \u201chome for 6 to 15 years,\u201d as he made no mention in the letter of the charged offenses or the surrounding circumstances. Nor did the letter actually support the prosecution\u2019s explanation for the defendant\u2019s denial of the rape charge; indeed, to find such support in the letter would require one to read so closely between its lines as to render any search for deeper meaning pointless. To be sure, the letter quite explicitly reveals that its author is profane, has destructive tendencies, and cares little for authority \u2014 in short, that he is hardly a model citizen. Any marginal probative value the letter may have had was thus substantially outweighed by its \u201cundue tendency to induce a decision against the defendant on some improper basis.\u201d <em>State v. Cochran, </em>132 N.H. 670, 672, 569 A.2d 756, 757 (1990). On balance, admission of the letter was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">This error was nonetheless harmless. Our inquiry in a harmless error analysis is not \u201cwhether the evidence, apart from that erroneously admitted, would support a finding of guilt, but whether it can be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the inadmissible evidence did not affect the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Ruelke, </em>116 N.H. 692, 694, 366 A.2d 497, 498 (1976). \u201cThe evaluation of whether this standard has been achieved involves consideration of the alternative evidence presented at trial and of the character of the inadmissible evidence itself.\u201d <em>State v. Vandebogart, </em>139 N.H. 145, 157-58, 652 A.2d 671, 679 (1994) (quotation and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">In this instance, the State presented compelling evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The defendant, on separate occasions, admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>facts central to the assault charge to the police, to his girlfriend, to Shane Grant, and to an acquaintance; the defendant also admitted the rape to Shane Grant and to an acquaintance. The defendant had earlier stated that he wanted to kill the victim; the victim told the medical staff treating her injuries of \u201cpenetration\u201d; tests revealed the presence of unidentified seminal material on the victim; and the defendant was seen with the victim both shortly before and immediately after the incident. As against this evidence, the force of the erroneously admitted letter, including its profanity, was comparatively minimal and, therefore, inconsequential. <em>See State v. Lemieux, </em>136 N.H. 329, 331-32, 615 A.2d 635, 636 (1992).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
