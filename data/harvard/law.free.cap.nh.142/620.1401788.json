On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in refusing to give the jury either a time-based defense instruction under <em>State v. Williams, </em>137 N.H. 343, 629 A.2d 83 (1993), <em>(Williams </em>instruction) or an alibi instruction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-16\">The defendant was indicted for an aggravated felonious sexual assault that occurred \u201con or about\u201d May 2, 1995. He timely filed a notice of alibi, claiming that he was in Mohawk, New York, at the time of the charged assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-17\">At trial, the State presented the following evidence. The defendant had a brief relationship with the victim\u2019s mother and lived with her and her two children at their apartment in Rochester, New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Hampshire, for a couple of months in 1995. The defendant often babysat the six-year-old victim and her younger brother. The victim testified that the defendant babysat her after school on \u201cJump Rope for Heart Day,\u201d a fund-raising event for the American Heart Association, and assaulted her. A school employee testified that the fund-raising event occurred on May 2, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Defense witnesses testified that the defendant arrived in Mohawk, New York, on April 28 or 29, and left to return to New Hampshire on the evening of May 2. On cross-examination, the prosecution challenged the recollection of the defense witnesses as to whether the defendant returned to New Hampshire on May 1 or May 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">At the close of the evidence, defense counsel submitted an alibi instruction, among others. The trial court questioned the propriety of the alibi instruction on the apparent basis that the date of the alleged assault was not an element of the offense because the defendant had not requested and secured a bill of particulars. Counsel moved for a bill of particulars, which the trial court denied. A request for a <em>Williams </em>instruction followed, and it, too, was denied. The court reasoned that \u201con or about\u201d May 2, 1995, did not constitute a \u201ctime frame\u201d under <em>Williams </em>and that the defendant failed to demonstrate a \u201clack of opportunity\u201d to commit the assault, assuming a time frame was alleged. <em>See Williams, </em>137 N.H. at 346, 629 A.2d at 85. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In assessing the defendant\u2019s appeal, we are mindful that \u201c[t]he trial court has discretion to determine whether or not a particular instruction is necessary to assist the jury in reaching a verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Dedrick, </em>135 N.H. 502, 505, 607 A.2d 127, 129 (1992). A trial court\u2019s denial of a proposed jury instruction is reviewed in the context of the entire charge and all of the evidence presented at trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">As a general rule, \u201c[t]he exact date of [an] assault is not an element of aggravated felonious sexual assault,\u201d <em>State v. Demond, </em>136 N.H. 233, 234, 614 A.2d 1342, 1342-43 (1992) (quotation omitted), and the State is not required to prove that an assault occurred at the time alleged in the indictment, <em>see State v. Stearns, </em>130 N.H. 475, 489, 547 A.2d 672, 680 (1988). Rather, the State must only prove that the crime occurred before the indictment was returned and within the statute of limitations. <em>State v. Perkins, </em>70 N.H. 330, 332, 47 A. 268, 269 (1900).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">There are, however, two exceptions to the general rule. First, if the State furnishes a bill.of particulars that identifies a specific date or time frame for the charged offense, then it must prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>temporal detail beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Boire, </em>124 N.H. 622, 624-25, 474 A.2d 568, 569-70 (1984). Second, if the State alleges the crime occurred within a time frame in the indictment or complaint and the defendant asserts a lack of opportunity defense for the entire period, then the State must establish the time frame as part of its proof. <em>Williams, </em>137 N.H. at 346, 629 A.2d at 85. The defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a bill of particulars; accordingly, we address whether the trial court erred in refusing to give a <em>Williams </em>instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The defendant argues that he was entitled to a <em>Williams </em>instruction because the State alleged a time frame in the indictment. Because we hold that the indictment did not allege a <em>Williams </em>time frame, the trial court did not err in refusing to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We interpret <em>Williams </em>to apply only when an indictment brackets criminal conduct within an extended time period, and a defendant asserts lack of opportunity to commit the crime. <em>See id. </em>We created the <em>Williams </em>exception to strike a balance between the difficulties the State encounters \u201cin fixing a precise date for a sexual assault, particularly when the victim is a young child who cannot easily relate the time of the offense to school vacations or other outside events,\u201d and the burden an extended time frame imposes on a defendant in preparing a defense because \u201cpersons can rarely find alibi witnesses for each day of a long time period.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant was charged with sexually assaulting a child while babysitting him \u201cbetween January 1, 1988 and December 31, 1989.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 629 A.2d at 84. The defendant presented evidence establishing that he was last alone with the child in December 1987. <em>Id. </em>at 347, 629 A.2d at 85-86. Because of the extended time period asserted in the indictment and the defendant\u2019s claim that he lacked opportunity to assault the victim during that period, we held that it was the State\u2019s burden to prove the assault occurred during the two-year period alleged. <em>Id. </em>at 346, 629 A.2d at 85. Here, however, the State did not charge the defendant with committing an assault during an extended period of time, but rather asserted that he sexually assaulted the young victim \u201con or about\u201d May 2, 1995. Such a narrow focus did not interfere with the defendant\u2019s ability to establish an alibi defense, <em>see State v. Fennell, </em>133 N.H. 402, 411, 578 A.2d 329, 334 (1990), and thus the concerns underlying <em>Williams </em>are not implicated. <em>See Williams, </em>137 N.H. at 346, 629 A.2d at 85. Accordingly, a <em>Williams </em>instruction was not required because the indictment did not allege a time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The defendant also asserts that the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to give the requested model alibi instruction because his alibi defense was supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Plante, </em>134 N.H. 456, 460, 594 A.2d 1279, 1282 (1991) (requested charge on theory of insanity defense must be given if theory supported by some evidence). Unlike a <em>Williams </em>instruction, the alibi instruction requested by the defendant does not require the State to prove that the assault occurred within a particular time frame. The instruction, instead, underscores the defendant\u2019s claim that he was not present when the crime was committed and the State\u2019s burden to prove his presence. <em>See </em>N.H. Criminal Jury instructions 3.02 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">A specific, contemporaneous objection to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a particular jury instruction is necessary to preserve the issue for appellate review. <em>State v. Davis, </em>139 N.H. 185, 192-93, 650 A.2d 1386, 1390 (1994). This requirement \u201caffords the trial court an opportunity to correct an error it may have made and is particularly appropriate where an alleged error involves a jury instruction.\u201d <em>State v. Eldredge, </em>135 N.H. 562, 564, 607 A.2d 617, 618 (1992) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">At the close of the evidence, the trial court and defense counsel first discussed the propriety of an alibi instruction. Their colloquy reveals that they both erroneously believed that an alibi instruction imposed a burden on the State to prove that the assault occurred on a specific date or within a particular time frame.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">THE COURT: I\u2019ve got to raise one thing that I am troubled by, and that\u2019s alibi. The charge in this case is on or about. There\u2019s no request for a bill of particulars. How do I charge alibi?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, at this point I would say that all the evidence that\u2019s come in, there\u2019s been no evidence of on or about. It\u2019s been evidence of May 2nd. The prosecution brought that out in their own case, that it\u2019s only May 2nd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">THE COURT: I understand that. That doesn\u2019t necessarily convert it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>to where the charge is on or about, doesn\u2019t convert it to an element of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, then I suppose, Your Honor, at this point I\u2019d move for a bill of particulars given the fact that the State has presented no evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">[THE STATE]: Now, you know, Judge, we went in front of the Court before when [defense counsel] had opportunity to do that so she could have taken advantage of it and she decided not to do that because I as[s]ume she felt there was more advantage in not doing it. To try and change the burden of proof at this point where she had an opportunity to do it before is unfair to the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not going to grant a bill of particulars at this juncture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right, then, Your Honor, I would ask for an instruction under State vs. Williams case, and I can give you the cite. We have raised \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-13\">THE COURT: What\u2019s the time frame?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">The exchange continued with defense counsel asserting an entitlement to a <em>Williams </em>instruction and concluded with the court denying the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">Assuming without deciding that a defendant may under certain circumstances be entitled to an alibi instruction, it is readily apparent from the record that the trial court had misgivings about its propriety absent a bill of particulars. To the extent the court believed that an alibi instruction could only be given in circumstances where the burden was on the State to prove the assault occurred on a specific date or during a particular time frame, this was error. When confronted with this misinterpretation, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>defense counsel made no effort to explain the lawful basis for an alibi instruction in order to allow the court to correct its error. Rather, the defendant abandoned his requested alibi instruction and affirmed the trial court\u2019s misperception that he sought to burden the State with the obligation to prove that the assault occurred on a specific date or within a particular time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Moreover, after instructing the jury, the trial court gave counsel the opportunity to record their objections. Defense counsel merely explained why a bill of particulars was not previously sought. Counsel again failed to remedy the trial court\u2019s mischaracterization of the requested alibi instruction when it voiced its reasoning that \u201cabsent filing a bill of particulars the date is not an element of the offense\u201d and \u201c[the charge or evidence] does not rise to ... a Williams type time frame . . . [or] time based defense sufficient to justify the Williams charge.\u201d Preservation requires that the defendant make a <em>specific </em>objection to provide the trial court an opportunity to correct any error it may have made, <em>see Davis, </em>139 N.H. at 192-93, 650 A.2d at 1390; <em>Eldredge, 135 </em>N.H. at 564, 607 A.2d at 618, and does not enable \u201ccounsel [to] comb the record on a treasure hunt for issues never properly brought before the trial judge.\u201d <em>State v. Josselin, </em>119 N.H. 936, 937, 409 A.2d 1336, 1336 (1979) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in failing to give an alibi instruction was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b664-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
