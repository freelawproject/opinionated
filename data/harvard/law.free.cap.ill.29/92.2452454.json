Underhill, 3 Scam. 388.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-7\" pgmap=\"97\">Complainant should have an express assignment and note from H. H. Moffatt; making him a defendant does not supply this defect.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-8\" pgmap=\"97\">Disregarding this defect, violates the rule in equity, which is, to do complete justice between all parties interested, and close every opening to new litigation.

Wight, for Appellee.</attorneys><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-13\" pgmap=\"97\">The note and mortgage in question in this cause are not subject to the defense attempted in this cause by the appellant.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-14\" pgmap=\"97\">The appellee is the bona fide holder of the note by indorsement, and of the mortgage by assignment.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-15\" pgmap=\"97(9) 98(51)\">The note is properly indorsed, the indorsement being on the face, which is sufficient, it not being necessary that an indorsement shall be on the back of a note. Byles on Bills, 115; Story on Prom. Notes, 121; Chitty on Bills, 227; 16 East, 6, (end of the case); 1 Strange, 18; 6 How. Miss. R. 60; 26 Ill. 208.</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-5\" pgmap=\"98\">The indorsement is sufficient in form. Any form may be used which manifests an intent to transfer the note (Story on Prom. Notes, 121); and figures put on a note for that purpose have been held to be an indorsement.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A27\" pgmap=\"98\">This indorsement is sufficient in form. It is a guaranty, such as has been held to be good to any holder of the note as a guaranty, and as sufficient to convey and transfer the title in the note to such holder as an indorsement. 3 Scam. 489 ; 20 Verm. R. 499.</p><p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-7\" pgmap=\"98\">The assignment of the mortgage is sufficient. It is stated in the bill, that by and with the consent and authority of H. H. Moffatt, D. 0. Moffatt assigned the mortgage to the appellee. H. H. Moffatt was made a defendant in appellee\u2019s bill, and it was taken for confessed against him.</p><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-8\" pgmap=\"98\">The defense cannot be made against a bona fide holder of a note. It is a sort of modified usury, (see 19 Ill. 121), and subject to the rules that govern the defense of usury; the statute giving it being no broader than the statute allowing the parties to plead usury. 3 Scam. 388; 24 Ill. 345, 347. See also, 14 Ill. 51.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-9\" pgmap=\"98\">Interest was paid on this note twice, (to wit, June, 1857, and January, 1858), after the act of 1857 went into effect. Was not such payment a legalizing of the note after it became lawful to make such notes ? It must be true that the payment must stand as it was made. It was a voluntary payment, made on account of interest, and no other application of the payment can now be made.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-10\" pgmap=\"98\">Although the note in form requires the ten per cent, to be paid as interest, was not the supposed interest, in point of fact, a part of the purchase price of the land, and, in equity, recoverable as such, though called interest; and will not this court, for the purposes of justice, look through the form of the transaction to its substance 1</p><p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-4\" pgmap=\"99\">The note in question, notwithstanding its reference to the mortgage, is a negotiable promissory note. See 31 Eng. Com. Law R. 180 ; 18 Ill. 563 ; 19 Ill. 392.</p><p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-5\" pgmap=\"99\">It was proper to compute interest at the rate of ten per cent, to the date of the decree. 16 111. 108.</p> <opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b99-6\" pgmap=\"99\">Breese, J.</author> <p id=\"Ai\" pgmap=\"99\">The first point made in this ease is, that the note was not properly indorsed, the transfer being on the face of the note. Literally, indorsement means a writing, in dorse, upon the back of the bill or note. But it is well established, \u2018that though such is its import, it may be made on the face of the bill, and numerous indorsements may be made on a separate paper, called an allonge. Chit, on Bills, *227; Yarborough v. Bank of England, 16 East, 12 ; Rex v. Bigg, 1 Strange, 18 ; Story on Promissory Notes, sec. 121; Gibson v. Powell, 6 Howard (Miss.) 60. And any form is sufficient which manifests an intention to transfer the note. Morris v. Bird, 11 Mass. 436.</p> <p id=\"b99-7\" pgmap=\"99\">This indorsement is in the form of a guaranty, and is sufficient to convey and transfer the title in the note to the holder, as an indorsement. Heaton v. Hulbert, 3 Scam. 489; Partridge v. Davis, 20 Verm. 499. This principle is well established.</p> <p id=\"b99-8\" pgmap=\"99\">We do not suppose there was any necessity for assigning the mortgage. When the note was indorsed, that carried wfith it the mortgage, the note being the principal debt, and the mortgage but an incident. Lucas et al. v. Harris, 20 Ill. 165. By the indorsement of the note and mortgage by Benjamin Moffatt to Daniel C. and Hezekiah H. Moffatt, they became entitled each to one-half the note and its proceeds, and to one-half the mortgage security, and no more; and neither one could transfer any other or greater interest in the same.</p> <p id=\"b99-9\" pgmap=\"99\">The bill filed by appellee, claimed the whole interest by virtue of the assignment of Daniel C. Moffatt to him, and the decree passed to that extent, declaring the appellee the owner of the whole mortgage, and of the moneys that should arise from the sale of the mortgaged premises.</p> <p id=\"b99-10\" pgmap=\"99(13) 100(144)\">He insists here, as there was a charge in the bill, that Hezekiah H. Moffatt had authorized Daniel 0. Moffatt to assign the mortgage and deliver the note and mortgage to appellant, and as that charge was not denied by H. H. Moffatt, it must be taken for true, and must bind him. There was no actual notice to either of the Moffatts, by summons, of the pendency of the bill, but a publication only, and on their non-appearance, their default was entered, and the matters in the bill taken as confessed. We should think, as notice by publication is, by law, a sufficient notice, the parties so notified must be deemed to be in court, and subject to any legal decree or judgment of the court, and that H. H. Moffatt, by his default, is precluded from denying the fact of the assignment of the mortgage, and of his interest in it.</p> <p id=\"b100-5\" pgmap=\"100\">The appellant sets up, as a part of his defense, that the note was for a usurious consideration, and submits proof that the note was given for the purchase price of a tract of land, and for nothing else, and that ten per cent, interest was reserved thereon.</p> <p id=\"b100-6\" pgmap=\"100\">This note was made in 1854, while the first three sections of the act of 1849, regulating interest, were in force. By those sections, but six per cent, interest \u201ecould be reserved on such a contract. The appellant shows that he has paid a large portion of interest computed at ten per cent, per annum. This he may avoid, and the decree for more than six per cent, per annum is erroneous. The bill and exhibits and testimony will be referred to the master in chancery, to take an account of interest paid over and above six per centum per annum, and the interest calculated at six per centum per annum, and no more, which, with the principal sum added, will be the amount of the sum which the Circuit Court of Winnebago county will render in the cause. The costs of this court to be equally divided between the parties.</p> <p id=\"b100-7\" pgmap=\"100\">Decree modified.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
