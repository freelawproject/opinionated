Knew Edmond Fitzgibbon; he took Patrick\u2019s children after his death. Patrick left three children\u2014John, William and Mary. I reside on lot 28, block 4, .Fort Dearborn Addition to Chicago. Lot 29 is next east of mine. Patrick Fitzgibbon was on lot 29 \u2022since the same was sold by the United States in 1839. In 1839, he moved a house on lot 29, and moved into it. The youngest boy and girl were born there\u2014the eldest was a small child then. Patrick did not reside on the lot at the time of his death; moved from there about a year before. Children resided in Cook county at the .time of guardian\u2019s sale.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-4\" pgmap=\"167\">The defendants called Edmond Fitzgibbon, who testified as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\" pgmap=\"167\">Patrick was my brother; had no relation or friend named Edward ; knew no such person. I proved the will and took upon myself the execution of the will. I was frequently called, and name often written, Edward. I acted as executor and guardian; gave bonds and qualified as guardian; filed petition for sale of premises. Had a conversation with Rev. Mr. Quarters about qualifying to act as guardian and executor, and he said that he would see that it was carried out properly, but never acted as guardian. I objected at the time to having anything to do with it, but Mr. Quarters told me to go on and get out letters, and he would see that it was duly carried out. He was clergyman for Chicago. John is now about twenty-two, and William nineteen years of age; Mary is younger. I am the only one that has acted as guardian or executor.

Mr. Quarters a letter declining to act as guardian. Thinks letters of guardianship were issued to Edmond alone; they would have issued at the date of the bond; no recollection of but one bond.</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-8\" pgmap=\"167\">Charles B.

If that sale was valid, the judgment is right; if not, wrong. t</p><p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-13\" pgmap=\"170\">The first point we make against it is, that the plaintiffs, John and William Fitzgibbon, whose property was sold, were nqt parties to the proceedings in which the order of sale was obtained. In re Sturms et ux., 25 Ill. 390 ; Hoare v. Harris, 11 Ill. 24; Bowles v.

Porter, 23 Ill. 445.</p><p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-15\" pgmap=\"170\">That Edmond Fitzgibbon, one of the testamentary guardians, could not alone, without his co-guardian, Rev. Walter Quarters, institute such proceedings. Although the office is not a mere naked power, but is coupled with an interest, and therefore survives, after the death of one of them, to the other, (Eyre v. Countess of Shaftsbury, 2 P. Wms. 103), yet during the life of both donees, they must join in the execution of the power. Sinclair v. Jackson, 8 Cowen, 543, 583.</p><p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-16\" pgmap=\"170\">There is no statute to aid, as in the case of executors. Clinefelter v. Ayres, 16 Ill. 329.</p><p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-17\" pgmap=\"170(33) 171(14)\">Joint testamentary guardians are \u201c strictly like the case of an administration granted to two,\u201d who must join in applying to sell the lands of the intestate. 2 P. Wms. 103; Thorp v. McCullum, 1 Gilm. 614, 625, 629; Gregory v. McPherson, 13 Cal. R. 562, 578.</p><p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-5\" pgmap=\"171\">The sale was ordered to be made on 17th April, 1848, but was made on the 22nd of same month.</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-6\" pgmap=\"171\">The statute requires the court to direct the time of sale. Scates\u2019 Stat. 552, sec. 10.</p><p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-7\" pgmap=\"171\">A sale at another time must be void. Wellman v. Lawrence, 15 Mass. 326\u2014330; Reynolds v. Wilson, 15 Ill. 394.</p><p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-8\" pgmap=\"171\">A void act cannot be confirmed. Sinclair v.

Correll, 19 Ill. 226.</p><p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-10\" pgmap=\"171\">There is no analogy here to the cases of sales made by order of the court of chancery, who exercise their own discretion, as described in Garrett v. Moss, 20 Ill. 549\u2014554.</p><p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-11\" pgmap=\"171\">\u201c Neither the guardian nor the court could contrive to vest the title in any other mode than that provided by the statute.\u201d Young v. Keogh, 11 Ill. 642.</p><p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-12\" pgmap=\"171\">This is not an irregularity; the act is void. The court derives its authority from the statute; it must pursue the statute or its acts are void.

Young v. Keogh, 11 Ill. 642.</p><p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-15\" pgmap=\"171\">Equity cannot supply the want of it. Young v. Dowling, 15 Ill. 481.</p><p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-16\" pgmap=\"171\">The confirmation is a judicial act. Halleck v. Guy, 9 Cal. R. 181. 195.</p><p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-17\" pgmap=\"171\">Unless judicial, a court would have no power to perform it, for a court has no other functions than judicial. Nor could error be assigned for granting or refusing, as in Ayres v. Baumgarten, 15 Ill. 445; ex parte Guernsey, 21 Ill. 443.</p><p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-18\" pgmap=\"171(22) 172(65)\">The court had, by this dismissal, lost all control of the ease; insufferable frauds would be the result of a contrary decision.

This could not be. The statute (sec. 10, before cited) authorizes \u201c the sale of the real estate of the ward,\u201d \u201c for the support and education of the wardnot for the support and education of any other person.

And no guardian ad litem was required.</p><p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-10\" pgmap=\"172\">. The ordinary rule in chancery is, that the infant must file his bill by his guardian or next friend, as in Hoare v. Harris, 11 Ill. 24.

J.</author> <p id=\"Av0\" pgmap=\"176(55) 177(191)\">The whole of this case depends upon the . admissibility of the record of the guardian\u2019s sale. That was the record of a court authorized by our law to order sales by guardians of the estates of infants, for their support or for reinvestment. This record is offered in defense of an action of ejectment, by one claiming under the guardian\u2019s sale. It really seems difficult for even good lawyers to appreciate the difference between such a case and a direct proceeding upon such a record for the purpose of reversing the order of the court, although almost every volume of our reports might teach them the difference. In a collateral action like this, such a decree, let it be never so erroneous, is just as valid and binding as if it were regular in every particular, if the court had jurisdiction to render it. This question of jurisdiction is the only one which can now be inquired into. What, then, will give the court jurisdiction ? This question we have often answered. We will quote the answer given in Young v. Loraim, 11 Ill. 637: \u201cThey all agree that enough must appear either in the application or the order, or at least somewhere on the face of the proceeding, to call upon the court to proceed to act; and all agree that when that does appear, then the court has properly acquired jurisdiction, or, in other words, is properly set to work.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b177-5\" pgmap=\"177(209) 178(244)\">Now this petition contains all that the statute requires, to authorize the court to order a sale of the minors\u2019 estate for their support. It states that the petitioner is testamentary guardian of these minors, naming them; that he has faithfully applied all the personal property belonging to the estate, and that he has not personal estate sufficient in his hands for their education and support; that the minors have real estate, describing it, which he asks to have sold, and the proceeds applied to their support and education. The first objection is, that the minors were not parties to the proceeding. This was not necessary, as the application was for their benefit. Mason v. Wait, 4 Scam. 127; and this case was approved and followed in several cases at the last term, not yet reported. See Stow v. Kimball, 28 Ill. 93. The next is, that the petitioner could not alone, without joining the other guardian named in the will, properly institute that proceeding. Whether the petitioner was the guardian, and had authority to institute the proceeding, was for that court to determine when it heard the petition. It decided he was, by granting the order, and we cannot reverse that decision here. Again, it is said that the sale was not in compliance with the order of the court. That was for that court to determine when it approved of the sale. We cannot inquire into any such irregularity. Again, it is said the proceeding was dismissed ' before the sale was approved. After the decree, and before the report of the sale by the guardian, by mistake an order was entered, purporting to dismiss the proceeding. That did not vacate the order of sale, nor revoke the authority of th\u00e9 guardian to sell, and to report the sale to the court; and when such report was made, it was the duty of the court to act upon it. This was done, and the sale approved. Although the court formally vacated the order entered dismissing the proceeding, yet this was not necessary. The last\u2018objection is, that the lands of two of the minors could not be applied, in whole or in part, to the support of the other. It was hot for the court to inquire, in this case, what was done with the money. If the court erred in directing an improper application of the money, the purchaser was not responsible for that. It was sufficient for him to see that there was an order for the sale of the land, made by a court which had jurisdiction to make the order. Such was undoubtedly the case, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b178-4\" pgmap=\"178\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
