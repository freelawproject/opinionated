Errors have not been joined, but the present plaintiffs in error, instead of reversing for non-joinder, wish a decision upon the merits as presented upon the present record. While a writ of error was pending to reverse a decree in partition, somebody (the record shows, that it was the defaulting commissioner, Erastus Wright,) commenced this attempt to forestall the action of this court by procuring pending the writ of error, and when that fact was proved in the record, an approval of the same made by the commissioner ten years before, which he had never reported, and when he had, after concealing his sale for ten years, kept the money up to and since the confirmation of sale. Mot a cent of the sale money is shown to have been paid over; not a cent has ever been paid over; the whole thing was a grand scheme of peculation. Mo person moved to report a sale until the writ of error under which decision was made at the last term of this court, and no person ever would have moved in the matter, but for that writ of error. The larceny for ten years was supposed to be \u201c an accomplished fact,\u201d but when a writ of error was prosecuted, the present anomalous proceeding was commenced, but no money was forthcoming. We ask, where is the law that permits a court, after a cause has passed off the docket, to reinstate that case on its docket without personal notice to the parties interested %</p><p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-4\" pgmap=\"544\">The provisions of our laws for constructive notice by publication, are confined to special cases\u2014none of the provisions in terms provide for galvanizing a case dead for years, by publication of notice. Suppose a defect in an attachment case, where is the law for publishing a notice to either party, that the other proposes on motion to correct or modify the record ? Where is the law which provides for that species of constructive notice to the original parties to the record \\ We answer, that it cannot be found, and that even as against the original parties to the record, such proceedings would be coram non judice unless personal notice was given.</p><p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-5\" pgmap=\"544\">This case is stronger, however. The abstract is full, and we will not repeat it. The record shows, first, an attempt by publication to get the original parties into court. When the suggestion is made in the record, that the parties, by deaths and marriages, have all changed, then an attempt is made to get in new parties by publications\u2014each successive notice, being an advertisement for new parties not in the original record.</p><p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-6\" pgmap=\"544(11) 545(98)\">Mow, if the case had remained on the docket, infieriy steps might have been taken to make parties under our abatement law, and the practice under it, but it had gone out of court, and when the attempt was made to get it back, the parties in interest had changed entirely. Where, we ask, is the law to conclude their interest on motion after a lapse of ten years, and to make them parties to a cause in court, on motion by publication ? The defendant in. error, or those interested under sale, had no remedy except by bill properly filed, with new parties made, if any remedy existed.</p><p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-5\" pgmap=\"545\">The whole of the present proceeding was a budget of blunders, and those who got it up were ashamed to face the parties in interest, by arguing the case in this court. The names of parties will be found to have been changed at every step, and the whole proceeding is without legal sanction. We can refer to no authorities on this point, because the attempt is one of \u201c first impression.\u201d There is no other case like it.</p><p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-6\" pgmap=\"545\">Suppose, however, that no change of parties had occurred, the title never passed until a confirmation of the sale was had.</p><p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-7\" pgmap=\"545\">Ten years had elapsed without the payment of money arising from pretended sale by the commissioner. Ho reason is given for failure to report sale. There is no proof of compliance with terms of sale by advertisement or otherwise, except by report of Erastus Wright, the commissioner. Did he ever advertise ? Did he ever sell ? After ten years, he reports that he did advertise and sell, but the whole statement rests upon Wright\u2019s report made after ten years delay. He does not account for that delay, nor does he corroborate his report in any manner.</p><p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-8\" pgmap=\"545\">Sales of this class are under the control of the court, unless confirmed by the court.

Coffee, 16 Ill. 144, and cases therein cited.</p><p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-9\" pgmap=\"545(63) 546(46)\">Had these sales been promptly reported, opportunity would have been afforded the parties in interest to have resisted the confirmation of report, and to have shown the facts upon which such resistance was based. But no report of sales was made, and the lapse of time puts it out of the power of the parties to show irregularities or improprieties in the sale. The delay is not accounted for. The parties in interest should not be deprived of their rights by delay over which they had no control. The rights of minors and married women should not be prejudiced by such laches, when no account is given of delay.</p><p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-4\" pgmap=\"546\">The Circuit Court, by the affidavit presented, and by its duty to notice writs of error pending to its proceedings, knew that the cause in which it was asked to confirm this sale, ten years old and only just reported, was pending on error in this court. Tet it confirmed these sales upon the simple report of the commissioner Wright.</p><p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-5\" pgmap=\"546\">\u201c The theory of sales of this character is, that the court is itself the vendor, and the commissioner or master its mere agent in executing its will. The whole proceeding, from its incipient stage up to the final ratification of the reported sale, and the \u2022 passing of the title to the vendee and the money to the person entitled to it, is under the supervision and control of the court. The court will confirm or reject the reported sale, or suspend its completion, as the law and justice of the case may require.\u201d Tooley v. Kain et al., 1 Smedes and Marshal\u2019s Ch. R. 522.</p><p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-6\" pgmap=\"546\">Apply this rule, and we have a Circuit Court approving a report\u2014of a sale ten years unreported\u2014no money paid\u2014no reason given for the delay ; all the facts stated in report resting upon the uncorroborated statement of the commissioner, and all the proceedings had pending a writ of error brought home to the knowledge of the Circuit Court, and that writ of error resulting in a reversal of the decree upon which this pretended sale was based.</p><attorneys data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-7\" pgmap=\"546\">M.

Great interests are involved in its decision, and it has received from us the most careful consideration.</p> <p id=\"b546-9\" pgmap=\"546(21) 547(425) 548(276)\">The proposition is, that striking a cause in partition from the docket, after a final decree has been entered, and a sale of the lands made by the order of the court, removes it entirely from the jurisdiction of the court. Should the removal from the docket have this effect ? From analogy, in criminal cases, it should not have such effect. In those cases, a practice has long obtained in this State, now near half a century, after ineffectual attempts to arrest a defendant in an indictment, to remove, on motion of the State\u2019s attorney, the cause from the docket, with leave to reinstate it on his own suggestion, at any future time. It is all one motion; to remove, subject to be reinstated, thereby excluding the conclusion that the case is at an end, but implying that it is still subject to the action of the court. It may be urged, that the order in this case reserves no right to reinstate; that it is, in terms, so peremptory as to amount to a discontinuance, leaving a party interested, to conclude, from an inspection of the record, that the cause was out of court. This may be so, he may so conclude, yet the jurisdiction of the court may remain. When this cause was stricken from the docket, it had proceeded to a decree for a sale of the lands, and a commissioner was appointed to make the sale. Thus the case stood, the only remaining act to be done, being the production of the report of the sale by the commissioner. At this time, persons, other than the parties to the suit, had become interested by the purchase of the lands. To preserve their interests, what should forbid the court, on their motion, or on that of the original petitioners, or any interested party, to re-docket the cause for the purpose of receiving his report, on proper notice being given, or for any other necessary purpose ? The suit had not been formally dismissed, discontinued, or abandoned in terms. Great latitude must be allowed the courts in such cases, so that the ends of justice may be promoted. We may say, a discretionary power was vested in the court, to allow or not, a motion to reinstate. A court may abuse a discretionary power, or exercise it illegally. We are not inclined to think, this is a case wherein a discretion has been exercised, in a manner not warranted by law. On a motion . to reinstate a cause which had been stricken from the docket, the time when it was done, may be an element to take into consideration. Should but a term or two have intervened, between the motion to strike from the docket, and the motion to reinstate, even in such case, notice of the motion should be given, either actual or constructive. This is indispensable. Where, as in this case, a peremptory order had been made of record, with no reservation, and ten years have elapsed, during the whole of which time the cause lay dormant, if not dead, a supplemental petition might be the better course, setting forth all the proceedings up to the time of filing it, and the parties in interest called upon to appear and make their objections to the final report, if that be the only act remaining to be done, or otherwise, as the state of the case may have been, when it was stricken from the docket, and some reason should be assigned, perhaps, why it was stricken from the docket. Of this petition due notice should be given in the mode prescribed by law, and the court, in the exercise of its discretion, if satisfied that the cause had not been stricken from the docket for an illegitimate purpose, would reinstate it. We are of opinion, that striking the cause from the docket, did not deprive the court of jurisdiction over it, to reinstate it, but that it could be reinstated, on motion, and notice, or by supplemental petition and notice. Due notice of this motion to reinstate the cause was given, and lapse of time should not bar the exercise of this discretionary power, or prevent the court from confirming the sale. Harvey, Guardian of the Heirs of Sweet, 16 Ill. 131.</p> <p id=\"b548-5\" pgmap=\"548\">\u2022 We will now consider, briefly, the action of the court upon the report of the commissioner. Approving the report of sale, involved the approval of the report of the three commissioners, appointed to rpake partition of these lands, and the order of the court thereupon, directing a sale. This court decided in the same case, Tibbs et al. v. Allen, 27 Ill. 128, that the Circuit Court was not justified in ordering a sale on the report of those commissioners\u2014that it was not only not in accordance with the statute, but in the face of the statute. We cannot take this back, as we remain of the opinion then expressed. It was an error then to confirm the sale, based, as it was, upon proceedings deemed illegal and in contravention of the statute.</p> <p id=\"b549-4\" pgmap=\"549\">It may be further remarked, that no proof whatever was furnished the court by the commissioner making the sale, that he had given any public notice of the sale. His mere statement sufficed. This was erroneous. Some proof, other than his assertion, should have been required; at least a copy of the notice, with the affidavit of some credible person that he saw it posted in some public place, or, if printed in a newspaper, the usual certificate of the printer, should have been required.</p> <p id=\"b549-5\" pgmap=\"549\">The order of the Circuit Court confirming the sale of these lands is reversed.</p> <p id=\"b549-6\" pgmap=\"549\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
