Plaintiff read in evidence a mortgage from the defendant, Jacob Kreig, and Jane Kreig, his wife, to plaintiff and one Jacob Sholl, dated February the 25th, 1859, for the premises, to secure the payment of the above named note for $1,037.80, by which said mortgage the said Jacob and Jane Kreig bargained, sold and conveyed the premises in question to said plaintiff and said Jacob Sholl, with all the appurtenances thereunto belonging or in anywise appertaining, with a general warranty of title. Which said mortgage deed was, upon condition that if said Jacob Kreig and Jane Kreig paid to said plaintiff and said Sholl, the full amount of said note of $1,037.80, on or before the 1st day of September, 1859, said mortgage deed should become void, and the estate thereby granted, to cease\u2014otherwise, to be and remain in full force and effect; which said mortgage was duly signed and acknowledged by said Jacob Kreig and Jane Kreig.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\" pgmap=\"515\">Plaintiff read in evidence the note accompanying said mortgage for $1,037.80, and a deed from Jacob Sholl and William A.

The lot of ground which the householder occupies as a homestead is one thing, and the right to claim its exemption from the payment of debts is another. The legislature did not intend to incumber the transfer of the first with the homestead release, or until the wife gave her consent; but simply intended to incumber the right to waive or release the right of exemption from the payment of debts in the cases named in the statute, until the wife gave her consent. But a deed or mortgage which conveys the fee, necessarily carries with it all minor estates or claims upon the land.</p><attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-8\" pgmap=\"517\">Scofield &amp; Manier, for Appellee.</attorneys><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-9\" pgmap=\"517(127) 518(26)\">The defendant below defended under the homestead laws of 1851 and 1857. (Stat. 1858, pp. 586, 587.) The plaintiff contends that the homestead laws are to be strictly construed, and will not protect against an ejectment for the recovery of mortgaged premises, although it will from an order of sale on foreclosure. If this be so, then all the benefits intended to be secured to the debtor and his family, and the manifest object of the legislature, may be frustrated. If the creditor may eject the debtor and his family, and come into possession of the homestead, the former decisions of this court, holding the homestead exempt from sale on foreclosure, are, for all practical purposes, of no benefit to the debtor, as the creditor may, after recovery in ejectment, foreclose the equity of redemption and sell it, and even if he could not, the law ceases to be any present protection.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-4\" pgmap=\"518\">We urge that this law is remedial and entitled to a liberal construction, to effectuate the object intended by the legislature. 25 Ill. 610; 23 Ill. 542.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-5\" pgmap=\"518\">The waiver of the right in both husband and wife must he express, and will not be implied against either by general or special covenants, but the waiver may be in the mortgage. 21 Ill. 40; 23 Ill. 536.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-6\" pgmap=\"518\">The cases of Ely v. Eastwood, 26 Ill. 107, and Smith v. Gore, 26 Ill. 150, have no application here, because those cases were decided under the law of 1851, without reference to the law of 1857, which makes the \u201c signature and acknowledgment \u201d of the wife a condition to the alienation of the homestead ; and for the further reason, that in those cases the creditor was not invoking the process or order of any court, but simply pursuing his rights under a power of sale\u2014making the cases analogous to a sale by an attorney in fact, under a power of attorney, in which case, the act of the attorney or trustee is the act of the principal, and as a conveyance, would bind him and those claiming under him. Since the act of 1857, the wife\u2019s rights are not held under her husband, but by the law, the same as the husband himself.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-7\" pgmap=\"518\">To present the question properly before this court, the appellant should have moved for a new trial in the court below, and on refusal to grant the same, have excepted.</p> <opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b518-8\" pgmap=\"518\">Caton, C. J.</author> <p id=\"AX8\" pgmap=\"518(103) 519(273)\">This was an action of ejectment, upon a mortgage executed by the husband and wife upon the homestead, without any release or waiver of the homestead right, and the question is, can the homestead right be claimed in an action of ejectment? It would undoubtedly be very difficult to do this under the law of 1851. That law only exempted the homestead from levy and forced sale, and the first section provides, \u201c And no release or waiver of such exemption shall be valid, unless the same shall be in writing, subscribed by such householdei-, and acknowledged in the same manner as conveyances of real estate are required to be acknowledged.\u201d Thus the law remained, until it was amended in 1857, as follows : \u201c That the first section of \u00a3 An Act to exempt homesteads from sale on execution,\u2019 approved February 11, 1851, be amended by inserting after the words, \u00a3 subscribed by such householder,\u2019 the words, \u00a3 and his wife, if he has one,\u2019 it being the object of this act to require, in all cases, the signature and acknowledgment of the wife, as conditions to the alienation of the homestead.\u201d This amendment does something more than merely make it necessary for the wife to join in the release of the homestead right. It goes further, and cuts up by the roots all alienations of the homestead, in which she does not sign and acknowledge a release of the homestead right. This is made a condition to the validity of all alienations of the homestead, whether by deed of bargain and sale, or mortgage. There was no such release of the homestead right signed and acknowledged by the wife, accompanying this mortgage, and without that, this statute, in substance, declares it to be invalid, and this reduces the case to the simple question, can the plaintiff recover upon an invalid conveyance? This question is so easy, that it answers itself. By annexing this condition, the legislature determined that it should not be binding in law without it, and consequently it creates no rights as a conveyance, and it is only as a conveyance that the plaintiff treats it when he attempts to recover upon it in ejectment.</p> <p id=\"b519-5\" pgmap=\"519\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b519-6\" pgmap=\"519\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
