Its jurisdiction was no greater than that of the. justice. See 2 Gilm. 335 ; Ballard v. McCarty, 11 Ill. 401; 12 Ill. 456.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-17\" pgmap=\"529\">This was a suit on a common law obligation, in the name of the payees of the bond, and the judgment must of necessity be for the full amount of the bond, and, that amount being $1,000, the justice could not render judgment therefor, for want of jurisdiction. See Purple\u2019s Statutes, chapter entitled Justices and Constables, sec. 17.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-18\" pgmap=\"529(21) 530(12)\">That this was a mere common law obligation, or was not a statutory bond required of the constable, see Purple\u2019s Statutes, chapter entitled Justices and Constables, sec. 11. Also, see 14 Ill. 72.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-5\" pgmap=\"530\">The bond mentioned in section eleven was to be payable to the county commissioners. This bond is payable to Samuel S. Gilbert and others, personally. 14 Ill. 72. That was given to the county commissioners in their official capacity. See section 11, chapter entitled Justices and Constables. This is given and payable to Gilbert and others as individuals. See same authorities.</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-6\" pgmap=\"530\">This not being a statutory bond, the penalty sought to be recovered in this suit as damages, and so given by the Circuit Court, could not be recovered in this suit. The court had no jurisdiction to render such judgment, and should, therefore, have excluded the evidence of McDaniel and Cotter in regard to the non-return of the executions delivered to Hall by them.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-7\" pgmap=\"530\">The statute imposing the forfeiture for not returning executions, like all penal statutes, is to be strictly construed, and no mere forfeiture or penalty inflicted on a constable could be held to be covered by the bond; and as there is no evidence whatever that the failure of the constable, Hall, to return the executions, mentioned in said witnesses\u2019 evidence, caused the parties, for whose use the suit was brought, any damage, their evidence was not admissible, and should have been excluded, and judgment should have been given for the defendants. The amount claimed is purely a forfeiture, for whether there be any damage, real or not, yet the amount of the execution which is not returned within ten days after its return day, is the amount of damages to be awarded, if anything.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-8\" pgmap=\"530\">The giving of a bond by the constable to secure the rights of persons entrusting business to his care, if given to any other than the person designated by the statute, could only be a common law obligation, and could then only entitle parties to sue thereon who had been injured by his misconduct.</p><attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-9\" pgmap=\"530\">Stuart, Edwards &amp; Brown, and C.

Hamilton, in the county of Macoupin, and State of Illinois, are held and firmly bound to Samuel S. Gilbert, County Judge, George A. W.

Sealed with our seals, and dated at Carlinville, this 14th day of November, A.

HAMILTON, [i. s.]\u201d</p> <p id=\"b531-11\" pgmap=\"531\">This bond the court below admitted in evidence as an official statutory bond, and this presents the only question in this case.</p> <p id=\"b531-12\" pgmap=\"531(32) 532(209)\">This case is not within the decision of Long v. Scott County, 27 Ill. 383. There we held that the official bonds of constables should be payable to the County Court. That bond was payable to \u201c William Leighton, Robert Husband and Jesse Husted, county justices, together constituting the County Court of Scott county, and State of Illinois, and their successors in office, for the use of the people of the State of Illinois.\u201d We there held, following the case of Frazier v. Laughlin, 1 Gilm. 347, that the bond was payable to the County Court, and that the names of the justices constituting the County Court might be rejected as surplusage. Here there is nothing to show that the officers named constituted the County Court. We know that the County Court is composed of the county judge, and two justices of the county designated in a particular mode for that purpose. But there is nothing to show that these two justices were designated for that purpose. For aught that appears these justices may have been just common ordinary justices of the peace. While we are disposed by every reasonable intendment to sustain bonds of this kind, and to overlook want of form, we must still require the substance of the demands of the statute. Here we cannot hold that this bond is payable to the County Court of Macoupin county, or that the obligees named constitute that court.</p> <p id=\"b532-5\" pgmap=\"532\">Admitting this to be a good common law bond does not help the case, for then it was not within the jurisdiction of a ustice of the peace. It is only of statutory bonds that the statute confers jurisdiction upon justices of the peace where the penalty exceeds one hundred dollars.</p> <p id=\"b532-6\" pgmap=\"532\">The court erred in admitting the bond in evidence. The judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b532-7\" pgmap=\"532\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
