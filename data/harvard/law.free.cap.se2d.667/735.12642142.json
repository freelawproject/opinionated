On August 11, 2003, John R. Wilson was employed as a conductor for the Norfolk and Portsmouth Belt Line Railroad Company (Belt Line), his employer for nearly 30 years. At the time of his injury, Wilson was riding on the side of a railroad boxcar that was moving along a switching track. The track ran parallel to a chain link fence, eight feet tall, supported by two-inch steel posts anchored in concrete. Wilson's purpose was to couple the boxcar he was riding to another car that was stationary on the same track. For most of its length, the fence was located approximately eight feet away from the centerline of the track, but one of the posts supporting the fence was bent inward, toward the track, one to two feet, a condition that had existed for more than two years at the time of Wilson's injury. As the car Wilson was riding passed the bent post, his left upper arm, near the shoulder, struck it, resulting in his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wilson brought this FELA action against the Belt Line, alleging that the Belt Line's business and his duties were in furtherance of interstate commerce and that the Belt Line had been negligent in failing to provide him a safe workplace. Specifically, he contended that the Belt Line had failed in its duty properly to inspect and maintain its track and right-of-way, and to eliminate dangerous \"close clearances\" along the track.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, Wilson introduced the testimony of Raymond A. Duffany, who qualified as an expert witness on the prevailing practices and safety standards in the railroad industry nationwide with respect to \"close clearances.\" Duffany testified that because railroad workers must often ride on the sides of rail cars in the course of their work, eight feet from the centerline of the track to any adjacent fixed object was the \"absolute minimum\" for safe clearance and that any distance less than eight feet would be a \"close clearance\" and \"very dangerous, life-threatening.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Over the Belt Line's objection, Duffany testified that, although Virginia has no law governing such clearances, 38 other states have such laws, that none of those laws permit clearances less than eight feet, and that 29 of those 38 state laws require clearances greater than eight feet. The Belt Line moved the court to strike Duffany's testimony regarding the laws of other states as\n   having no relevance to the law of Virginia but likely misleading the jury to think that those foreign laws governed the safety standard prevailing in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At Wilson's request, the court granted Instruction No. 41, which told the jury, \"You may consider custom and usage in the railroad industry\n   <em>\n    and close clearance laws in other jurisdictions\n   </em>\n   as evidence of what may be reasonable in a given situation, but are free to give this evidence whatever weight you [may choose] to give it. You must decide what was reasonable under the circumstances of this case based upon all of the evidence as you find it.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The jury returned a verdict for Wilson in the amount of $330,000, upon which the court entered final judgment. We awarded the Belt Line an appeal. The Belt Line asserts four assignments of error: (1) Admission of evidence concerning the \"close clearance\" laws of states other than Virginia, (2) admission of Duffany's expert testimony despite the plaintiff's failure to comply fully with the expert disclosure requirements of Rule 4:1(b)(4)(A), (3) admission of Duffany's testimony without requiring a foundation for opinions regarding close clearance practices in Virginia, and (4) admission of evidence of conditions that did not cause the plaintiff's injury. This fourth assignment of error relates to the court's admission, over the Belt Line's objection, of evidence that some additional sections of the fence and its supporting posts, beyond the point of Wilson's impact, were less than eight feet from the centerline of the track even though those sections were upright and undamaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Generally, we review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence using an abuse of discretion standard and, on appeal, will not disturb a trial court's decision to admit evidence absent a finding of abuse of that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    John Crane, Inc. v.

While it is undisputed that Virginia has no statute regulating close clearances along railroad tracks, Wilson contends that under Virginia law as well as under the FELA, a railroad company has a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of its employees, which includes the duty to provide them a reasonably safe place in which to work. Wilson argues that the standard by which that duty is measured with respect to close clearances is a nationwide standard fixed by the prevailing practice in the railroad industry. The statutes of 38 states on the subject of close clearances, Wilson contends, are illustrative of the prevailing standard and relevant to prove its existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Inapplicable statutes are, in most circumstances, irrelevant to the proof of the standard of care in a negligence case.

The animal jumped out of the enclosure and ran into the plaintiff, injuring him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.E.2d%20805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.E.2d%20805\">\n    at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.E.2d%20805\">\n    96 S.E.2d at 807-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The stockyard owner argued that he was absolved from negligence because the evidence showed that all his fences were \"lawful,\" in that they were at least five feet high, bringing them into compliance with the then applicable provisions of former Code \u00a7\u00a7 8-866 to 8-905. This Court held that the statutes were irrelevant to the stockyard owner's duty to exercise ordinary care because they were inapplicable. The Court wrote: \"A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   complete answer to this line of argument is that [those] statutory provisions, dealing with lawful fences and the trespass of stock[,] are applicable within counties and not applicable within cities and towns.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2058583\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/198/861/\">\n    198 Va. at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.E.2d%20805\">\n    96 S.E.2d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A statute that establishes a standard of conduct may be considered as evidence of negligence on behalf of one for whose benefit it was enacted, if its breach was a proximate cause of the injury of which he complains.\n   <em>\n    See McGuire v.

The plaintiff, injured by the breaking glass of a bathtub enclosure, contended that the defendant landlord had violated a duty to exercise ordinary care by failing to install tempered safety glass or plastic instead of the ordinary glass that caused his injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20502\">\n    at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff presented evidence that such safer materials had been available for over 20 years and that their use had, long before his injury, become the prevailing custom and usage in the local building industry. The plaintiff also offered, and the trial court admitted in evidence, two New York statutes mandating the use of shatterproof glazing materials for bathtub enclosures. The statutes applied only prospectively and did not affect the landlord's property, which was built before the statutes' effective date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20502\">\n    at 503-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statutes, however, were admitted as evidence of the industry standard. The trial court instructed the jury that evidence relating to custom and usage was not alone conclusive, but that the issue before them was \"the reasonableness of the defendant's conduct under all of the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20502\">\n    at 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that even though the plaintiff had presented evidence of custom and usage sufficient to take the case to the jury, and even though the jury had been correctly instructed, the admission of the inapplicable statutes into the case was reversible error. The statutes protected those whose shower glazing was installed after the effective dates of the statutes, a class to which the plaintiff did not belong. The court commented: \"[I]t cannot be said that the statutes, once injected into the adversarial conflict, did not prejudice the defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20502\">\n    at 506-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Statutory law, as the considered judgment of the elected representatives of the people, properly commands the respect of jurors. Evidence of statutory law that does not apply to the case on trial, but seems to support the position of one party, is likely to be both misleading to the jury and prejudicial to the opposing party. We agree with the courts that have considered the question and hold that inapplicable statutes are inadmissible as proof of the standard of reasonable conduct in a negligence case. For that reason, we will reverse the judgment and remand the case to the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Belt Line's second assignment of error, relating to inadequate pretrial disclosure of Duffany's expert testimony, is rendered moot by the reversal of the case. If Duffany should testify in future proceedings, the substance of his evidence has now been fully disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We find no merit in the Belt Line's third assignment of error, relating to Duffany's foundation for expert opinion as to the prevailing industry standard for close clearances in Virginia. Duffany expressed the opinion that the same standard prevailed in all states and he explained that standard in detail. That was a sufficient foundation for his opinion.\n   <em>\n    See Christian v.
