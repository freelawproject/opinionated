Eastern Greyhound Lines, 138 NLRB 8 (1962); 143 NLRB No. 71 (1963). The single question involved is whether Eastern\u2019s dispatchers are \u201csupervisors\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S. G.A. \u00a7 152(11). If they are, Section 14 (a) of the Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 164(a), relieves Eastern of the duty to bargain with a union as their representative. This Court has previously affirmed a District Court order dismissing Eastern\u2019s action brought to enjoin the election ordered by the Board. Eastern Greyhound Lines v. Fusco, 323 F.2d 477 (C.A. 6, 1963). We there held that Eastern could challenge the finding that its dispatchers were not supervisors only by refusing to bargain with the certified union, and obtaining here a review of an unfair labor practice order based on its refusal. Such review is provided by Sections 9(d) and 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 159(d), 160(e). Pursuant to such sections, the matter is now before us for decision on the merits. We conclude that Eastern\u2019s dispatchers are \u201csupervisors\u201d and the Board\u2019s contrary finding and order must be set aside and denied enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Eastern operates an interstate bus service in nineteen states and the District of Columbia, as well as in two Canadian Provinces (the dispatchers in Canada are not employed by Eastern, and are not here involved). Immediate direction of its daily bus operations and as many as 3,000 drivers is in the hands of its approximately 121 dispatchers and four assistant dispatchers, whose overall functions are best described by reproducing extensive portions of the: Board\u2019s first opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">\u201cThe primary function of the dispatchers is to dispatch buses and drivers in accordance with company schedules and anticipated needs for-extra service. They ai'e also required to forecast needs, make sufficient use of equipment and manpower, sign drivers\u2019 pay slips, handle-drivers\u2019 bids, report infractions of rules by drivers, prepare clerical reports relating to traffic and equipment, receive telephone reports of' accidents, notify proper authorities, thereof, and maintain liaison with and coordinate with other dispatch:points regarding additional needs- and the availability of men and equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">\u201c * * * The evidence indicates-that in cases of major violations the-dispatcher tells the driver to see the-superintendent, thus \u2018removing him from service\u2019 until a decision is made-by the higher official.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">\u201c * * * Dispatchers assign, equipment, call extra men to work when needed, and allocate available work to drivers. * * * The-number of extra drivers called to-work by the dispatcher is based on his determination of what is required to adequately maintain and' protect service to passengers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">\u201c* * * [Dispatchers\u2019] duties include selection of proper equipment,, obtaining and dispatching extra men- and equipment to other locations as-needed, supervising the bidding on-runs, assigning equipment to men: and giving them special operating in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>\u25a0struetions, determining that a driver is in a fit physical and mental condition to operate his run, overseeing \u2022the loading of buses, granting permission for days off, approving pay slips, determining what regular driver will be used if needed when a supply of extra drivers is exhausted, \u25a0controlling work of extra drivers in determining whether to put them on extra sections, charters, or 'deadheading\u2019 [footnote 9] them, and in \u2022determining need for \u2018protection\u2019 [footnote 10] * * * they may \u2022cancel runs or delay departures, enforce safety rules and regulations, and \u2018take charge\u2019 when an accident \u25a0occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">\u201c9. \u2018Deadheading a man\u2019 is sending him to another location in an empty bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201c10. Men on \u2018protection\u2019 are in a standby capacity in case they are needed to handle additional runs.\u201d 138 NLRB 10-12</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">From the foregoing, and without more, we indeed gain an immediate impression that Eastern\u2019s dispatchers are supervisors within the ordinary acceptation of that term. The evidence showed that in some places Eastern\u2019s terminals and its buses are in operation all day and all night. Dispatchers operate in three shifts so that one of them is in service at all hours. In the late night and the early morning hours there are generally no personnel with authority higher than that of a dispatcher on duty. If dispatchers are not supervisors, this multistate transportation system operates a substantial part of the time without supervision. We must decide, however, whether an Eastern dispatcher fits the statutory definition of a supervisor. In the categories relevant to the question here, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">\u201cThe term \u2018supervisor\u2019 means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to * * * <em>suspend </em>* * * <em>assign </em>* * * <em>or discipline </em>other employees, or responsibly to <em>direct them, </em>* * * <em>or effectively to recommend such action, </em>if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(11).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Disagreement between Eastern and the Board centers primarily on the actual existence and exercise of supervisory powers theoretically accorded and delegated dispatchers in the relevant \u201cjob description\u201d and on the question whether dispatchers are required to exercise \u201cindependent judgment\u201d in discharging such otherwise supervisory functions as they actually perform. In arriving at its conclusion, the Board reviewed the various higher levels of supervisory authority in Eastern\u2019s table of organization and emphasized that dispatchers\u2019 authority flows from and is carried out in obedience to instructions given by such higher authority. In the beginning consideration of the issue involved, the Board\u2019s field examiner took occasion to say that \u201cIt was the union\u2019s position that any authority exercised by the dispatchers is <em>delegated. </em>* * * \u201d We are persuaded that giving importance to this observation led the Board into a continuing misapprehension of the question it was to decide. The effective exercise of authority is nonetheless supervisory because it is a delegated authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">It is not necessary that we evaluate each function exercised or exercisable by the dispatchers which Eastern contends accords them supervisory status. If they possess any one of the criteria set out in the statute, they meet the test. Soon after the enactment of Section 2 (11), opinions of this Court established that an individual is a supervisor if he possesses any one of the powers there described to be exercised in his independent judgment. N. L. R. B. v. Edward G. Budd Mfg. Co., 169 F.2d 571 (CA 6, 1948) , cert. denied sub nom. Foreman\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Edward G. Budd Mfg. Co., 338 U.S. 908, 69 S.Ct. 411, 93 L.Ed. 441 (1949); Ohio Power Co. v. N. L. R. B., 176 F.2d 385, 11 A.L.R.2d 243 (CA 6, 1949) , cert. denied, 338 U.S. 899, 70 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>249, 94 L.Ed. 553 (1949). We are compelled to conclude that Eastern\u2019s dispatchers are made supervisors by at least two of their functions, the power to \u201csuspend\u201d and the power \u201ceffectively to recommend\u201d discipline of an employee. The Board\u2019s contrary finding is, on our view of the record as a whole, without support by substantial evidence. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">(1) <em>Power to Suspend.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Notwithstanding some attempt at qualification, the Board found as a fact that it is part of a dispatcher\u2019s authority and duties to order a driver off a bus for misconduct. Such misconduct included insubordination. The Board\u2019s brief to this Court avers, \u201cFor major infractions, such as intoxication or insubordination, the dispatcher tells the driver to see the transportation superintendent or some other management official for a determination of the action to be taken.\u201d This instruction operates to \u201cremove the driver from service\u201d \u2014 he is suspended pending final determination of appropriate discipline. It is true that the dispatcher\u2019s removal of a driver for an infraction is not the final action, as the dispatcher\u2019s removal of a driver from service is controlling only \u201cuntil a decision is made by the higher official.\u201d But it is the dispatcher who must, in his independent judgment, make the initial on-the-spot decision that the circumstances require taking a driver off a bus. It is not claimed that such commands by a dispatcher are not obeyed. While the dispatcher\u2019s action is responsible for suspending the driver only until higher authority reviews its propriety, this does not make the driver any the less suspended by the dispatcher\u2019s action. In its address to us, the Board characterizes such action as a \u201csimple ministerial act, capable of performance by any rank and file employee.\u201d We are unable to accept this ipse dixit as a substitute for substantial evidence. Neither can we accept the easy assertion that \u201cIt lacks any element of responsible direction of employees, and is in no way indicative of. supervisory status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">2) <em>Recommendation of Discipline.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Eastern has promulgated a join description applicable to its dispatchers.. It provides that the dispatcher \u201cMaintains discipline and order among drivers; removes drivers from service for infraction of company policies rules and regulations; recommends disciplinary action to be taken for such infractions.\u201d The' Board recognized that \u201cthe actual existence of supervisory authority rather than, its exercise is controlling.\u201d Such recognition accords with this Court\u2019s decisions in Ohio Power Co. v. N. L. R. B., and N. L. R. B. v. Edward G. Budd Mfg. Co., supra. It is clear that the quoted' job description clearly authorizes and requires the dispatchers to recommend discipline, but the Board expresses a view that \u201cthe absence of exercise of authority may negative its existence.\u201d We are not, sure what is meant by this observation because there really is no dispute concerning both the power and the duty off the dispatcher to recommend discipline.. None of the dispatchers called as witnesses for the union or Eastern denied that it, was his duty to make recommendations, of discipline. The Board, however, denies the dispatchers\u2019 authority to effectively recommend discipline. For this, position, it relies upon the fact that some \u2022 dispatchers said they did not make such recommendations, that some recom- \u2022 mendations were not followed, and that. some dispatchers felt that without access. to the personnel files of the drivers in- \u25a0 volved they could not make appropriate recommendati ons.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Dispatchers are provided with forms. for reporting infractions of driver rules with a space for recommending discipline. Eastern introduced a quite substantial number of completed forms bear- \u2022 ing such recommendations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u25a0cipline finally meted out in most of these -cases corresponded closely with the dispatchers\u2019 recommendations. Eastern\u2019s President, its Director of Industrial Relations and two dispatchers expressly testified that dispatchers\u2019 recommendations \u2022were effective.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The Board rejected the evidence relating to the effective power to recommend discipline on several grounds. It noted '.that dispatchers do not ordinarily have access to drivers\u2019 personnel files, that an independent investigation is made by higher supervisory officials before finally .determining what discipline to impose, .\u2022and stated that \u201cthere is no probative \u25a0evidence that any weight is given to a \u2022dispatcher\u2019s recommendations.\u201d It con-cluded that \u201cunder all the circumstances * * * such recommendations are not \u2018effective\u2019 within the meaning of the Act,\u201d citing two of its own cases where employee recommendations were subject to independent investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">It is true that dispatchers do not ordinarily have access to drivers\u2019 personnel files, and two dispatchers testified that they refused to make disciplinary recommendations because they felt unable to \u25a0do so without such information. Similarly, it is a fact that an independent investigation is made by higher supervisory \u00abemployees before dispatcher recommendations are finally accepted. In its 'brief to this Court, the Board argues '.from these facts to the conclusion that \u201cit is inconceivable that the Company would give any meaningful weight to the dispatcher\u2019s recommendation. * * * \u201d We are unable to attach such effect to these facts. That some dispatchers shirked their acknowledged duty to recommend discipline is not substantial evidence that such power did not exist or was never exercised in face of the clear evidence that many other dispatchers did exercise their power. That dispatchers have no access to personnel files does have some bearing on the degree of effectiveness of their recommendations, but this fact is at least offset by testimony that dispatcher recommendations are given great weight because they are the only persons in daily contact with the drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-18\">Even the occasions when the particular style and extent of the discipline recommended were not carried out do not support a conclusion that the recommendation was not effective. If <em>some </em>discipline was meted out, the recommendation that <em>discipline </em>be imposed was effective. We do not believe that the circumstance that dispatcher recommendations are subject to independent investigation before final action detracts from this fact. Indeed the Fifth Circuit has suggested that \u201c[t]he very fact that the Employer considered that these recommendations justified the time and expense of an investigation reflects the substantial significance attached to them.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Southern Airways Co., 290 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>2d 519, 524 (CA 5, 1961). We cannot accept the ambiguous implications possibly raised by such investigation and the circumstances already noted as substantial evidence sufficient to support rejection of the strong evidence that dispatchers\u2019 recommendations are effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"> As already noted, the Board accompanied its findings with the statement that \u201cthere is no probative evidence that any weight is given to a dispatcher\u2019s recommendations.\u201d While this statement hardly reflects the \u201cclarity\u201d by which the exercise of administrative power is \u201cbest vindicated,\u201d Phelps Dodge Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 313 U.S. 177, 197, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271, 1284 (1941), it might be taken as expressive of a refusal to credit the positive testimony already noted. In its brief to this Court, however, the Board as asserted that the coincidence between actual and recommended discipline is not controlling, since:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">\u201c -x- -x- * js a time-honored rule of logic that correlation does not prove causation; and causation is the crucial element here. The focus is on what weight the dispatcher\u2019s l\u2019ecommendation carries with management in determining discipline. <em>And on this point the Company failed to produce any evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">From this we can only conclude that the Board simply ignored the testimony contrary to its conclusion. But even if we assume the Board considered and intentionally discredited such testimony, we are unable to accept its determination. We recognize that ordinarily the credibility of witnesses is a matter to be determined by the Board and its hearing officers rather than a reviewing court. Compare N. L. R. B. v. Walton Mfg. Co., 369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829 (1962) (per curiam). This legal generality, however, does not relieve us from exercising the powers or performing the duties that are ours under the substantial evidence rule as declared by the Supreme Court in Universal Camera. \u25a0 We have recently reviewed the relevant cases and announced that \u201c[i]n a proper case-this Court may decline to follow the-action of an examiner in crediting and discrediting testimony, even though the-Board has adopted the Examiner\u2019s findings.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Elias Bros. Big Boy, Inc., 327 F.2d 421, 426 (CA 6, 1964). For emphasis, we repeat the-Board\u2019s statement that \u201cthere is no probative evidence that any weight is given to a dispatcher\u2019s recommendations,\u201d and-the assertion in its brief in this Court that \u201con this point [the weight accorded dispatchers\u2019 recommendations] the company failed to produce <em>any evidence.\u201d </em>In view of the clear fact that there is-substantial oral and documentary evidence supporting the company\u2019s position-in this regard, we can only guess that the quoted statements are the Board\u2019s way of saying that the company\u2019s testimony was completely incredible. If so, neither the Board nor the Examiner who received the evidence has given expression to any reason for finding cogent evidence incredible. Assuming the Board meant to do so, we cannot conscientiously follow its lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">To recapitulate, our starting point for this determination is the clear fact that the testimony sought to be discredited is uncontradicted by any direct showing, testimonial or otherwise. This fact is not sufficient to conclude our inquiry, however, since we would not presume to bind the Board to accept interested testimony simply because it remains formally uncontradicted, see N. L. R. B. v. Radcliffe, 211 F.2d 309, 315 (CA 9, 1954), cert. denied sub nom. Homedale Tractor &amp; Equipment Co. v. N. L. R. B., 348 U.S. 833, 75 S.Ct. 56, 99 L.Ed. 657 (1954). But see N. L. R. B. v. Ray Smith Transp. Co., 193 F.2d 142, 146 (CA <em>5, </em>1951); cf. N. L. R. B. v. Cleveland Trust Co., 214 F.2d 95, 98 (CA 6, 1954). Tenuous support for the Board\u2019s assumed rejection of this testimony, moreover, may be claimed in the circumstance that an independent investigation is made following dispatcher recommendations, and possibly also in the circumstance that a few dispatchers do not discharge their duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>to make recommendations. But against these circumstances and the interest of the witnesses must be set not only the fact that Eastern\u2019s President, Director of Industrial Relations and dispatchers are the persons most likely to know what effect the recommendations have, but also \u25a0the important fact that Eastern adduced .a very substantial number of completed forms of unquestioned authenticity, showing a very high correlation between recommendation and actual discipline. Together with the uncontradicted duties of the dispatchers which make it highly plausible, this showing is strong enough that we cannot allow it to be dismissed with an unexplained statement that no \u25a0probative evidence has been introduced. .'Some cogent reason would have to be advanced to offset the showing thus made, .and no such reason has been advanced by \"the Board, either in its opinion or in its \u2022\u2022addresses to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The order of the Board is set aside and \u00abdenied enforcement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\">. A company representative produced a representative group of 19 discipline reports which he had selected from approximately 100 similar reports that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>brought to the hearing with him. He testified that he had boxes full of similar reports at his office. This testimony was neither challenged nor claimed to be incredible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\">. President Shaffer testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">\u201cQ.
