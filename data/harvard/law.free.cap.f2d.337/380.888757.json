The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to justify submission of the-case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\"> After a careful review of the record, we have concluded that the conviction of Richard Hopkins should be affirmed, but that the conviction of Glenn Hopkins must be reversed for insufficient evidence. The only substantial evidence against Glenn Hopkins was that his truck and his wife\u2019s car were found' parked on a dirt road leading to his-house along with two other vehicles-containing illegal liquor. No illegal liquor was found in Glenn Hopkins\u20191 vehicles, and there was evidence that-the vehicles were often parked at that spot when weather conditions made the-dirt road impassable beyond that point. Where convictions are based solely on circumstantial evidence, the test to-be applied is whether the jury might, reasonably conclude that the evidence excluded every reasonable hypothesis except, that of guilt. Riggs v. United States, 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 949, and Clark v. United States, 5 Cir., 1961, 293 F.2d 445. As to Glenn Hopkins, this test has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">The conviction of Richard Hopkins is-affirmed; that of Glenn Hopkins is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
