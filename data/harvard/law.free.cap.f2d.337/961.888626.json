Ferenczi, et al., Bergen Point Iron Works, 3 Cir., 337 F.2d 956, decided this day. In that case the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey allowed in part and denied in part Bergen Point Iron Works\u2019 claim for just compensation for the taking by the United States of a right of way for a double pipeline over a certain tract of land, some of which was under Newark Bay in New Jersey. The State of New Jersey has appealed from the portion of the District Court\u2019s judgment denying compensation. Since it has been established that Bergen Point Iron Works was the owner of the land in question, (a fact which is not contested here), and the State of New Jersey has admitted receiving compensation, the amount of which it does not question as being unjust, for the remaining right of way under Hudson Bay from the United States, that State is not entitled to any compensation for the condemned right of way over that tract of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-20\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
