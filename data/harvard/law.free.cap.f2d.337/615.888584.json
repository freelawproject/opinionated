There was ample evidence to justify the District Court\u2019s findings that this was proximately caused by specific, and spectacular, acts of negligence on the part of military personnel and not, as the Government contends, wholly that of the service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>station attendant. Assuming that by reason of the location of the non-spark proof electric motor near the floor of the wash rack room, there was a violation of a local city electrical ordinance constituting contributory negligence per se, the evidence was not such as to compel a finding of proximate cause or overturn the implied finding by the District Court to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The Government therefore fails in every attack on the substantive merits of the case. The Appellees, however, concede that there was a technical error as to interest, and the judgment is therefore modified to provide interest from the date of the filing of the transcript of the judgment in the General Accounting Office to the date of the mandate of affirmance as required by the Act of July 27, 1956, ch. 748, \u00a7 1302, 70 Stat. 694, as amended, 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 724a (Supp. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
