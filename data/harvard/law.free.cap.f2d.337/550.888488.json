He was given a general sentence under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He does not press the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>appeal from his conviction of housebreaking, which is affirmed, and he does not challenge the sentence. He does contend that his conviction on the count charging grand larceny cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In our view the evidence of value of the articles involved in the charge of grand larceny is inadequate to sustain the finding of the jury that they were of the value of $100.00 or upward. For this reason the grand larceny conviction must be reversed, though the sentence remains unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-26\">. The sentence portion of the judgment reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b602-27\">It Is Ajuuged that the defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative pursuant to Section 5010(b), Title 18 of the U.S.Oode under the provisions of the Federal Youth Corrections Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
