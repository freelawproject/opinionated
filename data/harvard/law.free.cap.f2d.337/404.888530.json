In open court plaintiff withdrew any claim for malpractice, leaving only the claim that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by a fall from a defective wheel chair provided by defendant. The record amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the X-rays clearly establish that the slipping of the Smith-Peterson nail took place before plaintiff\u2019s alleged fall and that the alleged fall was not the proximate cause of the injuries which plaintiff claimed to have .suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">The motion to strike defendant\u2019s answer made on the day of trial was prop\u25a0erly denied. No request was made to take the testimony of the operating surgeon, Dr. Jackson, or for an adjournment \u25a0 of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">Subsequent to trial, plaintiff moved to .set aside the judgment or, in the alternative, for a new trial. Rule 59, F.R.Civ.P. Plaintiff failed to show any prejudice caused by the absence of the operating surgeon. He had voluntarily withdrawn his claim for malpractice and had the testimony of his own medical expert both as to operative procedures and the X-rays.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
