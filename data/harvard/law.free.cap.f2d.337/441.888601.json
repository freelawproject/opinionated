Robbin &amp; Company, hereinafter called \u201cRobbin,\u201d seeks review of a cease and desist order of the respondent, the Federal Trade Commission, on the ground that the Commission\u2019s finding of violations of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1191 <em>et seq.) </em>and of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 41 <em>et </em>seq.) in itself does not warrant the issuance of such an order and that in any event the order exceeds the scope of the Commission\u2019s remedial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Robbin is a small jobber in the wholesale and retail sale of fabrics in Chicago, with about 3% of its business involving sales of a tulle veil netting called \u201cbridal illusion\u201d which Robbin acquires by direct import from a French manufacturer, Aime Baboin of Paris, and from Gilmore Trading Company of New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Robbin admits that two swatches of this fabric submitted to the Commission\u2019s investigator for testing did not meet the standards of the Flammable Fabrics Act. However, Robbin states that immediately afterward advice was requested by telephone and letter from the Commission concerning procedures to be followed, and that the following letter was received:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u201cNovember 27, 1961</p>\n<p id=\"AuV\">\u201cHDS</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u201cMr. A1 Robbin,</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u201cA. Robbin &amp; Co.,</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">\u201c321 Jackson Boulevard,</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">\"Chicago, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">\u201cDear Mr. Robbin:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">\u201cReference is made to the conversation had with you today concerning the importation of approximately 100 pieces of bridal illusion of approximately 40 yards each.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">\u201cThe purpose of the tests mentioned in the Flammable Fabrics Act is to determine whether the goods are so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals. Also, if a guaranty is given it must be based upon reasonable and representative tests as prescribed in Rule 7 of the Regulations under the Flammable Fabrics Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">\u201cBy testing ten percent of the pieces, assuming them to pass, this would be sufficient under Rule 7 for the giving of a guaranty. I understand four lots are involved and there should be representative samples from each lot. Of course, as to each piece of fabric, whether it is dangerously flammable, it must stand on its own merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-16\">\u201cSincerely yours,</p>\n<p id=\"b494-17\">\u201cHenry D. Stringer,</p>\n<p id=\"b494-18\">\u201cAssistant Director,</p>\n<p id=\"b494-19\">\u201cBureau of Textiles and Furs.</p>\n<p id=\"ASV\">\u201cHDS :ab\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-20\">Robbin asserts that tests of 10% of the pieces were thereafter made as suggested, by the United States Testing Company, and that all bridal illusion thereafter purchased has been warx-anted by the supplier to comply with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-21\">The Commission nevertheless charged Robbin with importing and subsequently selling and transporting in interstate-commerce fabric which under the Flammable Fabrics Act was so highly flammable as to be dangerous when wox-n by individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-22\">Robbin\u2019s substituted answer submitted, during the course of the resulting hearing x-eads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-23\">\u201cCOMES&gt; NOW respondent A1 Robbin, an individual trading as A.. Robbin &amp; Company and answering' the complaint in this proceeding, states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-24\">\u201cThat he elects not to further contest the allegations of fact set foxThin the complaint, and that in accordance with Section 4.5(b) (2) of the? Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Rule\u00a9 of Practice he admits all material allegations of the complaint to be true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-25\">Robbin contends that the Commission is relying solely on the initial two swatches submitted before installation of the new px-ocedures, but the results of Robbin\u2019s own tests of 10% of its later shipments, exhibited in the hearing before the Commission, showed that despite the guaranty, some samples of the Aime Baboin fabxic failed the flammability test.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-26\">Although Robbin destx'oyed that part of the tested 10% which failed to pass, all of the 90% of untested fabric was evidently sold without any further testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The Commission found that those procedures adopted by Robbin after the investigation began were not sufficient to protect the purchasing public and concluded that there had been no abandonment or discontinuance of the practices \u25a0charged in the complaint, and admitted 'by the answer of Robbin.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The Commission issued its Order prohibiting Robbin from importing, selling, \u2022 or transporting for sale any fabrics so 'highly flammable, measured by statutory standards, as to be dangerous when worn by individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Robbin argues that the Commission -erred in disregarding the fact that Rob:bin complied fully with its suggested procedure for testing and in presuming that the procedure followed by Robbin would not follow the Flammable Fabrics Act intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Apart from the fact that the testing of \u25a0 only 10% is mentioned in the letter quoted above only in connection with giving \u2022a guaranty, the very letter on which Robbin relies says: \u201cBy testing ten percent of the pieces, <em>assuming them to :pass, </em>* * * \u201d [emphasis added]. \u25a0Robbin\u2019s tests did not show that all 10% -of the tested pieces passed. Nevertheless The remaining 90% was subjected to no ifurther testing before sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The guaranties on which Robbin relies, under \u00a7 8 of the Act, protect Robbin, as set out in \u00a7 8 itself, only against prosecution under \u00a7 7 of the Act which relates to willful violations of the Act, carrying penalties of fine and imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">The Commission has broad discretion in foi\u2019mulating its orders. See Niresk Industries Inc. v. F. T. C., 7 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 337, at page 343, cert. den. 364 U.S. 883, 81 S.Ct. 173, 5 L.Ed.2d 104, where this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">\u201cThe Commission has a large discretion in its choice of a remedy which it deems necessary to cope with the unlawful practices found, and the courts may interfere with the Commission\u2019s choice only if the remedy selected bears no reasonable relationship to such unlawful practices, [citing cases] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">\u201cWe think it is entirely reasonable for the Commission to frame its order broadly enough to prohibit petitioners\u2019 use of identical illegal practices for any purpose, or in conjunction with the sale of any and all products.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">Other fabrics sold by Robbin such as taffeta, organza and chiffon, have been found dangerously flammable in other cases. Joyeette Fabrics Corp., et al., 3 CCH Trade Reg.Rep. f[16,734, January 23, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">It was not unreasonable for the Commission to prohibit the sale of all flammable fabrics rather than to limit its order only to bridal illusion. Nor must the Commission proceed (as Robbin suggests) to restrain in toto the importation of any bridal illusion into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">The Commission\u2019s Order to cease and desist is affirmed and will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">Affirmed and enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
