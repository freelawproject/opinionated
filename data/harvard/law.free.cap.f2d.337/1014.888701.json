Since both parties concede that the marks and goods are so related that confusion is likely, the only remaining question is one of priority of trademark use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-23\">In 1943 Kanner-Wald Inc., a corporate predecessor of appellee Joseph Kanner Hat Company (hereinafter Kanner), obtained trademark Registration No. 403,-460 for HENLEY CLUB for men\u2019s hats, claiming use since early 1939. In 1951 appellee republished HENLEY CLUB under section 12 of the Trademark Act of 1946, disclaiming the word \u201cHenley\u201d apart from the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-24\">On July 25, 1956, The Joseph &amp; FeissCompany (hereinafter J &amp; F), appellant herein, filed application serial No. 12,813-for registration of HENLEY HOUSE for men\u2019s clothing, claiming use since-June 29 of that year. On December 3,, 1957, that application matured into Registration No. 655,275.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-25\">During the interim between J &amp; F\u2019s. filing and registration dates, however, Kanner\u2019s registration of HENLEY CLUB was canceled pursuant to section 8 of the Act. Kanner then filed, on April 21, 1959, application serial No. 71,956 for registration of HENLEY for men\u2019s hats, claiming, as did its predecessor, use since 1939. J &amp; F subsequently filed a notice-of opposition to this application, and Kanner countered with a petition for-cancellation of J &amp; F\u2019s HENLEY HOUSE registration. The Trademark. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>Trial and Appeal Board, in consolidated proceedings, dismissed appellant\u2019s opposition and ordered cancellation of the HENLEY HOUSE registration (reported at 136 USPQ 91). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">It is not challenged that J &amp; F\u2019s proofs are sufficient to show continued and widespread use of its mark HENLEY HOUSE since June 29, 1956. As noted above, the determination of the question here thus turns on the effect of the evidence introduced on behalf of Banner on the question of use of HENLEY CLUB and HENLEY. The board described that evidence in its initial opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-6\">\u201cJoseph Banner Hat Co., Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Banner) is a manufacturer of men\u2019s hats. Banner\u2019s vice-president, who has, since 1948, been fulltime with the company, a family business headed by his father, testified that prior to 1949 Banner used \u2018HENLEY CLUB\u2019 as a mark for men\u2019s hats and that since 1949, Banner has sold hats under the mark \u2018HENLEY\u2019. Banner, presently (testimony was taken on March 7, 1962), sells to but two customers, one of which operates a chain of men\u2019s shops, comprising five stores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-7\">\u201cThe president of the chain operator dealing in Banner\u2019s hats testified \"that his concern has been purchasing hats from Banner under either \u201c\u2018HENLEY CLUB\u2019 or \u2018HENLEY\u2019 for approximately twenty-five years; \u25a0that presently the hats bear the mark \u2018HENLEY\u2019; and that quite .a number of years ago, it was \u2018HENLEY CLUB\u2019. This witness was not definite as to when \u2018HENLEY\u2019 superseded \u2018HENLEY CLUB\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-8\">\u201cBanner\u2019s third witness, its general manager in charge of production and buying who has been with Banner and its predecessors for thirty-four years, testified that \u201c\u2018HENLEY\u2019 supplanted \u2018HENLEY CLUB\u2019 a \u2018good many years ago\u2019 and rthat \u2018HENLEY\u2019 was used as the mark in January 1956 and that Banner is still selling \u2018HENLEY\u2019 hats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-9\">\u201cA number of invoices from a lining manufacturer were introduced into evidence, apparently to show purchases by Banner of linings bearing the designation \u2018HENLEY\u2019 as of a date prior to June 1956. There is an inconsistency in that these invoices identify the linings purchased at the various times designated therein by \u2018HENLEY\u2019 and \u2018HENLEY CLUB\u2019, notwithstanding testimony that the latter was not used after 1949. A similar inconsistency appeared in other invoices and records placed into evidence by Banner. The explanation given by the officials who testified, is that the use of the term \u2018HENLEY CLUB\u2019 was used because of force of habit but that actually the linings of the hats bore the mark \u2018HENLEY\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">We find no manifest error in that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">While portions of the testimony relating to appellee\u2019s use of its mark are neither clear nor precise, we believe the record as a whole fairly supports the factual determinations made by the board. Factual findings of a lower tribunal are normally accepted unless clearly erroneous. Ranney v. Bridges, 188 F.2d 588, 596, 38 CCPA 1044, 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">Accordingly we must agree with the board wherein it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-13\">\u201cThat Banner is using the mark \u2018HENLEY\u2019 is evident even from J &amp; F\u2019s record. When Banner began its use of \u2018HENLEY\u2019 is in dispute. Banner contends its record clearly shows its use of \u2018HENLEY\u2019 since a date prior to June 29, 1956. * * * That these marks have been used interchangeably in such documents is apparent but it is clear from the testimony of the retailer of Banner\u2019s hats that they were never used concurrently, rather \u2018HENLEY\u2019 superseded \u2018HENLEY CLUB\u2019 without any hiatus period between their use. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>The oral testimony, however, is sufficient to show that Kanner\u2019s use of \u2018HENLEY\u2019 as part of \u2018HENLEY CLUB\u2019 and per se preceded J &amp; F\u2019s use of \u2018HENLEY HOUSE\u2019 and that such use has been continuous. Kanner\u2019s rights in \u2018HENLEY\u2019 are superior to J &amp; F\u2019s rights in \u2018HENLEY HOUSE\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Coming now to appellant\u2019s contention that the mark HENLEY is unregistrable because it is both a geographically descriptive word and a surname, we believe that the board did not err in declining to rule on that contention. It relates to a matter having no relevancy to the present proceedings which involve the question of whether appellee has superior rights in HENLEY as found by the board. In re Myers, 201 F.2d 379, 40 CCPA 747, cited by appellant does not support appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">In view of the above the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
