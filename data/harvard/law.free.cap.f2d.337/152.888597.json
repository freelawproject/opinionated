He fell into a depressed areaway immediately adjacent to the playground, which areaway itself surrounded the basement of the school building. The complaint, in one count, alleged that the fall was the result of the District\u2019s negligence in failing either to provide, or to maintain properly, an adequate railing or other safeguard around the depressed areaway or to warn of the resultingly dangerous condition, or in exposing Elgin to this dangerous condition through mandatory participation in activities likely to result in injury because of it. A second count in the complaint, relying upon the same factual allegations, sets forth a claim of nuisance. The District Court, upon motion prior to trial, dismissed the complaint, presumably upon the ground that the doctrine of municipal immunity precluded recovery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal seeks, through reversal of that action, an opportunity to prove the allegations of the complaint at a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-20\">Three points are urged upon us as warranting such reversal. One is a plea that we join the growing number of courts which have put an end to the shelter from tort liability afforded to municipal governments by the immunity doctrine. For the reasons set forth in the margin, we do not deal with the merits of this proposal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A second is an argument that, whatever the vulnerability of the negligence count in the complaint, the second count, stated in terms of nuisance, is. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>good under the long-standing exception to municipal immunity for this kind of wrong. Although a superficial examination of this contention suggests that the facts alleged appear to fall short of the common law concept of nuisance, we do not deal with the matter definitively in view of the disposition we make of the third issue raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">This third contention, which was the one principally pressed upon us as upon the court below, derives from the familiar learning with respect to the differentiation in functions performed by a municipality. Almost from the very moment of creation by the courts of an immunity initially resting upon the ancient dogma that the king can do no wrong, the judges have been alert to insist that the king be acting as such at the time injury occurs. With kings replaced by city councils as the embodiments of the grace by which men permit themselves to be governed, this alertness was verbalized in somewhat different terms, but the core of the judicial insight remained the same. It is, we believe, essentially this: If a king, or a city council, is to do the job of governing well, then there is something to be said for withholding the threat of answerability in damages for at least some of the actions and decisions which governing necessarily entails. He who rules must make choices among competing courses of action and in the face of conflicting considerations of policy. The capacity and the incentive to govern effectively are arguably not enhanced by the prospect of being sued by those citizens who may be adversely affected by the choice eventually made. Thus it has been thought wise to sweep this restrictive cloud from the horizon and to let those responsible for the conduct of public affairs calculate their courses of action free of this intimidating influence. By the same token, in those areas of governmental action where the reason for the rule does not apply, the rule itself is disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">This is, in our view, the origin and the present significance of the exception to municipal tort immunity rooted in the contrasting of \u201cgovernmental\u201d functions, as to which immunity is assumed to obtain, with those said to be of a \u201cproprietary\u201d nature, where it does not. It is not a useful exercise, to catalogue the many cases in this and other jurisdictions where the distinction has purported to be drawn. They frequently defy logical classification, and they reflect varying, and often inconsistent, rationalizations, as might be expected in an area where there is a growing conviction that a strict rule of immunity from liability has outlived its time. We do think it significant that, in the traditional formularization of the opposed concepts as \u201cgovernmental\u201d and \u201cproprietary,\u201d there has been an increasing tendency to substitute \u201cministerial\u201d for \u201cproprietary.\u201d' This sounds upon our ears as the knelt of the old rationale, which was stated in. terms of activities customarily associated! with government as compared with those-ordinarily carried on by the private sector of society. This was, at best, a tangential articulation of the most sensible-support to be found for the immunity-grant; and the use of the word \u201cministerial\u201d both eliminates any continuing-utility it might have and focuses attention upon a sharper and more satisfying analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">That analysis is more concerned with-, trying to distinguish between the functions performed within an area of readily recognizable governmental responsibility, than with undertaking to define-precisely where the boundaries of that, area lie. And, with such functions so-identified and differentiated, it next inquires whether an injury inflicted as a consequence of one of such functions can be subjected to judicial redress without thereby jeopardizing the quality and efficiency of government itself. \u201cMinisterial\u201d connotes the execution of policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>.\u2022as distinct from its formulation. This in turn suggests' differences in the degree of discretion and judgment involved in the particular governmental act. Where'' \u2022those elements are important, it is desirable that they operate freely and without the inhibiting influence of potential legal liability asserted with the advan-tage of hindsight. To the extent that the rule of municipal tort immunity continues to serve any useful purpose, this would appear to be that purpose; and its illumination in any given set of facts 'has been, and is, sought through the function-discriminating exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">There is nothing new about this approach in this jurisdiction. Indeed, it -was clearly reflected in the court\u2019s opinion in <em>TJrow, supra. </em>There the negligence attributed to the District of Col- 1 mmbia was the failure to locate a traffic \u25a0control device at a particular intersec- * tion, resulting, so it was said, in the \u2022death of appellant\u2019s decedent. The court, in addition to rejecting the invitation to reconsider the doctrine of municipal tort immunity, noted that the D. C. <em>Commissioners </em>had been entrusted with a discretionary authority to locate traffic signals .-at such places as they might deem advisable. \u201cThe establishment of such a general traffic control plan,\u201d said the \u25a0court, \u201cis essentially legislative in char.acter and is the result of the Commissioners\u2019 exercise of discretion and judgment.\u201d The court went <em>on to </em>hold that .a claim of negligence in this context of \u2022governmental discretion was wholly inadmissible, whatever view one might take of municipal tort immunity; and it sustained a dismissal of the complaint without trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The very last sentence of this court\u2019s \u25a0opinion in <em>Urow </em>referred to \u201ca ministerial as distinguished from a discretionary function,\u201d presumably reflecting its belief that this is a terminology to be preferred over the traditional governmental-proprietary dichotomy. And the implication is strong in the opinion that, again without reference, as the court put it, to \u201c[wjhatever defects there may be in the doctrine of municipal immunity from tort liability,\u201d such liability might well attach in other \u2014 and non-discretionary \u2014 circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">A case of such nature is not far to seek in the court\u2019s recent history. Judge Prettyman, writing for the court in Booth v. District of Columbia, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 32, 241 F.2d 437 (1956), reversed a directed verdict for the District upon the plaintiff\u2019s opening statement and remanded for trial a claim of negligent failure to maintain the streets in safe condition. The fact that two theories of negligence were advanced in that case, and resolved by the court in different ways, serves to cast in clearer outline the distinction between ministerial and discretionary functions. The plaintiff had been injured when her car had been caught in an intersection in a sudden current of flood water. Her first theory of negligence was that the District\u2019s culpability lay in failing to plan and provide an adequate sewer system. The court said there could be no recovery on this basis, relying upon Johnston v. District of Columbia, 118 U.S. 19, 6 S.Ct. 923, 30 L.Ed. 75 (1886), where the Supreme Court, noting that the planning and adoption of a sewer system is heavily fraught with discretionary determinations, held the District immune from liability on a similar claim. But Judge Prettyman characterized <em>Johnston </em>as also recognizing \u201cthat a municipality may be liable for negligence in the construction of a sewer in accordance with the general plan or for negligent failure to keep that sewer in good repair\u201d; and he went on to hold, in respect of plaintiff\u2019s second theory of negligence, that \u201c[i]f it can be shown to the satisfaction of the jury that the District negligently failed to keep the streets here involved in a reasonably safe condition, then the District may be liable * * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">If we were to make the issue before us turn on a simple conclusion that the provision of schools is properly to be regarded as a legitimate public activity\u2014 a \u201cgovernmental\u201d function in the traditional terminology \u2014 then our warrant for doing so would be District of Columbia v. Tyrrell, 41 App.D.C. 463, cert. dismissed, 243 U.S. 1, 37 S.Ct. 361, 61 L.Ed. 557 (1914).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This case has been strongly urged upon us by appellee as dispositive, and so perhaps it would be if, in the half-century which has elapsed since it was decided, this court had continued to adhere to the talismanic formula of \u201cgovernmental\u201d versus \u201cpropx\u00faetary,\u201d signifying the boundaries between what are regarded as characteristically public, as distinct from private, enterprises. But, as we have seen, the court has not done so. It has, instead discrimixxated among functions, all of which could be said to be \u201cgovernmental\u201d in this sense. The shift fx*om <em>Tyrrell </em>is signalized by <em>TJrovfs </em>explicit opposition of \u201cdiscretionary\u201d to \u201cministerial\u201d functions, with amenability for negligence depending upon which of these categories encompasses the facts in question. Thus, over and above the differentiating circumstance that <em>Tyrrell </em>did not involve a school child at all, much less one required by the school\u2019s program to be in the alleged place of danger, we do not consider that <em>Tyrrell </em>dictates the result here. Under the court\u2019s more recent appx'oaeh, a finding that a function is \u201cgovernmental\u201d is the begiixning of inquiry into the issue of answerability in tort, not the end of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In the case before us, the facts alleged in substance are that a guardrail erected by the school authorities to separate a school playground from a depressed area-way adjoining it had its protective purpose and capacity impaired because a section of it became missing; and that, although a dangerous condition was thus created, nothing was done to remedy it, nor were the required recreational activities on the playground suspended until repairs were effected. These are, we repeat, the allegations. They may or may not be established to the satisfaction of a court or jury after trial. The question before us now is not whether they are true, but whether the opportunity should have been given to prove them to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">We think it should have been. In so concluding, we accept the proposition that it is the appropriate business, and indeed the urgent responsibility, of the Distinct of Columbia to provide and operate schools and their accompanying playgrounds. We apprehend also that the discharge of that responsibility will frequently involve the performance of functions calling for the highest degrees of discretion and judgment; and it will be time enough, when and if such claims are before us, for this court to deal with the question of the District\u2019s liability in tort for harms allegedly flowing from such functions. We think that <em>Urow </em>and its forebears px-esently provide a considerable degree of guidance in this area to the trial courts, wholly apart from the resolution one way or the other of the abstract issue of municipal tox't immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">We are not persuaded, however, that the function of repairing broken guardrails imposes upon \u2018the District deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>minations of such delicacy and difficulty that its ability to furnish public education will be ponderably impaired by liability for neglect in failing to make such repairs. If \u201cministerial\u201d is to be given, anything- like its accepted usage, it surely has patent applicability to these circumstances. If we accept, as this court has, the right of a pedestrian on a public sidewalk to get to the jury on his claim of the District\u2019s liability in negligence for permitting a depressed area alongside such sidewalk to exist unguarded (Elliott v. District of Columbia, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 64, 160 F.2d 386 (1947)), we do not see how we can deny the same right on the facts alleged here. From the standpoint of the school child here involved, the school playground was not only a public area which he was privileged to traverse but one in which he was affirmatively required to be at the time of his injury. In the posture which this case has before us, a remand for the purpose of permitting the complaint to be pursued in appropriate proceedings impresses us as well within the scope which this court has already given for the assertion of claims against the District of Columbia sounding in tort.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASx\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\"><em>. Although, the </em>order of dismissal does not recite the ground, the motion was bottomed upon the immunity doctrine, and the memoranda of points and authorities filed by the parties were addressed to it, with special reference to the question of \u201cgovernmental,\u201d as opposed to \u201cproprietary,\u201d functions. The learned trial judge had earlier expressed his view generally to be that \u201c[gjovernment immunity from suit is an obsolescent and dying doctrine\u201d; and he had characterized the efforts of the courts to differentiate between governmental and proprietary functions as \u201cfar from clear and * * * not always consistent throughout,\u201d concluding that \u201c[i]t is obviously difficult to chart a definite course or to deduce a governing principle from this welter of decisions.\u201d Calomeris v. District of Columbia, 125 F.Supp. 266, 267-268 (D.D.C.1954), aff\u2019d, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 864, 226 F.2d 266 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-21\">. As recently as last year (and see Harbin v. District of Columbia, 119 U.S.App.D.C. \u2014, 336 F.2d 950, decided July 3, 1964), this court reaffirmed a position it had taken earlier, namely, that termination of municipal tort immunity is, insofar as the District of Columbia is concerned, a question to be resolved at the legislative level by the Congress of the United States. Urow v. District of Columbia, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 350, 316 F.2d 351, petition for rehearing en banc denied April 16, 1963, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 826, 84 S.Ct. 69, 11 L.Ed.2d 59 (1963).

District of Columbia, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 28, 179 F.2d 44 (1949). Whatever the merits or demerits of this position, a reexamination of it is, under our customary prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>tice, a matter for the full court and not merely a division. AVe note that appellants here did not, as they could have done, move for such a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\">. In reaching' this result, the court rested heavily upon District of Columbia v. Caton, 48 App.D.C. 96 (1918). There the District had formulated a general plan of street railway improvement, but the construction of it had been carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>out in such a way that a dangerous condition was created in the street and permitted to exist without correction. The court said (at p. 107): \u201cThe action would not be based upon a defective construction * * * but upon the negligence of the municipal authorities in permitting a dangerous condition to exist in the street, as the result of defective construction.\u201d The District has, of course, long been held responsible in tort for its failure to maintain the streets and sidewalks in safe condition. See e. <em>g. </em>Booth v. District of Columbia, <em>supra; </em>Sass v. District of Columbia, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 365, 316 F.2d 366 (1963); District of Columbia v.

In its opinion, the Supreme Court pointed out that the discussion of this matter by this court was dictum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b209-4\">. Knowledge of the defect in the guardrail by the District government does not appear to be alleged in the complaint. This court has consistently held that such notice, either actual or constructive, is an element of the case which must be pleaded and proved. See Aben v. District of Columbia, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 237, 221 F.2d 110 (1955); Dommel v. Managers, Inc., 109 U.S.App.D.C. 370, 288 F.2d 154 (1961); Sass v. District of Columbia, <em>supra </em>(by implication); Larmon v. District of Columbia, 5 Mackey [16 D.C.Sup.Ct.] 330 (1886). Appellee did not advance this point in its brief on appeal, nor does it appear to have been urged in support of the motion to dismiss in the District Court. Moreover, in papers filed in opposition to the motion to dismiss, appellants did allege notice. To the extent that the matter is placed in issue on remand, the alternative of amendment of the pleadings, absent a showing of prejudice by appellee, is available. Fbd.R. Crv.P. 15. On the record before us, no issue has been raised as to compliance with any statutory requirement of notice <em>after </em>the injury. See Stone v.

In emphasizing the factor of discretion as decisive, the court\u2019s opinion takes a useful step toward modernizing the archaic doctrine of sovereign immunity. In retaining a rigid classification of cases, however, it harbors seeds of the same arbitrariness which presently characterizes that doctrine. In other areas of tort law, the elaborate categorizations of the common law have gradually been replaced by a single rule \u2014 that the existence and extent of the defendant\u2019s duty to the plaintiff is to be determined in the context of all the circumstances of the action of which the plaintiff complains.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would decide cases against the sovereign in a like manner, treating the degree of discretion available to Government officials in performance of their office and the public interest in protecting the exercise of that discretion as among the \u201ccircumstances of the action\u201d to be considered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-13\">.
