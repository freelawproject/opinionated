The district court has affirmed the referee and has held that he should. Obrist, a creditor, appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-20\">Prior to adjudication of bankruptcy, Christensen gave Obrist \u201cbad checks,\u201d not honored by the bank because of insufficient funds in the drawer\u2019s account, in exchange for cattle. The checks were issued on different dates. Obrist contends to prevent a general discharge, as he must, that the checks were a false financial statement under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32 (Section 14 of the Bankruptcy Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">Section 32, general discharge, is not to be confused with debts not discharged by a general discharge, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35 (Section 17 of the Act). No question under Section 35 is before us. That is not the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-22\">The few cases in the field are squarely against the appellant. See In re Robinson, 1 Cir., 266 F. 970 and In re Rea Bros., D.C.Mont., 251 F. 431. Also, Scott v. Smith, 9 Cir., 232 F.2d 188, in our view upholds appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-23\">Appellant believes there should be a different rule on an Oregon bad check because of ORS 165.225, which makes refusal to pay by the drawee bank prima facie evidence of fraud of the drawer. We think that section does mesh with Section 35, but does not make a check a financial statement. While obviously a financial statement need not be preceded by a recital of, \u201cThis is a financial statement,\u201d yet it ought to have some relation to the popular concept of what a financial statement is. We go so far as to say that this would not normally include a negotiable instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>It may be that Obrist has been grievously wronged, but his rights are not now and have not been under Section 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The order of the district court affirming the referee\u2019s order overruling the objections to the discharge is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
