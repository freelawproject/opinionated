The court below on cross motions for summary judgment based on stipulated facts entered judgment denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion and granting the defendant\u2019s and the plaintiff appealed. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-18\">The $40 payment for participation in the club\u2019s bowling league was in addition to regular club membership dues of $67.50 on which the plaintiff paid a federal excise tax of $13.50 not here in issue. As a member of the club the plaintiff, on the payment of $40 in addition to his membership dues, become eligible to participate in the club\u2019s mixed bowling league competition. As a member of the bowling league the plaintiff was entitled to bowl three strings in league competition on each of 26 specified occasions from September to May without paying the club\u2019s usual charge to members for bowling of $.35 per string or three strings for $1.00. The sole issue presented is whether the $40 payment was \u201cdues\u201d as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4242 (a), quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-19\">The appellant concedes in his brief \u201cthat a literal and wooden application of the statutory definition of \u2018dues\u2019 \u201d in \u00a7 4242(a) \u201cmight lead one to conclude that the bowling fee involved here constitutes \u2018dues\u2019 within the meaning\u201d of \u00a7 4241 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-20\">He contends, however, that a literal reading of \u00a7 4242(a) is precluded by the opinion of the Court in White v. Winchester Country Club, 315 U.S. 32, 62 S.Ct. 425, 86 L.Ed. 619 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-21\">We do not see how the appellant can draw any comfort from the Winchester Country Club case in which the Court, construing a revenue statute imposing a tax on \u201cdues or membership fees\u201d but not defining those terms, held that the test of whether a payment to a country club is \u201cdues\u201d is whether the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>is \u201cfixed by each occasion of actual use\u201d of a club facility, as for a meal in the dining room or a single round of golf, or whether the payment is \u201cfor the right to repeated and general use of a common club facility for an appreciable period of time.\u201d See page 41 of 315 U.S., page 430 of 62 S.Ct.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Whether the fee paid for participation in the Maugus Club mixed bowling league fits the Court\u2019s definition of \u201cdues\u201d in the Winchester Country Club case need not concern us, for it fits squarely within the statutory definition in \u00a7 4242(a), supra, of the Revenue Code of 1954 with which we are here concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AKS\"> \u201cAs used in this part the term \u2018dues\u2019 includes any assessment, irrespective of the purpose for which made, and any charges for social privileges or facilities, or for golf, tennis, polo, swimming, or other athletic or sporting privileges or facilities, for any period of more than six days; * *</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
