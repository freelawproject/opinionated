It consists of something over 54% by-weight of calcium carbonates and approximately 44% by weight of magnesium carbonates. Impurities in the material account for a very small percentage. It, in fact, is used in the metallurgical and chemical industries for itsmetallurgieal and chemical properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-20\">Section 114(b) (4) (A), in relevant; part, provides depletion allowances as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-21\">\u201c(i) in the case of * * * stone. * * * 5 per centum,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-23\">\u201c(ii) in the case * * * dolomite, magnesite * * * calcium carbonates, and magnesium carbonates, 10 per centum,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-24\">\u201c(iii) in the case of * * metallurgical gx-ade limestone, chemical grade limestone * * * 15 per centum, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-27\">Everyone agrees that the plaintiff\u2019s; material is stone within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the first clause of \u00a7 114(b) (4) (A), and that it is dolomite within the meaning of the second clause. Unquestionably of a very high metallurgical grade, the only questions are whether or not it is a limestone as that word with its qualifying words is used in the third clause, and, if so, whether the word \u201cdolomite\u201d in the second clause is more or less specific than the words \u201cmetallurgical grade \"limestone\u201d in the third clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">To qualify as metallurgical grade limestone, the material must have in the .-aggregate at least 95% of carbonates. 'There are some such stones in which the -carbonate is principally calcium, while there are stones from other deposits -which contain a comparatively substantial proportion of magnesium carbonate. :Such material is frequently referred to ;as dolomitic limestone, though this is a relatively modem development, and, originally, there was no differentiation between material useful for the production -of lime on the basis of variations in magnesium content.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In addition to being known as dolo-mitic limestone, limestones having a com--paratively high magnesium carbonate \u25a0 content are known as dolomites. Pure mineral dolomite is 54.35% calcium carbonate and 45.65% magnesium carbon\u201eate. Pure material is rarely found in nature, though, as indicated above, the -plaintiff\u2019s product closely approaches it.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">There is substantial evidence that dolomite is only a subclass of limestone. The word is useful in indicating its magnesium content and distinguishing it from \u25a0other limestones having very high cal- \u2022 cium carbonate content, but the evidence indicates that neither historically, geologically nor industrially may dolomite be \u25a0 \u25a0divorced from the general class of rock known as limestone. There is evidence that \u201climestone\u201d is sometimes used ex- \u25a0 clusively to indicate stones having very high calcium carbonate content as contrasted with dolomitic limestones, but we accept the testimony, which supports the findings of the District Court, that \u201climestone\u201d has a broader meaning which encompasses both subclasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">In 1950, the National Lime Association sought higher depletion allowances for metallurgical and chemical grade lime-stones, including dolomite. In preparation for this effort, it had employed a Dr. Kenneth K. Landes, who prepared a summary of the reserves of high grade limestone and presented a report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives. He defined his terms and, as used in his survey, report and recommendation, the terms \u201cmetallurgical grade limestone\u201d and \u201cchemical grade limestone\u201d included dolomite of the requisite purity. The Committee adopted his language and his suggestion, but the Senate did nothing about the matter in 1950. In 1951, however, the House of Representatives adopted an amendment inserting into the Bill a provision which is now clause (iii) of \u00a7 114(b) (4) (A). At that time clause (ii) contained no reference to dolomites or to calcium carbonate or to magnesium carbonates. The Senate Finance Committee, however, inserted the word \u201cdolomite\u201d in clause (ii), and, by a floor amendment, the words \u201ccalcium carbonates\u201d and \u201cmagnesium carbonates\u201d were introduced into clause (ii). The Conference Committee adopted the Senate version,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and thus clause (ii) came to read as it did during the years 1952 and 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">From the foregoing, we think the District Judge was quite correct in his conclusion that the terms \u201cmetallurgical grade limestone\u201d and \u201cchemical grade limestone\u201d in clause (iii) included dolomites of the requisite purity, for that was clearly the basis of the presentation of the request to the Congress and the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>upon which clause (iii) came into the Section.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We also are of the opinion that the word \u201cdolomite,\u201d as used in clause (ii), is neither more specific nor more restricted than the words \u201cmetallurgical grade limestone\u201d as used in clause (iii). Of course, it is a more restrictive word than the word \u201climestone\u201d unmodified, for dolomite is a subclass of limestone, but \u201cmetallurgical grade limestone,\u201d defined to include dolomite of requisite purity, constitutes a very small proportion of minable limestone or minable dolomite. Limestones of both subclasses which can meet the grade requirements of clause (iii) are infinitely less plentiful than either of the general subclasses of limestone.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It thus appears that the obvious purpose of inserting the word \u201cdolomite\u201d into clause (ii) was to provide a 10% depletion allowance for that material which was of insufficient purity to qualify as metallurgical grade. Otherwise it would have been entitled to depletion only as \u201cstone\u201d at a five per cent rate. This conclusion is buttressed by the insertion on the Senate floor of the words \u201ccalcium carbonates\u201d and \u201cmagnesium carbonates\u201d into clause (ii). Collectively, the words \u201cdolomite,\u201d \u201ccalcium carbonates\u201d and \u201cmagnesium carbonates\u201d encompass all of the limestones. If the insertion of one of those words into clause (ii) was intended to withdraw a subclass of limestone from clause (iii) though meeting the grade specifications, then the insertion of the several words encompassing all of the limestones should be held to have withdrawn all limestone from clause (iii). Obviously, this was not the Congressional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We, therefore, agree with the District Judge that the words \u201cdolomite,\u201d \u201ccalcium carbonates\u201d and \u201cmagnesium carbonates,\u201d as used in clause (ii) were intended to encompass those materials only if they did not meet the grade requirements of clause (iii). Approximately 99% of the limestones would thus be allowed depletion under clause (ii); approximately 1%, meeting the metallurgical and chemical grade requirements of clause (iii), would be entitled to depletion allowance at the rate of 15%. That was the apparent Congressional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The District Court in its opinion considered and discussed prior judicial opinions bearing upon the question and the reasons for its conclusion as to the proper construction of the statute in light of the evidence in this case. We-need not repeat all of that discussion here, but, approvingly, refer the reader to it. The essential difference between this case and earlier ones discussed by the District Judge, however, is the presence here of compelling testimony that dolomite, historically and geologically, is one of two subclasses of limestone, and, when of the requisite purity, is metallurgical or chemical grade limestone as-, those terms were understood by the Congress in 1951 and by industrial engineers experienced in that field. The-Court\u2019s conclusions followed naturally from its findings, which, in this case, have a solid foundation in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-13\">. This action involves the tax years 1952-1953. The 1954 Code contains a different formulation which clearly extends the 15% depletion rate to this product.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-28\">. 221 F.Supp. 824.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\">. This is true as far as the language is concerned. The Senate version provided only a ten per cent depletion rate for chemical and metallurgical grade lime- . stone; however, in the Conference Corn<em>mittee, </em>limestones possessing these properties were restored to the fifteen per cent category. This Conference version became the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
