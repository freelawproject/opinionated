(the taxpayer) for an income tax refund of $475,133.35 covering taxes paid upon assessment for the years 1956 through 1959. The Government also appeals from the denial of a motion for judgment in its favor notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-19\">The taxes in question were assessed under sections 531-537 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 on the ground that the taxpayer had been availed of for the purpose of avoiding income taxes with respect to its stockholders. The accumulated earnings tax (Sec. 531) applies to every corporation \u201cavailed of for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders * * * by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed\u201d (Sec. 532(a)). The fact that earnings have been \u201cpermitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business shall be determinative of the purpose to avoid\u201d such tax \u201cunless the corporation by the preponderance of the evidence shall prove to the contrary\u201d (Sec. 533(a)). The term \u201creasonable needs of the business\u201d includes \u201cthe reasonably anticipated needs\u201d (Sec. 537).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-21\">To guide the jury in its analysis of the facts and the court in its resolution of legal issues, the court submitted two special questions to be answered \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d The first question was \u201cDid plaintiff, Duke Laboratories, Inc., permit its earnings or profit to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of its business?\u201d On the paper submitted to the jury, space was provided for \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers for each of the years 1956-1959. The second question was: \u201cWere such accumulations, if any, made for the purpose of avoiding the surtax upon the stockholders of Duke Laboratories, Inc. ?\u201d Similar space for answers was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-22\">In its charge, the court instructed the jury that \u201cYour verdict upon the ultimate issue just stated depends upon your determination of the following two basic questions. * * * \u201d The court then advised the jury that \u201cdepending upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>your answers to these questions, the lawyers for both sides have stipulated that the verdict will be entered automatically through your foreman, and you will not have to stand up here and say, \u2018We find for the defendant,\u2019 or, \u2018We find for the plaintiff,\u2019 and if for the plaintiff in \u2018X\u2019 dollars.\u201d The jury answered the first question in the affirmative and the second question in the negative as to each of the years 1956-1959. Accordingly, their verdict was in favor of the taxpayer and judgment was entered thereon. The court denied the Government\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and in the alternative for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The Government contends that the trial court erroneously presented the case to the jury in that he used the statutory language of section 532 in his second question wherein he told the jury to determine whether the accumulations were made \u201cfor the purpose of avoiding the income tax.\u201d This question, the Government argues, should have read \u201ca\u201d purpose instead of \u201cthe\u201d purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Courts should have some reluctance in rewriting statutes. The Congress did not use the article \u201ca\u201d in section 532 or 533. It did not choose to employ \u201cany\u201d or \u201cdominant\u201d or \u201cprimary\u201d purpose. A finding that the accumulations were beyond the reasonable needs of the business was to \u201cbe determinative of <em>the </em>purpose to avoid\u201d (emphasis supplied) unless the taxpayer \u201cby the preponderance of the evidence shall prove to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The Government\u2019s real quarrel is with \u201cthe singular verdict reached by the jury below.\u201d It is willing to have the verdict stand as to the unreasonableness of the accumulations and even concedes that \u201ca corporation\u2019s \u2018honest belief\u2019 that its earnings are not excessive for its needs, though mistaken, may exempt it from liability under Section 532(a),\u201d but it is unwilling to accept the jury\u2019s factual determination as to \u201chonest belief.\u201d The jury was misled, it claims, by the \u201cthe\u201d in the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Analysis of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury dispels any such inference. The jury was told that the taxpayer had the burden \u201cto show by a preponderance off the evidence the absence of any intent to avoid the income tax with respect to its shareholders, regardless of whatever other purposes for accumulation the plaintiff may have established.\u201d This instruction was followed by the statement that \u201cThe intent to avoid the income tax with respect to shareholders need not be the sole or dominant intent in permitting the accumulations.\u201d Even the court\u2019s illustration permitted the jury to rely on any purpose, the court saying, \u201cWhatever the motive may have been, when the practice of accumulation was adopted, an intent to avoid the income tax which induced or aided in inducing the continuance of that practice, is sufficient to impose the tax on the accumulated fund * * The eourt; thus, gave to the jury the widest latitude to determine whether tax avoidance was a factor in the formulation of any intent which might have motivated the taxpayer\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Although the facts are not in issue, they may well explain why the jury\u2019s-verdict was not quite so \u201cunique\u201d as the Government would have it despite its concession that the verdict in taxpayer\u2019s-favor was \u201cclearly permissible under the statute.\u201d Here again is the situation of the small but growing corporation with,, for all practical purposes, stock ownership in the hands of a single individuaL Under these circumstances, the Government is entitled to scrutinize with care' all pertinent facts relating to accumulations. However, in final analysis, resolution of these facts is for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">The taxpayer was formed in 1928 by Dr. Carl Herzog, the owner of 235 of 250 shares outstanding. During 1956-1959, the years in question, his annual salary was $40,000. The taxpayer\u2019s business consisted primarily of the manufacture and sale of bandages, dressings, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and soaps. Its market has been largely in the field of wholesale druggists, certain retail outlets serving the medical profession, surgical and first aid supply houses, the Red Cross and hospitals. Competition in the field from larger units was very great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u2022and sales methods changed radically. Illustrative of these changes were the door-to-door sales and chain store sales. This type of marketing required extensive and costly advertising by television, radio and .magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">From 1953 to 1961 the taxpayer had made capital expenditures of over $1,-.500,000, all financed from earnings because the taxpayer had a policy of self--.financing instead of borrowing from outside sources. From a humble beginning in New York City with a plant area \u25a0of less than 1,000 square feet, it progressively enlarged its quarters to some 6,000 square feet (Long Island City), 25,000 square feet (Stamford) and in 1956, 60,-\u25a0000 square feet (South Norwalk). Insufficient capital prevented the construction of a weaving plant in the Norwalk building. However, in 1960 a mill was purchased in Paterson, New Jersey, at a \u25a0\u2022cost of over $100,000 and a pension plan requiring some $160,000 was put into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Fui\u2019ther review of the many \u25a0\u2018items of proof is unnecessary. The problem for the jury was to determine from \u25a0all the evidence whether there was any intent in making the accumulations to .avoid taxes. The jury was told that it \u201cneed not be the sole or dominant intent\u201d; they were told that Dr. Plerzog \u201cknew that a distribution in the form of \u2022dividends would increase his income tax liability\u201d; and they knew that Dr. Herzog was a very interested witness. Yet, after observing Dr. Herzog as a witness for some three days, the jury apparently believed that the accumulations were not to avoid a tax but were for taxpayer\u2019s legitimate business needs. A determination of the intent of a third party is always difficult but it is peculiarly within the province of the jury which can both from observation of the witness and analysis of the proof best decide the question. The Government does not seriously disagree with this proposition but argues that \u201c[t]here must be some basis in fact for an \u2018honest belief\u2019 beyond its mere assertion.\u201d A five-day trial and the many exhibits introduced therein gave to the jury much more to deal with than a mere assertion. Their verdict is adequately supported by the proof. For the same reason, the court properly denied the Government\u2019s motion for judgment, notwithstanding the verdict and in the alternative for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
