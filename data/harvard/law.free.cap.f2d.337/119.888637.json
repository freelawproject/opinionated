Marshall was sentenced July 26, 1963, for a rape charged to have been committed on September 23, 1959. He was arrested October 28, 1959, and indicted November 16, 1959. His third trial, which began July 8, 1963, resulted in the conviction that is here on appeal. The following outline covers the period of some three years and eight months between the indictment and this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>(1) 75 days, from indictment to February 1, 1960, when the first trial began. Some delay was caused by illness of appellant\u2019s assigned counsel and his need of time to prepare. The jury did not agree on a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">(2) 71 days, from the end of the first trial on February 2, 1960, to the second trial on May 12, 1960. During this period there were several continuances: from February 19 to March 22 because new assigned counsel needed time to prepare, to April 26 because a co-defendant\u2019s counsel needed time to prepare, to May 2 because appellant was ill, and to May 12 because a co-defendant\u2019s counsel had another engagement. At the close of the government\u2019s case Marshall pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">(3) On November 12, 1960, after he had served six months of his sentence, Marshall moved to vacate his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">(4) The motion to vacate was pending 16 months, till March 12, 1962. During all this time appellant was either in prison or in a mental hospital. In January, 1961, he was transferred from Lorton, where he was serving his sentence, to St. Elizabeths for treatment of a mental illness because the Legal Psychiatric Service certified that he was insane. On January 30, 1961 counsel was appointed to represent him on his motion to vacate. On March 13 and again on April 11, 1961, hearing on his motion was continued at his request to allow more time for mental examination. The motion to vacate was heard on February 16 and March 9, 1962. On March 12, 1962 the guilty plea was vacated under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">(5) On or about March 15, 1962 appellant\u2019s third trial was set for July 16, 1962, and he was committed to St. Elizabeths for mental examination, although he had been there for treatment since January 1961. He remained there until June 14, 1962, when he was returned to jail as competent to stand trial. But his third and last trial, resulting in the conviction now here on appeal, was not held until July 8, <em>1963. </em>During this period of over a year there were the following continuances:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">(6) 116 days, June 14 to October 8, 1962. Though trial had been set for July 16, on June 12 the trial date was moved back to October 8 \u201cbecause of the summer schedule and the unavailability of jurors and witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">(7) 38 days, October 8 to November 15, 1962. On October 1, one week before the date set for trial and 45 days after trial counsel was appointed, he asked and was granted leave to withdraw because he had no experience in criminal law. He should not have been appointed in the first place. A capital trial is no place for a lawyer to begin acquiring experience in criminal practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">Trial was set for November 15. Another lawyer was appointed on October 2 and withdrew, for what reason does not appear, within 6 days. A third was appointed October 8, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">(8) 67 days, November 15, 1962 to January 21, 1963. On November 15, 38 days after counsel\u2019s appointment, he moved at appellant\u2019s request for more time to prepare. The court continued the trial to January 21, 1963, 67 days later. It does not appear that so long a delay was needed or asked. On December 14, 1962, counsel asked and was granted leave to withdraw because of \u201cserious illness in the family and because he was behind in other office work.\u201d He said he had spent very little time on the case. Five days later the court again appointed new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">On January 10, 1963, appellant pro se moved to dismiss the indictment for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">(9) 7 days, January 21 to January 28, 1963. The prosecutor was occupied with another case.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">(10) On January 28, 1963, defense counsel was ill with influenza. Instead of granting a reasonable continuance, such as a week or two, the court continued the case for 42 days, till March 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>(11) 42 days, March 11 to April 22, 1963. On February 13, the government asked for a continuance beyond March 11 because the complaining witness was expecting a child in late March. Trial was set for April 22. As far as appears, it might have been held in February.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">(12) 21 days, April 22 to May 13, 1963. Government counsel was ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">On April 24, appellant renewed his motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">(13) 61 days, May 14 to July 8, 1963. On May 14 defense counsel asked leave to withdraw. He said the defendant had become \u201chighly enraged * * * and charged that he believed that I was conspiring with others against him to bring about his conviction.\u201d Counsel also informed the court that a St. Elizabeths doctor \u201cconsiders Mr. Marshall still very seriously ill\u201d, and questioned his client\u2019s \u201cability to cooperate * * * in the defense\u201d. Without consulting appellant or informing him that counsel\u2019s withdrawal would cause more months of delay, the court granted counsel\u2019s request, continued the case to July 1, and appointed a fifth lawyer, who withdrew eight days later for no recorded reason. Finally, on July 8, 1963, a sixth lawyer, who told the court he could not put his client on the stand or even communicate effectively with him and that he \u201cblacks out\u201d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> tried the case. It had been eontinued from July 1 to July 8 because a new jury list was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">On May 21, 1963, appellant had made a third motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-20\">Until July 8, 1960, when he was sentenced after his second trial, appellant was out on bond. From that time until December 4, 1963, he was either in the District of Columbia jail, at Lorton, or at St. Elizabeths. In October, 1962, he asked that bond be set at $1,000 but the District Court set it at $5,000, which he could not meet. On December 4, 1963, he was released pending appeal on bond of $500 by order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-21\">If we were \u201ctalking English, not law\u201d, it would not be suggested that a man who was tried three years and eight months after indictment had a \u201cspeedy\u201d trial. We are to decide whether Marshall had a speedy trial in the technical sense that the law has given to this Sixth Amendment right. We think he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-22\">On March 12, 1962, when his motion to vacate his former plea of guilty was granted, Marshall had been in St. Elizabeths for treatment more than a year. There was or should have been no occasion to commit him to St. Elizabeths again for a 90-day examination in order to determine whether he was competent to stand trial, because the previous commitment had given the hospital ample <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>opportunity to determine his condition. The three months\u2019 delay (paragraph (5) above) from his new commitment to the hospital on March 15, 1962 to his return from the hospital on June 14, 1962, as competent to stand trial, should not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Since appellant\u2019s first two trials were short, it should have been foreseen that his third trial, which took only three days, would be short. Since the case was 31 months old in June 1962, the court should then have arranged its calendar so as to avoid postponing the trial until October. Most of the 116-day delay described in paragraph (6) should have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The 38-day delay described in paragraph (7), from October 8 to November 15, 1962, resulted from the court\u2019s inappropriate assignment of counsel. The court should have avoided, also, much of the 67-day delay described in paragraph (8), most of the 42-day delay described in paragraph (10), and most of the 42-day delay described in paragraph (11). The short delays described in paragraphs (9) and (12) call for no comment except that Marshall did not cause them.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In Smith v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C.-, 331 F.2d 784, which this court <em>in banc </em>decided February 20, 1964, we held that the speedy trial question turns on whether \u201cthe delay has been arbitrary, purposeful, oppressive or vexatious.\u201d (331 F.2d at 787.) By this test Marshall did not have a speedy trial. Though the delay was not purposeful in any meaningful sense, much of it was arbitrary, and in the aggregate it was oppressive and vexatious.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">We held that Smith was not denied a speedy trial. He was tried five months after indictment. Marshall was tided 43 months after indictment, 32 months after he moved to vacate a plea of guilty, almost 16 months after a trial date was first set, and almost 13 months after he was found competent to stand trial. In Smith, \u201cAlerted by the appellant\u2019s claim of denial of speedy trial * * * the judge then put the case upon a day to\u00bb day basis.\u201d 331 F.2d at 788 Marshall<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> moved not once but three times, in January, April, and May, 1963, to dismiss the indictment for lack of a speedy trial. His motions had no apparent effect. If five months\u2019 delay was not arbitrary, oppressive or vexatious in the circumstances of Smith, it by no means follows-that far longer delay was not arbitrary, oppressive or vexatious in the circumstances of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Delay was exceedingly prejudicial to-Marshall. Treatment for mental illness, which he had been undergoing at St. Elizabeths, was interrupted for months, while he waited in jail for his third and final trial. But that is a relatively secondary matter. Delay appears to have been fatal to Marshall\u2019s defense. In 1960, at his first trial, he testified effectively in support of his contention that the prosecutrix consented. In that trial,, the jury did not convict him. In June, 1962, he was found at St. Elizabeths to be competent to stand trial. But in July, 1963, when he was tried once more, according to the undisputed statements of his counsel he could not communicate effectively and was not able to take the stand. This time he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Because Marshall\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was denied, the judgment of conviction must be vacated and the indictment dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">Reversed, with directions to vacate the-, judgment and dismiss the indictment.,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-10\">. The Court: Is the defendant <em>going to </em>take the stand?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Mr. Harris: No, Your Honor. I can\u2019t put him on the stand. I have been really unable to communicate with him. He blacks out.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">The Court: I wanted to put on the record for him to state that he wanted to take the stand, if he was <em>going to take </em>the stand. I knew you were appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">Mr. Harris: I am appointed, Your Honor. I doubt that he can take the stand, Your Honor. He has been unable to give me information.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">The Court: I am not interested as long as he is not going to take the stand. If he were <em>going to take </em>the stand I would like to have it on the record for your protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">Mr. Harris: Thank you, Your Hon- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-23\">24 D.C.Code \u00a7 301 provides: \u201cWhenever * * * prior to the imposition of sentence * * * it shall appear to the court from the court\u2019s own observations, or from prima facie evidence submitted to the court, that the accused * * * is mentally incompetent so as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense, the court may order the accused committed * * * for examination and observation * * Because we are reversing on other grounds, we need not decide whether it was plain error requiring reversal for the court to permit the trial to proceed further without a new investigation of the defendant\u2019s competence. Thirteen months had elapsed since it had been determined that he was competent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">. As appellant\u2019s brief says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">\u201cIn view of the fact that until June 14, 1962, Marshall was at St. Elizabeth\u2019s for psychiatric examination, and that it can he argued that until a finding of present competence was made Marshall was not subject to retrial, appellant is willing to accept June 14, 1962 as being the critical date.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b174-14\">WASHINGTON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">I concur, for the reasons set out below, in the view expressed in Judge Edgerton\u2019s opinion that the indictment, charging appellant with rape must be-dismissed because appellant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">I emphasize first that appellant\u2019s claim that his trial was not speedy in the constitutional sense relates only to events occurring after the District Court, \u201cupon the basis of the testimony\u201d of two psychiatrists, allowed him on March 12,1962, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>-to withdraw his plea of guilty, given \u25a0nearly two years earlier, to the lesser (included) offense of assault with intent to commit rape; after the Acting Superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital, to which appellant had been committed for mental examination on his own motion, reported on June 11, 1962, that in the -opinion of the Hospital\u2019s staff the appellant was mentally competent to stand trial; and after the appellant was released on June 14, 1962, to the United States Marshal to be returned to jail .and tried.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The trial finally occurred on July 8, 1963, more than a year after June 14, 1962. The facts bringing about this long delay are set out chronologically in the \u25a0attached appendix. I must conclude that in the circumstances this delay in trial for more than a year was so prejudicial, \u2022oppressive, and vexatious as to amount to a violation of appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">When the District Court allowed withdrawal of the plea of guilty to the lesser included offense in March 1962, it set the case for trial on the following July 16. However, on June 12 the trial was continued by the court until October 8, 1962, as the Assignment Commissioner noted, because of the summer schedule and the unavailability of jurors and witnesses. No further explanation appears. I think this delay cannot be condoned for the reasons given. The appellant was to be tried on a charge for which the death penalty might be imposed. The District Court is required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 50 to give preference to criminal proceedings and I think particularly to one of this type, where since May 12, 1960, .appellant appears to have been either in jail or in a mental hospital. We judicially know that criminal cases are tried during the summer months pursuant to the reduced summer schedule, and that jurors can be made available for this purpose. Witnesses also can generally be made available by subpoena or their testimony be taken by deposition, and in the absence of some persuasive showing to the contrary, the trial should have occurred in the summer months. To be sure, the appellant did not ask the District Court to appoint new counsel for him<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> until August 14, 1962, and counsel was appointed to represent him on August 17. Notwithstanding this, I think that the postponement of trial until October 8 was not shown to be justified. The record before us does not indicate that after his appointment counsel asked for or required nearly two months for preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">I need not go fully into the matter of the delays beyond October 8, 1962, until trial of the case was actually commenced on July 8, 1963. Some of them were perhaps unavoidable, such as the postponement from July 1 to July 8, 1963, and some appear to be attributable to the appellant or to the various counsel appointed to represent him. But the appellant <em>pro se </em>on January 10, 1963, moved to dismiss the indictment against him because, as he alleged, he had not had the speedy trial guaranteed him by the Constitution, and subsequent like motions were filed by him on April 24, 1963, and May 21, 1963. Even assuming arguendo, contrary to what I have said, that the delay before January was satisfactorily explainable in its entirety, I think that the receipt of the first motion on January 10, 1963, protesting the delay on constitutional grounds, required the District Court to take the necessary steps to see that the trial then set for January 21, 1963, take place on that day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>or as soon thereafter as possible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, there were successive postponements until January 28, March 11, April 22, May 13, May 14, July 1, and finally July 8. Although the reasons given for the various postponements may have justified a postponement for a reasonable period in most or perhaps all of the instances, I think it was unreasonable, and in violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights, to order postponements for the length of time allowed in at least the three instances where the trial was delayed for more than a month. In my view, the case should each time have been put on a day-to-day basis, see fn. 3, so that unreasonable delay would not occur. Cf. King v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 193, 265 F.2d 567, cert. denied, 359 U.S. 998, 79 S.Ct. 1124, 3 L.Ed.2d 986 (1959), including the dissent in which I concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">It is my view also that the delay is not shown not to have prejudiced the defendant in defending himself at his trial. Cf. Williams v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 51, 250 F.2d 19 (1957). He took the stand at his first trial, which resulted in a hung jury. At the trial held on July 8, 1963, he was unable, according to statements of his appointed counsel, to communicate effectively and thus to testify. Since the report to the District Court by the Acting Superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital on June 11, 1962, stated that it was the opinion of the Hospital Staff that \u201cMarshall is mentally competent to understand the nature of the proceedings against him and to assist properly in the preparation of his defense,\u201d an assumption is required for present purposes that the appellant had the ability at that time to communicate effectively. His loss of that ability prior to trial clearly indicates, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, that substantial prejudice to appellant\u2019s defense resulted in the long delay before his trial occurred on July 8, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">Since I have concluded that the indictment must be dismissed, I do not reach any of the other points raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">Appendix (to Judge Washington\u2019s opinion)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">1.

Although this court frequently appoints counsel without experience to represent persons accused of crime before this court, even in capital cases, Judge Edger-ton\u2019s opinion states of Counsel #1: \u201cHe should not have been appointed in the first place. A capital trial is no place for a lawyer to begin acquiring experience in criminal practice.\u201d I note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>courts would be greatly handicapped in making appointments of counsel for representation of indigent defendants in capital cases if they must be confined to attorneys with experience in criminal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b177-23\">. Three of the attorneys appointed to represent the appellant prior to March 15, 1962, were permitted to withdraw; the first after he learned that appellant refused to tell him the true facts; another because appellant did not want him as his lawyer; the third because appellant did not want her representation and \u201cdischarged\u201d her as defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b177-44\">. Subsequent motions <em>pro se </em>to dismiss on this ground were filed on April 24, 1963, denied after hearing on May 3, 1963, and on May 21, 1963, denied after hearing and argument on June 19, 1963.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b177-42\">DANAHER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AlR\">(dissenting) : This appellant contends, principal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ly, that he was unlawfully denied a speedy trial, was brought to trial without a determination of his restored competency, and was twice put in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The record shows an indictment of this appellant on November 16, 1959 on a charge of rape. At his first trial in January 1960, the jury failed to agree. During his second trial the appellant withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to a lesser included offense of assault with intent to commit rape. Appellant thereafter filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate that plea of guilty on the ground that he had been mentally incompetent at the time of trial. After a hearing on March 12, 1962, the District Court granted his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty and an order was entered committing the appellant to St. Elizabeths hospital for a mental examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The acting superintendent on June 11, 1962 certified to the court the conclusion of St. Elizabeths staff that the appellant was mentally competent to stand trial and, to the extent he had been suffering as of October 5, 1959 from \u25a0\u201cAnxiety Reaction (Conversion Features),\u201d the alleged criminal offense \u201cwas not a product of this mental disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Az5\">Since the appellant\u2019s discharge from \u25a0St. Elizabeths he had had six court-appointed attorneys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s own motions, his disagreements or dissatisfaction with counsel and problems involving the succession of attorneys had occasioned the largest share of whatever delay occurred. I think the speedy trial issue should be resolved against him in light of <em>Smith v. United </em>States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">As to his contention that he improperly was brought to trial without an adjudication of his restored competency following examination at St. Elizabeths, it may be noted first that no objection was raised on that ground. Moreover, this court has held that \u201can unchallenged certificate of the hospital superintendent * * * obviates the necessity for further proceedings on the question of sanity.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">As to his claim of double jeopardy, the proceedings which had resulted in the first conviction on his plea of guilty to the charge of assault with intent to commit rape were reopened and that conviction was set aside on the appellant\u2019s own motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He thus is in no position to complain.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">The record before us discloses no error affecting substantial rights.
