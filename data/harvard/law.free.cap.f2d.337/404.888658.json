The Referee in Bankruptcy, after \u00e1 hearing, resolved this question against the appellant, and the District Court, Judge Young, after analysis of the evidence in light of the applicable legal principles, affirmed the decision of the Referee in Bankruptcy. Judge Young\u2019s soundly reasoned opinion is reported, sub nom, In Re Westbrook, 228 F.Supp. 966 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">We have carefully reviewed the record, the findings of the Referee in Bankruptcy and the opinion of the District Court, and have considered the contentions of appellant. We conclude the findings of the Referee, sustained by the District Court, are fully supported by the evidence and are not clearly erroneous. We therefore affirm on the basis of the opinion of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
