Murphy Corporation v. United States, D.C., 230 F.Supp. 583 (1964). This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">A thorough examination of the authorities cited and others having any relevancy to the question presented satisfies us that the judgment appealed from is correct and we affirm on the basis of the trial court\u2019s opinion. Like Judge Henley, we are not persuaded that Burton-Sutton Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 328 U.S. 25, 66 S.Ct. 861, 90 L.Ed. 1062 (1946) has the effect of changing the law as announced by the Courts of Appeals and by the Tax Court in cases cited in the trial court\u2019s opinion. Since the issue presented in this case was not before the Supreme Court in Burton-Sutton, we have difficulty in adopting appellant\u2019s suggestion that the broad generalization contained in the two sentences taken from the Burton-Sutton opinion demonstrates fundamental error in the prior decisions of the Courts of Appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Jefferson Lake Sulphur Co. v. Lambert, D.C., 133 F.Supp. 197, affirmed 5 Cir., 236 F.2d 542 (1956) which lends support to appellant\u2019s position, was in our view influenced in large part by the statements of the Supreme Court in Burton-Sutton, quoted in the margin. Inasmuch as we do not regard such language, seemingly controversial, as having the effect of overruling long standing Treasury Regulations and decisional law, the validity of Jefferson Lake is, in our view, greatly diminished and certainly it does not control the disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\">. In Burton-Sutton the court was concerned with the tax treatment of a lease payment in the form of net profits. In its discussion, the court made these statements seized upon by appeEant in support of its contentions; 328 U.S. at page 27, 66 S.Ct. at page 863: \u201cIf they are capital investments to one, they are capital sales to the other. If they are rents and royalties paid out to one, they are rents and royalties received by the other.\u201d We note that Freling, Bonus Payments Through the Looking Glass, P-H OIL <em>&amp; </em>GAS TAXES \u00a7 2027 (1926) cited by appeEant, takes issue with the court\u2019s view in this language: \u201cAt least one sentence in the foregoing quotation from Burton-Sutton is incorrect, and the Tax Court [Shamrock Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 35 T.C. 979, 1054, et seq. (1961)] rightly makes short shrift of the notion. Merely because an expenditure is a capital investment to the payor does not necessarHy mean that there has been a capital sale by the payee.\u201d Page 2514 of \u00a7 2027.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
