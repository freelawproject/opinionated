On substantial evidence considering the record as a whole-the Board found that respondent had violated Section 8(a) (1) (3) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, as modified by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The order requires respondent to cease and desist and to take affirmative action appropriate to the violations found. The details of the case are reported at 144 N.L.R.B.. No. 33 and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-23\">Except for one matter to be mentioned, -the issues are purely factual, and we may not disturb the resolution of those issues by the Board since, as we have said, its findings are based on substantial evidence considering the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-24\">The Board\u2019s opinion refers to \u25a0 events which took place more than six months prior to the filing of the charges. Respondent contends this was contrary to the provisions of Section 10(b) of the-Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> citing Local Lodge No. 1424, International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. NLRB, 362 U.S. 411, 80 S.Ct. 822, 4 L.Ed.2d 832. We do not agree, for in the present case the unfair labor practices found by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Hoard were within the six-month period.
