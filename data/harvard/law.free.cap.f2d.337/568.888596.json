It entered into a subcontract with Burns &amp; Roe, Inc., for engineering and construction work. In turn Burns &amp; Roe issued to plaintiff Austin, and Austin accepted, a so-called purchase order whereby Austin agreed to do the architectural, structural and mechanical phases of the work to be done at station 13 by Burns &amp; Roe under its subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Austin completed the work under his subcontract with Burns &amp; Roe, but was unable to pay for-all the labor and material furnished by others in the performance of this contract. Austin\u2019s surety, Great American, paid labor and material claims totalling $22,279.96. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint claims a balance due from defendants in the sum of $111,465.II.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was filed on December 7, 1961, although plaintiffs contend that it was delivered to the clerk of the district court on December 6 and should have been filed as of that date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">On December 8, 1962, defendants filed their motion for summary judgment on the grounds (1) that the suit was not instituted within one year from the date on which the last of the labor was performed or material supplied<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; and (2) that the plaintiff Austin\u2019s notice of claim was insufficient for the reason that it did not state \u201cwith substantial accuracy the amount claimed\u201d by plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">On January 10, 1963, plaintiffs filed a notice of motion for an order correcting the filing date on the complaint to December 6, 1961, the date on which the complaint was delivered to the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">The two motions were heard by the district court on February 4, 1963. The case had also been calendared for a pretrial conference on the same date. Counsel for plaintiff indicated that he was not ready for pretrial and that further discovery was necessary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>\u00a1trial conference was continued to March 11, 1963. No conference was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">An order was entered February 11, 1963, granting defendants\u2019 motion for \u00a1summary judgment, and findings of fact, \u25a0conclusions of law and judgment were \u25a0entered February 21, 1963. An order was entered March 11, 1963, denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to correct the filing date of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Appellants appealed from the judgment \u00a1and the order denying their motion to \u25a0correct the filing date. On September 10, 1963, an order was entered in this \u25a0court dismissing the appeal for the reason that neither the summary judgment nor the order was appealable, but suggesting that if the district court should \u00a1see fit to make the determination and .give the direction specified in Rule 54 (b) <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> of the </em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and enter judgment in conformity therewith, an appeal- therefrom could be heard upon the briefs and record of the proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">On October 16, 1963, the district court \u25a0entered an order amending its order \u25a0of February 11, 1963, to provide that .the judgment entered in favor of the \u2022defendants should be a final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b). On October 21, 1963, amended findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment were \u25a0entered in conformity with the amended order and the provisions of Rule 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">The summary judgment was granted on the first ground of defendants\u2019 motion, i. e., that plaintiffs\u2019 action was filed more than one year from the date on which the last labor was performed and material supplied by the plaintiff Austin. The district court did not pass upon the question of the sufficiency of the notice of the claim filed by Austin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">The court found that plaintiff Austin \u201csubstantially completed the work and the furnishing of material * * * on or about October 25, 1960\u201d; that the labor and material furnished subsequent to that date \u201cwere of a minor nature, such as cleanup, repair, correction or installing overlooked items as noted by Burns &amp; Roe, Inc., in its punch list\u201d; and that \u201cwritten notice of nonpayment was given by plaintiff Austin to Western Electric on December 14, 1960, stating that the work of the subcontract * * * was completed on or about October 25, 1960\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">Appellants contend, inter alia, that the \u201cdistrict court erred in weighing the evidence and resolving issues rather than determining that there were issues to be resolved in a regular trial\u201d. The record suggests that this may be true. There is no recital in the court order, findings of fact, or judgment that the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and affidavits \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rule 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The findings of fact recite that \u201chaving considered all of the evidence and having examined all of the proofs offered by the respective parties\u201d, the court makes its findings of fact \u2014 a form customarily followed where the court has weighed the evidence and resolved the issues. Rule 52(a), by amendment effective March 19, 1948, specifically provides that, \u201cFindings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions\u201d for summary judgment under Rule 56. We recognize, however, that findings of fact and conclusions of law are frequently used in granting motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As suggested in Trowler v. Phillips, 9 Cir. 1958, 260 F.2d 924, 926, findings of fact, \u201cwhile unnecessary\u201d, sometimes \u201cprovide a handy summary\u201d. On the other hand, \u201call too often a set of unnecessary findings of fact is the telltale flag that points the way to a discovery that summary judgment should not have been granted\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">If the district court were permitted to weigh the evidence and resolve issues in making its findings of fact and conclusions of law, we could properly find from the evidence here that the findings and conclusions should be sustained. It is necessary to determine, however, whether viewing the evidence as a whole and the inferences to be di-awn therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff it may be said that there is no genuine issue of fact,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> mindful also of the fact that there is no express finding to that effect by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">A determination as to whether there is a genuine issue of fact involves three related questions: (1) is \u201csubstantial completion\u201d the proper test as to when the last of the labor is performed or materials supplied; (2) were any of the so-called \u201cpunch list\u201d items performed and furnished on or after December 7, 1960, and if so, were they required to complete the subcontract of the plaintiff Austin; and (3) are plaintiffs bound by the notice given by the plaintiff Austin on December 14, 1960?</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The Miller Act \u201cis entitled to a liberal construction and application in order properly to effectuate the Congressional intent to protect those whose labor and materials go into public projects. * * * But such a salutary policy does not justify ignoring plain words of limitation and imposing wholesale liability on payment bonds\u201d. Clifford F. MacEvoy Co. v. U. S., 1944, 322 U.S. 102, 107, 64 S.Ct. 890, 88 L.Ed. 1163; United States v. Carter, 1956, 353 U.S. 210, 77 S.Ct. 793, 1 L.Ed.2d 776; Apache Powder Co. v. Ashton Co., 9 Cir. 1959, 264 F.2d 417, 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">As noted supra, a subcontractor is required to give notice of his claim within 90 days from the date on which he performed the last labor or furnished or supplied the last material for which claim is made. He must file suit within one year from the same date. Appellees contend that the critical date is when the contract was \u201csubstantially performed\u201d. Apparently, the district court adopted this test and found that the work was \u201csubstantially completed\u201d on October 25, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">We do not find the phrases \u201csubstantially performed\u201d or \u201csubstantially completed\u201d used in any of the decided cases. A more accurate statement of the test to be applied is whether the work was performed and the material supplied as a \u201cpart of the original contract\u201d or for the \u201cpurpose of correcting defects, or making repairs following in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>spection of the project\u201d. See United States v. Gunnar I. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., 8 Cir. 1962, 310 F.2d 899, where the court held that two bus duct elbows were component parts of an electrical equipment distribution system, although there was no evidence \u201cas to the cost or value of such elbows, or as to whether they were of major or minor importance\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The case which proved persuasive with the district court, United States for Use of McGregor Architectural Iron Co. v. Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corporation, N.D.Pa.1960, 185 F.Supp. 381, is distinguishable. There the court found, after trial, that the subcontractor supplied the last materials on his contract by January, 1954; that the \u201ccorrection of errors in the work performed * * * completed in early 1954 and which consisted in supplying some missing bolts and closing some holes in the head posts, which had been overlooked, was pursuant to an inspection made in 1955 followed by notice thereof and not part of the original performance of the contract\u201d. The court\u2019s \u201cdiscussion\u201d called attention to the fact that the work had been completed by January, 1954, and that it was \u201cmost significant that a year and a half later two hours of labor were performed on June 9, 1955, and eight hours of labor on June 20,1955, without charge, followed by a carefully worded formal notice on June 22, 1955\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Attached to \u201cDeclaration of Barney Austin in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d as an exhibit is a \u201cpunch list\u201d, dated October 13, 1960, containing some 60 items, and sent to Austin by Burns &amp; Roe on October 20. The letter of transmittal called it a \u201cpunch list of work covered by your contract\u201d and stated that the work must be completed by October 26, I960.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In other words, it was not a list submitted after completion of the work and limited' to corrections and repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Appellees concede that there is a dispute as to the last date \u201cupon which the punch list items were completed\u201d,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but contend that the dispute is immaterial because the punch list items were in the nature of corrections of minor defects, not necessary to \u201csubstantial completion\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s contract. Many of the items in the punch list, however, appear to be work required' for the \u201ccompletion of the project\u201d.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Others obviously were in the nature of corrections, repairs and cleanup.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Appellees rely heavily upon the notice-prepared, signed and verified by Austin\u2019s; attorney and mailed to the prime contractor on or about December 14, 1960. This notice reads in pertinent part: \u201cYou and each of you will please take notice that on or about the 25th day of October, 1960, Barney Austin * * * completed the furnishing of labor, material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>and services upon a certain project, known as Project Mercury * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">With reference to this notice, plaintiff Austin answered interrogatories submitted by defendants in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">Interrogatory 54: \u201cMr. Butts (Austin\u2019s attorney) was authorized and directed to prepare and serve such notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">Interrogatory 56: \u201cEach and all of the allegations or factual statements contained in the document are affirmed as being substantially true as of the date of that document and in accordance with the knowledge of answering plaintiff and Mr. Butts at that time.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">Interrogatory 136: \u201cAs of December 14j 1960, the statement referred to * * * was probably true and correct according to the knowledge of Mr. Robert Butts at that time, but it was not correct in accordance with the knowledge of Barney Austin at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">In answer to other interrogatories, Austin stated that the \u201clast work as far as physically completing the work of the subcontract on the job site, was December 9, 1960, * * * \u201d (Interrogatory 71) ; that he furnished labor or materials in prosecution of the work subsequent to \u201con or about October 25, 1960 (Int\u00e9rrogatory 138); and that he would rely upon \u201cpayroll records, material bills, testimony of myself and of my employees\u201d to prove the truth of his answer to interrogatory 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">In a deposition Austin testified that the statement that the job was completed on or about October 25, 1960, was correct, \u201cwith the exception of the work that was requested on the punch list\u201d. In Austin\u2019s \u201cdeclaration\u201d it is recited that, \u201cOn or about November 2, 1960, the work of the subcontract had been substantially completed so far as he could determine, excepting such items of work which may have been unintentionally omitted or failed to receive approval of a government inspector or Burns &amp; Roe\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">The testimony with respect to what work, if any, Barber did on December 7, 8, and 9 is inconclusive, and it cannot be determined from the record whether this work may have been a part of the original contract, or corrections and repairs subsequent to the completion of the contract.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\"> Finally, appellees contend that Austin\u2019s \u201cDeclaration\u201d and Barber\u2019s affidavit must be totally disregarded, as \u201cpresumably\u201d each \u201cwas in the court below\u201d, for the reason that they failed to comply with Rule 56(e). It is true, as appellees contend and appellants con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>cede, that the declaration is not an affidavit. It is a recital of facts followed by the statement, \u201cI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct\u201d. This would be sufficient under the California law,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and counsel for appellants state that the use of this form rather than an affidavit was inadvertent on the part of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">No objection* was interposed to the use of this declaration at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, and counsel for both parties referred to the declaration in their oral argument to the trial court. The declaration would have been subject to a motion to strike. Had appellees made such a motion or otherwise objected to the use of the declaration, the defect could have been remedied by appellants filing an affidavit in lieu of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Moreover, while Rule 56(e) does not state any different requirement for opposing affidavits than for the movant\u2019s affidavits, \u201cthe papers supporting the movant are closely scrutinized whereas the opponent\u2019s are indulgently treated\u201d. Bohn Aluminum &amp; Brass Corp. v. Storm King Corp., 6 Cir. 1962, 303 F.2d 425. See also 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 2123-6, \u00a7 56.15(3); p. 2336, \u00a7 56.22; Cammack v. Howard, D.C.Cir. 1946, 154 F.2d 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Under these circumstances, and particularly in view of the fact that no pretrial conference was held, it is our opinion that neither the trial court nor this court is precluded from considering the declaration.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The same is true of the Barber affidavit.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In any event, this affidavit simply corroborates the Austin deposition with respect to the days worked, and the deposition in itself is sufficient to raise this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Viewing the evidence as a whole and the inferences which may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff we cannot say that there is no genuine issue of fact with respect (1) to whether work was performed on or after December 7, 1960, and (2) whether any work which may have been performed on or after that date was required to complete the subcontract of the plaintiff Austin.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-25\">. 40 U.S.O. \u00a7 270a et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">. The complaint asserts two causes of action: the first, based on the Miller Act, against Western Electric and its surety; the second, for breach of contract, against Burns &amp; Roe, Inc. The second cause of action is still pending in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\">.. It is contended that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was delivered to the clerk of court on December 6, 1961; that the clerk informed the person who submitted the complaint for filing that it could not be filed because it contained a fictitious defendant in contravention of a local rule; that the clerk retained the pleading, stating that if a dismissal of the fictitious defendant were filed, the \u201csituation would be remedied\u201d; that a dismissal was filed on December 7 and the complaint marked filed as of that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\">.

The nearest approach to such a finding is the statement in the order granting the motion for summary judgment that, \u201cIt appears without conflict from the evidence and interrogatories on file that on October 25, 1960, the use plaintiff had <em>substantially </em>\u2018completed the furnishing of labor, materials and services\u2019 * * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">.

An issue of fact may arise from inferences to be drawn from the evidence, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue as to a material fact must be resolved against the party moving for a summary judgment.

The fact that the work performed or material furnished was minor in nature is not conclusive, where the work is performed or material furnished in connection with the completion of the project and not for the purpose of correcting defects. See, for example, U. S. ex rel. Bourquin v. Chester Const. Co., 2 Cir., 1939, 104 F.2d 648; United States v. James Stewart Co., D.Idaho 1961, 195 F.Supp. 715; Noland Co. v.

The dispute arises as to whether any work was done on or after December 7, 1960. Austin testified in a deposition that C. W. Barber worked on December 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. An affidavit of Barber recites that be worked on December 5, 6, 7, and 8; that he refused \u201cto swear that he worked on December 9, 1960, but is reasonably certain that he did so, and avers that he was paid $121.92 by Barney Austin on December 9, 1960 for his work beginning on December 5, 1960\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b625-14\">.

It was affiant\u2019s intention by his answer to ratify the act of Robert Butts, his attorney, in preparing and serving the Miller Act notice and to state that the Miller Act notice represented the information which <em>Mr. Butts </em>had at the time the notice was prepared.

Mr. Butts was not informed by affiant of affiant\u2019s return to the job to do the additional and corrective work, as this did not appear significant at the time.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b626-16\">. In Ms deposition Austin suggests that the work on December 8 may have been weather stripping, but he was not positive. He recalls that Barber was \u201cin Area 2, the Telemetry Building\u201d on December 9; that he met Barber there and checked one job because Barber \u201cwas in the process of doing it. There was some honeycomb at the base of the tower foundation and he was dry-packing it with concrete\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\">. O.O.P. \u00a7 2015.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b627-10\">. The rule here applicable was stated in 3 Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure 171: \u201cAn affidavit which fails to meet the requirements of Buie 56(e) may be stricken on motion. In the absence of a motion to strike or other objection the court may properly choose to consider a document which technically fails to conform to the rule.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b627-21\">. Barber\u2019s affidavit contains a statement that he does not \u201cwaive his right which he may have to refuse to testify in the trial of the matter\u201d. The reason for including this statement was explained to the court by counsel for appellants in-reading Barber\u2019s affidavit. We see no-basis for Barber\u2019s claim of immunity from process. Should he have such right, it too could be waived. See Banco de Espana v. Federal Reserve Bank, 2 Cir. 1940, 114 F.2d 438.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
