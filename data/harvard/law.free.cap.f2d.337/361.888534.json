The plaintiff did not see the tractor until almost the moment of impact. He thought he had had time to touch his \u00a1brake pedal, but there was insufficient time for his brakes to take effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">\u2022Under these circumstances, the District Court directed a verdict for the defendant. It did so upon the theory that West Virginia law requires a motorist to look effectively and holds him guilty &lt;of dontributory negligence when he fails to see what a motorist exercising due care should have seen. Such contributory negligence is an absolute bar to recovery in West Virginia, whatever the fault of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">The District Court\u2019s conclusion was in accordance with the West Virginia authorities. Smith v. Penn Line Service, Inc., 145 W.Va. 1, 113 S.E.2d 505; Scott v. Hoosier Engineering Co., 117 W.Va. 395, 185 S.E. 553; Divita v. Atlantic Trucking Co., 129 W.Va. 267, 40 S.E.2d 324; Wolfe v. Beatty Motor Express, Inc., 143 W.Va. 238, 101 S.E.2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
