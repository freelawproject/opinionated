We also sustain the finding that the returns were fraudulent. Apart from other circumstances, each return reported less than half of the taxpayer\u2019s rather substantial income from dividends and interest during the taxable year. One return reported less than 10% of his income from those sources. The record makes clear that the taxpayer personally received these payments and must have been aware that his aggregate income from these sources was far in excess of the amounts reported, although he may not have kept the precise amounts of such receipts in mind. The taxpayer\u2019s explanation was that, although he signed his returns as prepared by his bookkeeper, he never read them or noticed the amounts of income reported therein. The Tax Court disbelieved this testimony and on the record was entitled to do so and to conclude that the very substantial omissions were intentional and for the purpose of evading taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-14\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
