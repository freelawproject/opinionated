It was brought on the theory that the defendant was responsible for the alleged wrong of officers in the office of West Virginia\u2019s Fire Marshal. The plaintiff contended that the doctrine of respondeat superior was applicable because the defendant reported to the Fire Marshal\u2019s office a fire which appeared to have been of incendiary origin, requested' prompt investigation of it and a copy of the Fire Marshal\u2019s report, coupled with the fact that funds for the operation of the Fire Marshal\u2019s office are derived entirely from taxes assessed by West Virginia upon fire insurance companies and measured by their West Virginia premium income.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">The District Judge held that the officials of the Fire Marshal\u2019s office were-discharging only their official duties as-prescribed by West Virginia\u2019s statutes- and did not act under the direction or the-control of the defendant. We agree with, him that the record shows no agency relationship, and that summary judgment for the defendant was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
