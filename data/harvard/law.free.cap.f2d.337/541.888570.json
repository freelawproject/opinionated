Concurrent sentences of 5 years on both counts 4 and 7 (\u00a7 4705(a)) and counts 6 and 9 (\u00a7 174) and of 2-6 years on counts 5 and 8 (\u00a7 4704(a)) were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The government\u2019s evidence was such that the jury could reasonably have found beyond a reasonable doubt that an undercover police officer in the company of a special employee of the Police Department on the latter two transactions had given appellant certain sums of money so that appellant could purchase narcotics for the undercover officer. Appellant testified in his own behalf that he-had participated in the transactions described by the government witnesses. His testimony raised the issue of entrapment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the court instructed the-jury on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">On this appeal it is claimed that, the District Court erred in not giving an instruction requested in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-14\">\u201cIf you believe that the Federal Agent..........or the informer, who acted under instructions and. authority of agents of the Federal' Bureau of Narcotics, asked the defendant to get some heroin for him and thereupon the defendant undertook to act in the prospective purchaser\u2019s behalf rather than his own,, and in so doing purchased the drug' from a third person with whom he-was not associated in selling, and' thereafter delivered it to the buyer, the defendant would not be a seller and <em>could not be convicted under this indictment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL-\">Counts 2, 5, and 8, as well as charging appellant with selling, dispensing, or distributing, charged him with the purchase of narcotics. The usual purchasing or procuring agent instruction would not be applicable to the offense of buying. See Kelley v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 122, 275 F.2d 10 (1960) (per curiam); United States v. Sizer, 292 F.2d 596, 599 n. 4 (4th Cir. 1961) (dictum).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Thus, the italicized portion of this instruction is too broad and was correctly-refused ; the addition of a limitation such as \u201cfor the offense of selling,\u201d at the end of the proposed charge would have made the charge correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The purchasing agent instruction is required when requested on a \u00a7 4705 (a) <em>selling </em>charge \u2014 here counts 4 and 7 \u25a0 \u2014 when the evidence would warrant it. Kelley v. United States, supra; United States v. Sawyer, 210 F.2d 169, 170 (3d Cir. 1954); see Willis v. United States, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 221, 223-224, 285 F.2d 663, 665-666 (1960) (dictum); Vasquez v. United States, 290 F.2d 897 (9th Cir. 1961); Adams v. United States, 220 F.2d 297 (5th Cir. 1955); United States v. Somohano, 193 F.Supp. 201, 203 (D.Conn.1961) (as to sale under \u00a7 174).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Thus, a procuring agent instruction was required in this case as to the offense of selling under \u00a7 4705(a), and failure to so instruct would call for reversal for a new trial as to counts 4 and 7. However, appellant\u2019s 5 year sentences under those counts were made concurrent with 5 year sentences on the \u00a7 174 counts (counts 6 and 9) charging him only with <em>facilitating </em>the concealment and sale of narcotics, not the sale itself. In the <em>Willis </em>case, <em>supra, </em>this court seems to have indicated that a purchasing agent can be convicted under \u00a7 174 of facilitating concealment or sale, rejecting a contention that a sale as to all three statutory sections had to be proved. The cases in other federal jurisdietions are divided on the question. See United States v. Prince, 264 F.2d 850, 853 (3d Cir. 1959) (reversing for failure to instruct on procuring agent theory as to facilitating a sale under \u00a7 174, although such instruction had been given as to sale counts); Jackson v. United States, 311 F.2d 686, 690 (5th Cir. 1963) (dictum as to facilitating sale); United States v. Somohano, <em>supra </em>(as to facilitating sale); <em>cf. </em>Henderson v. United States, 261 F.2d 909, 912 (5th Cir. 1959) (alternative ground); United States v. Moses, 220 F.2d 166 (3d Cir. 1955). To the contrary is Bruno v. United States, 259 F.2d 8, 10 (9th Cir. 1958) (alternative grounds): \u201cThe uncontradicted evidence that Bruno delivered to [Undercover Agent] Velasquez the heroin and received the payments therefor, shows facilitation of the sales.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Cf. </em>Jasso v. United States, 290 F.2d 671, 673 (5th Cir.) (dictum), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 858, 82 S.Ct. 97, 7 L.Ed.2d 55 (1961); Rios v. United States, 283 F.2d 134 (9th Cir. 1960) (affirming conviction for facilitating sale by knowingly transporting <em>purchaser </em>to place of buy). See also Vasquez v. United States, supra, 290 F.2d at 899 (noting lack of stated rationale in <em>Prince </em>case).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">We are unable to see any reason why a procuring agent may not be convicted of <em>facilitating </em>a sale of illegally imported narcotics; we cannot ignore what to us seems unmistakably plain language in \u00a7 174: \u201cWhoever fraudulently or knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>* * * receives, conceals, buys, sells, <em>or in any manner facilitates the * </em>* * <em>sale * </em>* 70 Stat. 570 (1956), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (1958). In short, one who acts as a conduit facilitates the end result. Since buying and selling are made individual offenses, we do not believe that Congress intended to proscribe only conduct facilitating <em>the seller; </em>it made criminal conduct which \u201cin any manner facilitates <em>the </em>* * * <em>sale </em>* * *,\u201d rather than only that conduct which facilitates the seller, as distinguished from the buyer. A sale by definition subsumes a transaction between buyer and seller; the act of each is essential to produce a \u201csale.\u201d The reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the <em>Bruno </em>case seems correct to us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">\u201c\u2018[Facilitates\u2019 of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 \u2018in any manner facilitates a sale\u2019 has \u2018the common and ordinary definition as expressed by a standard dictionary. Quoting from Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary, \u201cfacilitate\u201d is defined as follows: \u201cTo make easy or less difficult; to free from difficulty or impediment; as to facilitate the execution of a task.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Bruno v. United States, <em>supra </em>259 F.2d at 10. In this sense, the procuring agent, who is a type of \u201cmiddleman,\u201d or \u201cbroker,\u201d inevitably facilitates the \u201csale.\u201d To acquit one who makes more easy or otherwise aids or assists the <em>purchase </em>and convict one who facilitates the <em>selling </em>would exalt hair-splitting at the expense of common sense and substance; we may not close our eyes to the simple words of \u00a7 174, \u201cin any manner.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the judgments against appellant on counts 6 and <em>9.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Ordinarily, under Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943), affirmance of the \u00a7 174 counts would, because of the concurrence of the 5 year sentences, obviate our passing upon the validity of the \u00a7 4705(a) counts, since failure to instruct on the purchasing agent theory as to the \u00a7 4705 (a) sale counts could not have prejudiced appellant under the \u00a7 174 counts which did not charge a sale. However, concurrently with the four 5 year sentences, appellant also received concurrent sentences of 2-6 years on counts 5 and 8 under \u00a7 4704(a). Since we conclude that failure to give the purchasing agent instruction as to the \u00a7 4704(a) counts was prejudicial error as to the \u201csale\u201d offenses charged in those counts, affirmance of the facilitating offenses does not preclude reversal of the remaining 4 counts. The government is, of course, free to re-try appellant on those counts under appropriate instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">As we noted earlier, purchase by a procuring agent violates a proscription against <em>buying </em>illicit narcotics. However, when an indictment under \u00a7 4704(a) charges the offense of selling as well as purchasing, the procuring agent instruction is required in the same way as for a sale charged under \u00a7 4705(a), provided the evidence of \u201cprocuring\u201d is present. Under an indictment charging the offenses of \u00a7 4704(a) the jury is entitled to convict by inferring a purchase from appellant\u2019s unexplained possession of the drug, but it may also convict by finding directly, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant sold the narcotics in violation of the statute. We need not speculate on which theory the jury here relied; a conviction on counts 2 and 6 under \u00a7 4704(a) may have rested on a finding of \u201cselling\u201d which might have been obviated by a procuring agent instruction here required by the evidence. Whenever a sale of narcotics is charged, it is \u201cessential that the jury be instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>as to the elements necessary to establish a sale by the appellant.\u201d Kelley v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. at 123, 275 F.2d at 11. (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">We have considered appellant\u2019s other contentions and hold that the issue of entrapment was properly submitted to the jury on correct instructions and that no error affecting substantial rights was committed by the admission on rebuttal of evidence of transactions subsequent to those charged in the present indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Affirmed as to counts 6 and 9; reversed and remanded as to counts 4, 5, 7 and 8.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\">. 68A Stat. 551 (1954), as amended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a) (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\">. 68A Stat. 550 (1954), as amended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\">. 70 Stat. 570 (1956), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b595-10\">. Appellant\u2019s testimony was that on the last occasion he had been allowed to keep some narcotics for himself; this purported profit is not necessarily inconsistent with an agency theory, <em>infra, </em>for \u201cagents\u201d do not necessarily act gratuitously. In any event, our holding in Kelley v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 122, 275 F.2d 10 (1960) (per curiam), rejected the government\u2019s contention that appellant\u2019s own case must be consistent with the procuring agent theory; in <em>Kelley, </em>appellant had denied her part in the transactions. The purchasing agent theory, rather than constituting a defense, like entrapment or self-defense, for example, derives from a defendant\u2019s right to an instruction on all elements that must be proved to establish the offense charged. See United States v. Massiah, 307 F.2d 62, 71 (2d Cir. 1962) (majority opinion of Judges Hays and Waterman on this point citing the <em>Kelley </em>case for the above proposition), reversed on other grounds, 84 S.Ct. 1199 (May 18, 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b595-20\">. <em>Cf. </em>Vasquez v.

We note that the indictment as to those counts is drawn far more restrictively than the normal indictment that charges all offenses under \u00a7 174; as indicated earlier, counts 6 and 9 charged appellant only with facilitating the concealment and sale and not with the sale itself. Had the indictment charged a sale under \u00a7 174, disposition in accordance with our holding as to the proper instruction under \u00a7 4704(a), <em>infra, </em>would be dictated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b598-6\">WRIGHT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_G\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">I concur in the court\u2019s well reasoned opinion reversing as to counts 4, 5, 7 and 8.

One who is a procuring agent for the buyer is, under the law, neither the seller nor the facilitator of the sale. United States v. Prince, 3 Cir., 264 F.2d 850, 853 (1959); United States v.
