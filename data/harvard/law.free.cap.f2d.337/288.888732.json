We think it clear that under the Georgia cases as exemplified by Chancey v. Cobb, 102 Ga.App. 636, 117 S.E.2d 189, the child riding with its mother was \u201c[a] minor child of tender years riding at the invitation of the driver and owner of [the] automobile, with the express consent and acceptance of its mother,\u201d and thus the child was \u201ca guest of the driver * * * within the rule rendering the driver liable to such guest only for gross negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-27\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
