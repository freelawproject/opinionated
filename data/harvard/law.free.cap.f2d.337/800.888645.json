App. \u00a7 462.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was tried in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey with a jury and was sentenced to a term of two years imprisonment. The execution of the sentence was suspended and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>he was placed on probation for five years subject to a special condition that he should report to the New Jersey State Hospital at Greystone Park, New Jersey, for civilian work for a period of two years. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Much testimony was adduced and many documents were presented at the trial from which it appeared that: The appellant was born March 26, 1938 in Jersey City, New Jersey. He registered under the Selective Service System with Local Board No. 24 for New Jersey. He returned his classification questionnaire to the Board on June 29, 1957, in which he claimed that by religious training and belief he was conscientiously opposed to war in any form. He requested the Board to furnish him with a special conscientious objector form (SSS Form 150).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Upon its receipt he filled it in, indicating that he was a Christian of no particular sect, but that, under the guidance of his parents, he had engaged in Bible study and discussions, as a result of which he reached the conclusion that he could not conscientiously participate in war. He returned the form September 12, 1957. After the lapse of considerable time and opportunity for appellant to substantiate his request the Board, on May 18, 1961, classified him as a conscientious objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Having been ordered to report, on August 2, 1961, for a physical examination, appellant, on August 1, 1961, wrote the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-7\">\u201cTo take the physical examination is in conflict with my conscientious beliefs. Please be advised I will not take the physical examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">\u201cI wish to inform you that I am willing to perform civilian work that contributes to the maintenance of national health, safety or interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atm\">He did not take the physical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Thereafter, various exchanges took place between the Board and appellant concerning the civilian work in which he could engage in lieu of induction into the Armed Forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">On October 17, 1961, the Board wrote appellant, stating that within the next ten days he should report and make application for maintenance, hospital, or institutional work in one of the following institutions in New Jersey: State Hospital at Greystone Park; the NeuroPsychiatric Institution at Skillman; or the State Hospital at Marlboro.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">In a letter dated October 27, 1961, appellant replied stating that only two of the institutions had answered his letter inquiries, and that the only position open was institutional attendant. Regarding this position, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-13\">\u201cI believe it is my duty to inform you, within the ten day limit of your letter, of October 17, 1961 that I am not offering to perform the limited choice of job open to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">Again, various exchanges between the Board and appellant concerning civilian work in lieu of induction took place culminating in a meeting at the office of the Board on June 21, 1962, attended by appellant, members of the Board, and a representative of the State Director. It was agreed there that appellant should apply for a job the next day, June 22, at the New Jersey State Hospital, Grey-stone Park, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">On June 26, 1962, the appellant visited the Greystone Park State Hospital for an interview and filled out an application for employment there. John G. Matybell, the personnel assistant of the Hospital, who interviewed appellant, stated at the trial that to the best of his knowledge, he neither accepted nor rejected appellant\u2019s application for a job. He also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnHj\">\u201cI told him about the jobs that were available at the present time and he didn\u2019t say either yes or no that he would accept them or that he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">Appellant testified that Mr. Matybell promised to notify him by letter when a position was open for which he was fit. Contrariwise, Mr. Matybell stated at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>trial that to the best of his knowledge he did not remember promising to so inform him since \u201c[m]ost of the correspondence is handled through the Selective Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">In response to the Board\u2019s letter the State Hospital informed the Board by letter dated June 28, 1962 that the position of institutional attendant at $59 per week was available. \u201cIf Mr. Lawson was interested in this type of employment,\u201d the letter of the Hospital continued, \u201cI [Thomas M. Russo, personnel director] would appreciate having him complete and return the enclosed application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">In a letter dated August 7,1962, appellant informed the Board that since July 4, 1962 he had been working for Goodwill Industries in Jersey City, New Jersey. It was his belief that this job fulfilled his civilian work obligation, since it appeared on a list of approved agencies and projects at Selective Service Headquarters in Newark during January of 1962. Goodwill Industries, however, had no such approval in New Jersey at that time though it was on the approved list of other states. The Board notified appellant of this fact by letter dated August 17, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Before receiving appellant\u2019s letter of August. 7, 1962, a copy of an order was mailed to him on that same date, the substance of which is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">\u201cSelective Service System Order to Report for Civilian Work and Statement of Employer</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">\n<em>August 7,1962</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">(Date o\u00a3 mailing)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">\u201cTo <em>Lloyd Odin Lawson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">(First name) (Middle name) (Last name)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">\n<em>28 2h 88 85</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">(Selective Service No.)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-17\">\u201cMailing address <em>1709 Summit Avenue Union City</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-18\">(Street and number) (City)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">\n<em>New Jersey</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-20\">(Zone) (State)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-21\">\u201cHaving been found to be acceptable for civilian work contributing to the maintenance of national health, safety, or interest you have been assigned to <em>Institutional Work </em>located at <em>New Jersey State Hospital, Greystone Park, New Jersey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-22\">\u201cYou are ordered to report to the local board named above at <em>9 A. M. </em>on <em>20th </em>day of <em>August, </em>1962, where you will be given instructions to proceed to the place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-23\">\u201cYou are ordered to report for employment pursuant to the instructions of the local board to remain in employment for twenty-four (24) consecutive months or until such time as you are released or transferred by proper authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-24\">\u201cYou will be instructed as to your duties at the place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-25\">\u201cFailure to report at the hour and on the day named in this order, or to proceed to the place of employment pursuant to instructions, or to remain in this employment the specified time will constitute a violation of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended, which is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-26\">/s/ Nancy M. Kukowski</p>\n<p id=\"b857-27\">Nancy M. Kukowski, Clerk</p>\n<p id=\"b857-28\">(Clerk or Member of the Local Board)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>In a letter dated August 15, 1962, appellant acknowledged receipt of the order notifying him to report for a civilian work assignment at the New Jersey State Hospital on August 20. In addition, he again indicated a belief that his work at Goodwill Industries fulfilled the requirements of a civilian work assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">In a letter dated August 17, 1962, the Board notified appellant that Goodwill Industries is not approved by the State of New Jersey although approved in other states. This letter reiterated to appellant that he should \u201creport as ordered to this Local Board on Monday, August 20, 1962, at 9:00 A.M. to be forwarded to the New Jersey State Hospital at Greystone, New Jersey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">On August 20, 1962, the Board received a letter from Colonel MacGrath, State Director of the Selective Service System. It stated, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">\u201cWhile the Goodwill Industries appear on the list of approved employers, the State Director of New Jersey has never approved any of their projects for employment of conscientious objectors in New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">\u201cInasmuch as the Director has approved the order to civilian work, the above registrant should be expected to report as ordered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">On August 20, 1962, the appellant reported at the office of the Board. He told Miss Nancy M. Kukowski, the Clerk of the Board, that he had not yet received the letter dated August 17, 1962. In addition, he said that he would like postponement for a few days of the order to report to the State Hospital so that he could, according to Miss Kukowski, \u201cclear up some business.\u201d She replied that there could be no postponement and he was expected to report to the New Jersey State Hospital that day. Miss Kukowski stated that appellant then answered that he had to take care of some business first.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">Appellant has conceded that he failed to go to the New Jersey State Hospital on August 20, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">The State Director of Selective Service wrote to appellant on August 27, 1962. He stated that appellant\u2019s work with Goodwill Industries in Jersey City, New Jersey could not be approved. Two of the reasons set forth in the letter were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-14\">\u201c* * * Goodwill Industries have not been approved by this Headquarters and also according to the National Policy of the Selective Service System, as set forth in Section 1660.21(a) of Selective Service Regulations, conscientious objectors are not assigned to civilian work projects located in the same area in which they reside.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">The letter also observed: \u201c[Y]ou are under continuing duty to comply with the order of your local board to report for civilian work at the New Jersey State Hospital, Greystone Park, New Jersey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">On January 16, 1963, the indictment of the appellant was filed, followed by trial and conviction, as heretofore stated.</p>\n<p id=\"AM8\">\u2014I\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">Appellant contends that counsel for the Government made improper remarks during his summation to the jurors which were prejudicial and inflamed them against him to such an extent as to constitute grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">He points to the following statement by the prosecuting attorney toward the end of his closing address in which he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-19\">\u201c * * * Do you believe that when that man testified that the rubber stamp stopped him from going down that that was the truth? Of the 800,000 other people who get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>these orders through the mail 99.9 per cent of them comply. They don\u2019t have any problem here. And this man didn\u2019t have any problem either.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">\u201c * * * We don\u2019t come before you as an atheistic government, we are a nation of laws and as Abraham Lincoln said, a nation under God, under God. And at Gettysburg he said we are here to remember those men and so that this nation under God, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom. And those men at Gettysburg, ladies and gentlemen, they were buried and they fought and they died. I don\u2019t know whether they had Selective Service laws in those days \u2014 they probably volunteered, they probably volunteered because they loved their country and they were willing to see that something was done for it. And now they are buried in the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-10\">\u201cAnd this is why we are here today and this is why we are a nation of strong and independent people. * * *\"<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">There were no objections in any form by counsel for appellant to those comments by the Government. He raised his objection for the first time on appeal, asserting that the closing remarks of the Government \u201cinsinuated untruthfully that the defendant was atheistic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-20\"> If counsel for the appellant believed his adversary committed prejudicial error in his closing argument to the jury, he should have made this known to the court. Besides preserving the matter for appeal, he thereby would have afforded the trial court an opportunity to cure the error, if any, by rebuke, precautionary instruction to the jury, or some other action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-21\">Appellant, accordingly has a difficult burden to sustain in attempting to show that the closing remarks of the Government so aroused religious prejudices as to be reversible error. To be successful, he must bring this prosecution within those \u201cexceptional eases where justice would require us to reverse even though defense counsel voiced no objection to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks at the time.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-22\">To be sure, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires the recognition of errors affecting substantial rights regardless of whether they were brought to the attention of the court. Appellate courts always may notice errors which are obvious or which seriously affect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Indeed, counsel for appellant, himself, based part of his argument as to his client\u2019s innocence on religious references. The injection by appellant\u2019s counsel of this aspect in his summation may well have inspired the comments made by Government\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">It is not inferable that the questioned portion of the Government counsel\u2019s summation was for the purpose of implying that appellant was an atheist. Rather it was for the purpose of arguing that historically the Government had, like appellant, a religious background. The prosecution felt, apparently, that it would be at a disadvantage if appellant\u2019s praising of religion were greater than the Government\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Whether this kind of emotional appeal to the jury, by both the appellant and Government, was germane or aided the rational search for truth is questionable. But, the portion of the summation of the Government, to which this complaint was addressed, occasioned no infringement on any substantial rights of appellant. It was merely an effort to show that the Government was not being antireligious in the prosecution of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">In addition, appellant objects to other statements in the closing address of the Government. Allegedly, these comments \u201cinflamed the jury against him by virtually accusing him of being a hypocrite, and intimating and probably influencing the jury to believe that the defendant [appellant] was a liar and a slacker.\u201d Appellant bases this charge on these specific portions of the closing argument of Government\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-13\">\u201cIt is a little bit sad, and I think we made a mistake, there has been a mistake in this case and the mistake was when Selective Service headquarters ever classified him as a CO. He should have been 1-A. He is no more of a conscientious objector than the man in the moon. He is a conscientious objector and he won\u2019t show up at a mental hospital to do work which he acknowledged was in the national health, welfare and interest ? And where are we going to be if we continue to get people like that? How about these 800,000 registrants ? * * * This man would be content to fiddle while this country burned down. That is what he would do. * * * Sure he had a chance to volunteer. He was given a year. Read those regulations on this instrument, this document that Mr. Elfenbein is circulating, and it says if you are a conscientious objector \u2014 and that isn\u2019t any longer in this case, he was a conscientious objector, although I say we probably made a mistake in doing that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>Again, counsel for appellant made no \u25a0objection at the trial to these comments. He now raises his objection for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Throughout the trial the prosecution took the position that the Board had classified the appellant as a conscientious objector. It submitted as the only issue in the case that he had failed to comply with the obligation of this classification by ignoring what the Government contended was a valid order to report for civilian work at a State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In the heat of dispute in this trial, some latitude must be given to lawyer\u2019s language.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Of course the Assistant United States Attorney who tried the case as a representative of the Government is not an ordinary party to a controversy. Though he must prosecute with earnestness and vigor, he also must refrain from improper methods.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> His interjection of his personal belief that the Board erred in classifying the appellant as a conscientious objector can be said to be improper. But, after all, the Government based its case on the proposition that the Board correctly classified appellant as a conscientious objector. Its dissatisfaction with appellant, as already stated, was with his alleged failure to fulfill his duties as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">We are not persuaded that the remarks of the Government\u2019s counsel concerning the draft classification of appellant were such plain error as to command reversal. Moreover, notwithstanding the lack of objection by appellant, the District Court in its charge adequately cared for any confusion on this topic.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, it would be unrealistic to believe that the jurors in this case were so lacking in common sense as to allow the comments of Government\u2019s counsel on the draft classification of appellant to have a prejudicial effect in their eyes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">In a similar vein appellant without registering an objection at the trial<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> now takes exception to the following language of Government\u2019s counsel in his summation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-18\">\u201c * * * An3 then he [appellant] takes the stand, he says I have no knowledge about regulations and this and that and everything else, but I looked at this rubber stamp and I said this can\u2019t be any good. Where do you think he got that? He didn\u2019t know he was supposed to report to Greystone so he wrote in a letter dated August 15, 1962, \u2018I am in receipt of the order ordering me to go to Greystone.\u2019 That is what he wrote.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-19\">Appellant argues that the prosecution insinuated in the above paragraph that he was lying when he said that he did not believe that Form 153, dated August 7, 1962, was a genuine work order, \u201cfor if it were it would not have a rubber stamp instead of a signature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>The letter written by appellant on August 15, 1962 <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> actually said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-4\">\u201cI wish to acknowledge your letter in which you notify me to report for a civilian work assignment at New Jersey State Hospital, Grey-stone Park, New Jersey on August 20, 1962.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Thus appellant charges his letter did not specifically admit that he had received the \u201corder ordering me to Greystone.\u201d Appellant contends that it merely stated that he had received a \u201cletter in which you notify me to report for a civilian work assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Both documents eventually went to the jury where they were available for such evaluation as it determined they deserved. We cannot agree with appellant that the discrepancies in the prosecution\u2019s statement of the contents of appellant\u2019s letter of April 15, 1962 constituted a \u201cdeliberate distortion of a written document by the prosecution on such a major issue, as to when the defendant first made up the story he told on the stand\u201d and constituted \u201ca grave abuse of the defendant\u2019s rights to a fair jury trial.\u201d It is true that Government\u2019s counsel did not accurately quote from appellant\u2019s letter and attributed the word \u201corder\u201d to him instead of the word \u201cletter.\u201d It is obvious, however, that he was not reading from appellant\u2019s letter the verbatim contents. His statement was not, as appellant contends \u201can uncalled for fabrication.\u201d Nor do we find that appellant\u2019s letter contained, as appellant urges, \u201cno such language as quoted.\u201d The alleged \u2022 quotation was reasonably accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">The appellant also contends that the remark \u201cWhere do you think he got that?\u201d was a \u201creprehensible innuendo that the defendant\u2019s testimony was prompted by his lawyer.\u201d The question was unclear and at best rhetorical. It had, however, no consequences prejudicial to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-20\">In short, a scrutiny of all of appellant\u2019s fine tooth combing of the closing address of Government\u2019s counsel leaves us unconvinced that the appellant was unduly prejudiced or the jury inflamed by any statement to which he has taken exception on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-21\">\u2014II\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b862-22\">Appellant contends that his conviction should be reversed also on the ground that portions of the charge of the District Court were \u201ccontradictory, inconsistent and confusing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-23\">Appellant presented no objection at the end of the charge except to the definition of \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But, any error alleged to have been made in the definition of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d has not been laid as a ground for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-24\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30 <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> provides that a party may not assign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>as error any part of the charge unless he states distinctly the matter and grounds of his objection. Plainly, appellant failed to do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Considerations of assuring the accused a fair trial, however, will prevail over the important policy of having counsel point out errors immediately so that correction can occur then and there.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In short, if the error is basic and highly prejudicial<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the appellate court must give effect to the plain error rule,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which protects the substantial rights of the accused. Hence our inquiry is whether the charge amounted to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The portion of the charge against which the appellant mounts his attack is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALB\">\u201cAnd may I say at this time, members of the jury, that <em>you are to give no consideration to the fact that the defendant has been employed by the Goodwill Industries, </em>since July 4, 1962, because that employment was not in compliance with the order of August 7, 1962. Such employment, as I stated, is not in compliance with the work order issued. <em>But you may use this fact </em>in determining whether his act in not complying with the order of August 7, 1962, was knowingly, wilfully and unlawful. <em>Neither are you to consider, members of the jury, the fact that the defendant loent to Greystone Park </em>in June 1962 and filled out a questionnaire. This, too, was not in full compliance with the work order. <em>But again you may consider this fact </em>in determining whether his failure to comply with the work order was done unlawfully, knowingly and wilfully.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Appellant contends that this was a \u201cclear cut, definite and unconditional\u201d instruction to the jury that it should give no consideration to the appellant\u2019s job at Goodwill Industries, and that it is \u201ccontradictory, ambiguous and confusing\u201d with regard to an ensuing statement wherein the District Court said: \u201cBut you may use this fact in determining whether his act in not complying with the order of August 7, 1962, was knowingly,' wilfully and unlawful.\u201d Appellant complains that the same confusion and contradiction appear in the next three sentences of the charge. When the District Court charged: \u201c[Y]ou are to give no consideration to the fact that the defendant has been employed by the Goodwill Industries,\u201d it referred only to the argument of the appellant that this job fulfilled appellant\u2019s work obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">After the statement that no consideration should be given to the Goodwill Industries employment, the Court stated: \u201cBut you may use this fact in determining whether his act in not complying with the order of August 7, 1962, was knowingly, wilfully and unlawful.\u201d The use of the first word in this sentence \u2014 \u201cBut\u201d\u2014shows that the court was creating an exception to its general instruction that no consideration could be given to the Goodwill employment. Owing to the closeness of time in these pronouncements, it is unlikely that any confusion occurred in the comprehension of the charge by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">When the District Judge also said: \u201cNeither are you to consider members of the jury, the fact that the defendant went to Greystone Park in June 1962 and filled out a questionnaire,\u201d he was referring to the argument of the appellant that going to Greystone Park on June 26, 1962 fulfilled the order of the Board directing appellant to report there on August 20, 1962. After that statement the court went on to say: \u201cBut again you may consider this fact in determining whether his failure to comply with the work order was done unlawfully, knowingly and wilfully.\u201d The use of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>words at the commencement of the sentence \u2014 \u201cBut again\u201d \u2014 shows that the court was once more simply creating an exception to the general instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Any possible confusion that occurred by reason of the court\u2019s statement that no consideration may be given to the employment at Goodwill or the June visit to Greystone was inconsequential. A reading of the charge and its sequence of sentences demonstrates that the court correctly presented the issues and that the jury could readily comprehend them.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We must assume that the jury possessed and exercised common sense<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in following the charge of the court. We are convinced that appellant\u2019s attack upon the charge of the Trial Judge must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">\u2014 III \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">We now turn to other contentions, among the many advanced by the appellant, that his conviction should be reversed. He submits that the Board exceeded its authority in issuing the order to the appellant to report for 'civilian work in that it violated the statute and regulations pertaining to such orders. He complains that the evidence at the trial raised issues of fact concerning the validity of the order of the Board which should have been decided by the jury under proper instruction of the Trial Judge, but that the Judge failed to give such instructions though requests for the same were submitted by the plaintiff. Instead, the Judge instructed the jury that the order to report for civilian work was validly issued as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Among the shortcomings alleged to invalidate the order are: The Clerk of the Board appended her signature to the order of August 7, 1962 with a rubber stamp; the Clerk was not authorized by the Board to sign or issue the order; and no proof was made of minutes of the Board recording such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">It is true that the signature of the Clerk on the order was by rubber stamp. It is equally true that the regulations disapprove rubber stamps.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Failure, however, to conform to the regulations and to other similar procedural provisions cannot be held to deprive the Board of its jurisdiction as appellant contends. Absent some showing of prejudice to appellant due to the failure on the part of the Board to comply with the formal procedural directive of a regulation, an order of the Board, otherwise within its power to issue, will not be invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">Similarly, a regulation provides that official papers may be signed by the clerk of a board if he is authorized to do so by regulation duly adopted and entered in the minutes of the meetings of the Board.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In this case, the Clerk of the Board, on cross examination by appellant, testified that she was authorized to do so by resolution of the Board. No subpoena had been served upon her by appellant to produce the resolution. The Trial Judge requested her to produce it later. The production of the resolution, however, was never followed up at the trial. The testimony of the Clerk that the resolution existed was never disputed. If the appellant seriously contested the existence of appropriate delegation of authority to the Clerk to sign the order he had ample opportunity to press the contention, but did not do so. Here, again, the requirement of the resolution for authority to sign may be regarded as directory to the Board rather than mandatory. Its absence does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number><em>excuse </em>non-compliance with an otherwise valid order of the Board to report for civilian work.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The appellant is entitled to full protection of his procedural rights, but he may not insulate himself against the requirement that he perform his obligation under the Selective Service Law by relying on mere procedural irregularities which expose him to no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">In United States v. Hagaman, 213 F.2d 86, 91 (3 Cir. 1954) Judge Goodrich, speaking for this court sitting en banc, although in a dissenting opinion, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUK\">\u201cIt is one thing, however, to protect a man when he is prejudiced by the failure of administrative authorities to observe the precautions taken to guard his rights. It is another thing to create an administrative procedure, designed to be handled by volunteer laymen in communities throughout the nation, as technical and ritualistic as common law pleadings. We have said in an earlier opinion that a registrant is not obliged to make his points with his draft board in the fashion required of a well-trained lawyer, United States ex rel. Berman v. Craig, 3 Cir., 1953, 207 F.2d 888. It is likewise true that the board\u2019s proceedings do not need to be recorded with the meticulous accuracy with which an experienced corporation counsel draws a set of corporate minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The appellant further objected that the alleged order of the Board, dated August 7, 1962, requiring him to report for civilian work was rendered invalid by the following asserted deficiencies : There was no minute or resolution of the Board authorizing or deciding the type of civilian work to be performed by the appellant; the order itself did not explicitly \u201corder\u201d appellant to report for civilian work but rather recited that it had \u201cassigned\u201d him to institutional work; the order required him to report only to the Board; and the directive contained in that order as to the instructions he would receive to proceed to the New Jersey State Hospital at Greystone Park was too vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">There was ample evidence that the Board was in full agreement in its recommendation that he should perform civilian work at the New Jersey State Hospital at Greystone Park. Though a formal resolution was not produced, a written minute to this effect was received in evidence. To debate whether the order was an \u201corder\u201d or an \u201cassignment\u201d to engage in civilian work is purely an excursion in semantics which avails appellant nothing. And the assertion that the \u201corder\u201d was too \u201cvague\u201d to properly instruct him where to engage in civilian work is without any substance. The evidence is clear that appellant knew that he was ordered to the New Jersey State Hospital at Greystone Park, for it is undisputed that he appeared at the office of the Board on August 20, 1962, as directed, and informed the Clerk of the Board, among other things, that he would not go to the Hospital because other business claimed his attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\"> The appellant also contended that he was excused from reporting because the Board was not present at its headquarters when he reported on the appointed day for the purpose of requesting a postponement and that the Clerk of the Board acted outside the scope of her authority when she denied him such a postponement. Of course there was no requirement that the Board should be present on his arrival at the office. His request for a postponement of the date for him to report at the Hospital, made on the very day he was due there, was untimely. Its rejection by the Clerk of the Board was the only course she could take under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">The appellant complains that the Board misconstrued his status in that he was processed for civilian work as a non-volunteer conscientious objector when he should have been processed as a volunteer conscientious objector. He refers to his communication to the Board of August 1, 1961, in which, among other things, he advised that he \u201cwas willing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>to perform civilian work that contributes to the national health, safety or interest.\u201d He contends that upon the receipt of this information from him it was the duty of the Board to forward to him for execution Selective Service Form 151 entitled \u201cApplication of Volunteer for Civilian Work\u201d, and that he should have been processed accordingly under Section 1660.10 of the Regulations of the Selective Service System.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">It is conceded that such a form was never sent to the appellant. Instead appellant was supplied with Selective Service Form No. 152, entitled \u201cSpecial Report for Class I-O Registrant\u201d, pursuant to section 1660.20 of the Regulations.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>He filled it in, informing the Board, among other things, that he was willing to perform work for the blind and that he had been interviewed by the New Jersey Distributors of Blind Made Products of East Orange, New Jersey, for a job with that organization. The Board advised him that the New Jersey Distributors of Blind Made Products was not on the list of approved employers but that he could examine such an approved list at the State Headquarters of the Selective Service System, at 1060 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">He later inquired whether the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York was an approved employer and was informed that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">On July 4,1962, appellant went to work for the New Jersey Goodwill Industries,' Inc. He was still employed by it when he received the communication from the Board of August 7, 1962, directing that he report to the office of the Board on August 20 for the purpose of engaging in civilian work at the New Jersey State Hospital at Greystone Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Nearly a year elapsed between tHe time the appellant made'known his willingness to engage in civilian employment that contributed to the public welfare and when he actually entered the service of Goodwill Industries, Inc. There he worked as a truck driver out of its place of business in Jersey City. His job was to collect donated articles from receiving stations within a radius of 30 to 40 miles of Jersey City. Although appellant had seen Goodwill Industries listed as an approved agency for which conscientious objectors <em>might </em>work by states other than New Jersey, it had not been approved in this state. Indeed, on August 20, 1962, the very day that appellant was notified to report for work, Goodwill Industries made application to the National, State and local Selective Service authorities for approval. Such approval from the State of New Jersey was not actually granted until September 6,1962,</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">It is the position of appellant that as a volunteer for civilian work he was free to make a choice of work. He urges that by failing to recognize his \u201cvolunteer\u201d status the Board denied him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>this advantage and that in any event he should not have been ordered to work pending the approval of Goodwill Industries on September 6, 1962. Upon its approval, he asserts, he should have been permitted to continue his work there as satisfying his obligation to the Selective Service System. Appellant relies on his mere statement in Form No. 15 of his willingness to take on civilian work of national importance as placing the burden upon the Board of sending him an appropriate form upon which he would request to be ordered to perform such work.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> But the appellant cannot so easily cast this burden upon the Board. It was his duty to obtain the employment that was to be his satisfactory substitute for entering military service. Moreover, that employment, whether voluntarily engaged in by a registrant or chosen for him by the Board, was in any case to be employment considered appropriate by the Board, and not just any employment, private or non-profit, which suited the whim of the registrant.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">But here the appellant draws down another objection. Now he appears to concede that approval of the employer is necessary but that it is completely within the discretion of the local board to give that approval. He asserts that the Board utilized lists of employers transmitted to it by the National and State Selective Service authorities and made its order pursuant to the suggestion by them. In this, appellant contends, the Board abandoned its duty to exercise its own discretion which, he submits, excuses him from compliance with the directive of the Board that he take employment with the New Jersey State Hospital at Greystone Park. Indeed, he goes so far as to doubt the constitutionality of the regulation limiting the employers to public or non-profit agencies asserting that those engaged in private enterprises are fully as contributive toward the public welfare as non-profit agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">But the appellant makes no suggestion that the proposed employers were unfit. Were this the case and it was shown that the Board permitted its discretion to be dominated by suggestion of employers, illegally contrived, there might have been some ground to his contention. However, when the dust cloud of these objections settles, it becomes apparent that the Board, by permitting itself to be guided in the selection of the proposed employer of this conscientious objector, abandoned none of its autonomy with which the Selective Service Act vested it. Indeed, it is difficult to understand how uniformity of treatment of all conscientious objectors with regard to engagement in public welfare work could otherwise be practiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Appellant further urges the contention that his conviction must be reversed because the Trial Judge refused evidence offered to show that the State Director of Selective Service committed \u201charmful procedural errors\u201d in not filing an appeal for the appellant from the order of August 7, 1962, directing him to report for civilian work, in not preventing the issuance of such an order, and in failing to reply to questions put by appellant to him concerning the regulations. This revolved around a letter forwarded to the Board and the State Director by the appellant on August 21, 1962, the day following the date on which he was ordered to report, in which he again, stressed his application that he be permitted to continue to work for Goodwill Industries. He enclosed a copy of Goodwill Industries application of August 20, 1962, to be listed as an approved employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">On September 15, 1962, appellant also wrote the State Director that he appealed \u201cfrom any complaint against me that requires prosecution of me.\u201d The pith of appellant\u2019s contention is that his communications to the Board and to the State Director constituted an appeal to the Board from its order of August 7 and placed the burden upon the State Director of prosecuting such an appeal. The Trial Court refused to entertain this evidence and the appellant reserved it by way of an offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">There can be no merit to the claim of the appellant that his requests concerning his employment with the unapproved Goodwill Industries, after August 7 and August 20, 1962, constituted an appeal to the Board or a burden upon the State Director of prosecuting it. If the State Director did not respond to questions which appellant says he posed to him after he had failed to report as ordered, such failure can hardly be regarded as relevant to the issue upon which appellant was tried, namely, whether he wilfully failed to appear as directed by the Board on August 20, 1962. The Trial Judge correctly rejected the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Still another ground apparently seriously urged by the appellant for reversal of his conviction is that notwithstanding his failure to report to the New Jersey State Hospital at Greystone Park on August 20, 1962, he was \u201cconstructively\u201d present there. He bases this on his assertion that he visited the Hospital on June 26, 1962, and was interviewed by its personnel officer, who he alleges, promised to notify him when a job was available, which promise the personnel officer denied. Since he never received any notification from the Hospital, he states that his \u201cphysical presence there was entirely superfluous and uncalled for.\u201d The Trial Judge was fully justified in rejecting this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">After both sides rested the appellant moved for a directed verdict of acquittal because there had been no proof of compliance with section 1660.30 of the Selective Service Regulations,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> which requires information of failure to obey an order to report to be forwarded to the National Director of the Selective Service System for his approval of prosecution by the Department of Justice. Failure to comply with the outlined procedure leading to prosecution was not a condition precedent for the finding of an indictment by the Federal Grand Jury of the violation of the law named there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>in. Neither was it a necessary ingredient in the establishment of the Government\u2019s case against the appellant. The Trial Judge correctly denied the appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Finally at the hearing of this appeal the appellant challenged the constitutionality of Section 6(j) of the Selective Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j), and the jurisdiction of the Board over him on the authority of United States v. Seeger, 326 F.2d 846 (2 Cir. 1964). There Seeger was denied exemption from I-A military service classification because his conscientious objections to such service were not based upon a \u201cbelief in a relation to a Supreme Being.\u201d His conviction for failure to report for military service in his I-A classification was reversed on the ground that the statute limiting the conscientious objection to military service to persons who believe in a Supreme Being violated the due process clause of the fifth amendment by creating an impermissible classification as applied to one whose abhorrence of war was sincere and was predicated on religious training and belief. The short answer to this argument is that the <em>Seeger </em>case is irrelevant to this one where the appellant was concededly granted his conscientious objector classification by the Board without more than the formal required questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The trial of this case consumed more than four days. The record was needlessly prolonged by an interminable range of objections and technicalities offered by both counsel for the Government and for the appellant. Nevertheless the entire record and the charge of the Trial Judge have been reviewed. On this appeal the appellant has raised an almost endless number of challenges to his conviction. Many are repetitiously advanced. We have endeavored to rule upon all that appeared to deserve comment. Upon the others, for example, the Government\u2019s failure to prove criminal intent, we found them so lacking in substance as to merit no comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">We are convinced that the appellant was accorded a fair trial; that the record discloses no erroneous ruling of the Trial Judge that prejudiced the appellant or that warrants reversal and that the charge of the Trial Judge fairly and adequately submitted to the jury the issue of fact which it was called upon to decide. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-11\">.
