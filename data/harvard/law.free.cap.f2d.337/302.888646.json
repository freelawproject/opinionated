A timely motion to suppress the evidence was interposed by appellant and denied by the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-25\">The Government established that during the night of December 26, 1963, at least one box or carton of shoes destined to St. Helena, Oregon, was stolen from a truck belonging to Triangle Express and Transfer Company, in the City of St. Louis, Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The only direct evidence on the issue of probable cause is found in the testimony of the arresting officer, a member of the Metropolitan Police Force of the City of St. Louis, Missouri. This officer, Herman Ubben, testified that about ten-fifty o\u2019clock p. m. on December 26, 1963, while on a routine patrol, he saw appellant, known to Ubben to be a \u201cnoted thief,\u201d walking westwardly on the north side of Biddle Street between Twelfth and Thirteenth Streets in the City of St. Louis and about three and one-half (3i/4) blocks from the parking lot of Triangle Express and Transfer Company. Appellant was carrying a box and when Ubben stopped his automobile about two feet from appellant, he observed a label on the box upon which appeared the words \u201cInternational Shoe Company.\u201d At that time Ubben was wholly ignorant of the theft from the interstate shipment. Ubben then had this colloquy with appellant: \u201cI asked, where are you going with the box, Lem, where did you get it? He said, I found it; I said, I bet you stole it, and he said, I wouldn\u2019t doubt it.\u201d The officer\u2019s testimony does not establish with exactness the time of the arrest as related to seizure of the box, but the officer did state without equivocation that he did not observe that there was another \u201cseal\u201d on the box with the words appearing thereon, \u201cSt. Helena, Oregon,\u201d until after he had \u201cquestioned him and taken the box into his custody.\u201d Appellant was taken to the police station where the box was opened and six pairs of shoes found therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">From cases which have considered the question before us, there has emanated \u2022guidelines and standards which are to be applied in determining whether, under the facts and circumstances presented, probable cause existed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, in Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1310, 1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949), this pronouncement appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u201cIn dealing with probable cause, however, as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act. The standard of proof is accordingly correlative to what must be proved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\u201c \u2018The substance of all the definitions\u2019 of probable cause \u2018is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.\u2019 McCarthy v. De Armit, 99 Pa. 63, 69, quoted with approval in the Carroll opinion [Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543]. 276 U.S. at page 161 [45 S.Ct. at page 288, 69 L.Ed. 543]. And this \u2018means less than evidence which would justify condemnation\u2019 or conviction, as Marshall, C. J., said for the Court more than a century ago in Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339, 348 [3 L.Ed. 364], Since Marshall\u2019s time, at any rate, it has come to mean more than bare suspicion: Probable cause exists where \u2018the facts and circumstances within their [the officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonable trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u2019 an offense has been or is being committed. Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162 [45 S.Ct. 280, 288, 69 L.Ed. 543].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">The same basic principles were recognized by the Supreme Court in Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959), which also involved a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659, and where upon more persuasive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>facts than this record presents, the Court held that the officers did not have probable cause for the arrest, the search was illegal and the articles seized were not admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">From the teachings of the Supreme Court, it is evident that the key question presented in cases of this nature is whether the information possessed by the arresting officers was sufficient to constitute \u201cprobable cause\u201d as opposed to \u201cmere suspicion.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This issue, factual in nature, must be resolved from the facts and circumstances of each particular case, Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302 (1949); Washington v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 58, 263 F.2d 742, 744 (1959) citing cases; Hawkins v. United States, 8 Cir., 288 F.2d 537, 541 (1961), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 975, 81 S.Ct. 1943 (1961); Mueller v. Powell, 8 Cir., 203 F.2d 797 (1953). We turn then to the question, whether prudent men in the shoes of Officer Ubben would have seen enough to permit them to believe that appellant was violating or had violated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">To support the arrest and seizure, the Government relies upon the following circumstances: (1) the time of the arrest; (10:50 p. m.) (2) the place of the arrest; (about three and one-half blocks from the area where trucks were parked) (3) appellant\u2019s reputation; (4) the appearance of the name \u201cInternational Shoe Company\u201d on the box; (5) the statement made by the appellant to the officer prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">But there are other facts, equally pertinent which cannot be ignored. To enumerate, Officer Ubben was wholly ignorant of theft from the interstate shipment and, of course, was not engaged in investigating the offense as were the officers in Henry, supra. Appellant made no attempt to flee from the officer or to escape arrest. The contents of the box did not become known to the officer until sometime after the arrest and even then he was unaware that the shoes had been stolen from an interstate shipment. Seemingly, the colloquy between appellant and Officer Ubben, wherein appellant in response to the suggestion, \u201cI bet you stole it,\u201d replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t doubt it,\u201d is regarded as supplying the final link in the chain of circumstances relied upon to establish probable cause. We are not persuaded to believe however, that the statement made by appellant is entitled to be recognized as a direct admission, so as to supply the deficiency which was obviously existing when such statement was made. The authorities lend support to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">In Brinegar v. United States, supra, where the arrest and search were sustained, no expression whatever appears in the opinion of the majority as to the weight, if any, which was accorded to this colloquy between one of the agents and the accused; \u201cHello, Brinegar, how much liquor have you got in the car this time,\u201d and the reply \u201cnot too much\u201d or \u201cnot so much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">Also pertinent to the materiality of the statement made by appellant is United States v. One 1956 2-Door Chevrolet, 8 Cir., 275 F.2d 240 (1960). There, after suppressing as evidence the liquor involved on the grounds of illegal search and seizure, the Court acquitted the defendants of the charge of attempting to transport intoxicating liquor from Missouri to Oklahoma (then a dry state.) The Government had also instituted forfeiture procedures under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3615 against the liquor and against a Chevrolet automobile which the Alcohol Tax Unit Agents had seized in connection with the liquor. From an adverse judgment in the forfeiture case, the government appealed to this Court and one of its contentions was that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>'liad improperly failed to take into account admissions made by Frank Ban-field, one of the accused parties, to the liquor agents as found in this conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">\u201cQ. \u2018Frank, why do you stick your neck out like this ?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201cA. \u2018I don\u2019t know, I guess I don\u2019t ;know any better.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cQ. \u2018How far do you ordinarily .go with these fellows?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\u201cA. \u2018About two miles.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">'\u201cQ. \u2018Why don\u2019t you let them -start from your store ?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">\u201cA. \u2018I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t believe I ought to be in this business.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">We observed, 275 F.2d 243, that the -trial court had \u201crecognizingly\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">\u201c \u2018Hardesty\u2019s residence, and Ban-field\u2019s statements, may create a suspicion that ultimately the liquor in question would have reached Oklahoma, but doesn\u2019t at the time of the \u2022search and seizure and subsequent \u25a0arrest of Banfield and Hardesty, establish that they were then actually engaged in attempted transportation of liquor that can be declared contraband.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">-Our appraisal of the trial court\u2019s finding -was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\">\u201cThus, the court regarded the conversation as not constituting or implying any such intended or direct admission in respect to the particular transportation as to be persuasive of violation, or in overall consideration to require such an appraisal of what had been done in the situation, with its lack of objective elements of seeming probability at the time.\u201d 275 F.2d at 243.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">'In affirming, we took occasion to observe: ~\u201cwe think the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134, lends support to the conclusion -which he [trial judge] reached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">Further discussion is unnecessary. We cannot escape the conclusion that this is another case where an attempt is made to establish probable cause by the fruits of the search and seizure and by other after-acquired information, a practice long condemned. Henry v. United States, supra, 361 U.S. at page 98, 80 S.Ct. 168; Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13-15, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948). Without such post-arrest information, it clearly and unmistakably appears that the arrest stemmed from mere suspicion; it was not based upon information which would warrant a reasonable prudent person in believing that appellant was violating or had violated the law. As a consequence, appellant\u2019s motion to suppress should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-13\">.

He was arrested and subsequently charged by Information with violating Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 659. At his trial thereon, substantial competent evidence was adduced to establish appellant\u2019s guilt. Appellant offered no evidence in defense of the charge made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-20\">Standing on a \u201cmotion for judgment of acquittal\u201d made at the close of the Government\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error before us is that his conviction cannot stand \u201cbecause of (an) illegal search and seizure in the first instance, and (his) following unlawful arrest.\u201d As a consequence, he contends, \u201call the evidence (adduced by the Government at his trial) should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>suppressed\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (par added) and his motion for acquittal should have been sustained. He seeks reversal of his conviction on that singular premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Under the undisputed facts and applicable law as I perceive it, appellant\u2019s conviction is not constitutionally illegal and I must respectfully dissent from a reversal thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Officer Ubben, a St. Louis, Missouri police officer, was patrolling his assigned police district in a patrol car late at night. As he approached appellant on a public street in a semi-mercantile residential neighborhood, he observed that appellant was carrying a large wrapped, sealed package. Officer Ubben knew appellant had the reputation of being a \u201cnoted thief.\u201d Ubben pulled up and stopped his police car within two feet of appellant for the purpose of making a routine investigation. At that time he saw the words, \u201cInternational Shoe Company,\u201d labeled on the box appellant was carrying. He then said to appellant, \u201cWhere are you going with the box, Lem, where did you get it?\u201d Lem said, \u201cI found it.\u201d Ubben said, \u201cI bet you stole it.\u201d Lem said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t doubt it.\u201d Officer Ubben then told appellant to \u201cput the box down.\u201d <em>Notice, </em>appellant did not then, or at any other time, make claim that the box he was carrying was rightfully his. To the contrary, after he was arrested and the package he was carrying was \u201cseized\u201d by his arresting officer, he told the latter: \u201cI stole it from some other guys, I saw some other guys put it down, I picked it up when they left.\u201d Manifestly, such statement, though voluntarily made, cannot be related back to probable cause for appellant\u2019s \u201carrest\u201d or \u201cseizure\u201d of the box he was carrying, but it certainly can be related to probable cause for the \u201csearch\u201d here considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The only conclusion I can reach from the above-stated fact is that Officer Ubben lawfully \u201carrested\u201d appellant and contemporaneously therewith made \u201cseizure\u201d of the box appellant was carrying, incidental to such arrest. I think that must be so when it is considered that the law of the State of Missouri is that a St. Louis, Missouri police officer\u2019s merely interrogating a person in the course of a routine investigation, outdoors at night, does not rationally constitute an \u201carrest,\u201d though the person interrogated may be momentarily detained. Cf. State v. Evans, 161 Mo. 95, 61 S.W. 590, 593. Such is a recognized duty of a St. Louis, Missouri police officer under Section 84.090 V.A.M.S. Hence the \u201carrest and seizure\u201d here considered could only have occurred simultaneously, after the first conversation supra took place and when Officer Ubben told appellant to \u201cput the box down.\u201d Cf. Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959); State v. Monroe (Mo.App.) 289 S.W. 29 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The \u201csearch\u201d leading to appellant\u2019s, prosecution occurred thereafter, for it. is Officer Ubben\u2019s testimony that after-the above conversation took place, he-then got out of his patrol car, looked more closely at the box, turned it around: and read a label thereon revealing it was. addressed to a \u201cNikolas\u201d company, St. Helena, Oregon.\u201d Thereafter, he had the-subsequent conversation with appellant..</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">\u201cThe right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place-where the arrest is made in order to-find and seize things <em>connected with the crime as its fruits </em>or as the means by which it was committed,, as well as weapons and other things-, to effect an escape from custody, is-, not to be doubted. * * * Such, searches and seizures naturally and usually appertain to and attend such-arrests.\u201d (Emp. added.) Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 30, 46 S.Ct. 4, 5, 70 L.Ed. 145 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">A police officer of the City of St. Louis,. Missouri, by statutory authority may-make an arrest without warrant when he-has reasonable suspicion to believe that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>an offense against the law has been, or is being, committed by the person arrested. Cf. City of St. Louis v. Washington (Mo.App.) 223 S.W.2d 858; City of St. Louis v. Simon (Mo.App.) 223 S.W.2d 864; City of St. Louis v. Ward (Mo.App.) 223 S.W.2d 847; State v. Humphrey, 358 Mo. 904, 217 S.W.2d 551. A bad reputation or a criminal record, although itself not reasonable ground for an arrest, is a circumstance that may be taken into consideration along with other surrounding facts in determining whether probable cause exists for an \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cseizure\u201d contemporaneously made. Cf. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The majority opinion considers that because Officer \u201cUbben was wholly ignorant (that) the theft from (an) interstate shipment\u201d had occurred at the time he arrested appellant, such is a \u201cpertinent (fact) which cannot be ignored.\u201d I do not think such knowledge was essential to sustain the \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cseizure\u201d here considered; because Officer Ubben \u201c[had] reasonable grounds to believe that the particular package\u201d appellant \u201ccarried\u201d was \u201ccontraband,\u201d i. e. stolen. \u201cIts shape and design\u201d and the \u201cmanner in which it (was) carried\u201d were enough to create \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d in the mind of Ubben that the box was stolen. Cf. Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 104, 80 S.Ct. 168, 172. The statutory authority of F.B.I. officers and agents to make felony arrests without a warrant is not restricted to offenses committed \u201cin their presence\u201d but also to instances where they have \u201c \u2018reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested has committed or is committing\u2019 a felony.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3052. Henry v. United States, supra, 1.c. 100, 80 S.Ct. 168. All that need be present in the mind of a police officer at the time he makes an arrest is \u201cgrounds of reasonable suspicion that (the arrested person has) committed an offense\u201d against the law. Cf. Commission Row Club v. Lambert, 161 S.W.2d 732, 736 (Mo.App. 1942). It is apparent that \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d as there considered means more than \u201cbare suspicion\u201d condemned in the Brinegar case, supra, and is tantamount to \u201cprobable cause\u201d as considered in Mueller v. Powell, et al., 203 F.2d 797 (8 Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In the enlightening monographs by Professor John Scurlock on \u201cThe Law of Arrest in Missouri,\u201d and \u201cSearch and Seizure in Missouri,\u201d 29 Univ. of K.C. Law Rev., No. 2, Summer 1961, pp. 281-283, he has this to say about \u201carrest\u201d and \u201csearch\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cAn arrest, in order to justify a <em>search </em>without warrant, must meet certain qualifications. First. <em>The arrest must be a real, technical arrest. </em>The officer must have brought the suspect within the custody and control of the law for the actual or purported purpose of causing him to be committed on a criminal charge. The forcible detaining of a suspect while he is being searched may constitute \u2018an arrest\u2019 * * *. Furthermore, it seems obvious that since <em>necessity alone permits a search incidental to arrest, </em>an arrest cannot qualify to support a search unless the officer intended to arrest. * * Second. <em>The arrest must precede the search. </em>If the search comes first, it is unlawful although evidence is discovered which justifies an arrest. For most defendants the requirement that the arrest come first is academic because in case of dispute as to the order of arrest and search the word of the arresting officer will ordinarily be accepted as against the contention of the defendant. The constitutional guarantee forbids the making of a <em>search </em>before arrest, it does not always prohibit the <em>seizure </em>of goods prior to arrest. <em>When an officer sees goods subject to seizure, without having to make a search, he has the right to seize them. The order in which arrest and seizure of such visible articles occurs is not material. </em>Third. <em>The arrest must be lawful. </em>An arrest may be either with or without war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>rant of arrest, but it must be lawful independently and irrespectively of what is discovered by the <em>search; </em>it is axiomatic that <em>a search cannot relate back and </em>give validity to an arrest which was made on inadequate grounds. All good axioms have their exceptions or apparent exceptions. When an arrest is for a felony, <em>the effect of the rule against relating back is negated, by the rule that if in fact a felony has been committed, reasonable grounds exist as a matter of law for arresting whether the officer is aware of them or not. </em>Application of the latter rule produces a seeming paradox that while a <em>search </em>(without warrant) before arrest is unlawful regardless of what the search discloses, yet if an arrest upon (reasonable) suspicion is made before the search, <em>both the search and the arrest will be lawful if the search discloses the commission of a felony. </em>When the situation is examined penetratingly, it will be seen that the search does not really relate back and validate the felony arrest. The search merely proves that the arrest was lawful all along! Fourth. <em>The arrest must be made in good faith, that is, not for the sole purpose of creating an excuse to search. </em>This qualification presents difficult problems of proof. The illegality of an arrest being establishable on more or less objective bases, is more likely to be shown successfully than the <em>mala fides </em>of an arresting officer. The fact that the officer had a desire to search will hardly do the trick.\u201d (Some pars, and emphasis added. Footnote citations eliminated.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In the light of the foregoing thesis, I do not consider appellant\u2019s <em>arrest and the simultaneous seizure </em>made in the ease at bar to have been unlawful under Missouri or federal ease law. The serious question in this case is whether the arrest preceded the \u201csearch.\u201d Manifestly, the arrest of appellant did precede the search, because there is no dispute that the latter occurred after Officer Ubben told appellant to \u201cput the box down.\u201d That was before Officer Ubben got out of his patrol car. The <em>arrest and seizure </em>were then complete. Seizure of the box was justified because it was obviously sealed \u2014 a wrapped box \u2014 and visible thereon was the name \u201cInternational Shoe Company\u201d a well-known St. Louis firm. Reasonable facts were thereby established as probable cause for its <em>seizure. </em>The search took place later \u2014 after Officer Ubben got out of his patrol car and \u201cturned the box around and saw the name \u2018Nikolas\u2019 Company, and address, St. Helena, Oregon,\u201d thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Professor John Scurlock, in his monograph supra, at pp. 119-120, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">\n<em>\u201cThe Effect of an Unlawful Arrest\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">\u201cThe illegality of an arrest has certain consequences. The most important in day-to-day police work is the illegality which an unlawful arrest imparts to a <em>search </em>incident to it. The evidence obtained thereby will be suppressed if the defendant makes timely motion. * * * Although the practical effect of the illegality of an arrest may be that the arrestee cannot be convicted because the essential evidence is suppressed, the decisions definitely do not establish that the unlawfulness of an arrest will of itself prevent conviction. <em>No case was found holding that the judgment of the trial court must be reversed merely on the ground of the unlawfulness of the arrest. </em>There is one situation in which it may seem that reversal follows from the illegality of the arrest but in reality it turns on a factor which happens also to void the arrest. This situation exists where the complaint upon which a warrant of arrest is issued and upon which the information is based is fatally defective so that both warrant and information are bad. The judgment is void not because the arrest cannot be maintained, but because the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>formation fails.\u201d (Emp. added and footnote citations eliminated.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The place of arrest determines its validity. In Ralph v. Pepersack, Warden, 335 F.2d 128 (4 Cir. 1964) it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">\u201c * * * The existence of \u2018probable cause\u2019 is to be determined by the application of a practical, not a technical, standard. The meaning of the phrase has been so frequently stated as to require little elaboration here. (Citing cases.) Probable cause is something more than mere suspicion and something less than evidence which would justify a conviction. The essence of all definitions of probable cause for arrest is reasonable ground for belief that a crime has been committed and that the person ari'ested committed it. (Citing cases.) * * * No single litmus-paper test will provide the answer when probable cause is at issue; we look instead to the totality of the circumstances. And the pertinent circumstances are those of the moment, the actual ones, the ones that confronted the arresting officers. Officers patrolling the street at night do not prearrange the setting and they cannot judge events in the calm of an office. Things just happen, and as they happen the officers must choose to act or not. Our inquiry is whether their action was that of reasonable and prudent police officers in view of the circumstances as they appeared at the time of arrest.\u201d (1. c. 132.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">I think the circumstances existing in the nighttime on \u201cBiddle Street between Twelfth and Thirteenth in the City of St. Louis, and about three and one-half (3%) blocks from the parking lot\u201d of a transfer company, a semi-business-and-residential neighborhood where no contention is made that appellant was a resident and he did not say the \u201cbox is mine,\u201d established probable cause for Officer Ubben to arrest and seize the very apparent asportative box appellant had in his possession. Such constituted reasonable grounds for his \u201carrest\u201d and the \u201csearch\u201d that was thereafter made, in the light of all the circumstances here-revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Such facts reasonably considered do not, in my opinion, violate the Fourth Amendment provision against unreasonable search as considered in Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960); Rios v. United States, 364 U.S. 253, 80 S.Ct. 1431, 4 L.Ed.2d 1688 (1960) ; or Wong Sun and James Wah Toy v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441. (1962) as appellant contends. As I read Rios v. United States, it is authority in support of the arrest, seizure and search here considered, as is Brinegar v. United States, supra; for all that was necessary was that \u201c(t)he police must have-reasonable grounds to believe that the-particular package carried by the citizen is contraband,\u201d i. e. stolen. Henry v. United States, supra, 361 U.S. at p. 104, 80 S.Ct. at p. 172. The \u201cstopping of the car\u201d in United States v. One 1956 2-door Chevrolet, 275 F.2d 240 (8 Cir. 1960) was clearly without probable cause for the seizure and search there made. All that was shown to exist in that case was \u201cbare suspicion\u201d which is admittedly not. \u2019enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">I would affirm appellant\u2019s conviction..</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-14\">. His motion to suppress, made before trial, was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
