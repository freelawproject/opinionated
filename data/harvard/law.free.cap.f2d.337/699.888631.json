The district court held a hearing on the motion and found that. Cortez had failed to sustain his burden-of showing that his plea of guilty was; not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">Cortez was indicted on August 30, 1961 for aiding and abetting his wife, Aurora, in illegally importing heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174. He was. also indicted for resisting and interfering with United States officers in the performance of their duties. Aurora was indicted for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174, and Cortez\u2019s brother Roger was also-indicted for aiding and abetting Aurora. Cortez, represented by assigned counsel, pled not guilty to both counts on September 18, 1961, but changed his plea to guilty on both counts on October 17, 1961. Aurora, who was seven months pregnant, pled guilty to a lesser \u201ctax count\u201d charge, and was sentenced to two years in prison, the minimum term. The original charge against her involved a minimum sentence of five years with no-probation and a maximum sentence of 20-years.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">Cortez\u2019s contention is that a \u201cdeal\u201d' was made between the United States-Attorney\u2019s office and his attorney, whereby Cortez would plead guilty to the indictment against him, in \u201cexchange\u201d for his wife\u2019s being allowed to plead guilty to the lesser tax charge. Cortez says he-entered into this deal because of Aurora\u2019s, pregnancy, and to protect her. He urges-that this was sufficient coercion to vitiate-his plea. He contended at the hearing that the statements that he made at the time'of the guilty plea as to its voluntariness and freedom from coercion were-made so that the exchange would occur; and he was still maintaining to his attorney and to a probation officer that he-was innocent. Other factors that may have influenced the guilty plea were Cortez\u2019s past conviction for a felony and his wife\u2019s past conviction for perjury, as well as his attorney\u2019s knowledge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>the government had witnesses who would testify that Cortez had sold narcotics to school children. Another factor mentioned was that his attorney told Cortez that if he went to trial, a judge who had a reputation for severe sentences in narcotics cases would hear his case, while there was a possibility of having a different sentencing judge in the event a guilty plea were entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Cortez would frame the issues for this court as, \u201cwere promises made by a United States attorney, were they transmitted to Appellant, were they sufficient to induce a plea, and did they, in fact do so.\u201d The United States relies on the trial court\u2019s finding that Cortez\u2019s pleas of guilty were voluntarily made, and urges that this fact-finding cannot be set aside on appeal unless clearly erroneous. Appellant\u2019s statement of the issue attempts too much. If his rationale were adopted, all guilty pleas would be vitiated if they were entered as a result of a bargain with the United States Attorney. A more proper inquiry is whether in the circumstances of this case the inducement for the guilty plea was one which necessarily overcame Cortez\u2019s ability to make a voluntary decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">We take judicial notice of the fact that the vast majority of those who are indicted for federal crimes plead guilty. We know, too, that in many of the cases where this occurs the plea will be to one count, or less than all counts, of a multicount indictment, or to a lesser offense than that originally charged. In a sense, it can be said that most guilty pleas are the result of a \u201cbargain\u201d with the prosecutor. But this, standing alone, does not vitiate such pleas. A guilty defendant must always weigh the possibility of his conviction on all counts, and the possibility of his getting the maximum sentence, against the possibility that he can plead to fewer, or lesser, offenses, and perhaps receive a lighter sentence. The latter possibility exists if he pleads guilty, as Cortez did, to the whole charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">No competent lawyer, discussing a possible guilty plea with a client, could fail to canvass these possible alternatives-with him. Nor would he fail to ascertain the willingness of the prosecutor to-\u201cgo along.\u201d Moreover, if a co-defendant is involved, and if the client is anxious to help that co-defendant, a competent lawyer would be derelict in his duty if he did not assist in that regard. At the same time, the lawyer is bound' to advise his client fully as to his rights, as to the alternatives available to him, and of the fact that neither the lawyer nor the prosecutor nor anyone else can bargain for the court. There is nothing wrong, however, with a lawyer\u2019s giving-his client the benefit of his judgment as. to what the court is likely to do, always-making it clear that he is giving advice, not making a promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">The important thing is not that there-shall be no \u201cdeal\u201d or \u201cbargain\u201d, but. that the plea shall be a genuine one, by a defendant who is guilty; one who understands his situation, his rights, and', the consequences of the plea, -and is neither deceived nor coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">A leading Supreme Court case in the-area is Kercheval v. United States, 1927, 274 U.S. 220, 223-224, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009. There the Court stated' that \u201ccourts are careful that a plea of' guilty shall not be accepted unless made voluntarily after proper advice and with, full understanding of the consequences. When one so pleads he may be held, bound. * * * But, on timely application, the court will vacate a plea of guilty shown to have been unfairly obtained, or given through ignorance, fear or inadvertence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5m\">In Kent v. United States, 1 Cir., 1959, 272 F.2d 795, 798, one of defendant\u2019s, contentions, in a motion under section. 2255, was that he pled guilty to a charge of bank robbery so that his fiance, who-had also confessed, would not be prosecuted as an accessory. The court there-stated, \u201cWe are not prepared to say that, it can be coercion to inform a defendant that someone close to him who is guilty of a crime will be brought to book if he-does not plead. If a defendant elects to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>sacrifice himself for such motive, that is his choice, and he cannot reverse it after he is dissatisfied with his sentence, or with other subsequent developments.\u201d Cf. Booth v. United States, 9 Cir., 1958, 251 F.2d 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Here, the court heard the matter at some length. It found that Cortez did know that if he pleaded guilty and if his wife pleaded guilty to the \u201ctax charge\u201d the matter could thus be disposed of. It also found, in substance, that Cortez was in fact guilty, that at the time of his plea he was fully and accurately advised, and that his plea was voluntary. The evidence sustains the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The principal cases on which Cortez relies do not help him. They are Zaffarano v. United States, 9 Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 707 and Motley v. United States, 5 Cir., 1956, 230 F.2d 110. In each it was held that, upon allegations similar to those in Cortez\u2019s petition, a hearing \u25a0should have been held. In Zaffarano, a hearing has since been held. The plea was held valid, and that decision has been affirmed by us. Zaffarano v. United States, 9 Cir., 1964, 330 F.2d 114. Here, too, a hearing was held. The judge, who did not receive the plea, but was the sentencing judge, believed Cortez\u2019s testimony at the time of plea<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of sentencing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather than his testimony at his section 2255 hearing. This he was entitled to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\">. \u201cMR.
