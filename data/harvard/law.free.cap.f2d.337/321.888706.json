The district court ordered Humble to arbitrate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-21\">The question for decision is whether the contract between Humble and the Union obligates Humble to submit the grievance to arbitration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The contract contains an unequivocal no-strike clause. Article 215, Work Stoppages, provides, \u201cThere shall be no lockouts or strikes.\u201d Humble\u2019s agreement to arbitrate must be construed as the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d for the Union\u2019s agreement not to strike, and an order to arbitrate should not be denied \u201cunless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills, 1957, 353 U.S. 448, 77 S.Ct. 912, 923, 1 L.Ed.2d 972; see also United Steelworkers of America v.

Then, \u201cif the claim is disputed, the issue is either: (1) The interpretation of the provision, or- (2) The facts, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ay7\">The Union\u2019s letter demanding arbitration asserts that Humble\u2019s refusal to permit a representative to be present at the investigation \u201cis a violation of the certification and is further a violation of Sections 211, 234 and other provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>of the contract.\u201d Section 234 has been quoted. Section 211 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjY\">\u201c211. <em>Recognition of Union Functions</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">\u201cThe Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative of all employees covered by this agreement for the purpose of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, and other conditions of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7L\">Section 211 must be construed in connection with its counterpart, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201c212. <em>Recognition of Management Functions</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201c(a) The Union recognizes that the Company has the right, on its own initiative, to perform any function of management at any time, so long as it does not violate any express provision of this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201c(b) The following acts are functions of management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201c(1) Those acts which are not within the area of collective bargaining as required by the National Labor Relations Act, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9a\">\u201c(2) Those acts which are usually exercised by employers, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az3y\">\u201c(3) Those acts which management should exercise in order to properly manage the business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">The district court found:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">\u201cThere is no showing whatever of bad faith on the part of the Union. The language of Sections 211 and 231 particularly of the collective bargaining agreement, especially where they refer to \u2018other conditions of employment\u2019 and \u2018working conditions\u2019 is sufficiently broad to be susceptible of varying interpretations. There is, therefore, a good faith claim by one party, the Union, that the other party, the Company, has violated a written provision of the agreement. Therefore, under the clear provisions of the agreement, arbitration should be ordered, and such arbitration should be held in accordance with Sections 250 through 257 of the collective bargaining agreement pertaining specifically to arbitration procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">We agree with the learned district judge. The case most heavily relied upon by Humble is Independent Petroleum Workers of America v. American Oil Co., 7 Cir. 1963, 324 F.2d 903. That case is readily distinguishable on a number of grounds. First and foremost, the contract there involved did not contain an unequivocal no-strike provision as here, but the no-strike clause was specifically suspendable on a refusal to arbitrate. Second, in that case arbitrable grievances related to \u201cQuestions directly involving or arising from applications, interpretations or alleged violations of the terms of this agreement.\u201d 324 F.2d at 905. That is much narrower than \u201ca good faith claim by one party that the other party has violated a written provision of this agreement.\u201d (Article 251, quoted supra.) The word \u201calleged\u201d in the Petroleum Workers case modified only \u201cviolations,\u201d while under Article 251 of the present contract the \u201cgood faith claim\u201d might relate to the interpretation of the written provision of the contract. There are other differences. It would unduly prolong this opinion to distinguish the other cases relied on by Humble.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">Humble insists that if the Union\u2019s claim is established, it would constitute an unfair labor practice of refusal to bargain over which the National Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction. If true, that is no answer to the Union\u2019s good faith claim that Humble\u2019s conduct also constitutes a violation of a written provision of the collective bargaining agreement. Lodge No. 12, Dist. No. 37, International Association of Machinists v. Cameron Iron Works, 5 Cir. 1958, 257 F.2d 467. The contract obligates Humble to submit the grievance to arbitration, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-12\">.
