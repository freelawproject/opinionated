It appears, however, that Section 7237 was amended prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>time appellant committed the offenses for which he was convicted and, as amended, authorizes a maximum sentence for first offenders of ten (10) years. The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
