The defendant, driving behind her, noticed her erratic course, weaving from side to side. The plaintiff admitted that she may have dozed. As she approached a bridge she left the paved portion of the highway, entered on to the shoulder and, after continuing thereon for a time, seemed to be preparing to make a right turn into a gravel road intersecting the main highway on the right. However, she continued along the shoulder and rammed into the concrete abutment of the bridge. The impact swung plaintiff\u2019s automobile in a clockwise direction athwart the defendant\u2019s path, and the two vehicles then collided.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">The District Court, 234 F.Supp. 856, upon the depositions of the parties, gave summary judgment for the defendant. We affirm upon the memorandum opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
