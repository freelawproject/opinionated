P. Van Valkenburgh Co.. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cVaneo\u201d),, against third-party defendant, A. T. Smith &amp; Co. (hereinafter referred to as-\u201cSmith\u201d). The district court obtained, jurisdiction of the original action filed by Arrow Road Construction Co. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cArrow\u201d) againstVaneo under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270b. This court possesses jurisdiction to entertain Smith\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s final decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-23\">In 1958, Vaneo contracted with the United States Naval Department to construct certain roads and facilities. One such road, the subject of the present controversy, was known as \u201cE\u201d Road. Vaneo forthwith executed subcontracts with Smith and Arrow, in essence delegating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>the construction of \u201cE\u201d Road\u2019s sub-base \u25a0of silty sand to Smith and of \u201cE\u201d Road\u2019s asphalt stabilized base and various coatings to Arrow. Arrow also undertook a number of other subcontracting assignments for Vaneo, under the latter\u2019s contract with the Navy.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Smith completed its work on \u201cE\u201d Road about December 9, 1958, and was paid therefor. Arrow completed its work by \u2022January 1, 1959, but the Navy refused to accept the completed road because of \u25a0certain defects. Upon refusal of Arrow to comply with Vanco\u2019s request to perform corrective work, Vaneo engaged Smith to make the necessary renovations \u25a0at a cost of $50,959.53.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Arrow subsequently instituted an action against Vaneo for the remainder due for the services it had performed for Vaneo under the Naval contract. Vaneo \u2022counterclaimed against Arrow for the \u25a0damages resulting from Arrow\u2019s defective work on \u201cE\u201d Road. Arrow asserted that the fault for \u201cE\u201d Road\u2019s deficiencies rested with Smith for its substandard \u25a0performance in laying a sub-base; as a result of this assertion, Vaneo filed a \u2022third-party complaint against Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The court found that both Smith and Arrow were at fault, and apportioned the liability seventy-five per cent to Arrow and twenty-five per cent to Smith. The \u25a0court consequently rendered judgment favoring Vaneo and against Smith for $12,739.88. Arrow\u2019s portion of the damage liability, $38,219.65, was then offset against the $43,699.46 still due Arrow under the entire contract. Arrow thus received a $5,479.81 judgment in its favor against Vaneo.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Three questions are presented:</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">1. Was Vaneo entitled to recover from :Smith any portion of the damages due to \"the faulty construction of \u201cE\u201d Road ?</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">2. Was the district court in error by using the degree of fault to apportion the damage liability to Arrow and Smith?</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">3. Did the district court abuse its discretion by taxing all costs of the three-party action to Smith ?</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">Appellant contends at great length that it was error to hold Smith liable to any degree because \u201cit was error to award Arrow any Judgment whatsoever * * * and if no Judgment had been rendered in favor of Arrow, Vaneo would not be entitled to any Judgment against Smith.\u201d (O.B. p. 12) We find no logical basis whatsoever for such a contention. In no manner is the liability of Arrow and/or Smith for the improper construction of \u201cE\u201d Road tied to the amount remaining to be paid by Vaneo to Arrow for the latter\u2019s work on the entire contract. Smith asserts it was held liable only because Arrow recovered a judgment against Vaneo in the amount of $5,479.81, the $43,699.46 still outstanding under the subcontract, less the $38,-219.65 for seventy-five per cent responsibility for the defective construction of \u201cE\u201d Road. But to sustain appellant\u2019s assertion would make its liability for defective road construction dependent upon the financing arrangements between Arrow and Vaneo \u2014 the schedule of payments and the amount remaining unpaid under the overall contract. Clearly no basis exists for relating the two separate issues of liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">Arrow\u2019s right to recover under the entire contract is conceded, subject to Van-co\u2019s counterclaim for Arrow\u2019s defective work on \u201cE\u201d Road. The result of the counterclaim itself is in no way contingent upon the amount outstanding to Arrow on the entire contract. Appellant\u2019s reasoning that any liability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Smith to Vaneo was contingent upon and limited by the liability of Vaneo to Arrow is fallacious.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">\n<em>Apportionment of Liability on the Basis of Fault</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Appellant\u2019s second specification of error is addressed to the district court\u2019s use of relative fault to apportion the damages sustained by Vaneo due to the reconstruction of \u201cE\u201d Road. Appellant contends such apportionment can only properly be made on the basis of actual cost figures, not by relative fault. But, under the facts of this case, the district court\u2019s approach is not only reasonable but is also the most practicable and accurate method of apportionment that the circumstances would permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">To adopt appellant\u2019s suggested approach of assessing the cost of rebuilding Arrow\u2019s construction and the cost of rebuilding Smith\u2019s construction would ignore completely the interrelationship of the activities of the two subcontractors. For example, had Arrow complied with specifications but the road still required reconstruction solely because Smith\u2019s sub-base was defective, a substantial cost would have been sustained for repeating Arrow\u2019s performance; yet the cost would have been directly attributable to Smith, and Smith alone. Use of appellant\u2019s approach, under such a fact situation, would unjustly charge Arrow with a bulk of the liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Where the deficient performance of multiple parties is so interrelated, therefore, a relative- fault approach as utilized by the district court is not only reasonable but is also well, if not best, suited to the situation. The cases cited by appellee, Allen v. Gardner, 126 Cal.App.2d 335, 272 P.2d 99 (1954) and California Orange Co. v. Riverside Portland Cement Co., 50 Cal.App. 522, 195 P. 694 (1920), lend substantial support to the propriety of the district court\u2019s apportionment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Since the $50,959.53 repair figure was not in dispute, the district court properly construed the principal issue as being the apportionment of the costs for correcting \u201cE\u201d Road to the two subcontractor parties. The method of apportionment employed by the court was quite proper; under the circumstances, the degree of fault was a method of calculation as reasonably accurate as any other approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">\n<em>Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">An award of costs is largely in the discretion of the trial court. We always hesitate to intrude on such a large discretion. However, we feel that discretion has been misdirected in this case. Since Arrow\u2019s right to recover payments on the entire contract is independent of Vanco\u2019s right to damages for defective construction of \u201cE\u201d Road, Smith should not be taxed costs for Arrow\u2019s successful suit for construction payments. Smith was properly taxed $523.76 under Vanco\u2019s third-party complaint, but to tax him with $912.80 costs incurred by Arrow under Arrow\u2019s suit for payments and Vanco\u2019s counterclaim for damages, flies contrary to the rationale of the approved division of fault we have above affirmed, and constitutes an error in discretion. The costs of the primary action should be distinguished from the costs of the third-party action. See Tejas Development Co. v. McGough Bros., 167 F.2d 268 (5th Cir. 1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">Since Arrow\u2019s suit for payments under the entire contract was distinct from Vanco\u2019s counterclaim and third-party complaint for damages, the district court abused its discretion by transferring to Smith the costs taxed to Vaneo on Arrow\u2019s judgment against Vaneo.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-16\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed except as to the matter of $912.-80 costs assessed against Smith for Arrow\u2019s costs. In that respect it is reversed, and costs in that amount are to be taxed to Vaneo under the district court order granting judgment to Arrow against Vaneo as is presently provided in paragraph \u201c1.\u201d of the judgment (Tr. p. 100).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AoQD\">. To illustrate how illogical is appellant\u2019s contention, one need only hypothesize that the damages for faulty construction of \u201cE\u201d Road were $80,000.00, rather than $50,959.53. Arrow would then not have obtained a judgment against Vaneo because the payments due it, $43,699.46, would not have exceeded its proportionate share of liability on Vanco\u2019s counterclaim \u2022 \u2014 -seventy-five per cent of $80,000.00. Pursuant to appellant\u2019s argument, since Arrow could not recover from Vaneo, Vaneo could not recover from Smith, despite the fact that twenty-five per cent of the damages of \u201cE\u201d Road were attributable to Smith.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
