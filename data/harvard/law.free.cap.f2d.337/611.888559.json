(1) Here there could be no conceivable connection between the service of the ship and the activities of libelant at the time of his injury. (2) He was not on authorized shore leave at all. (3) He was not on shore leave for the purpose of escaping for a time the monotony of the services aboard the ship during a voyage. He had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>performed no services of any kind aboard the ship, and in fact, in failing to report aboard the ship ready to work, as instructed by the officer in charge, he had violated the orders of his superior officer to the extent that discharge from employment therefore was in order at the discretion of his superior officer. Hence, under the circumstances of this case, the shipowner should be relieved of liability for injuries thus sustained by libelant while engaged in activities in no way whatsoever connected with the service of the ship, and in no way connected with shore leave as contemplated by the doctrine of the Aguilar case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201cWillful misbehavior or deliberate acts of indiscretion suffice to deprive the seaman of his protection. The traditional instances are venereal disease and injuries received as a result of intoxication. When the seaman\u2019s injuries are caused by his intoxication, they are held to be occasioned by his misconduct, thus relieving the shipowner of the duty to provide maintenance and cure. Barlow v. Pan Atlantic Steamship Corp., 2 Cir., 101 F.2d <em>697; </em>Bloomquist v. T. J. McCarthy S. S. Co., 7 Cir., 263 F.2d 590; Smith v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., D.C., 205 F.Supp. 954.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201cThe injury suffered by libelant in this case was caused by his own misconduct, that is, while intoxicated, and while engaged in activities in no way whatsoever connected with the service of his ship, and thus, the respondent shipowner is thereby relieved of all liability for lost wages, maintenance and cure resulting therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">We express no opinion on the correctness of the district court\u2019s statement of the law as set forth in the first paragraph we have quoted. We affirm the district court\u2019s holding, as stated in the second and third paragraphs, that the libelant\u2019s intoxication constituted misconduct barring recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">The \u201c \u2018poor and friendless\u2019 seaman\u201d, Gilmore and Black observe, is \u201cthe beneficiary of a system of accident and health insurance at the shipowner\u2019s expense-more comprehensive than anything yet achieved by shorebound workers.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Norris has written: \u201cThe effect of Aguilar [Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 1943, 318 U.S. 724, 63 S.Ct. 930, 87 L.Ed. 1107] has been to expand and elasticize the-meaning and extent of the phrase \u2018in the service of the ship\u2019 so that at the present time it virtually encompasses all of the seaman\u2019s activity from the time he departs from her after signing off. The personal nature of the seaman\u2019s activity at the moment of illness or injury is not the determining factor in deciding his right to an award.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Farrell v. United States, 1949, 336 U.S. 511, 69 S.Ct. 707, 93 L.Ed. 850, Warren v. United States, 1951, 340 U.S. 523, 71 S.Ct. 432, 95 L.Ed. 503, and other cases have extended the meaning of the term \u201cservice of the ship\u201d beyond the limits set in Aguilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">If wilful misconduct causes the injury, however, it will bar a seaman\u2019s recovery of wages, maintenance and cure. Thus in Aguilar the Court added the caveat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmM\">\u201cOnly some wilful misbehavior or deliberate act of indiscretion suffices to deprive the seaman of his protection. [citing cases] The traditional instances are venereal disease and injuries received as a result of intoxication, though on occasion the latter has been qualified in recognition of a classic predisposition of sailors ashore.\u201d 318 U.S. at 731, 63 S.Ct. at 934.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">The trend of the cases toward increased coverage for a seaman in the \u201cservice of his ship\u201d and Justice Rutledge\u2019s suggestion in Aguilar that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>are \u201coccasions\u201d when the court should bear in mind the \u201cclassic predisposition of sailors ashore\u201d seem to point toward judicial tolerance when seamen are injured while engaged in their own fun in a seaman\u2019s bar. Thus some coui-ts have said that \u201crecovery of maintenance and cure is [not] forfeited by the mere circumstance that the injured seaman is intoxicated at the time [of his injury].\u201d Bentley v. Albatross, 3 Cir. 1952, 203 F.2d 270. See also Buckeye S. S. Co. v. McDonough, 6 Cir. 1952, 200 F.2d 558, cert. denied 1953, 345 U.S. 926, 73 S.Ct. 785, 97 L.Ed. 1357. In these cases, however, as in The S. S. Berwindglen, 1 Cir. 1937, 88 F.2d 125, the presence or absence of unseaworthiness and negligence were important factors in the decision. In The Quaker City, D.C.Pa.1931, 1 F.Supp. 840, where the factors of unseaworthiness and negligence were absent, the court drew a distinction between innocent involvement of a drunken seaman in a brawl and involvement of a drunken seaman who had instigated the brawl. The Seventh Circuit, in Bloomquist v. T. J. McCarthy Steamship Co., 263 F.2d 590 distinguished Bentley because it involved unseaworthiness, distinguished McDonough because it involved negligence and stated, flatly, that \u201ca seaman [is] not entitled to maintenance for injuries resulting from his own intoxication\u201d. 263 F.2d at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In the ease before us, there is no question of unseaworthiness of the ship, negligence of the shipowner or the master, or innocent involvement in a brawl of a seaman who just happened to be drunk at the time. If, as the district court found, the libelant\u2019s intoxication caused his injury, he was solely responsible for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In reviewing this case, this Court is bound by the clearly erroneous rule. McAllister v. United States, 1945, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20. The medical records show that the libelant was a chronic alcoholic. He had the odor of alcohol on his breath when he was admitted to the hospital at 2 A.M. after his accident. He admits doing some drinking before going to the barroom. And he was in the bar from about 11 P. M. to about 1:30 A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">The record is painfully emaciated, but we cannot say that the district court was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\">.
