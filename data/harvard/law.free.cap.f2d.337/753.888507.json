There was no direct appeal, and the record shows the Marshal\u2019s return, \u201cDefendant delivered on July 26-56 to U.S.P. at Atlanta, Ga., the institution \u2022designated by the Attorney General, with a certified copy of the within judgment and commitment.\u201d Appellant is presently confined in the Florida state penitentiary serving sentences for offenses against that State, but alleges that there is a \u201cfederal detainer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">His motion under Section 2255 of Title 28, United States Code, alleged that his federal sentence was illegal on a number of grounds, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-16\">\u201c(c) Petitioner being \u201820 years of age\u2019 and being indigent, under fear, had no counsel for his defense through fear, lack of representation ignorant to law. Lack of knowledge, lack the ways of judical (sic) proceeding persuation (sic) by threats of how much time he would receive, by the state officers in jail and was blindly led into the position of being convicted on a crime he enter (sic) a plea of guilty through fear. Of which he could have proven his innocent (sic) with the aid of a counsel. Wherefore Your Petitioner ask (sic) this Honorable Court to vacate and set aside his illegal sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">The district court denied the section 2255 motion without a hearing, on the ground that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-18\">\u201c * * * it affirmatively appearing that the files and records of the case, Pensacola Criminal No. 5121, conclusively show that petitioner is entitled to no relief, the official file of his sentencing showing that he was, in fact, fully and accurately informed of his constitutional rights in every regard prior to his entering a plea of guilty, and that he by his own free will and accord signed waiver of indictment, counsel and venue * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-19\">On the same ground, the district court denied leave to appeal in forma pauperis and certified under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 that the appeal is not taken in good faith. The rulings of the district court can be sustained only if \u201c * * * the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief * * 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. Before us is an appeal from the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>The appellant sought to have his conviction set aside under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since it is stated in the petition by which the appellant sought to invoke the jurisdiction of the district court that he was held in a prison of the State of Florida, it is clearly apparent that he is not a prisoner in custody under sentence of a federal court. He was in state custody. The question of jurisdiction under Section 2255 was not raised or passed upon in the district court, but if there is a lack of jurisdiction it can and should be here raised by the Court of its own motion. It has been well said that \u201cthe party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court must demonstrate that the ease is within the competence of such a court. * * * The rule is that the parties cannot confer jurisdiction which has not been vested in the court by the Constitution and Congress. The parties cannot waive lack of jurisdiction, whether by express consent, or by conduct, nor yet even by estoppel. The court, whether trial or appellate, is obliged to notice want of jurisdiction on its own motion.\u201d Wright, Federal Courts 14-15. It is pointed out by Professor Wright that Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 12(h), 28 U.S.C.A., provides that \u201cWhenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\u201d If the district court entered an order denying relief in a proceeding where it was acting without jurisdiction this Court should sustain its action even though it did not consider the jurisdictional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">Since United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232, it has been understood that a proceeding under Section 2255 is the substantive-equivalent of habeas corpus. Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d. 417, reh. den. 369 U.S. 808, 82 S.Ct. 640, 7 L.Ed.2d 556. See Larson v. United States, 5th Cir. 1960, 275 F.2d. 673, cert. den. 363 U.S. 849, 80 S.Ct. 1627, 4 L.Ed.2d 1732, where the rule is followed and the Hayman case is discussed. The first of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent pronouncements is in Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415, 79 S.Ct. 451, 3 L.Ed.2d 407, where it is said that Section 2255 is available only to attack a sentence under which a prisoner is in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The opinion of this Court in Shelton v. United States, 5th Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 101, requires consideration as to whether jurisdiction should be asserted by treating the appellant\u2019s Section 2255 motion as an application for a writ of coram. nobis. In the Shelton case an application was made under Section 2255 by a petitioner who had been given a conditional release from the sentence he sought to-have vacated. His status was the same, in regard to his movements, as one on. parole. Although citing Anderson v. Corall, 263 U.S. 193, 44 S.Ct. 43, 68 L.Ed. 247,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court thought the authorities-were divided on the question as to whether the petitioner Shelton was in custody while on parole. The Section 2255 application was treated as an application for coram nobis and, so treating it, the-Court decided that the cause should be-remanded. The Court, in an en banc rehearing, set aside the judgment of the-panel and held that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed. Shelton v. United States, 5th Cir. 1957, 246 F.2d 571. The Supreme Court, by a brief per curiam opinion, vacated the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>this Court and remanded to the district court. Shelton v. United States, 356 U.S. 26, 79 S.Ct. 563, 2 L.Ed.2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Neither the Court of Appeals sitting en banc nor the Supreme Court considered the basis for jurisdiction; nor did either express any view as to whether jurisdiction was exercised under Section 2255 or of a coram nobis proceeding. If any doubt was left by Anderson v. Corall, the doubt has been put to rest by the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285, 92 A.L.R.2d 675. There it was held that a state prisoner, placed on parole, was under such restraint as would support the issuance of habeas corpus. See Hoptowit v. United States, 9th Cir. 1960, 274 F.2d 936. We need not consider the various degrees of restraint under the parole and probation systems of the several states. See Annotation 92 A.L.R. 2d 675, 682. Shelton was convicted of a federal offense. Federal restraint over a parolee is no less than that considered by the Court in Jones v. Cunningham. The rule there stated is of course applicable in Section 2255 cases such as Shelton. In the light of the Anderson and Jones cases there was such \u201ccustody\u201d in Shelton as sustained Section 2255 jurisdiction and we do not think the Supreme Court held otherwise. Van Meter v. Sanford, 5th Cir. 1938, 99 F.2d 511, holding that the moral restraint of parole is not such custody as will support habeas corpus, is no longer a controlling precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Our record does not disclose how Young got out of federal prison and into a Florida prison. If we were permitted to indulge in a conjecture or surmise, of which we are so critical when done by those tribunals whose decisions we review, we might conjecture or surmise that he had been given a conditional release or parole from the place where he had been confined by federal authority and had then been taken into custody by the Florida law enforcement officers. But if we had some proof of what we cannot surmise or conjecture, we would be unable to treat the conditional release or parole as federal custody to support Section 2255 jurisdiction. Young is in the Florida penitentiary. There cannot be dual or joint custody. An order of release under Section 2255 would be a nullity. We think there was no custody as to sustain jurisdiction under Section 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\"> We think we ought not to follow the rule stated in Crow v. United States, 9th Cir. 1950,186 F.2d 704, where the Court refused to treat a motion under Section 2255 as an application for relief under Fed.R.Crim.Proc. 32(d), 18 U.S. C. In so doing the Court said, \u201cCourts cannot be inquired to search for possible grounds upon which to grant relief. Their function is performed when they dispose of matters properly presented.\u201d 186 F.2d 704, 706. Rather we would adopt the practice of the Tenth Circuit which has said that \u201cA Section 2255 motion can be treated as an application for a writ of coram nobis, and the validity of the sentence may then be tested, in an appropriate case.\u201d Igo v. United States, 10th Cir. 1962, 303 F.2d 317, 318. But it is only in an appropriate case that coram nobis will lie. It is an extraordinary remedy and one that should be allowed only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice. United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248. In the Morgan case relief by coram nobis was granted because the federal conviction was taken into account by a state court in imposing sentence for a state crime. In Marcello v. United States, 5th Cir. 1964, 328 F.2d 961, this Court sustained coram nobis relief where the judgment of conviction was being made the basis of a deportation order. We find no circumstance here that compels the treatment of the Section 2255 motion as an application for a writ of coram nobis. This case is not unlike Ragavage v. United States, 5th Cir. 1959, 272 F.2d 196, cert. den. 363 U.S. 806, 80 S.Ct. 1241, 4 L.Ed.2d 1149. Ragavage was convicted of kidnapping on his plea of guilty. He was in state custody when he sought 2255 relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>In a per curiam opinion the denial of relief was affirmed. The Shelton opinion was not mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">To hold that this cause should be entertained on a coram nobis theory would open the door to all manner of applications where, as here, no relief could be granted. The appeal should be and is</p>\n<p id=\"Ake\">Dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-21\">.

As presiding judge, I submitted to my brothers a proposed one-sentence order reading, \u201cLeave to appeal in forma pauperis is hereby granted.\u201d It was, and still is, my thinking that the allegation of a coerced plea of guilty depends on facts dehors the record, that the section 2255 motion should not have been denied without a hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and hence that leave to appeal in forma pauperis should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">My brothers, however, raise, sua sponte, as a jurisdictional obstacle their view that the movant is not in federal custody because the record discloses that he is in a Florida state penitentiary serving sentences for offenses against that State. The movant, appearing pro se, made the further allegation that there is a \u201cfederal detainer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">With deference, I submit that it is my brothers who are permitting themselves to \u201cindulge in a conjecture or surmise\u201d when they reach the conclusion, without any opportunity for the movant to be heard on the issue, that the record affirmatively discloses an absence of jurisdiction. The record does not show that movant\u2019s federal sentence has expired, and clearly it has not or he would not be here complaining. If we granted leave to appeal in forma pauperis, and the facts on this new issue were developed on the hearing on the merits as would be proper,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we might know officially that the movant was conditionally released on parole from the federal penitentiary with a part of his federal sentence unserved. If, as the majority holds, the movant must begin actually serving the remainder of his allegedly illegal federal sentence before he can test its legality, it may'well be that his sentence will have been served before its legality can be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">An absence of remedy which would require service of any part of an illegal sentence is a gross inadequacy. I submit that our modern federal procedure is not subject to that criticism.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The simplest answer is that the prisoner remains \u201cwhile on parole, in the legal custody and under the control of the Attorney General, until the expiration of the maximum term * * * for which he was sentenced.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4203.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Likewise, a state prisoner on parole remains \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>My brothers, however, raise the conceptual objection that: \u201cYoung is in the Florida penitentiary. There cannot be dual or joint custody. An order of release under Section 2255 would be a nullity. We think there was no custody as to sustain jurisdiction under Section 2255.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">With deference, I submit that such a barren conceptual objection is not sound, and should not operate to deprive the movant of any effective remedy. There was a \u201cfederal detainer,\u201d thus continuing the \u201clegal custody and * * * control of the Attorney General.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4203. That statute contains no exception to its requirement that a prisoner \u201cremain, while on parole, in the legal custody and under the control of the Attorney General, until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced.\u201d With deference, I submit that my brothers have no authority to amend that statute so as to except the time which the prisoner may spend in a State prison.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Abstract questions of \u201ccustody\u201d of a prisoner as between State and federal authorities are matters of comity between sovereigns which present no obstacle to a trial by the other sovereign.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Conversely, such questions should present no obstacle to the assertion of a prisoner\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Moreover, if there is not such custody as to permit the exercise of section 2255 jurisdiction, we should, as in the Shelton case, cited supra n. 5, \u201c \u2018treat the record as adequately presenting a motion in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis enabling the trial court to properly exercise its jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d 242 F.2d at 101, 111. This proposition was followed on en banc rehearing. See 246 F.2d 571 at 577, 578. The Supreme Court\u2019s per curiam order of reversal, 356 U.S. 26, necessarily held by implication that the district court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">Indeed my brothers concede as much, but express uncertainty \u201cas to whether jurisdiction was exercised under Section 2255 or of a coram nobis proceeding.\u201d To me that seems immaterial. By one-route or the other, jurisdiction existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">I differ with my brothers\u2019 further objections to the treatment of the motion-as an application for a writ of coramnobis, which, as I understand them, are: (a) that no relief can be granted; and (b) that the circumstances do not compel such action to achieve justice. With deference, I submit that the responses-to those objections are too obvious to require statement. In any event, those-objections are not jurisdictional, but are-matters requiring the exercise of discretion in a case which has not yet been-heard by this Court on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">The district court did not doubt its-jurisdiction. That doubt has arisen on&gt; this Court\u2019s consideration of the motion-, for leave to appeal in forma pauperis.. The record does not disclose that the district court lacked jurisdiction. Leave to&gt; appeal in forma pauperis should be granted. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">. See Waley v.
