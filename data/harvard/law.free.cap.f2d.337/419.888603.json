Petitioner was there likewise represented by experienced \u25a0counsel. A consideration of this record convinces us that there was ample basis from qualified medical-psychiatric experts for the trial Court\u2019s conclusion that at the time of his trial, Petitioner had the requisite mental capacity to stand trial and assist in his defense. The hearings and the evidence satisfied the requirements elucidated in Bishop v. United States, 1956, 350 U.S. 961, 76 S.Ct. 440, 100 L.Ed. 835; Dusky v.
