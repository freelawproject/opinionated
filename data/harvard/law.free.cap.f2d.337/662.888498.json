No. 71,667, filed April 16, 1959; dismissed oppositions by Hammermill to the registration by Gulf States of \u201cE-Z DUPLICATOR,\u201d Ser. No. 99,212, filed June 17, 1960, and \u201cE-Z MIMEOGRAPH,\u201d Ser. No. 99,211, filed . June 17, 1960; and sustained a petition by Gulf States to cancel Hammermill\u2019s registration of \u201cE-Z PAPER PAK\u201d on the Supplemental Register, Reg. No. 698,743, granted May 31, 1960. These proceedings were all consolidated and tried and appealed as one.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-18\">Hammermill appeals from the granting of the petition in Cancellation No. 7,591 and from the sustaining of Gulf States\u2019 Opposition No. 40,385. It expressly waived its appeal from the decision dismissing its two oppositions, Nos. 40,863 and 40,866.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-19\">The nub of the issue, as we glean it from the 75 pages of briefs, is likelihood of confusion as between Gulf States\u2019 admittedly prior marks \u201cE-Z PAK\u201d and \u201cE-Z CARI\u201d for paper bags, registered respectively as Reg. No. 625,877, April 24, 1956, and Reg. No. 629,101, June 19, 1956, and appellant\u2019s \u201cHAMMERMILL E-Z CARRY PAK\u201d and \u201cE-Z PAPER PAK,\u201d used on carrying cases or boxes for so-called \u201cfine\u201d paper such as typewriter or duplicator paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-20\">The board thought confusion would be likely and, for the reasons sufficiently stated in the board\u2019s opinion, which both parties conceded at oral argument to be factually accurate, so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-21\">In answer to appellant\u2019s arguments that \u201cit will suffer irreparable damage if it is divested of its trademarks\u201d and that \u201cHammermill will suffer irreparable damage if its trade-marks are cancelled\u201d we point out that this proceeding has nothing to do with divestiture or cancellation <em>of trademarks. </em>We are concerned only with a refusal to <em>register </em>a mark and the cancellation of a <em>registration. </em>Appellant\u2019s right to use it is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-22\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
