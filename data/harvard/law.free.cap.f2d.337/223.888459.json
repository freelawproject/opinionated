State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 299 F.2d 525, we reversed and remanded the case for a trial of the Assured\u2019s claim that the Insurer was liable-for the excess of the damage-claimant\u2019s-judgment over the policy limits. On the-eve of that trial, the Insurer, under F.R. Civ.P. 19(b), sought to bring in theDonaldsons, the damage-claimant-judgment creditors, as necessary parties. The-theory asserted in this amended answer was that by conduct of the judgment creditors there had been an accord and satisfaction of the judgment against the Assured Smoot. If that were so, there would then be nothing to try in the suit of the Assured <em>vis-a-vis </em>the Insurer. Though objecting to this unorthodox transmutation of the Assured\u2019s suit into a trial of rights as between the Assured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>and his recent (and continuing) adversaries, the Assured waived the requirement of time. That limited case proceeded to trial before a jury. After denial of motions for directed verdict, the jury found, in effect, accord and satisfaction. The Donaldsons appeal. Smoot, as a protective measure in the event the Donald-sons prevail, also appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Without undertaking to determine whether this procedure was a permissible application of F.R.Civ.P. 19(b), we are of the clear view that under controlling Georgia principles by which we are <em>Erie-bound, </em>there was as a matter of law no accord and satisfaction as there was no condition of payment express or implied. See American Associated Cos., Inc. v. Vaughn, 1957, 213 Ga. 119, 97 S.E.2d 144; Rivers v. Cole Corp., 1952, 209 Ga. 406, 73 S.E.2d 196; Sylvania Electric Products Inc. v. Electrical Wholesalers Inc., 1945, 198 Ga. 870, 876, 33 S.E.2d 5 (dissenting opinion). The trial Court should therefore have directed a verdict for the Donaldsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The District Court\u2019s judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was erroneous and must be reversed. This means that the declaration that the State Court judgments are satisfied, paid and execution cancelled are therefore vacated and reversed. Likewise the entries on the execution docket pursuant thereto are extinguished and to be expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">This leaves then only the case between Smoot, the Assured, and the Insurer for his damages for the excess of these valid, outstanding State Court judgments over the policy limits. As it was in 1962, this case must again be reversed and remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">. \u201cIT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED AS FOLLOWS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">\u201c(a) The verdict of the jury in the favor of the Plea of accord and Satisfaction is hereby made the judgment of this Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">\u201c(b) The judgments and executions hereinabove referred to are declared and adjudicated to be satisfied and to have been paid in full;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">\u201c(c) The said William M.
