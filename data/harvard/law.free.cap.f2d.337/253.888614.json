We held that venue lay in the Tenth Circuit and denied the motion. Texaco, Inc., v. Federal Power Commission, 10 Cir., 317 F.2d 796, 800-802, 807. The Supreme Court reversed, saying that the Tenth Circuit did not have venue. Federal Power Commission v. Texaco, Inc., 377 U.S. 33, 37-39, 45, 84 S.Ct. 1105, 12 L.Ed.2d 112. Texaco then filed a motion in the Supreme Court asking that the case be either remanded to the Third Circuit or to the Tenth Circuit with directions to transfer the proceedings to the Third Circuit. The motion was denied. Federal Power Commission v. Texaco, Inc., 377 U.S. 974, 84 S.Ct. 1881, 12 L.Ed.2d 745. Thereafter the Supreme Court remanded the case to this court \u201cfor further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of this Court.\u201d This was followed by the motions now under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-22\">In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company v. Federal Power Commission, 10 Cir., 337 F.2d 249 (No. 7587\u2014opinion filed this day) we granted, over the objection of the Commission, the transfer of the proceedings in that case to the Eighth Circuit. On the basis of that authority we would grant the transfer in this case if it were not for the direction of the Supreme Court. In its opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ion the Supreme Court said (377 U.S. 39, 84 S.Ct.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">\u201cTexaco is a Delaware corporation and there is no claim that its principal place of business is within the Tenth Circuit. The Court of Appeals therefore erred in failing to dismiss its petition for lack of venue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The remand to us is for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion and the opinion says that we erred in not dismissing the petition. We are bound thereby and have no alternative to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The motion for transfer is denied and the petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
