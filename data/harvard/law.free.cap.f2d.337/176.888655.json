Petitioner, while serving a five-year sentence, escaped and was subsequently apprehended and sentenced to an additional consecutive sentence of two-and-one-half years for such escape. Given a mandatory release on February 13, 1963, he was returned to custody on September 5, 1963, for violation of the terms of his release, to serve 763 days of good time previously allowed on the aggregated sentences. Asserting that at such time he had completely served his original five-year sentence, he contends that the application of aggregated sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4161 and the forfeiture of good time under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4165 are invalidly imposed. This court has consistently held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>otherwise. Downey v. Taylor, Warden, 10 Cir., 327 F.2d 660, and cases therein cited; Hoover v.
