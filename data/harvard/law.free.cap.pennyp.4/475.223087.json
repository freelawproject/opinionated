The land sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>recovered in this suit was included in that deed. Defendant gave in evidence deed dated March 3,1882, (two months prior to bringing this suit,) by which Arthamer Ames and wife conveyed to John Yorty:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">\u201cAll the following described tract of land situated-in West Pike Run township, bounded by land of Isaac Thompson, John Duvall, William Allen, and A. D. Scott, making the road that goes from the N ational road to the Pike Run road the line between Arthamer Ames, and the said Yorty, containing twenty-four acres, more or. less, being the same property as purchased at sheriff\u2019s sale by William Beall and conveyed by him to Arthamer Ames by deed dated December 25, 1872, and recorded in book S, Yol. Y, page 501.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">Defendant offered to prove that the defendant and those under whom he claims, have been in continuous adverse possession for twenty-one years or more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-7\">Objected to by plaintiff for the reason that under the rule of court they have not notified the plaintiff of the evidence in their bill of particulars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-8\">Offer overruled. Exception by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-9\">The plaintiff offered to show in rebuttal the location of the road referred to in said deed of Ames to Yorty, with reference to the land therein mentioned, and that said road intersects said land, cutting off a small- portion thereof from the twenty-four acres, more or less, it being the land in dispute, for the purpose of showing that the disputed land was not included in the deed from Ames to Yorty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-10\">Objected to as incompetent and irrelevant, the plaintiff having already parted with his interest in the land deeded to him by William Beall by his conveyance of March 3, 1882, to John Yorty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-11\">Objection overruled. Exception by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-12\">Defendant\u2019s counsel presented the following point for charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-13\">\u201cThe Court is respectfully requested to instruct the jury that there is no exception or reservation in the deed from the plaintiff to Yorty put in evidence by the defendant; that all the right, title, and interest of the plaintiff to the land in dispute passed to Yorty by the deed aforesaid, and that consequently the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-14\">The Court thereupon charged the jury, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqQ\">\u201cThe title that is held by the plaintiff overlaps a certain road, and extends into a field, which is in possession of Mr. Scott; and the disputed tract is inclosed, by Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Scott\u2019s fence. There is no doubt of that, gentlemen, from the evidence. It is a very small piece of ground, containing less than a quarter of an acre, but it lies in Mr. Scott\u2019s field. Now, then, under the circumstances, the plaintiff is entitled 'to recover here, he holding the older title to this piece of ground, if you are satisfied that is the case\u2014 that this piece of ground is inclosed in Mr. Scott\u2019s field, and is not included in the conveyance made by the plaintiff to John Yorty before the bringing of this suit. [Now, I instruct you that if you believe the evidence in regard to the location of the disputed piece of ground, and there don\u2019t seem to be any doubt about it \u2014 that it is not included in the deed from Arthamer Ames to John Yorty, and therefore that it still belongs to Mr. Ames, your verdict should be for the plaintiff for the land in dispute.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-4\">\u201c There is no question here in regard to the Statute of Limitations ; and. you are confined to'the one point. [If you believe that this land in dispute lies between Mr. Yorty\u2019s ground and Mr. Scott\u2019s according to the deed of conveyance from Ames to Yorty, why, that little piece of ground was reserved and belongs to the plaintiff, and he is entitled to your verdict in this action. Your verdict, should be simply for the plaintiff for the land in controversy.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-5\">September 21, 1883, verdict for plaintiff, upon which judgment was afterwards entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">The defendant then took out a writ of error, and assigned as error the refusal of defendant\u2019s offer, and admission of plaintiff\u2019s offer of evidence as above stated, the answer to the point, and the parts of the charge inclosed between brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-7\"><em>J. L. Juclson </em>and <em>Dougan &amp; Todd </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-8\">\u2022The only effect of omitting to give notice of special matter is to confine the defense to the general matters under the pleas on the record: Ege <em>v. </em>Medlar, 1 Nor., 101; Moyer \u25a0\u00bb. Fisher, 12 Har., 515; Snyder <em>v. </em>Bauchman, 8 S. &amp; B,., 336 ; Black <em>t&gt;. </em>Tricker, 2 P. F. Sm., 436 ; Patterson <em>v. </em>Brindle, 9 Watts, 99. The defense of \u2018the Statute of Limitations was therefore admissible under the plea of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-9\">Where the description of the subject-matter conveyed is defective, uncertain, or too .general to be understood, explanatory evidence is admissible: Best <em>v. </em>Hammond, 5 P. F. Sm., 409. But where a subject-matter exists which will satisfy the terms of the instrument of conveyance, the explanatory evidence is inadmissible: Starkie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>on Ev., 693 ; Wusthoff <em>'o. </em>Dracourt, 3 Watts, 240 ; Harvey <em>v. </em>Yandegrift, 8 Nor., 346; Appel <em>v. </em>Byers, 2 Out., 479. The land conveyed to Yorty is identified by the deed, hence parol evidence was inadmissible: 1 Green-leaf Ev., sec. 297 ; Wright <em>v. </em>Weakly, 2 Watts, 89.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-4\">An exception out of a grant ought to be stated and described fully and accurately : Bouv. Law Diet., tit. Exception, 1 Greenleaf Ev., sec. 297.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-5\"><em>John L. Goto </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-6\">The argument that the defense is admissible under the general issue would render the rnle of court inoperative and of no effect. The cases referred to decide that the defendant will not be allowed to give affirmative evidence in support of his plea, but will merely be allowed to repel the case of the plaintiff : Moyer <em>r&gt;. </em>Fisher, 12 Har., 515 ; Black \u00ae. Tricker, 2 P. F. Sm., 436 ; Daniel <em>v. </em>Wilver, 12 Har., 516.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-7\">No exception of the one fourth acre was made or intended. It was not embraced in the conveyance to Yorty, and this may be shown by locating the boundaries : Mc-Clenahan \u00bb. Humes, 1 Casey, 87. The recital is descriptive of the title only: Chaplin <em>v. </em>Srodes, 7 Watts, 410.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-8\">The question whether the land in controversy was embraced in the deed could only be determined by parol testimony: Hoffman <em>v. </em>Danner, 2 Harris, 28; Collins <em>v. </em>Rush, 7 S. &amp; R., 147.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b474-9\">November 3d, 1884.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AxS\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"AcU\">The rule of court requiring a bill of particulars to be furnished is a just and wise one, and it was properly enforced in this case. No valid reason was given for the omission to state in the bill the title attempted to be given in evidence. No request was made for leave to amend the bill. The evidence was properly refused. The reference in the deed to \u201cthe road, that goes from the National road to the Pike Run road\u201d as one of the boundaries of the land conveyed, made the parol evidence proper. The object thereof was not\u201d to establish that the land in question was technically excepted out of the land conveyed, but to prove that it was not intended to be included within the boundaries given in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
