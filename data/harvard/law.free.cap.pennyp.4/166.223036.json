Hall, the defendant, died the owner and in possession of a farm which included the land in controversy. O. E. Pickett was appointed administrator of his estate. In May, 1870, on application of the administrator, the orphans\u2019 court made an order authorizing the administrator to sell the farm for the payment of the debts of decedent. In September, 1870, the administrator made his return, setting forth that he had made sale of the premises to J. Gr. Sterling, for the sum of $1,075. The fund arising from this sale constituted the entire estate. John Bishop, the guardian of some of decedent\u2019s minor children, filed exceptions to the sale on the ground of inadequacy of price. The parties met in December, 1870, for the purpose of taking depositions. The defendant testified that at this meeting a written agreement was executed between plaintiff and himself. Evidence was offered of the loss of the instrument. He further testified, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-5\">\u201cHe agreed to give me one half of this eighty-five acres as it was called, and give me a deed of it as soon as he got his deed, and I was to support the family and take care of them, and make it a home for them, and give him my share, whatever it might be, when it was settled up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-6\"><em>Q. </em>Your share of what?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-7\"><em>A. </em>My share that occurred from the sale of the place in the administrator\u2019s hands.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-8\">This testimony was corroborated by several witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-9\">As a result of this meeting, the bid of Sterling was transferred to the plaintiff, February 14, 1871, the return amended, the sale confirmed, and a deed given to the plaintiff. The plaintiff gave to the administrator a judgment note for $793 29, payable in one year from the final confirmation of the sale, which provided that \u201cthis note is not to be negotiable, but to be held by administrator until his final account is settled, and not be collected until his account is finally confirmed by the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-10\">This note was not paid, and the administrator entered judgment upon it to September term, 1879, and issued execution.

If you find that there was a written contract by which this land was to belong to Hall, he giving for it his share or interest in his father\u2019s estate, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover in this case the land described in the writ, that recovery to be set aside upon the defendants paying to him, or into court for his use, the value of that share.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-12\">[\u201c The form of your verdict will be that you find for the plaintiff the land described in the writ with costs, to be released upon the defendant\u2019s paying so much, stating the sum that you find the defendant should pay in order to hold this land within such a time, naming the time within which you think he should pay it.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-13\">On Ilecember 23, 1883, the jury rendered the following verdict: \u201cThe jury aforesaid do say in their verdict, on their oaths, that they find in favor of the plaintiff the land described in the writ, and costs, to be set aside and judgment entered for the defendant on his paying into court, for the use of the plaintiff, the sum of $76 20, with interest and costs within ninety days.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-14\">December 28, 1883 \u2014 Judgment upon the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-15\">The defendant thereupon took this writ, assigning for error, <em>inter alia, </em>the answer to the plaintiff\u2019s point as above, and the portions of the charge in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-16\"><em>Dames &amp; Hall </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Coburn was a trustee <em>ex maleficio </em>for the plaintiff in error: Wolford <em>v. </em>Herrington, 86 Pa.

The plaintiff avers the contract was oral; that he was to convey upon payment of all the purchase money, and that Hall was to give his share of his father\u2019s estate and the further sum of one hundred dollars. It appears that, at the date of the making of the contract, the estate was.merely the purchase money of land sold by the administrator at orphans\u2019 court sale, and, by arrangement, Coburn was to take the place of the bidder; some debts and expenses were to be paid out of that money. On May 1, 1871, Coburn gave his note to the administrator, which was not to be negotiable, and not to be collected until confirmation by the court of the final administration account. The defendant alleges there was a written agreement that Coburn would convey the land to him soon as he received his deed from the administrator; that defendant would take care, of the family and make the land a home for them, and give his share of his father\u2019s estate, whatever it might be when settled, to Coburn. Whichever of the alleged contracts is the true one, the case is simple. No trust1 relation is involved. Upon the verity of Coburn\u2019s allegation, he is entitled to one hundred dollars and Hall\u2019s share of the estate, and is not bound to make a deed till payment. If the contract be as alleged by Hall, he was to give nothing but his share in the estate, and Coburn was bound to convey to Hall soon as he got his deed from the administrator. Coburn already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>had the share in his hands, and was not bound to pay it to the administrator until settlement of his account. The contract to give the share was virtually executed. If the administrator collected the note, Coburn was entitled to receive from him the share he purchased from Hall. There is no complaint that Hall did not give the care and home to the family as he agreed, and they were interested in that part of the contract, not Coburn. It is unlikely that Coburn would have been allowed to take the place of the bidder had he not made the contract to sell this part of the land to Hall. The contract imposed no duty on Hall respecting the settlement of the estate\u2014 he has not received any money, directly or indirectly, from the administrator on the share he gave to Coburn. If it has been left in the hands of the sheriff, so far as shown, it is neither merit nor fault in Hall; had lie taken it, he would have been in fault. Then, if the contract was made, as Hall alleges, and he has not in any way hindered Coburn from receiving and realizing the share of the estate, he owes Coburn nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The amount of money naujed in the verdict to be paid to release the land indicates that the jury found the contract as alleged by defendant, and that he had performed his part. If so, it is unjust that he be made to pay costs. The plaintiff should have delivered him a deed for the land instead of suing him. But if the jury found that he was to pay one hundred dollars, besides the share of the estate, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict for the land, to be released upon payment of the amount due and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The jury were instructed that, under all the evidence in the case, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the laud, to be released upon the payment by defendant of the purchase price therefor, or any part thereof, and costs. That was correct, if the defendant owed any purchase money. Upon the facts alleged by the plaintiff, upon the evidence alone adduced by him, there is no error in the instructions set out in the third, fourth, and fifth assignments. Upon the facts alleged by the defendant, the plaintiff had no right to a verdict for the land. How could the jury find that the defendant should pay the amount of the share of the estate, if he had abstained from control over, or interference with, or receipt of that share after the making of the contract ? As the case comes, no evidence appears to warrant inference that he exercised any control over the share of the estate after the contract. If the administrator or other persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>caused the note to be collected by the sheriff, that of itself did not obligate the defendant to ascertain and receive the distributive share and pay it over to the plaintiff. The last three assignments must be sustained, for the instructions should have been properly adapted to whichever condition of facts the jury were warranted in finding from the testimony. Under proper instructions they might have found a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
