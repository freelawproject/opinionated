A. T. Andrews is their general agent and salesman for Crawford county. In June, 1882, Andrews sold a reaper belonging to the plaintiffs, and of their manufacture, to the defendant. As to the conditions of the-sale, the evidence was conflicting. The defendant'and his son testified that Andrews had promised that \u201cthe machine would be a good one, and run light, and do its work in No. 1 good order, and give good satisfaction, and deliver its sheaves good;\u201d that Andrews had further warranted it to do good work in every respect, and to be equal to and run as light as the McGranahan machine, and that if, when the machine was received, it did not do as it was agreed and warranted it should do, the defendant, after a trial of it, should be privileged to return it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-4\">The defendant and a number of other witnesses testified that the machine was tried upon several days after defendant\u2019s receipt of it, in cutting wheat, and that its draught- was much heavier than the McGranahan machine ; that it did not do as good work as that reaper, and that it did its work badly. Some of the witnesses, upon whose farms the .reaper had been used, testified that they would not have it in their fields. The defendant, after trying the machine about one week, returned it to Andrews, leaving it in front of the latter\u2019s house. One of defendant\u2019s witnesses, Tedlock, who had been at work on Andrews\u2019 farm at the time the machine was returned, testified that he had asked Andrews why it was Blair had brought the machine back; \u201che said he didn\u2019t know; says he, \u2018 I understand it didn\u2019t do good work, or Mr. Blair didn\u2019t like it.\u2019 I asked him myself if Mr. Blair didn\u2019t get it on trial; he said he did ; he said he got it to cut two or three pieces of grain ; if it done good work he was to keep it; if it didn\u2019t do good work, he was to return it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">Andrews, testifying for the plaintiffs, denied that he had given any warranty with the machine, and that he had any conversation with Tedlock such as is noted above ; he and other of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses testified that the machine sold to Blair did good work, and that any bad results obtained from it were due to unskillful handling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">The plaintiffs submitted the following point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">\u201cThat if the jury find, from the evidence, that the sale was upon condition that the reaper should do good work, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the defendant is bound to show that the defective work complained of was through no fault of his, and that the reaper was not capable of doing good work by the exercise of ordinary skill in its management and use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">The Court answered this point as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-7\">This point is affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-8\">[You will bear in mind, gentlemen, that a farmer buys a mowrer or reaper expecting it to be used by a farmer of average, ordinary intelligence in the use and manipulation of mowers and reapers. A farmer is not required, when he buys a machine, to have a learned machinist to fix it up and run it for him, and to see that the nuts and bolts are kept in their places. It is not necessary that a farmer should keep an agent of the manufacturer about him. It must be such a machine as is used by the ordinary, average farmer in the grain field. Otherwise a machine might be built of the best mechanism theoretically, but unfortunately of no use to the farmer, because he would not have that degree of skill as a machinist to run it. It must be capable of a fair, ordinary, average test by a farmer. Machines are made and sold to be used by farmers, and not by persons skilled above their fellows in mechanics.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-9\">Exception.

(First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-13\">Yerdict for defendant and judgment thereon; upon which plaintiffs took this writ, assigning for error, <em>inter </em>alia, the portions of the charge of the court included within brackets above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-14\"><em>Geo. F. Davenport </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-15\">The plaintiffs alleged the sale of a Champion reaper to defendant. He admitted the sale, but alleged a warranty that it would do good work \u2014 as good as McGranahan\u2019s reaper \u2014 and a breach of the warranty. There were, therefore, but two questions in the case : \u25a0 First. Was there a warranty ? Second. Was there a breach ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-16\">In the first assignment, the Court, in substance, charged the jury that there is, in the sale of a reaper, an implied warranty of fitness. That is not the law. A distinction is made where a thing is bought for a special purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>and a special thing is bought: Port Carbon Iron Company \u00ae. Groves, 18 Sm., 149. &lt;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-4\">True, the Court afterwards instructed the jury there was an allegation of an express warranty; but if, under, the evidence, they did not find that, still, under the charge, they might have found for the defendant under an implied warranty.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-5\"><em>Brawley &amp; McCHiniock </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">The Court substantially charged the jury that the defendant\u2019s right to set up, as a defense, the imperfections of the machine, depended upon the existence of an \u201cexpress warranty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-7\">Whereas, under the circumstances of this sale, there would be an implied warranty by the plaintiffs that the machine would do the work for which it was made and purchased well \u2014 the original agreement being executory ; if, upon receipt of the machine, it did not do'the work for which it was made and purchased, it was the right of the vendee to return the machine, and release himself of the obligation of the contract: 1 Parsons on Contract, 586; Jones <em>v. </em>Bright, 5 Bing., 533 ; Laing \u00ae. Fidgeon, 6 Taunton, 108 ; Brown \u00ae. Edgington, 2 Man. and G., 279 ; Shepherd \u00bb. Pybus, 3 Man. and G., 868; Howa d <em>v. </em>Hoey, 23 Wend., 351; Hart\u00ae.

Where a manufacturer of a reaper sells one to a farmer, we think it is sold and bought with the understanding that it will do the kind of work for which it was made. Here, however, there was evidence of an agreement on the part of the\u2019vendor that it would do as good work as another machine named. The jury have found that it was not as good, and did not do good work. The assignments are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Judgment affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
