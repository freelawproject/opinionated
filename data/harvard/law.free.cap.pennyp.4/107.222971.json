He directed his executor to sell the real estate, leaving one third of the proceeds as an incumbrance upon it to secure the life interest of his wife, and the residue, after payment of the legacies to his daughter and grandson, to be paid to Mrs. Weddell. The testimony showed that Douglass was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>man of weak intellect; that he had been several times confined in an asylum, and that at one time he had had a committee appointed to take charge of his estate. It also appeared that insanity was hereditary in his family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\"><em>John O. Rankin </em>was called by the defendant, and asked:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">Do you know the condition his (testator\u2019s) daughter and grandson were in, financially <em>\\</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">Objected to by plaintiff as incompetent and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-9\">The Count: Testimony received; objection overruled.

M. Brown </em>and <em>M. P. Douglass </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-22\">The first, second, and sixth specifications of error prove that testimony was admitted to show that Margaret Douglass and James E. Myers were very poor; that Margaret was not physically strong, and much more of the same sort. This, we submit, was not simply erroneous, but strongly tended to produce the result reached by the-trial \u2014 a verdict giving the property to these impecunious people, mainly because of their poverty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-23\">If the validity of wills is to be determined by such facts, few of them would be upheld. The most impecunious of the next of kin are sometimes the most undeserving of bounty; and a testator, having testamentary capacity, has the right to nominate the objects of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>bounty, althougn his judgment may not be approved by his neighbors. Under the rulings in the present case, the verdict could not be otherwise than in favor of the penniless contestants, and. against the presumably rich legatee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-6\"><em>John Dalzell </em>and <em>J. W. Baillie </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">The first, second, and sixth assignments of error relate to the same subject. The Court below admitted evidence tending to show the miserable condition, pecuniary and physical, of Robert Douglass\u2019 only living daughter, to whom, under the alleged will, was left a pittance of $300, and charged the jury that if, under the evidence, they found that Maria Weddell, to whom was left the bulk of the estate, was well-to-do and not in need of such bounty, they might take these facts into consideration in passing upon the questions of the validity of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-8\">The evidence was admissible and the charge was rignt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-9\">\u2018 \u2018 The fact that a man\u2019s will is unaccountably contrary to the common sense of the country is not sufficient, <em>ipso </em>facto, to set it aside. But certainly that which outrages common feeling, and displays a want of natural affection, is a fact to be considered, along with other evidence, in the question of unsoundness or delusion of mind.\u201d Bitner <em>v. </em>Bitner, 65 Penn. St., 362; Pidcock <em>v. </em>Potter, 68 Penn. St., 352.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b103-10\">November 10th, 1884.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AAn\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"A5S\">The evidence of unsound mind of the testator, for many years, was so clear and strong that it increased the probability of improper influence having been exercised over.him. While a person of sound mind may disinherit those who are most nearly related to him by blood, and who would inherit from him in case he died intestate, yet after some evidence is given of great imbecility of mind, and of improper influence in making the testamentary devise, the helpless and dependent condition of such near relatives who were strongly discriminated against may be shown as bearing on the question of imbecility or restrained volition. Wholly unexplained, it is a fact proper to consider as indicating the absence of a reasonable natural affection implanted in the human mind. The assignments are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
