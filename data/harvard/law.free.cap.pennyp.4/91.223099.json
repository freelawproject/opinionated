The action is grounded on a contract relation, the essential characteristics of which are recognition by the occupant of the owner\u2019s title, and possession in subordination thereto, with his express or implied assent. As was said in Brolasky <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 12 Wright, 434, the proof of such relation may be either direct or presumptive. If the occupant of the premises has been in possession by permission of the owner, the law will presume a promise to pay a reasonable rent, though none has been expressly agreed upon. In such case, the contract is deduced from the assent of the owner, and the acts of the occupant in pursuance thereof ; but, when the occupant enters without any understanding with the owner, and without ids knowledge, there can be no basis for any implication of a contract to pay for the use of the premises. Tested by these principles, plaintiff below had no case, and defendant\u2019s fifth point, in which the court was requested to instruct the jury, \u201cThat under all the evidence their verdict should be for defendant,\u201d should have been affirmed. In his examination-in-chief, plaintiff testified in substance that defendant took possession of the house and lot on the death of his mother, in 1878, and has lived there ever since; that at one time he demanded possession of the premises, but defendant refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>to surrender the same. On cross-examination, lie was asked: \u201cWhen did you first ask Henry for rent, if you ever did?\u201d His answer was, \u201cI did not ask him for rent, because lie would not give me any that I know of.\u201d And to the question, \u2018 \u2018 Hid lie ever agree to pay you any rent ?\u2019 \u2019 lie replied, \u201cNo; I made no arrangement with Mm. All I wanted was to board there somewhere.\u201d In the face of this testimony, and plaintiff had nothing better on which to rely, it was clearly impossible for the jury to find that any s.uch relation as that of landlord and tenant existed between the parties. On the contrary, the only inference that could be legitimately drawn by the jury from the evidence was, that on the death of his mother, defendant, as her devisee of the premises in question took, and retained possession thereof, in his own right, and not in subordination to the title of Ms father or any one else. In other words, plaintiff below failed <em>to </em>make out such a case as warranted a verdict in his favor. It is unnecessary to consider the specifications of error in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
