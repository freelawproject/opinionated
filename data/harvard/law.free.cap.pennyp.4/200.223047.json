Upon this farm there were two sets of buildings, consisting of thirteen barns, sheds, and out-buildings, and two dwelling-houses, all of which were in good condition for farming purposes. The northern part of the farm fronts on a public road called the Buffalo road, and extends along it for a distance of 2,000 feet. Parallel with this road, and about 200 feet south of it, the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern railroad is located through, the said farm and occupies 2 acres 119 perches of land. On the south of this railroad, and within 15 feet of its right of way, stands the dwelling of \u25a0Gr. T. Elliott, and to the eastward, another dwelling-house 78 feet from said railroad.

The defendant company then took possession of the right of way, constructed its railroad thereon, and shortly thereafter began to operate it. The right of way of this railroad is located 93 feet south of Elliott\u2019s dwelling, and extends through the entire farm, east and west, occupying 2 acres 123 perches. Between the rights of Avay of the txvo railroads are the two houses and 6 acres 118 perches of land, leaving about 86 acres south of the road of defendant company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-9\">A number of witnesses testified as to the character of the injury done to the land and the buildings, and the amount of the damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-10\">Defendant\u2019s counsel asked witness, John Love, the following question: \u201cBy whom were the barns and the sheds upon the right of way taken off the right of Avay <em>V\u2019 </em>Objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-11\">The Court. \u201cThere being no evidence upon this ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tion on tlie part of the plaintiff, the objection is sustained and the testimony rejected.\u201d Exception.

Here the defendant filed the petition and was required to plead to it, thus making the pleading one-sided. In R. R.

It would only have tended to mislead and confuse the jury. The application was too late, having been made when tbe case was called for trial: 79 Penna., 71. The court should not order a view in such case, except by consent or agreement of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-5\">When a railroad company takes private property for railroad purposes, the title to that property passes to the railroad company upon the filing and approval of the bond for the payment of damages to the land-owner. It follows, therefore, that the title to all the buildings, &amp;c., upon the land passes with it and belongs to the company. The land-owner has no right or power to interfere. If he did remove any of the materials from the right of way, he committed a trespass, and damages for such tresspass cannot be tried in an action of this kind, neither in* the way of set-off nor as a defense.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b197-6\">February 18, 1884,</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Ac-\">the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AY2\">Green, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">We are clearly of opinion that the defendants\u2019 offers of testimony in relation to the removal of the buildings on the plaintiff\u2019s land should have been received. The removal of the buildings was certainly an element of damage to be considered by the jury.__ If they were taken by the company, the land would bedvorth less than if they were left upon the premises. If the plaintiff took them, his damage would not be so great as if the company took them. It would be for the jury to consider all the circumstances in this connection, in order to determine intelligently what amount of injury was sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of what was done with the buildings, whether by the plaintiff or the defendant. They should know all the facts relating to the subject. The first six assignments, all of which relate to this matter, are sustained. The seventh is not sustained. The Court was not bound to direct the jury to go upon the premises. Such an order is often made, and, as a general rule, it is desirable that the jury should visit the premises, but there is no legal obligation on the part of the Court to make the order upon the mere application of one party and against the objection of the other. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>a view is desired, it can generally be bad by means of a struck jury, under the rules of practice which relate to that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In regard to the pleadings in such cases us this, the practice in some counties is to regulate them by rules of court. It is certainly more conformable to correct practice to have an issue regularly made up between the parties, and we see no objection to making the land-owner plaintiff. It does not seem that there is any rule of court in Erie county on the subject, at least none is referred to by counsel on either side. The act leaves the whole matter to the court, and we can hardly say there was error because the Court ordered the company to plead without a declaration. Such may be the practice in Erie county, and as the court of common pleas of that county has entire control over the mode of trial in such cases arising within its jurisdiction, the subject must be left to their direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Judgment reversed and new <em>venire </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
