This cause was removed to the common pleas of Lancaster county, September 4, 1880, a jury called October 11, 1880 ; the same day a verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff for $3,500, and on October 13, 1880, judgment th\u00e9reon. Charles H. Pennypacker and W. A. Atlee, Esqs., were the plaintiff\u2019s counsel of record, the former in Chester county, and the latter in Lancaster county. At this time, and until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>spring o\u00ed 1883, the defendant company was in the hands of receivers, and the judgment was not enforced by execution. On January 9, 1883, Charles H. Pennypacker agreed with the defendant\u2019s counsel to settle the same for $1,458 27, cash, and a due bill for five per cent, bonds for the same amount, when the bonds should be issued. The cash payment was made to Charles II. Pennypacker, and the due bill handed him the same day. By direction of Mr. Pennypacker, W. A. Atlee satisfied the judgment of record, January 19, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">Abraham Pennypacker had died December 10, 1881, intestate, leaving to survive him a widow and four children. He had made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors some years before, to his nephew, W. D. Christman, and' had died insolvent. W. D. Christman was spoken to by Charles H. Pennypacker, on January 13, 1883, about obtaining letters of administration upon the estate of Abraham Pennypacker, and agreed to procure them. The same day he received from Mr. Pennypacker $300 in cash, and the due bill. Letters of administration were issued to W. D. Christman on January 22, 1883. Subsequently, Mr. Pennypacker paid him an additional sum of $483 34; he also paid the widow for her exemption, $300, and retained for his and Mr. Atlee\u2019s fees, $375. These payments and the fees retained made up the sum of $1,458 28,' received by Mr. Pennypacker from the defendant company. The settlement made was without the knowledge or consent of any of the heirs of Abraham Pennypacker, and beyond the receipt by the widow of her $300 exemption, there was no ratification of the compromise by any of them. Except by his acts in receiving, before becoming administrator, the $300 and the due bill, and accepting, after the letters were granted, the sum of $483 34, as stated above, there were no words or acts of the administrator Christman to indicate his ratification of the settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\">Upon hearing and argument, the Court made the rule to strike off the entry of satisfaction absolute, Livingston, J., filing the following opinion, [after stating the facts:]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-8\">\u2018 \u2018 Had the attorney, under such circumstances, power to make a settlement or an arrangement to accept or take less than the amount due on the judgment, and thus prevent the recovery of the whole sum due to the administrator or widow and heirs of the plaintiff, who, in his lifetime, had been his client? In Chambers <em>v. </em>Miller, Judge Gibson says: \u2018An attorney is bound by a sacred trust, and policy requires that there bo no tanqoering with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>it. Beyond the exact justice in the particular case, it is the business of the law to bind mankind to an elevated and stern morality by making the consequence of a departure from it as disastrous as possible.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-4\">A number of cases were cited on the argument as to the power of an attorney-at-law to compromise and settle doubtful cases or claims in the absence of and without special authority from his client, but, in our judgment, these have no application to the case under consideration. The authority of an attorney-at-law, regularly employed, to compromise pending litigation of doubtful claims, is fully recognized by the English courts, and may, speaking generally, be said to be so recognized by the courts of Pennsylvania as well as in most of the United States. But this case.is not of this character. Here the client had obtained judgment, thus terminating with it all the uncertainties surrounding it; he had ended all difficulties, differences, and doubts that might or could have been urged against his claim to recover damages \u2014 the subject of controv\u00e9rsy and it had been clearly and conclusively ascertained and decided that he was entitled to receive and recover by an execution from the defendant a certain definite and fixed sum of money in cash. There was no doubtful or disputed claim, the subject of a pending suit, to be compromised or settled. It was simply an arrangement by an attorney, whose authority had been revoked by the death of his client, and before his administrator was appointed, with counsel for the defendant, to receive in full payment and satisfaction of the judgment a sum less than the amount due thereon ; a portion thereof to be in bonds not then issued, and when issued to be worth less than the sum they were to represent, and to enter full satisfaction on the record of the judgment. This, under the law and the evidence presented, he had certainly no such previous or prior authority for doing as would make such arrangement binding or conclusive on the legal representative or widow and heirs of Abraham Pennypacker, deceased; and he had no power of his own mere motion to remit any portion of the judgment, even if he had been regularly employed as counsel at the time of his so doing. In Stackhouses. O\u2019Hara\u2019s Executors, 2H., 89, Coulter, J., says: \u2018An attorney-at-law in Pennsylvania has very extensive powers in relation to conducting a suit, but after judgment this plenary power, in a great measure, ceases, excepting as to his power of receiving the amount of the judgment, and giving a receipt for it.\u2019 In Jewett <em>v. </em>Wadleigh, it is said: \u2018An attorney-at-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>has no authority .by virtue of his general employment to discharge an execution in favor of his client unless upon payment of its whole amount.\u2019 If he receives a less sum, it will not preclude his client from recovering the balance remaining unpaid. In Todd and Ireland it is said: \u2018A party will not be bound by a contract entered into on his behalf by his attorney-at-law without previous authority or subsequent ratification.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\">In Harrow \u00ae. Farrow, the Court says :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">An attorney-at-law has no authority to release a judgment obtained by him for his client without a new warrant. He remains attorney while the j udgment may be executed without new proceedings for its enforcement, not for its release. He had no authority as mere attorney to make such agreement or entry. He had no power as such to release the judgment nor to chaffer with the opposite party and receive money or other things in satisfaction of a judgment for land, nor can it make any difference or add any superior sanctity to the arrangement that it was entered of record in open court. The action of the attorney in this case having been without authority previously given, has it been adopted and ratified by those having authority to ratify it, and thus cause it to bind and conclude them or to estop them ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-7\">Ratification is where a person adopts a contract or other transaction which is not binding on him, because entered into by an unauthorized agent or the like ; if he adopts it, he is said to ratify it, and then it is as effectual as if it had been originally made with his authority, for <em>ratihabitio mandato compar atur.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-8\">Ratification of a contract is an agreement to adopt an act performed by another for us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-9\">By ratifying a contract, a man adopts tlie agency \u2014 altogether as well what is detrimental as that which is for his benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-10\">In the Pittsburgh and Steubenville Railroad Company \u00bb. Gazzan, it is said that ratification of a contract necessarily implies the relation of principal and agent, and unless that relation existed, the idea of ratification is necessarily excluded. But a ratification of his acts, unless done with full knowledge of his whole proceedings relative thereto, does not estop or bind the principal. From the evidence it is clear that after the death of Abraham Pennypacker, and prior to this alleged settlement, C. H. Pennypacker, the attorney, had not been employed by any one to collect the amount due on the judgment, or to make any arrangement concerning it; there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>administrator, and he says in his testimony he did not inform the widow and children of the settlement he had made until about a week afterwards, about the 16th or 17th of January. He does not say that he had any prior authority from them to make such arrangement. Where then did he obtain his authority? Who was his client'? Whose agent was he ? It does not appear that he was employed by any one, and, although he has labored most assiduously to have his act ratified, he has, in our judgment, after a full examination of the testimony presented, wholly failed to obtain a legal ratification thereof, and we , sliall therefore be obliged to make the rule absolute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">The defendant thereupon took this writ, assigning for error the action of the court in making absolute the rule to strike off the entry of satisfaction, in, holding that C. H. Pennypacker had no authority to make the settlement with the railroad company, and in holding that C. H. Pennypacker\u2019s act in making the settlement had not been legally ratified.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-5\"><em>II. M. North </em>and <em>E. D.

Without previous special authority or subsequent ratification he cannot compromise the fixed judgment and satisfy the same on the payment of a part thereof only. As, however, he may collect the money or a part thereof, so far as the same is actually paid to him, he may receipt, and to that extent it will pay and satisfy'the judgment. In the present case, the defendant in the judgment actually paid to the attorney the'sum of $1,458 33. Although the evidence of author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ifcy to compromise the judgment is not satisfactory, nor the evidence of ratification of the compromise sufficient,yet the knowledge of the defendant in error that the attorney had received money on the judgment is unquestioned. A portion of'this money was paid over to the administrator. While, then, the Court was justified in striking off the satisfaction to that portion of the judgment in excess of the money actually paid by the defendant therein, yet the order should have gone no further. It must be modified accordingly. The sum of $1,458 33 must be applied as a payment on the judgment as of the 10th of January, 1883, and the satisfaction be stricken off as to the residue of the judgment. Thus modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
