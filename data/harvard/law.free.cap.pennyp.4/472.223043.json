A. Rogers against Samuel Davidson, to recover the amount of an award rendered by arbitrators against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-8\">At the trial, February 29,1884, before Williams, P. J., the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-9\">On July 2, 1874, an agreement in writing was entered into between Rogers and Davidson, which contained, <em>inter </em>alia, the following article:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-10\">\u2018 \u2018 Said parties agree to have no litigation over this contract or the work under it, and if any real or supposed cause of complaint should arise, they hereby agree to submit the same to one or three indifferent men, to.be chosen by the parties as arbitrators are undef the general arbitration law, upon notice by either party as to the time and place of choosing, whose award shall be final.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-11\">A dispute having arisen between the parties, on June 7, 1875, Rogers served a notice upon Davidson to meet him at the prothonotary\u2019s office on the 22d day of the same month, to choose arbitrators to settle all matters at variance between them. On the day appointed, arbitrators were appointed by the prothonotary. On July 8, 1875, the arbitrators met and found for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-12\">The plaintiff offered in evidence the award of the arbitrators. The defendant objected, because the arbitrators were not chosen under any authority contained in the contract, or under any authority given to the prothonotary of the county of Warren by law or by the contract, and because, therefore, the arbitrators had no authority to act in the premises, and their award is null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-13\">The objections were sustained, under objection, and the Court' directed a compulsory non-suit, which it subsequently refused to take off. The plaintiff thereupon took this writ, assigning for error the action of the Court in refusing his offer, as above, and directing a non-suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-14\"><em>J. O. </em>Parmlee, <em>W. W. </em>Wilbur, and <em>W. M. Lindsey </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-15\">It is well settled that where parties to a contract have agreed to leave their differences to a particular person or persons, whose decision shall be final, resort must be had to the tribunal appointed by the agreement: Reynolds <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 1 Smith, 298; O\u2019Reilly <em>v. </em>Kerns, 2 <em>Id., </em>214; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Howard <em>v. </em>The Allegheny Yalley R.

Co. <em>v. </em>Fenlon, 4 W. &amp; S., 210.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-6\">The duty of courts is to enforce all lawful contracts made between parties, whatever they may be: Harris <em>v. </em>Ligget, 1 W. <em>&amp; </em>S., 301.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-7\">The court will always seek to uphold a . submission in spite of a defect in formality, according to the obvious intent of the parties: Morse on Arbitration and Award, 47.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AiD\"><em>Brown &amp; Stone, </em>and <em>John P. Vincent </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-9\">The agreement contains no submission that can be carried out according to its terms. The arbitrators were to be chosen by the parties, and not by the prothonotary of Warren county. The plaintiff assumes that the words \u2018 \u2018 as arbitrators are chosen under the general arbitration law,\u201d means that the one or three arbitrators are to be chosen by the prothonotary when neither the officer nor the county are named in the submission. If it was a sensible submission at all, it was clearly a prospective one \u2014 to arbitrators to be thereafter chosen by the parties. That such a decision is not binding on the parties, and does not oust the general jurisdiction of the courts, is decided in many cases : Me\u00fatz <em>r&gt;. </em>The Armenia Ins. Co., 79 Pa., 475; Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Morse, 20 Wallace, 445; Gray <em>v. </em>Wilson, 4 W., 39.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b470-10\">June 9th, 1884.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AYI\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"AUD\">This judgment is clearly</p>\n<p id=\"AjNY\">right. The agreement contains no submission that can be enforced according to its terms. The right of trial by jury cannot be taken away by any uncertain agreement. A stipulation that either party may fix the time and place of choosing the arbitrators is too uncertain to sustain the action of the party and the prothonotary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
