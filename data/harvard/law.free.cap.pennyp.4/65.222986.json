J., 171; Bergman\u2019s app., 7 Norris, 123; Colburn \u25a0\u00bb. Bancroft, 23 Pickering, \u00a157.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">In the present case, Belford and Bedford, when spoken, may be easily mistaken the one for the other, and when written in the hand of the average penman, the resemblance is close. If J. Belford saw that her lot, with its marked and characteristic description, \u201cfronting twenty-two feet on the south side of Forty-second street, at the corner of Grant street,\u201d was assessed in the name of J. Bedford, she could not but know that she was the person sought to be charged. If she did not see it, her lack of information was not in consequence of the misnomer. A married woman, living with her husband, her name did not appear in the city directory. Successful inquiry in the neighborhood of the property was the only means of procuring personal service of the notices and writs. And so great is the similarity in the names that inquiry prosecuted there for \u201c J. Bedford, owner of the lot on the corner of Forty-second and Grant street,\u201d would as readily lead to the discovery of the true owner as if the .inquiry had been for J. Belford. The defendant\u2019s first point should have been affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-7\">The position that the sale in the name of Unknown Owner carried good title needs no elaboration. There was a contradiction on the city register; the validity of Mrs. Green\u2019s title depended in part upon representations made by Mrs. Belford outside the record that her name was Bedford. It would be unreasonable to impose upon the city the duty of deciding between conflicting titles. To proceed against the lot in the name of either the one or the other of the claimants, would be to expose to sale a questionable title. The act of January 6, 1864, section 21, (P Tk, page-1136,) provides the only safe course, and the city followed it by substituting \u201cUnknown Owner\u201d as defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-8\"><em>John Barton </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>It is argued that the names Belford and Bedford are the same in sound, and when written present the same appearance to the eye; the difference is in the first syllable-one is Bel and the other is Bed; there is as much difference both to the eye and ear as there is between a dinner bell and bedstead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApN\">It was to avoid the very uncertainness as to names and description in entering municipal liens referred to by plaintiffs in error that the registry law of 1871 was passed, requiring, under penalty, that all property-owners should bring in their deeds to the city engineer to register, and all sheriffs, trustees, &amp;c., making judicial sales should cause the deed of conveyances to be registered before delivered to the purchaser ; and the same act gave to those who complied with the law a complete protection, and provides: \u201cWhensoever such descriptions shall have been furnished, and the certificate of the engineer or his assistant shall be received, no property so returned shall be subject to sale for taxes or other municipal claims-thereafter, to accrue as lien of record thereon except in the name of the owner as returned, and after recovery by suit and service of the writ on him, as in case of a summons, <em>scire facias, </em>or other appropriate writ.\u201d And again, in the eighth section of the act, the Legislature, in speaking of the title that shall be acquired bjr the purchaser at sales upon municipal liens, further enacts: \u2018 \u2018But if the said duty of making the returns, as required by the acu, shall have been discharged by the party who shall have acquired title in whatsoever manner before the tax accrued, as a lien of record for which the same shall have been sold, the purchaser at the tax sale shall not acquire the title of such persons who shall have performed said duty, or of his heirs or assigns, unless the same shall have been made in the name of such owner, after service of process upon him, as in case of suit by summons, <em>scire facias, </em>or other appropriate writ.\u201d</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b64-5\">November 10th, 1884.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aee\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"AbZ\">Mrs. Jane Belford performed her duty towards effecting a correct registration of her title t\u00f3 the land in question.
