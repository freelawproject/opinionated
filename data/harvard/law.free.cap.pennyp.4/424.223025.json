Under this reservation, the plaintiff objects to the admission as evidence of the facts set out in paragraphs, from sixteen to twenty-three inclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-11\">\u201cThe objection is pressed on these several grounds. The action sounds in tort, and no set-off is allowable in actions of tort. The set-off is barred by the Statute of Limitations. The defendant has not complied with section 100 of rules of court in regard to notice of set-off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-12\">\u201c The defendant\u2019s answer to these several grounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>objection on the part of the plaintiff is that he has not pleaded set-off, but <em>\u2018non </em>assumpsit,\u2019 which entitles him to give in evidence anything which shows that at the time the action was brought the plaintiff had no right to recover, citing, in support of his answer to the objection, the cases of Kennedy <em>v. </em>Perris, 5 S. <em>&amp; </em>It., 394; Gaw \u00ab. Wolcott, 10 State R., 43. Both of these actions were actions of assumpsit, the pleas <em>non assumpsit. </em>In the first, it was held that- discharge as an insolvent could be given in evidence as an answer to plaintiff\u2019s right to recover ; and in the second, which was an action for work and labor done, evidence of unworkmanlike and insufficient performance, it was held, could be set up to defeat a recovery by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-4\">\u201cThat the matters of defense., if admissible under the pleadings, is barred by the Statute of'Limitations, received no answer at the hands of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">\u201cThe action is grounded on a payment by the legal plaintiff, acting in his capacity as sheriff, to the defendant of a larger sum of money than was due to the defendant, in settlement of his purchase for $4,000, of the property mentioned in the statement of facts, which had been purchased by the defendant under a judgment on a mortgage, ' of which, by assignment, he had become owner. The said payment was in the form of a credit, given to the defendant in said settlement, and for which he receipted to the sheriff, in the sum of $2,110 58, on account of his judgment, and $8 on account of costs, which formed a part \u2019 of the purchase money of $4,000. In the statement of facts, it is admitted that at that time there was due to the defendant no more than the sum of $1,500, the amount of the mortgage, with interest, from the 30th day of May, 1875. The .settlement was completed on the 9th day of March, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AgA\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that the right of the plaintiff is clear to recover back from the defendant, for himself, in his own right, or for the use plaintiff, to recover for himself, on the strength of the legal title of Elliott, the amount which, by mistake or in fraud of the rights of the sheriff, was wrongfully retained by the defendant and receipted for by him. It was not, as defendant argues, a mistake in calculation, but the credit was given on the claim made by the defendant, that the larger sum was due to him, instead of a smaller amount, and that this fact was, or ought to have been, within the knowledge of the defendant, at the time, is fairly to be inferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">\u201cIf it needed authority to support the right of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>plaintiff to recover in this action, the case of McDonald <em>v. </em>Todd, 1 Grant, 17, is in point. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-4\">\u201cThat the defendant\u2019s attorney, in making claim for a credit on account of the $4,000, of $2,110 58, and $8 costs, instead of the sum of $1,500, with interest from 30th of May, <em>\u00cd </em>875, acted in ignorance of the fact that his demand exceeded so largely the amount actually due, is wholly immaterial. That he acted in good faith, no one who knows him will doubt; and this, also, he asserts, under the solemnity of his oath; but his client, the defendant, knew that more interest was claimed on his $1,500 mortgage than he was entitled to claim a credit for, and that in the settlement he gained an advantage, by withholding information from his attorney, which he had no right to take to himself, and this places the case squarely on the ground of fraud, so far as the defendant is concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">\u201cThis conclusion renders inapplicable any defense which may be supposed to grow out of the facts contained in items of the agreement, from 16 to 23 inclusive, and requires that the objection to their admission as evidence in the cause should be sustained; the facts, therefore, on which the case is to be determined, are those embraced in paragraphs from 1 to 15 inclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">\u201cThis conclusion requires us also to sustain the objection to the admission in evidence of the $5,000 mortgage of Joseph R. Planigen and wife to Joseph E. Taylor, and also the assignment of said mortgage by Taylor to George W. Baugh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">\u201cWe think the objection to the admission of the proposed defense, that it is barred by the statute, is also well taken. The settlement with the sheriff was on the 9th of March, 1876, and pleas claiming set-off or defense under the plea of <em>\u2018non </em>assumpsit,\u2019 were not filed until the 5th of April, 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-8\">\u201cAnd now, December 27, 1882, it is ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs, in the sum of $548 50, with interest from the 9th day of March, 1876, making together the sum of $761 33.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-9\">Defendant\u2019s counsel thereupon filed eight exceptions to the finding of the court, which were dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-10\">There was no bill of exceptions taken to the finding of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-11\">Defendant took out a writ of error, and assigned as error the dismissal of the said exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-12\"><em>W P.
