Up to his death, a possibility of issue existed. Death closed that door, as a will speaks from the death of a testator. The surviving brothers, as a class, are to be looked for at that period, because both vesting and distribution are at one and the same time: See act of June 4, 1879, P.

The deed provided that the estate was to be held by Elizabeth Ring-wait during the life of the grantor; after his death, it was to go to his lawful issue, should he leave any; in default of such issue, \u201cthen it is to be equally divided among his surviving brothers or their legal representatives.\u201d The words \u201clegal representatives\u201d were evidently used as the equivalent of heirs, and the grantor must have intended the grant to inure'to the benefit of his brothers living at the time of the grant. This would harmonize with his father\u2019s will, which he probably had in his mind when he executed the deed. The grantor could not have intended that the estate should go to his brothers surviving at his death, or their heirs, for a <em>surviving </em>brother could have no heirs.' There could not be, at the death of the grantor, both surviving brothers and legal representatives of such survivors. The natural reading of the paper, therefore, is that upon the death of the grantor without issue the estate should be divided among his brothers then living, and the heirs or legal representatives of those who were then deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
