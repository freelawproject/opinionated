Lee, Permelia Pesta\u00f1a, Elizabeth Brunges, and William Sickler, administrator of Cora Sickler, deceased, from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of <em>Wyoming </em>County, distributing the funds in the hands of John Lee, administrator of the estate of Daniel Lee, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-7\">\u25a0 The court below appointed B. W. Lewis, auditor to make distribution, who found, <em>inter </em>alia, the following-facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-8\">That Daniel Lee died December 24 1874, leaving to survive him children as follows : John Lee, Wellington Lee, Henry W. Lee, Elizabeth Brunges, wife of William N. Brunges, and Permelia Pesta\u00f1a.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-9\">Minerva Layton, a daughter -of the decedent, died before decedent, leaving to survive her two sons, viz : Daniel Lee Layton and Peter L. Layton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-10\">Nancy Sickler, a daughter of-the decedent, died before decedent, leaving to survive;her two daughters, viz : Dora Sickler, who died some time after Daniel Lee, and Cora Sickler, who died since her gister-\u2019s death. William Sickler is the administrator of Cora Sickler\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-11\">Wellington Lee died since his father\u2019s death, leaving to survive him Martha Lee, his widow ; James D. Lee, Inez Lee, and Florence Vandermark, wife of Edson Vandermark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-12\">Charles Armstrong and James D. Lee are the administrators of Wellington Lee\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-13\">The auditor further finds that John Lee and Wellington Lee received their share- or \u25a0interest, in their father\u2019s estate during his lifetime, and are, therefore, not entitled to share in this distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-14\">He also finds that H.

The same question came up on the former audit, and was, to a certain extent, passed upon.--It was then held that, as no consideration was shown for the assignment, it was not sufficient to cause her to be regarded as a competent witness, on the ground of having no interest in the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>tribution of her father\u2019s estate. As John Lee, the administrator, sought in the former audit to make this use of it, he is now-, in the opinion of the auditor, estopped from claiming for it an opposite purpose in this proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-4\">\u201cMrs. Martha E. Lee claimed the share of Dora Sickler in this distribution, by reason of a direction given by Dora Sickler, a short time before her death, that her share in her grandfather Daniel Lee\u2019s estate, be paid to her for her care during her last sickness. It was shown that Dora Sickler was at the house of Mrs. Martha E. Lee for some time previous to her death, and that she died there ; and also that she was well cared for while there, and that the services were valuable. But, in the opinion of the auditor, however meritorious the claim, the auditor would be exceeding his jurisdiction to make this distribution of Dora Sickler\u2019s estate. He, therefore, awards the amount coming to the heirs of Nancy Sickler to William Sickler, the administrator of Cora Sickler, deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">Exceptions were filed to this report by John Lee, Martha E. Lee, and Inez Lee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-6\">August 17, 1882, Charles Armstrong and James D. Lee, administrators of Wellington Lee, deceased, presented a petition to the orphans\u2019 court praying for an issue to the common pleas to determine whether or not the said Wellington Lee had received his interest in the estate of his father in his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-7\">Objections were filed that no demand for an issue was made before the auditor, and that it was then too late. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\">The Court granted an issue \u201cto determine whether it belongs to Wellington Lee\u2019s estate to have one seventh part of the estate of Daniel Lee, deceased, after paying all legal costs and expenses, and whether Wellington Lee did receive his interest in his father\u2019s estate in his, Daniel Lee\u2019s, lifetime,\u201d to which exceptions were taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">Upon the trial of the issue in the common pleas, before Ingham, P. J., exceptions were taken by appellants to rulings upon evidence, and to the charge of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-10\">November 24, 1882, verdict for plaintiffs, viz: Charles Armstrong and J. D. Lee, administrators of Wellington Lee. The record of the trial was certified back to the orphans\u2019 court and approved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-11\">The orphans\u2019 court set aside so much of the auditor\u2019s report as found that \u201cWellington Lee received his share of his father\u2019s estate during his lifetime, and is, therefore, not entitled to share in the distribution,\u201d and ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>that the administrators of Wellington Lee, deceased, should receive one seventh part of the fund for distribution. The Court also overruled the finding of the auditor against the claim of John Lee, and so much of the report as distributed to William Sickler, administrator of Cora Sickler, deceased, the share of Dora Sickler, and awarded said share to Martha E. Lee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">J. B. Shiffer, assignee, <em>et </em>al., then appealed, and assigned as error the action of the orphans\u2019 court in granting the issue to the common pleas; the admission of certain testimony, and portions of the judge\u2019s charge, in the trial of said issue ; the decree of the court approving the finding of the jury and awarding the administrators of Wellington Lee, deceased, a one-seventh interest in the distribution, and in awarding the share of Dora Sickler, deceased, to Martha E.

The acts of Assembly expressly limit the right of review to the applicant for the issue, and nowhere gives the right to the opposing party: Moth-land <em>v. </em>Wireman, 3 P. &amp; W., 185; Wallace <em>v. </em>Elder, 5 S. <em>&amp; </em>R., 146; Finney <em>v. </em>Moore, 8 S. &amp; R., 345. The cases cited by appellants are those in which a demand was made for an issue as matter of right. Court can grant issue after audit: Daddow Est., 1 Schuylkill Leg. Reg., 90. The orphans\u2019 court should have reserved the finding of the auditor if no issue had been granted.
