The answers of the executors further stated that they \u201cbelieve that the lands should be sold by them as\u2019soon as can be reasonably done, and the money distributed to those entitled but they deem it impracticable to do so now, and as the will leaves it entirely discretionary with the executors when to sell, etc., said respondents beg leave humbly to present their judgment that it would be greatly against the interests oi all concerned to sell the same as the market for real estate now stands, and that the unsold real estate should .not be divided among said grandchildren until said debts, legacies, etc., are fully paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-5\">The answers of the eight grandchildren of Mrs. Roup set forth that, \u201chaving either read or heard read the above answer to petition filed by Henry S. Baum, we answer that we believe the said answer to be true in every particular, and that it would not be for the interest of the parties in interest to have the land divided (if then) until the debts, legacies, bequests, etc., are fully paid, and that we are satisfied that now is not the time to dispose of any of said lands by sale, as there is now no market therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AU\">The answers of the executors further denied the right of the petitioner to have partition of the premises among the parties in interest for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-6\"><em>\u201cFirst. </em>The said grandchildren have not at any time by unanimous consent elected to take the unsold land instead of the proceeds thereof, but, on the contrary, have refused to .consider the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-7\"><em>\u201cSecond. </em>The $10,000 for cemetery-lot purposes have not, as yet, been realized or expended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-8\">\u2018 \u2018 <em>Third. </em>The legacies have not, as yet, been fully paid .and satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-9\"><em>\u201cFourth. </em>The power of sale under the will, as respondents have been- advised and as they believe, is an absolute positive, and, explicit direction to sell and to convert into money, and does not rest in the discretion of the executors nor depend upon contingencies.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The Court, on hearing and argument, entered a decree dismissing the petition in the following opinion by Hawkins, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-4\">\u201cThere are two grounds upon which the prayer for partition in this case must be refused :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-5\">I. It is admitted there is a balance of legacies un-. paid, and that the improvement of the cemetery lot has not been made as directed by the will. The averment of the petitioner that' the executors have sufficient available assets with which to satisfy these amounts having been denied by the answer and being not established,by evidence, it must be presumed that further sales of real estate are necessary for that purpose. If so, there can be no doubt that it is the office of the executors to make such sales. This is conceded. If further sales are necessary for the purpose of the will, the residuary estate has not yet been ascertained, and there can be no partition. This is also conceded ; but it is claimed that this Court has jurisdiction in this proceeding to ascertain the residuary estate by ordering the executors to make sale of sufficient real estate to satisfy the purpose of the will. The answer to this position is twofold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-6\"><em>First. </em>The petitioner prays for partition alone. It is a well-settled principle that the sole purpose of partition is the severance of possession, as between parties having a community of interest in the land sought to be parted. In accordance with this principle, the Courts refuse to entertain questions of boundary and title: McMasters <em>v. </em>Carothers, 1 Fa. St-., 324; Ihmsen <em>v. </em>Ormsby, 32 Id., 202; Hobb <em>v. </em>Longstreth, Dist. Ct., Phila., (cited in Miller on-Partition, 48.) In the latter case, the court refused partition of land devised, because a definite boundary had not been fixed or agreed upon. In McMasters <em>v. </em>Carothers, it is said that \u201cthe Court will not undertake to investigate the validity of the title when it is contested, for the possession alone gives jurisdiction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-7\">The executors have no community of interest with petitioner. They have the exclusive right of possession of so much land as the purposes of the will require them to sell. An order on them to sell would, on the theory of petitioner, look to the ascertainment of the residue as being the subject of partition ; and until that order should have been executed, there could obviously be no such possession, as would support partition. If the sole purpose of partition be severance of possession, the institution of proceedings in partition pre-supposes the ascertainment of the quantity and boundaries of the land sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>parted ; and the fact that that had not been done prevents jurisdiction of this Court attaching.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-4\"><em>Second. </em>But assuming that this court has jurisdiction in a proper case in such proceeding to ascertain the subject of partition, it will not, with this view, control the exercise of a discretionary power of sale given to trustees, unless the interests of the trusts required it: Dundas\u2019 Appeal, 64 Pa. St., 325. The record does not justify interference in this case. It does not appear that the trust has been abused, or that any loss has, or will presently, result from failure to sell. The executors are invested with the largest discretion ; and this Court must presume that they have acted in good faith and sound judgment until the contrary has been shown by clear and positive proof. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\">II. Had testatrix stopped with the first clause of the fourth paragraph of her will, there would not have been sufficient reason to doubt that no more than discretionary power of sale of the residuary estate was intended to be vested in the executors; and that tinder the authority of Chew' <em>v. </em>Nicklin, 45 Pa. St., 84, the petitioner would have been entitled to partition of that estate before actual conversion. The word \u201cdescend\u201d is, <em>prima </em>facie, applicable to real estate, and the expression \u201cauthorize and empower\u201d ordinarily imports no more than a discretion. But the concluding clauses of the paragraph show beyond a reasonable doubt that testatrix attached to them a different meaning ; and in accordance with the cardinal rule of construction in such cases, the ordinary meaning must yield to the manifest intention of testatrix. The intention to convert cut and out is evidenced\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\"><em>First. </em>By the provision making the unanimous consent of the grandchildren a condition preceden t to .their election, \u201cto take the unsold land instead of the proceeds thereof,\u201d in connection with the previous authority to the executors \u201c to convert my (testatrix\u2019s) residuary estate into money; \u201d and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\"><em>Second. </em>By the intention to vest in the executors, control of the residuary estate as manifested in the extent of the powers of sale granted, in the direction that upon written notice to the executors of the unanimous election of the grandchildren \u201cto take the unsold land instead of the proceeds thereof,\u201d the said land \u201c shall be delivered up to them by said executors for partition; \u201d and in the direction that \u2018 \u2018 should either of my said grandchildren desire a lot or piece of land for their own use and occupation, the said executors may convey the same to him or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>her \u2014 after selection made \u2014 at a fair valuation, to be accounted for in the then next distribution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">The necessary implication from these provisions, which express the final and controlling thought of testatrix, is the exclusion of the grandchildren from and the investiture of the executors with the right of possession of testatrix\u2019s residuary estate until conversion by the executors, or the election by the grandchildren \u201c to take the unsold land instead of the proceeds thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">The extraordinary powers of sale vested in the executors, the direction that upon election the unsold land should be \u201cdelivered up\u201d to the grandchildren by the executors \u201cfor partition,\u201d and that the executors should convey lots for \u201cuse and occupation\u201d to such of the grandchildren as should desire them, can be explained or accounted for on no other theory of construction. Why or how \u201cdeliver up\u201d possession for partition, or make conveyance for \u201cuse and occupation,\u201d and charge a \u201c fair valuation,\u201d unless the intention had been to confer on the executors a prior right of possession <em>i</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-8\">These considerations leave no room for doubt that the intention of testatrix was to give her executors complete control of her real estate. The petition for partition must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-9\">From this decree, the petitioner took this appeal, assigning for error, <em>inter </em>alia, the action of the Court in dismissing his petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-10\"><em>Carnahan &amp; Son </em>and <em>W.

St.,-R., 287. The beneficiaries are entitled to the proceeds by the terms of the will as a matter of right. Without a voluntary election by all parties interested, no partition can be <em>had. </em>\u2014 Id. The testatrix, foreseeing that'all might not agree unanimously to elect to take the whole, provided that if one or more of'the beneficiaries might desire a lot or piece of ground instead of money, (and that they might not be deprived of this privilege,) she directed that \u201cshould either of my said grandchildren desire a lot or piece of ground for their own use and occupation, the said executors may convey the same to him or her in fee, after selection made, at a fair valuation to be accounted for at the then next distribution.\u201d Here again we have the recognition by the testatrix, in unmistakable language, that they should not have title to any of the land except for certain purposes and in the mode and manner appointed therefor, but that the title should remain in the executors for sale until, at least, such grandchild should, make a selection of a lot or piece of ground for his own use and occupation, when the executors might, instead of selling and conveying to a general purchaser, convey such selected lot to the selector in fee at a fair valuation to.be accounted for in the then next distribution, which distribution has, and can by a strict construction of the will have, reference only to the proceeds of lands sold or to be sold.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b27-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>November 10th, 1884.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AP\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">No fact is shown to justify the Court in interfering with the large discretionary power given to the executors as to the time of selling the real estate, and the unanimous consent of all the grandchildren to take \u201cthe unsold land instead of the proceeds thereof\u201d had not been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The petition was, \u2022 therefore, properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
