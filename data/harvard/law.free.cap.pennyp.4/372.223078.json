At the time A\u2019s business was in prosperous condition; he was possessed of property other than that so conveyed to the amount of more than $25,000; he was indebted at the same time in the sum of about $5,000. This indebtedness was all paid within a few months. Three years later he failed; his wife sold a portion of the real estate which A had conveyed to her to a judgment creditor of her husband, who, in consideration thereof, assigned to her the judgment he held against A. A\u2019s wife also held another small judgment against him; on this latter judgment she caused execution to be issued, and had sold, as the property of her husband, the remaining real estate which he had conveyed to her. The fund thus produced was claimed before an auditor both by A\u2019s wife on account of the two judgments held by her, and by B, a judgment creditor of A, whose judgment had been obtained subsequently to those held by A\u2019s wife. The auditor found in addition to the above facts that there was no purpose to defraud creditors by the conveyance, and that it was not made in anticipation of future indebtedness. <em>Held, </em>that the fund was properly awarded to the wife of A.</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b368-5\">Before Me roue, C.

Reeves was appointed auditor to make distribution of the fund. He found the following facts .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-8\"><em>First. </em>That Lewis M. Harned and wife, by deed dated October 3, 1876, and recorded October 17, 1876, in deed-book, D. H. L., No. 45, page 510, conveyed to James N. Dickey certain premises on the east side of Sixth street, in the Sixth ward of the city of Philadelphia, and that the said James N. Dickey and wife, by deed dated October 14, 1876, recorded October 17, 1876, in deed-book, D. H. L., No. 45, page 501, conveyed the same premises to Charity Harned, wife of Lewis M. Harned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-9\">Subsequently, on the 13th day of December, 1879, Charity Harned conveyed these same premises to Joshua Peirce, the- deed being recorded in deed-book, L. W., No. 74, page 65. The consideration of this last conveyance was the assignment by Joshua Peirce to Mrs. Charity Harned of the judgment held by him against L. M. Harned and others, and also of whatever stock and machinery Peirce had purchased at the sheriffs sale in Bristol.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-10\"><em>Second. </em>That Lewis M. Harned and wife, by deed dated November 1, 1876, and recorded June 2, 1877, in deed-book, D. H. L., No. 86, page 550, conveyed certain premises, No. 2202 Venango street, to James N. Dickey; and James N. Dickey and wife, by deed dated November 2, 1876, recorded June 2, 1877, in deed-book, D. H. L., No. 86, page 475, conveyed the same premises to Charity Harned, wife of Lewis M. Harned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-11\">It was upon an execution issued upon this last-named property, \u25a0 selling all the right, title, and interest of Lewis M. Harned in said property, that the present fund is realized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-12\"><em>Third. </em>That at the time of these conveyances \u2014 to wit: November 1, 1876 \u2014 Mr. L. M. Harned was doing a prosperous business in the manufacture of upholstery trimmings in this city, and was perfectly solvent then, and so continued for a period of over two years thereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-13\">Subsequently, in 1877, through the advice of parties from whom he made his purchases in trade, he removed his manufacturing to Bristol, Bucks county, Pa., where he continued to manufacture in the same business that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>had formerly conducted in Philadelphia until 1879 when he failed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>At the time of the conveyance, in 1876, it appeared that the total amount of Mr. Harned\u2019s liabilities did not exceed $5,000, exclusively consisting of the then current liabilities of his business ; all of which was paid at maturity, he doing business on sixty and ninety days\u2019 credit, which was considered equivalent to cash. It also appeared that at the time of the conveyances \u2014 to wit: November 1, 1876 \u2014 the machinery in the establishment of L. M. Harned was worth $20,000, on which he did not owe one dollar. It further appeared that, in addition to his machinery, he had stock on hand and bills receivable amounting further to from $7,000 to $10,000 ; so that at the time of the conveyance to his wife he was perfectly solvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-7\"><em>Fifth. </em>It did not appear that the removal of the business to Bristol rendered it hazardous, but, on the contrary, it did appear before your auditor that the facilities for carrying on the business there were greater than they were in Philadelphia, and the expenses less \u2014 notably decrease of rent, water rent, taxqs, etc.; and in fact it was proven before your auditor that the business whilst conducted there was prosperous throughout 1877 and 1878 and the early part of 1879. It also appeared that the business in Bristol was the same identically in every particular as that which he had conducted so 'successfully in Philadelphia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-8\">Your auditor reports that at most the removal to Bristol was nothing more than a mistake of judgment, becoming only apparent in the subsequent'part of the year 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-9\"><em>Sixth. </em>That no debt or liability which was in existence or contracted at the time of the conveyances \u2014 November 1, 1876 \u2014 was in existence at the time of the sheriffs sale, under which this fund was created ; in fact all the liabilities (which, aggregated, did not exceed $5,000 as above stated) were fully paid by Mr. Harned within ninety days after November 1, 1876, being as soon as the same had matured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\"><em>Seventh. </em>Your auditor further finds, as a fact, that, treating the deeds as a voluntary conveyance, there was no evidence produced before him to prove any purpose to defraud creditors by such conveyances by Mr. Harned indirectly to his wife; the fact being that Mr. Harned, at the time of said conveyances to his wife, was possessed of other property in his own name belonging to him, amount<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ing to more than five times the amount of any liability existing at that time or for some considerable length of time afterward. Your auditor further finds that said conveyance was not made in anticipation of future indebtedness, because for a considerable space of time after the conveyances the amount of the current liabilities did not increase to any appreciable extent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-4\">The deeds mentioned in the auditor\u2019s findings were offered in evidence before him on behalf of Littlefield Brothers in an attempt to prove fraud on the part of Harned in executing them ; it was shown that at the time of these conveyances, Harned was indebted to Littlefield Brothers in the sum of $813; this sum was paid within sixty or ninety days thereafter, and a fresh debt incurred, and this mode of dealing was continued until Harned\u2019s failure, when he owed them $833 75.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\">The auditor awarded the entire fund, after deducting the expenses of the audit, to Charity Harned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">Exceptions filed on behalf of Littlefield Brothers were dismissed, and the auditor\u2019s report confirmed; whereupon they took this appeal, assigning for error, <em>inter alia, </em>the award to Charity Harned as owner of the Peirce judgment, the failure to direct payment of the Littlefields\u2019 judgment, the dismissal of their exceptions, and the confirmation of the auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-7\"><em>Charles L. Loelcwood </em>and <em>Joseph A. Sinn </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-8\"><em>First. </em>The fund in court is raised by a sale of the grantor\u2019s right, title, and interest in. the conveyance,-and, therefore, should be distributed on the theory that the conveyance was fraudulent. The inquiry is not whether the gift was valid, but against whom was it invalid. No one, except those creditors who had a right to attack the title, which right has been divested by the sale, can share in the proceeds: Hoffman\u2019s Appeal, 8 Wright, 95 ; Beekman\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright, 385 ; Haymaker\u2019s Appeal, 3 P. F. Smith. 306.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-9\">The ground upon which voluntary settlements are supported is that they are provisions for a wife- or family. They should not be supported when it is evident that the subject of the transfer was to be used for the husband\u2019s benefit, and to keep his creditors at bay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-10\">This case presents a most extraordinary state of facts\u2014 a husband in business and in debt, owning real estate, machinery, and stock in trade \u2014 a wife, without any separate estate, (except that embraced in the small undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>puted judgment,) who first gets the real estate, then gives up part of that and gets the machinery and stock and a creditor\u2019s judgment, and then keeps alive this judgment and uses it against her husband\u2019s creditors. If the transfer to her was valid, she should have relied \u25a0 upon it, and would have had the protection of the law. Having abandoned that position, and declared that though the transfer was not valid, yet she would take, as.a creditor, what she did not get under the transfer, her claim should not prevail against honest creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-5\"><em>Second. </em>She is estopped from claiming the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-6\"><em>Third. </em>When the \"owner was indebted, at the time of the conveyance, but afterward paid off the debt by new purchases on credit, even the new subsequent creditors are subrogated to the rights of existing creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-7\"><em>Fourth. </em>There is ample evidence that appellants were, intended to be defrauded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-8\"><em>Ernest Lowengrv/nd Octavius A.
