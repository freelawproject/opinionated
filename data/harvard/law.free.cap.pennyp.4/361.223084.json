Moore and Henry B. Moore in favor of plaintiffs for $2,370 52, and an attachment execution was issued and served on II. G. Harris and Catharine C. McFillin. In his answers' to the interrogatories, Harris averred that there was no balance in-his hands in favor of defendants; that he was not at the service of the writ, nor had he been since indebted to the defendants ; that he knew of no claim of defendants on him for money or property, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>that there was no debt or demand in suit between him and the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">In answer to an interrogatory as to whether he had in his hands any property in which the defendants were interested, he replied as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">\u2018\u2018I had in my hands when said writ was served a mortgage of $1,500, in which said defendants were interested. The said mortgage was held by me as collateral security for a guarantee I had made of the said amount of $1,500 to a creditor of said defendants, and for any sums that might be due me by said defendants. The mortgage was upon a property of said defendants. The said debt so guaranteed is disputed by said defendants, but the creditor claims to hold me responsible on my guaranty. Should the creditor\u2019s claim be successfully disputed by said defendants, and I relieved from liability, the defendants would be interested in the distribution of the proceeds of the mortgage to see them properly applied.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">On April 6, 1879, the plaintiffs ruled the garnishee to plead.

Therefore, as to this question of liability for costs, he must stand or fall by his answers and his plea of <em>nulla bona: </em>Walker\u00ae.

He proceeds to state a contingency in -which they might be interested in the distribution of the product of a mortgage, on their property, which he held as collateral security. This answer not being satisfactory to the defendants in error, he put in the plea of <em>nulla </em>bona, and on the trial a verdict was rendered against him for $5 53 found to be in his hands, for which sum, with costs, judgment was entered against him. His complaint now is, that he is not liable for costs. It is true, on the trial, he did present a statement showing $5 53 to be in his hands. That, however, was too late\u2019 to relieve him from costs. Having denied all indebtedness and all claims for property, both in his answers and by his plea, and the jury having found against him, he became liable for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AJx\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
