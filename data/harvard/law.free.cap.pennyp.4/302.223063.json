And the said George Sickman doth further agree as aforesaid, that the said Sarah shall have and keep all her wearing apparel of which she is now possessed, and also all the personal property, beds, and household furniture which she brought to him at the time of her marriage, or which has been since purchased with her money, and also that she shall have one hog of those now in the pen, part of the potatoes and cabbage now in the ground, and further, that the said Sarah shall keep the children born of the said marriage, and bring them up and maintain and educate them as she may think right and proper. And the said George Sickman doth further covenant, grant, and agree, as aforesaid, that he, the said George Sickman, his heirs, executors, and administrators shall and will, from time to time, and at all times hereafter well and sufficiently save, defend, and keep harmless as well the said Jacob Ackerman, his executors, and administrators, and Sarah, the wife of the said George, as all and every the wearing apparel, moneys, bonds, obligations, notes, goods, chattels, furniture, household stuff, beds, bedding, and other effects and personal estate of what nature or kind soever, and the lands, tenements, and hereditaments which either in virtue of the present articles are given and made over to and for the use of the said Sarah, or which she shall at any time hereafter get, -acquire, obtain, or in a.ny manner or by any right be seized or possessed of as aforesaid, or which she or any other person in her right or to her use may or can hereafter claim, challenge, or demand, and of atrd from all debts, dues, obligations, contracts, and engagements of what nature soever heretofore contracted by the said George Sickman, or which, at any time hereafter, he may contract, except the one half of the debts contracted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>by the said George, prior to the ninth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-one, which the said Sarah is to pay, and of and from all and all manner of action or actions, suits, arrests, attachments, distresses, processes, judgments, seizures, recognizances, liens, and executions had done, suffered, sued forth, recovered or obtained, or hereafter to be had, done, suffered, sued forth, recovered, and obtained by reason of the debts, dues, contracts, and engagements or any of them of the said George Sickman contracted or to be contracted as aforesaid, or by any default of him, the said George Sickman, or by his acts, means, consent, or procurement, (except as before excepted,) and that he, the said George Sickman, will not, on the decease of the said Sarah, claim or take administration of her goods and chattels, rights, or credits, or in any manner disturb or prevent her disposition thereof, or in case of her intestacy prevent or disturb the transmission and succession thereof to her personal representatives. And the said Jacob Ackerman, for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, in consideration of the premises, doth covenant, promise, grant, and agree to and with the said George Sickman, his executors, administrators, and assigns, by these presents upon the delivery, by the said George, of the wearing apparel, household furniture, and personal estate aforesaid, \u00e1nd the possession of the equal undivided half part of the plantation or real estate aforesaid into the hands of the said Jacob, to and for the sole and separate use of the said Sarah, the wife of the said George as aforesaid, the said Sarah shall and will pay and satisfy the one half of the debts contracted by the said George prior to the ninth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-one, and that she, the said Sarah, shall not and will not, at any time hereafter, claim from the said George Sickman any alimony or any allowance in the nature of alimony ; and that the said Sarah will not any time during her natural life claim or demand from the said George any further or other provision in money or otherwise for her maintenance and support in health or in sickness, nor at the death of the said George challenge, claim, or demand any dower or thirds in or out of his estate, real or personal, of which he shall die .seized or possessed. And further, the said Jacob Ackerman covenants, promises, and agrees as aforesaid, that he will, well and truly, from time to time and at all times hereafter, indemnify and save harmless the said George Sickman, his heirs, executors, and administrators of, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>from all debts, dues, obligations, and engagements which the said Sarah shall or may hereafter contract during the separation aforesaid, and of and from all costs, charges, and expenses whatsoever for or by reason of the maintenance and support of the said Sarah during the said separation in health and sickness, and of and from all suits, actions, and demands, and all prosecutions, claims, and controversies as well by and at the instance of the said Sarah, as by all and every other person or persons whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim for any charge or expense for the maintenance and support of the said Sarah daring the said separation, or for or by reason of any quarrels, disputes, injuries, or complaints which have heretofore been done, had, or arisen between the said George Sickman and Sarah, his wife, to the day of the date of these presents, and of and from all claim and demand of dower or thirds by his said wife ,out of his estate, real or personal, of which he may or shall die seized or possessed for or by reason of the coverture aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">After this date, the said George and Sarah lived separate and apart from each other, and on the 26th day of May, A. I). 1824, the said Sarah, the said George being-still living, married Jacob Osterstoek, by whom she had three children, viz : the defendants and one other. George Sickman died about the year 1870 ; Sarah, his wife, died April 16, 1882 ; and the said Jacob Osterstoek died July 12, 1872, George Sickman died in the poor-house, of which he had been an inmate some four or five years prior to his death. Sarah Sickman, <em>alias </em>Osterstoek, left a will, a copy of which is made part hereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">[In this will, the testatrix directs her executor to sell the land derived from George Sickman, and after paying debts and certain legacies, to divide the remaining proceeds equally among her children, the progency of Sick-man and Osterstoek.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-7\">' At the time the present writ was served upon them, the defendants were, and still are, in possession of the land in controversy, claiming the same as devisees of the said Sarah Sickman, <em>alias </em>Osterstoek, who, they contend, took said- land in fee, under the articles of separation aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-8\">George Sickman convej\u2019ed the half of the farm, retained by him under the articles of separation, to John Sigman by deed dated December 4, 1824. and recorded in deed book A, vol. 5, p. 279, which deed was received in evidence. Sarah Sickman, <em>alias </em>Osterstoek, also gave a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>deed jointly with the said Jacob Osterstock and the said Jacob Ackerman, for some seven acres of the other half of said farm mentioned in said articles, to Sarah Osterstock, which deed was also given in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-6\"><em>Second. </em>\u2019Upon the foregoing facts, we reach the conclusion that Sarah Sickman took but an estate for life in the one half of the farm set aside for her use in the articles of separation. Not only are there no words of limitation over to her heirs, but the language of the articles is such as to leave no room for an implication that the creation of a fee was intended. The purpose of the conveyance to her is expressly declared to be \u201cthat the said Sarah shall at all times hereafter have a suitable provision and maintenance,\u201d in consideration of which it. is declared \u201c that the said Sarah shall from henceforth have,hold,occupy,possess, andenjoy\u201d the premises. Then follows the conveyance to the trustees, \u201cin trust for the sole and separate use of the said Sarah \u201d without more. True, the conveyance of the legal title is to \u201c Jacob Ackerman, his heirs, and assigns\u201d in trust, etc., but this signifies nothing, for it matters not what may be the nominal duration of an estate given to a trustee, it continues in equity no longer than the thing sought to be secured by the trust demands: Koenig\u2019s Appeal, 7 P. F. S., 355. See also Perry on Trusts, \u00a7 312, cases there cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-7\">At the trial, the learned counsel for the defendants argued with much earnestness that an absolute power of disposition over the land in controversy was given to Sarah Sickman, and that this enlarged her estate into a fee. We think, however, that the whole of this part of the very ingenious and able argument of the learned counsel of the defendants is based upon a misreading of the articles of separation. The power to sell created by the articles does not, as we think, refer to the land in controversy at all. George Sickman, having released all his right, title, and interest in and to any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, of which his wife was then, or might thereafter be, seized or possessed, and in and to all her personal property of every kind whatsoever, \u201cwhich by these articles are made over or secured to her,\u201d or which at any time thereafter she might acquire, grants to her the absolute power to dispose of \u201cthe same.\u201d This is the power referred to -by the learned counsel for the defendants upon which he bases his argument. But manifestly the words \u201c the same\u201d as here used, refer, so far as the real estate is concerned, to such lands, tenements, and hereditaments only as Mrs. Sickman was seized or pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>sessed of at the time the articles of separation were signed, or such as' she might acquire afterwards. The land in controversy belonged to neither category. Whatever title she acquired in these she acquired by and under the articles. It will not do to say that such a construction savors too much of refinement. The distinction is palpable, and was recognized by the parties; for, in dealifig with the personal property, as has been seen, the articles of separation include in express terms property \u201cwhich by these articles are made over or secured to the said Sarah.\u201d That both George and Sarah Sickman seemed to regard the latter\u2019s title as absolute after their separation, is a circumstance which we do not feel at liberty to take into consideration, and without further elaboration we record our decision in favor of the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-4\">Exceptions were filed by the defendants, which, on hearing, were dismissed by the Court, and judgment entered for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">The defendants thereupon took this writ, assigning for error, <em>inter </em>alia, the action of the court in holding that Sarah Sickman took but an estate for life.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-6\"><em>F.

It was the only land that she could be empowered to sell or devise by this instrument. She had in fact no land at the time of signing of this instrument other than the half of the farm given to her by it, and if she had had other land, he could not empower her either to sell, convey, or to devise any lands she might have possessed before the signing in this way, because it was not included in the conveyance to the trustee therein named ; the only way he could empower her to devise or sell land without hindrance from him was, as he did, by assigning the same to a trustee, and at the same time empowering her either to devise as she saw fit, and at the same time sell or convey the same as though she were a <em>femme sole.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-9\">The married woman\u2019s act of 1848 had not yet then been passed. Had he conveyed the property in question to Jacob Ackerman, the trustee in fee to the use of his wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Sarah and her heirs, the statute of uses would have executed the use, and would have passed to the wife the entire estate in fee simple. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-4\">This would have clearly defeated the very purpose over and over again expressed in the instrument, for had the entire estate thus vested in the wife, she could not have made any conveyance of the fee or lesser estate without the joinder of her husband, nor could she have made any devise thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-5\">Is this, therefore, an estate in the wife for life only ? It is certainly more. It was the intention of the grantor either to give a fee, or, what would be still better, a full enjoyment of the land with power to dispose of the same without any restraint or condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-6\">Had he intended to give her simply a life estate without anything more, it would have been easy to say so. In few and simple words it would have been stated to be for life, with remainder to his own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-7\">But it will be noticed that he omits the words for life, and gives her an' estate in the land freed and discharged from any person whatever claiming any right or title of, to, or in the same.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-8\"><em>Edward J.

Before the delivery of the deed she certainly had no estate in the land beyond a right of dower, and, therefore, the words \u201cof which she is now seized or possessed\u201d could not relate to this land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-5\"><em>Mo instante </em>the deed was delivered, she was possessed of whatever estate o.r interest in the land that the deed conveyed to her.

If the grantor desired to refer to this land, and to covenants to make no claim hereafter to it, the words \u201ceither by this deed or otherwise\u201d or words of like import, have been inserted after the word \u201cpossessed\u201d in the second line from the bottom of page 2 of appendix. It is manifest that the grantor did not refer to the land conveyed by this deed, because, in the next clause of the same sentence, where he speaks of the personal property and covenants \u2018 \u2018 that he will not claim or demand any title or interest therein,\u201d he speaks of it \u201cwhich by these present articles are made over or secured to the said Sarah for her use, or which at any time hereafter she shall yet acquire,\u201d <em>&amp;c.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-6\">Where the grantor reaches that part of the deed in which he conveys this land, he recites that \u201cin consideration also, that the said Sarah shall at all times hereafter have a suitable provision and maintenance,\u201d \u201che doth covenant, &amp;c.,\u201d \u201cthat the said Sarah shall from henceforth have, hold, occupy, possess, and enjoy the one equal undivided half part,\u201d &amp;c. The <em>habendum et tenendum </em>is to Jacob Ackerman, his heirs, and assigns \u201cin trust, nevertheless, to and for the sole and separate use of the said Sarah, the wife of the said George Sickman, as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-7\">It is plain from the whole instrument that it was to provide for the maintenance and support of the wife during her life. The estate was in the trustee during Sarah\u2019s life, and at her death it reverted to the grantor and his heirs by operation of law.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b308-8\">March 24th, 1884.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ARP\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"A1c\">A careful examina_ tion of the deed executed by George Sickman convinces us that it gave to his wife a life estate only in the land in question. The personal property thereby transferred to her is given absolutely, and he agrees that she may,without any hindrance from him, use and dispose of any property she then owns or may thereafter acquire, as if she was a <em>femme sole. </em>As to the land of which he gives her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the use, he not only omits words of inheritance, but carefully avoids using any language evincing an intention to vest a fee in her. The main purpose of the agreement was to furnish her during life a separate support and maintenance as his wife-. No divorce was provided for. It is evident that none was intended. As we affirm this judgment on the language of the deed, it is not necessary to decide whether the fact that she afterwards was guilty of bigamy, and for many years persisted in living in adultery, would not have worked a forfeiture of all her rights in the land. It is very clear that an agreement by which husband and wife shall live separately, and he provides for her support, does not contemplate that she shall give birth to a brood of illegitimate children to deprive his lawful children of their just inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">There is no error in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
