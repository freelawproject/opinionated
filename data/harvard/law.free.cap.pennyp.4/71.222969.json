Said lease, however, of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago railroad, referred to in the fourth paragraph of said bill, includes, in addition to the railroad and property therein named, all rights, privileges, and franchises therein named, relating to the said demised railway, or to the construction, maintenance, use, and operation of the same.

Nor is it now attempting to condemn and take from the plaintiff, or any other party, an additional right of way. The fact is, that the defendant company, under competent authority, is simply straightening, widening, enlarging, and otherwise improving the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago railway, pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of defendant company duly passed, wherein is expressed the <em>bona fide </em>opinion *of the board of directors of defendant company that such improvement of said line is necessary for better securing the safety of persons arid property, and increasing the facilities and capacity for the transportation of traffic thereover. And defendant further shows that the necessities of a constantly increasing business over said-railway renders absolutely essential the making of said improvements in the interest of the public, and that in the absence thereof said defendant company cannot answer the purposes of its creation, and fulfill the obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tions by law imposed upon both it and the said Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company. And defendant company further shows that it is under obligations to make said improvements by reason of the terms of the said lease, hereinbefore referred to, wherein and whereby it is <em>(inter alia) </em>provided that said defendant company, at the expiration thereof, shall deliver up and surrender to the said Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company the said demised railway and premises in at least as good order and condition as the same were when delivered under said lease, and with such conditions, betterments, and improvements as shall have been made thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-4\"><em>Fourth. </em>The averments of the eighth paragraph of said bill defendant company denies, and avers that both as lessee of the said Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago railway, and under its own act of incorporation, id has the right to exercise the power of eminent domain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">The Court referred the case to N. S. Williams, as master, who found, <em>inter </em>alia, the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">That the defendant company, in pursuance to a resolution passed by its board of directors, dated November 30, 1881, are now engaged in carrying out certain improvements on the line of the Pittsburgh. Fort Wayne and Chicago railroad between Allegheny City and Dixmont station; said improvements consist, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cin the enlarging of all present outer depot yards and shop facilities, the construction of two additional tracks from the present outer depot to Dixmont, the providing of local station facilities at nearly all the local stations, additional side-tracks, and the re-location of nearly all the station-houses for the better safety of the passengers in operating the four-track system of road,\u201d and to provide facilities to accommodate the increased traffic of the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">The taking of plaintiff\u2019s property is in connection with this improvement. The strip between the present roadbed and the river is to be used in straightening the line of the road and for additional tracks; the triangular piece, on the hillside of the road, is to be used in connection with what is left after the line is straightened for a station-house at that place, so that with the old right of way, and when the present appropriation from plaintiff is completed, the defendant company at that point will have four main tracks, station-house and grounds, a side-track for local accommodation, a tram-way for approach on side-tracks, station platforms, and an approach to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>station from the west side across the creek. That these improvements are necessary in order to accommodate the increased traffic of the road, and that this appropriation is necessary and essential to the carrying out of these improvements. That at the time of the lease above referred to the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago railroad was a double-track road between Allegheny City and Dixmont, and that when this appropriation is completed it will be a four-track road between these points. That so far as plaintiff is concerned it will virtually amount to the construction of a new road ; the original right of way of said road being sixty-six feet in width, and when this appropriation is made it will be one hundred and twenty-one feet- in width on the eastern boundary of plaintiff\u2019s land, and on the western boundary about one hundred feet at grade. That the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago railroad connects at Pittsburgh with the Pennsylvania railroad. That so far as the terms of the lease made by the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, dated June 7, 1869, to take effect July 1, 1869, are concerned, they are sufficiently ample to cover this contemplated improvement, since it is therein provided, <em>inter </em>alia, \u201cincluding also all locomotives, &amp;c., and all rolling-stock and equipment belonging to the said party of the first part, and all rights, privileges, and franchises connected with or relating to said demised railways or either thereof, or to the construction, maintenance, use, or operation of the same: <em>Prometed </em>always, <em>Jiowever, </em>That nothing herein contained shall operate to grant or demise, orbe construed to include the franchises to be a corporation,\u201d &amp;c. Article fifth of said lease being as follows: \u201c The party of the second part shall and will, at its own proper cost and expense, and without deduction from the rent aforesaid, operate and run the said demised railways, at all times during the said term, in the same manner as the party of the first part, as the owner thereof or otherwise, is now, or shall, or may at any time hereafter be required by law to do, and the said party of the second part shall and will, at its own proper cost and expense, and without deduction from the rent aforesaid, at all times during the said term, maintain, preserve, and keep the railways and premises hereby demised and every part of the same in thorough repair and working order and condition, and supplied with rolling-stock and equipment, so that the business of said demised railways shall be preserved, encouraged, and developed; and that the same shall be ai <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>all times done with safety and expedition, and the public be accommodated in respect thereto with all practicable conveniences and facilities, and that all future growth of such business, as the same may arise or be reasonably anticipated, shall be fully provided for and secured. \u25a0 And the party of the second part hereby promises and agrees to and with the party of the first part that the said party of the second part shall and will, at its own proper cost and expense, and without deduction from the rent aforesaid, from time to time whenever needed during the term aforesaid, do or cause to be done, to and upon the said demised railways and premises, any and all repairs, replacements, and renewals, and, also, in manner expressed in the sixteenth article of these presents, any and all additions, constructions, and improvements, which may be reasonably required for the purposes aforesaid, and provide thereon such rolling-stock and equipment, and other facilities, as shall or may be reasonably required for the purposes aforesaid. And that the said party of the second part shall and will use all reasonable efforts to maintain, develop, and increase all the business of the said railways.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-4\">Article sixteenth of said lease provides, <em>inter </em>alia, that \u201cthe party of the first part hereby agrees that for the purpose of enabling the party of the second part to meet the obligations of the party of the first part to the public, by making, from time to time, such improvements upon and additions to the said Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago railway, in the extension of facilities for increased business, by additional tracks and depots, shops and equipments, and the substitution of stone or iron bridges for wooden bridges, or steel rails for iron rails, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">Article twentieth of said lease provides, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c that the said party of the second part-hereby covenants, promises, and agrees to and with the said party of the first part, that at the end of the term, or other sooner determination of this lease, the said party of the second part shall re-deliver and surrender up to the said party of the first part, its successors and assigns the said demised railways and premises, in at least as good order and condition as the same shall be delivered to the said party of the second part under this lease, and with such additions, betterments, and improvements as shall have been made thereto, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">The master also found that the Pennsylvania Company had express authority to take an assignment of the lease, section third of its charter providing, <em>inter alia, </em>as fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>lows: \u201cTo assume, to become responsible for, execute, and carry out any contracts, leases, or sub-leases, made by any company to or with, any other company or companies, individuals, or firms whatsoever.\u201d The defendant company may, therefore, be considered as lessee, and it does not become necessary to consider the assignment itself; sufficient to say that it bears date June 29, 1884, and provides, <em>inter </em>alia, 'that the defendant company is to operate or run the said railway in the same manner as the said Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago railway, as the owner thereof, or otherwise, is or shall or may at any time hereafter be required to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-4\">The master reported, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows : \u2018\u00a3 The sole question raised by the bill, answer, and evidence in this case is whether the defendant company, either (1) as assignee of the lease made by the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company, or (2) by virtue of its own act of incorporation, possesses the power of eminent domain? The plaintiff here contends that the defendant company does not, either as assignee or in its own right, possess the right to exercise the power of eminent domain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">\u201c That the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company would have had authority to make this appropriation had it not executed the lease hereinbefore mentioned, cannot be denied, since the act of March 17, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">\u201cThat the power of eminent domain passes to the lessee, is said to have been decided in the case of Sly <em>v. </em>the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 15 P. F. Smith, page 209, wherein it is said: \u00a3 By virtue of a simple lease, therefore, an artificial as well as a natural person would succeed to all the rights, liberties, and franchises, and subject to all the limitations imposed on the lessor. The lessee is the assignee, for a term or period, of the lessor, his. bailiff to hold possession for him : Co. Litt., page 239 b, Note 2. It is so as to natural persons, why not as to corporations, unless the law has made a difference when it authorized the lease? The lessee of a railroad corporation must necessarily be bound by all the prohibitions and limitations contained in the charter of the lessor, and, on the other hand, must be entitled to all the rights and. franchises. The Legislature, by authorizing another corporation to take such lease, have, by necessary implica^ tion, conferred them.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\">\u201cIn this case, the question was mainly the right of the lessee to charge higher rates for the conveyance of passen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>gers than the charter of the lessee authorized it to do, and the Court held that this was to be determined by the charter of the lessor, and, as there was no restriction in the lessor\u2019s charter, the Court held that the restriction in the lessee\u2019s charter did not apply. Under the acts of Assembly above cited, authorizing companies owning connecting railroads to enter into contracts or leases in respect to the use, management,'or operation of any such railroad, it would clearly seem sufficient to give the lessee power to fix a tariff of rates where there was nothing in the lessor\u2019s charter to the contrary. While the words used by the Court are very broad and comprehensive, the master is of the opinion that they were used in regard to the case under consideration, and, in effect, simply mean that such rights or franchises as the lessor is expressly, or by necessary implication, authorized to transfer, pass to the lessee; that, under the authorities above cited, and under the following, to wit: Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, page 396, and 21 Pennsylvania State Reports, page 22, nothing short of express authority, or authority by implication', will authorize a delegation of the right of eminent domain. In the case of the Pennsylvania Railroad <em>v. </em>Canal Commissioners, 21 Pennsylvania State, page 22, Black, C. J., in delivering the opinion of the Court, says, <em>inter alia: </em>\u00a3It may be that the privilege which the relators claim might arise by implication out of their charter or some other of the acts cited by their counsel, if we were at liberty to give to them the broad construction which we sometimes apply to other laws of a different character. But corporate powers can never be created by implication or extended by construction. No privilege is granted unless it is expressed in plain and unequivocal words, testifying the intention of the Legislature in a manner too plain to be misunderstood. When a State means to clothe a corporate body with a portion of her own sovereignty, and to disarm herself to that extent of the powers which belong to her, it is so easy to say so that we will never believe it to be meant where it is not said. And words of equivocal import are so easily inserted by mistake or fraud, that every consideration of justice and policy requires that they should be treated as nugatory when they do find their ways into the enactments of the Legislature. In the construction of a statute, to be in doubt is to be resolved, and every resolution which springs from doubt is against the corporation. This is the rule sustained by all the courts in this country and in England ; no other has ever received the sanction of any authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>to which, we owe much deference. The privileges of the Pennsylvania railroad may be too rigidly restricted. If the usefulness of the company would be increased by extending them, let the Legislature see to it, but let it be remembered that nothing but plain English words will do it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-6\">\u201cIf this strict rule of construction is applicable to the powers of corporations under their charters, certainly a broader one cannot be held in the delegation by a corporation of its corporate rights and franchises in the absence of clear legislative authority. If it be true that a corporation authorized \u2018to run, use, and operate,\u2019 and \u2018 to enter into leases in respect to the use, management, and working,\u2019 cannot lease its franchises to complete the road, as decided in 32 P. F. Smith, page 113, how can improvements and betterments bearing nearly the same relation to an old road tha t a partly constructed one does to a finished one, at least in this case, which contemplates changing the number of tracks from two to four, and changing the width of the road-bed from sixty-six feet to over one hundred? That the absence of this power would undoubtedly operate as a hardship in many cases cannot be denied, and might even prevent the lessee of a railroad from discharging its duties to the public ; as such a construction might prevent a leased road from adopting the constantly increasing new and useful inventions applicable to railroads, <em>e. g., </em>in the matter of signals, switches, etc., and from accommodating itself to increasing traffic, and in many ways cripple its usefulness ; bu t this would seem to be within the exclusive province of the Legislature to remedy. If it be true, as contended by defendant company, that, under the acts of Assembly above referred to, a lessee has the power to exercise the right of eminent doiriain, then any corporation, no matter what the purposes of its creation are, provided it be authorized to contract with the other corporations, could fake an assignment of such lease, and then exercise the high prerogative right of eminent domain. Had the Legislature intended that so extraordinary a power should be so handed about, they would certainly have said so in language too plain to be misunderstood. For the reasons above given, therefore, the master is of the opinion that the right to exercise the power of eminent domain does not pass to the lessee in the absence of clear statutory provision expressly authorizing it, and that the defendant company have no right to exercise this power as assignees of the lease above mentioned. The master, however, is of the opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the defendant company, under its own charter of incorporation, have the right to exercise the power of eminent domain, and that this right is clearly given it under tli\u00f3 rule of construction as laid down by Judge Black, above referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-4\">\u201cUnder section first of \u2018An act to incorporate the Pennsylvania Company,\u2019 approved the 7th day of April, 1870, it is provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that the said company \u2018may purchase, receive, hold, and enjoy to them, their successors and assigns, all such lands, tenements, leasehold estates, and hereditaments, goods and chattels, securities and estates, real, personal, and mixed, of what kind and quality soever as may be necessary to erect depots, engine-houses, tracks, shops, and other purposes of the said corporation, as hereinafter defined by tire second section of this act '* * * * <em>* </em>* and generally may do all and singular the matters and things which to them shall appertain to do for the well-being of the said corporation and the management and ordering of \u25a0the affairs and business of the same.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">\u201c Section second of said charter provides that the corporation hereby created shall have power to contract with any person or persons, firms, corporations, or any other party, however formed, existing, or that may hereafter exist, in any way that said parties, or any of them, shall have authority to do, to build, construct, maintain, or manage any work or works, public or private, which may tend or be designed to improve, increase, facilitate, or develop trade, travel, or the conveyance and transportation of freight, live stock, passengers, and any other travel by land or water, from or to any part of the United States or the territories thereof.

The act, therefore, does not give the appellee the power sought to be exercised in this case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-12\"><em>Hamspton &amp; Dalzell </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-13\">By act of 17th March, 1869, P. L., 12, there was added to the franchises of the Pittsburgh, Port Wayne and Chicago Railroad Co., power \u201c to straighten, widen, deepen, enlarge, and otherwise improve its line of railroad and bridges, &amp;c., and to make new feeders.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-14\">By virtue of act of 29th March, 1859, P. L., 290, said company had power to lease, and the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. had power to become lessee: Act 23d April, 1861, P. L., 410. One of the rights, privileges, and franchises thus leased to appellee was that of widening, straightening, and improving the road. The right of eminent do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>main passes by the lease because the power to transfer corporate property is inherent at common law ; because every corporate franchise is the subject of sale and transfer except only that of being a corporation ; because the authority to lease, without passing such power, is inconsistent with the idea that a railroad is a public highway ; and because, when the Legislature authorized the leasing it, by necessary implication, conferred on the lessee all the necessary powers of lessor for the maintenance, use, and occupation of the leased property : Penna. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Sly, 15 P. F. Sm., 209.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-6\">Aside from this question, however, the Pennsylvania company has the power under its own charter for two reasons: First, because it is a railroad company, and therefore within the purview of the act of 17th March, 1869 ; second, because its charter expressly confers such power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-7\">The State may even confer the power of eminent domain on an individual: Pierce on Railroads, 144, 146; Ash \u00bb.

In other words, that the latter company is clothed with the power of eminent domain, and that, if this particular taking had been, in the name of that company, there would have been no room for criticism. That the said company has the right of eminent domain, is not a disputed point in the case, nor could it well be. In view of this, it is difficult to see what great injury the appellant has sustained to justify him in invoking the extraordinary powers of a court of equity. Injunctions will not be granted to redress imaginary grievances. It is only where there is a great and irreparable injury being done or threatened that a chancellor will restrain.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">We need not discuss the question whether the right of eminent domain, which the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company admittedly possesses, passed by its charter to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company* and to its assignees, the Pennsylvania Company, for the reason that the right of eminent domain is in terms conferred upon the latter company by its charter. Under the first section of an act entitled \u201cAn act to incorporate the Pennsylvania Company,\u201d approved April 7, 1870, P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>L., 1025, it is provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that said company \u201cmay purchase, receive, hold, and enjoy to them, their successors and assigns, all such lands, tenements, leasehold estates, and hereditaments, goods and chattels soever as may be necessary to erect depots, enginediouses, tracks, shops, and other purposes of the said corporation, as hereinafter defined by the second section of this act * * <em>* </em>and generally may do all and singular the matters and things which to them shall appertain to do for the well-being of the said corporation and the management and ordering of the affairs and business of the' same.\u201d And by the fourth section of the same act it is further provided that \u201c the said company, hereby created, shall also Have power to enter and occupy the lands of individuals or of companies (on making payment therefor or giving security according to law) for the purpose of erecting, constructing, maintaining, or managing any public work, such as is provided for in the second section of this act, and to construct and erect such works thereon as also buildings, improvements, structures, roads, or fixtures, as may be necessary or convenient for the purpose of said company under the power herein granted, and to purchase, make, use, and maintain any works or improvements connected with the works of the said company, and to merge or consolidate or unite with the said company the improvements, property, and franchise of any other company or companies upon such terms,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In view of this clear grant of power by the Legislature, any further discussion of the case is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
