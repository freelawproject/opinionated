Said hearing and examination to be completed and award rendered on or before May 1, 1882. And it is further agreed that William Mitchell be and hereby is authorized to settle all accounts and claims of said firm, except as above mentioned, and to sell, transfer, and assign any notes, accounts, or judgments of said late firm, and to pay the money arising therefrom in liquidation of any proper indebtedness of said firm, and for that jeurpose said Mitchell to have possession of the firm books and papers, reserving the right to said John B.

The said Mitchell not to charge or be allowed any compensation for his individual services in making said settlement, but to be authorized and empowered to pay for any necessary legal services he may require. Witness our hands and seals the day and year aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-4\">(Signed) John B. Newman, [l. s.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\">William Mitchell, [l. s.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">The arbitrators heard the evidence of both parties, and then held several meetings for consultation upon an award. At one of these meetings, held on April 29,1882, Bull, who had been appointed in the interest of Newman, offered to sign an award in favor of the plaintiff for $1,800, if the other two arbitrators would sign also. This proposition Yan Etten, who had been selected on Mitchell\u2019s part, refused. Biddis then proposed to sign an award with Yan Etten for plaintiff in the sum of $1,500. This also was rejected by Yan Etten. Biddis then stated that unless Yan Etten would sign one of these awards, the award would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>$2,100. Mitchell then, through Van Etten, requested further time for examination, but this was refused on the ground that the submission fixed the 1st of May as the time for the award. Mr. Bull consulted Mr. Newman in regard to his willingness for a continuance ; and Mr. Bull reported that Mr. Newman would agree thereto, provided each party should give to the other a bond with surety not to do any act or bring any suit at law, or otherwise, in any manner; prevent an award or finding of the arbitrators or referees during any extension of time as asked and as might be agreed upon \u2014 and further that the award would be accepted without exception or appeal when rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-4\">The arbitrators then adjourned until May 1, 1882, in order to learn the conclusion of the parties. Mitchell refused to give the bond, and during the morning of that day, before the meeting, served upon Van Etten a notice of revocation of the submission setting forth:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-5\">\n<em>\u201c Messrs. Q. W Bull, J. D. Biddis, andJ. H. Van Etten, arbitrators:</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">Please take notice that I hereby withdraw from the submission made in above case, and hereby give notice before the signing of the award that I decline to abide by said reference or be bound thereby.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\">Prior to the meeting at 2, p. ii., Bull had sketched in pencil a form of award, but had not inserted any amount. At the meeting Van Etten stated that Mitchell had served a notice on him of a revocation, and had requested him to hand a copy to each of the other arbitrators. This he did, and then withdrew. Biddis then copied upon the submission the form of award sketched by Bull, inserting the amount $2,100, and entered it of record. It appeared that Mitchell had knowledge before the final meeting that the award would be against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-9\">Exceptions to the award filed by Mitchell were dismissed by the Court, and a rule to strike off the judgment and set aside the award discharged in the following opinion by McCollom, P. J.;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-10\">[After disposing of some minor exceptions not after-wards pressed.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-11\">\u201cThis view leaves for consideration these questions: Was the submission revocable ? and if so, was it revoked by proper instrument, and in time?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-12\">As a part of the agreement of submission, Mitchell was to have possession of the books of the dissolved partnership, and to settle its affairs. He was by said agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>made the liquidating partner upon the terms therein stated. The agreement was entire. It possessed the elements of a contract upon sufficient consideration, and after its execution it was not in the power of either to revoke or cancel it without the assent of the other: Mc-Geehen <em>v. </em>Duffield, 5 Barr, 499 ; Paist \u25a0\u00bb. Caldwell, <em>25 </em>P. F. Smith, 166.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-4\">We think, too, that the attempted revocation was defective in form: the submission was under seal, the attempted revocation was not. In Morse on Arbitration and Award, it is stated that \u2018 the formality of the revocation must follow and conform to the formality of the submission. Thus, if the submission be under seal, so, also, must be the revocation. If the submission be in writing, the revocation must be written ; but if the submission be only verbal, then the revocation may be verbal also. If this rule be not complied with, a revocation, which is insufficient under it, will be of no effect.\u2019 We .are not aware that this precise question has been determined in Pennsylvania, but in Dickerson <em>v. </em>Rorke, 6 Casey, 392, it was held that \u2018 where a submission is in writing, it cannot be directly revoked except by a written instrument given to the arbitrators or a majority of them.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">It is probable that, under the authorities, the attempted revocation in this case would be held to be in time, as it was made before the award was signed or the exact amount agreed upon ; but it is clear from the evidence that Mitchell knew, before he attempted to revoke the submission, that the award, when made, would be against him, and it is a fair inference from the evidence that he knew that its amount would be $2,100 unless Yan Etten, his former counsel, consented to the proposition of Biddis. If revocation is admissible upon the state of facts disclosed by this evidence, the policy of the rule which admits it is seriously questioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">The defendant thereupon took this writ, assigning for error, <em>inter </em>alia, the action of the Court in holding the submission irrevocable, and in refusing to set aside the award.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-7\"><em>G. G. Waller </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-8\">The submission was not a contract upon sufficient consideration. It gives him the liberty to settle accounts and claims, and pay over the money to those they owe, but he had that right before, as one of the partners. As a matter of convenience to themselves and their debtors,the books and papers are left with one of them, inasmuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>as they had separated, and could not both have the books at the same time. Newman does not agree to give anything for this work, and stipulates that Mitchell is not to receive anything. What rights did Newman relinquish ? He had access to the books at all times, just as much as if he was the liquidating partner. It -was for their mutual benefit that the books and accounts of the late firm should be settled. One party was no more interested in this than the other. That was not a matter submitted to the arbitrators, or with which they had anything to do, but which the parties chose to arrange for their own convenience, without any consideration moving either, beyond the legal right which either of them already had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-4\">The learned judge says: \u201cMitchell was by the agreement made the liquidating partner upon the terms therein stated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-5\">The mere fact that the agreement states a self-evident fact, or concedes a right already existing and undisputed, should not make it an essential factor in the submission, and for that alone, without any consideration, constitute it a binding contract: Johnson <em>v. </em>Andress, 5 Phila., 8.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-6\"><em>H. T. Baker </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-7\">The agreement to submit to arbitrators was a contract upon sufficient consideration to render it irrevocable. While it is true that Mitchell, before this agreement, had the right to settle the affairs of the firm as a partner, Newman had also the right. By the submission Newman gave it up: McGreehen <em>v. </em>Duffield, 5 Barr, 499. In this case Newman relinquished his right and gave Mitchell full power to settle accounts and claims, sell, transfer, and assign notes, accounts, and judgments, pay out moneys in liquidation of the debts, and to have sole possession of the books and papers of the firm. This, moreover, gave Mitchell the practical advantage of communication and dealings with old customers of the late firm at his new place of business. Further, Newman submitted to the arbitrators as a part of the adjustment of the several affairs in dispute between the parties his judgment, then due, and ripe for execution, and abstained from entering up and issuing execution upon the same. He also\u2014 with the consent of the other heirs of his father\u2019s estate\u2014 submitted to their determination all the matters of that estate connected with the firm, involving a large store account and rent for the premises occupied by the firm for the full term of partnership, and began no litiga tion in that behalf; thus, by this single method of adjudication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>of the several differences between the parties, avoiding at least three different forms of legal proceedings : Williams <em>v. </em>Tracey, 14 N., 310.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-5\">The revocation at best was not in time, nor founded upon proper canse. No fraud or misbehavior of arbitrators is alleged; and if Mitchell, between Saturday, when the amount was agreed upon, (unless an extension was made by the parties,) and Monday, when the award was actually signed, simply concluded that he was dissatisfied with the conclusion reached by a majority of the arbitrators, the revocation was not warranted thereby. Under these circumstances, it was not in the power of Mitchell, \u201cat the last moment, and after the referees had gone far into the case, suddenly to give a notice of revocation and avert a result;\u201d Paist <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 25 P. F. S., 163.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-6\">In this case; the parties were a law unto themselves, and only gross misbehavior of the arbitrators or fraud could stop or set aside the award; Robinson <em>v. </em>Bickley, 6 C., 389 ; Paist <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 25 P. P. S., 166 ; Monongahela Nav. Co. <em>-o. </em>Penlon, 4 W. &amp; S., 205 ; Gallup v. Reynolds, 8 W., 426 ; Lewis\u2019 Appeal, 10 N., 359.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b444-7\">March 10th, 1884.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AQ3\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">This agreement of submission contains something more than a mere submission. It further stipulates that the defendant in error should give to the plaintiff in error possession of the books and papers of the firm, and that the latter should become the liquidating partner, with full power to dispose of its assets and pay its indebtedness therewith. This was a sufficient consideration to make the submission irrevocable -when made. An attempted revocation just as the award is about to be announced, and when there is persuasive evidence that the party had substantial knowledge of the conclusion at which the referees had arrived, is not entitled to much favor. It cannot be asserted except under a clear claim of right. Such right did not exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
