T., 1866, although necessarily brought in the name of Hannah Christman, the present plaintiff, and although the breaches laid in the declaration were of all the conditions of the bond, both those for the benefit of the plaintiff herself, as well as those for the benefit of Amelia Buskirk, yet the result of the huit was that judgment was obtained against Sally Ann Hawk and her liusband, not for anything due the plaintiff, but only for the amount due by them to Amelia Buskirk, being the otre half of $666 and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-12\">So that this suit, so far as the plaintiff was concerned, was a failure \u2014 it resulted in nothing. It is as though a jury had found in favor of the defendants. The judgment entered is not a judgment in favor of Hannah Bus-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>kirk or Christman, but it is a judgment to the use of Amelia Buskirk*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-4\">It is true the judgment was confessed for the penalty of the bond, and the amount of damages liquidated by agreement of counsel for plaintiff and defendant, respectively, but that fact is of no consequence. It matters not whether Hannah Christman failed to recover because there was nothing due to her, or because she forgave defendants the debt \u2014 the important fact is that she, in her own right, recovered nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">The judgment was the judgment of Amelia Buskirk, in which the legal plaintiff had no interest whatever. The execution was the execution of Amelia Buskirk to compel payment, not of any amount due Hannah Christman, but the amount due Amelia Buskirk; and the estate or interest of Sally Ann Hawk in the land was sold for that purpose, and the proceeds applied to that end. Amelia Buskirk, the equitable plaintiff, had a right to issue execution and collect the amount of that judgment by a sale of defendant\u2019s interest in the land in despite of the protests or whatever opposition Hannah Christman might make ; see Coffey to Use of White\u00ae. White Ex., 14 W. N. C., 108 ; Kennebec Ice &amp; Coal Co. \u00ae. Wilmington &amp; N. R. R. Co., 13 W. N. C:, 162. And on her writ the land was sold \u2014 103 acres, with buildings and improvements, for $500 \u2014 barely enough to pay the debt, interests, and costs on Amelia Buskirk\u2019s judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-6\">The authorities recognize three exceptions at least to the rule that liens are discharged by a judicial sale, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-7\"><em>First. </em>Where liens are created by last wills and testaments as permanent provisions for wives and children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-8\"><em>Second. </em>Where, from the nature of the incumbrance, it will not readily admit of valuation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-9\"><em>Third. </em>Where it is plain from the agreement of the parties that the incumbrance was intended to run with the land: Stewartson \u00ae.

Baker, 13 Wr., 9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-10\">If the plaintiff\u2019s security were in the nature of a mere lien, created by deed, it would seem very clearly to fall within both the second and third exceptions above noted, being of indeterminate value, and expressly created to run with the land during the life of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-11\"><em>William Dams </em>and <em>B.

Lenox, 9 S. <em>&amp; </em>R., 313.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-7\">This lien was a certain definite sum; which the plaintiff had the right to take out of the proceeds of the sale when the sheriff sold the property to Christ, and the same is therefore discharged by the sale, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-8\">The fact here alleged is apparent. The mortgage expressly stipulates :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-9\">\u201cProvided always, nevertheless, that if the said parties of the first part shall and do pay, or <em>cause to be paid, the aforesaid debt of $8,000, or in lieu thereof well and sufficiently pay and perform the covenants and agreements in the bond, etc., etc.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-10\">Under this provision, Hannah Christman was entitled to participate in the proceeds of sale. It required no impounding of a sum by the court. It did not require the court to ascertain the amount due on account of her lien. The parties themselves fixed it at $2,000. This is definite and certain, and the lien to secure the same was necessarily discharged by the sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-11\">But we say further, that the sheriff\u2019s sale in this case, having been under a judgment obtained on the bond, in which Hannah Christman herself was plaintiff, and the suit \u00ediaving been for a breach of ail the conditions thereof, including the non-payment of the annuity and the personal support up to the date of the suit, the sheriff\u2019s sale, under that judgment, divested her lien or estate, or whatever it may be called.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b292-12\">March 24th, 1884.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ApG\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"Any\">The deed and the mortgage bear the same date. They were executed and delivered at the same time. The deed stipulated for future support and maintenance of the grantor, and the payment to her of a specific sum semi-annually during her life, and of a, further specific sum to one Amelia Bus-kirk, at the expiration of five years from the date of the deed. The bond.recited in the mortgage was conditioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>for the payment and performance of all the- stipulations stated in the deed. Some ten years after the execution of the papers, suit was brought on the bond. A narr was filed, assigning breaches of all the stipulations and conditions' mentioned in the bond. Judgment was obtained, and by virtue of execution thereon, the land was duly sold to the defendant. We think the effect of this judgment and sale divested the lien of th\u00a7 plaintiff on the land. It follows the learned judge committed no error in directing a judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"Avf\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
