Plea_, \u201cnot guilty.\u201d\u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">On the trial, the following facts appeared :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-8\">The plaintiff, John Brewer, was employed in March, 1880, by the defendants, who are the owners of the Monastery Coke Works, near Latrobe, Westmoreland county, to work in their coke yards. A crushing machine was used at the works for the purpose of breaking or crushing coal. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was thirteen years, eight months, and ten days old. His height was over six feet, his weight one hundred and forty-four pounds, and his wages eighty-five cents a day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-9\">The plaintiff testified, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-10\">\u201cI lost this arm in the tipple. The tipple was at the mouth of the mines. It was either my third or fourth day, I cannot say which. I cannot say how wide the place I was working in was. I think, maybe, about eighteen, maybe twenty, inches, or a little more, I cannot tell exactly. I cannot say exactly how deep it was below the top of'the ground, about two and a half feet, I would suppose. I do not know exactly how long. I was sitting on my knees. I was to keep the place from clogging whenever there would be a big lump get in the place where it went down through. I had to break it with an iron poker to keep the lumps small enough, so they would go down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>through.. I reached over to break a lump of coal, and my coat caught over the spider wheel. You might call it the spider wheel. When I tried to throw my coat off, in trying to throw it off, it caught my hand. My arm is off just below the elbow. It most certainly was a dangerous place. I had to work with torch-light. It was dark in there ; torch-light, a large lamp, you may say.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-4\">Upon cross-examination, he said :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\">\u2018 \u2018 I did not think it was dangerous as soon as I went. If I had I would not have gone in. I discovered it was dangerous after I was hurt. I could not help but see it when I was in there. Still I did not think there was much danger ; not at that time. When I went there at first I did not think there was any danger. I did not think it was a very safe place, but I did not think there was much danger. There was a log that the wheel worked on, the log that the wheel run in the inside of. I was about six or eight inches from the wheel. John Taylor and William Hartzell worked in there. That is two parties that I know worked in there. I never knew of anybody else hurt there. I cannot tell you how old this Hartzell boy was. I think he was older than me. I was to kneel on my knees right beside that log. At the time I\u2018 was hurt I was not sitting on the log. I did not tell young Hartzell that I was sitting upon that log. The log was between me and the wheel. The log was about six or eight inches thick. I was on the opposite side of the log from the wheel. I went to strike, and my coat flew out that way and it caught me. My position there was to break any big lump that would clog in there. I had in my hand to do it with a middling long iron rod, something like three feet long, or maybe a little more. I would punch the coal with that.\u201d <em>'</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">John Taylor, an employ\u00e9 of defendants, testified for plaintiff, <em>inter'alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\">\u2018 \u2018 It was not a fit place for a boy to work. I think it would take a man to mind himself that he did not get hurt in a place of that kind. * * * It was a very narrow place, I suppose not over two feet, probably a little more than that. It was a dangerous place.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-8\">George Lawson, for plaintiff and also an employ\u00e9, testified :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-9\">\u201cI do not think it was a dangerous place to work for any person who had any judgment about them. I do not think it was any more dangerous than any other place about the works. I had been in there before the boy Brewer got hurt; * * * I did not feel anyways <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>alarmed about it. * * * I would not want a boy of mine to go in there, because a boy has not always the same judgment as a man has.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\">Casper Adams, another employ\u00e9, called for the plaintiff, testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">\u201c I was acquainted with that piece of machinery before the accident occurred. I put it there. I would not think it was dangerous with proper care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\"><em>Q. </em>How would it be for a boy <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-7\"><em>A. </em>With proper care, for a boy it would be the same as a man, to my notion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\"><em>Q. </em>Do you think it was safe to put a boy in there to work ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-9\"><em>A. </em>I cannot tell you for that, if the boy was put there, if he took care. I do not think there was any danger. If he was careful, I do not think there would b.e any danger.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-10\">William Kelley, who was also an employ\u00e9, testified under plaintiff\u2019s call:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-11\">\u201cI do not think it was any more dangerous than in any other places of the same kind about the works, if the boy was careful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-12\"><em>Q. </em>But for a boy of that age ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-13\"><em>A. </em>Well, I thin!?; that, of course, a boy is always thoughtless and careless. If he did not attend to his work, he might possibly be caught.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-14\">There was no attempt to show that defendants\u2019 machinery was defective or out of repair, or that any negligent act, contributing to the plaintiff\u2019s injury, had been committed by any of the defendants or their agents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-15\">Roll Slater, E. W. Householder, George Sander, George Stader, all employ\u00e9s of defendants, and called by them, testified that there was no more danger at the work in which the plaintiff was engaged than in any other about such an industry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-16\">,Wm. Hartzell testified, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-17\">\u201cIn March, 1880, I was working where Brewer was, where Brewer got hurt. I was employed in that position. I was seventeen past, then. The day that he got hurt I told him about getting hurt. There was a place down, anyhow three feet, between this log and the outside for him to sit in. He was sitting right on the log that way, and every time he would punch back his arm, would hit the elevator. I saw him, and I told him about it. I said, \u201cYou will get hurt.\u201d He said he did not care a damn whether he would or wouldn\u2019t. That was, maybe, four or five minutes before he got hurt, or maybe not that long. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>was not a dangerous place to work in unless you made it so. I could have worked in there for years and never got a scratch. If he wanted to make it dangerous, certainly it was dangerous, like any other machinery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-5\">E. W\u201e Householder testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-6\">\u201cI asked the boy how he got hurt. He told me he had caught those eievators two or three times with his hand, and had stopped them, and he caught them this time and they did not stop, and he got his hand caught.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">The plaintiff offered in evidence the act of 24th of May, 1878, section two (P. L., 119).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-8\">The Court charged the jury that \u201cunder all the evidence, your verdict should be for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-9\">Verdict accordingly for defendants and judgment thereon ; whereupon, plaintiff took this writ, assigning for error the action of the Court in directing the jury to find a verdict for the defendants, and in not submitting to the jury as a fact the question of defendants\u2019 negligence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-10\"><em>Edgar Oowan </em>and <em>Luden W. Doty </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-11\">The question of defendant\u2019s negligence ought to have been submitted to the jury. This is the general rule governing cases of this kind : Humphreys \u00bb. Reed, 6 Whart., 435 ; Hydraulic Works Company \u00bb. Orr, 83 Pa. St. Rep., 332 ; Fritsch \u00bb. Allegheny, 91 Pa. St. Rep., 226 ; McKee <em>n. </em>Bidwell, 74 Pa. St., 218; McCully \u2022\u00bb. Clarke, 40 <em>Id., </em>399.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-12\">The learned judge held the infant plaintiff to the same care and discretion as would have been required of an adult. It was said in effect that a child of thirteen years of age is bound to take the risks of any employment in which he may engage. This is going further than any case to be found in the books. Blackstone, Vol. I, p. 435, fixes,fourteen as the age of discretion in males. Under seven years, an infant cannot be guilty of a felony. Between seven and fourteen, the requisite discretion may be present or wanting \u2014 the standard is not fixed. His responsibility depends on circumstances, and whenever the standard of the degree of care is not fixed, wherever the duty is variable, the question is for the jury and not for the Court: Smith <em>n. </em>O\u2019Connor, 48 Pa. St'., 218 ; Pennsylvania R. R. Co. \u2022\u00bb. Kelly, 31 Pa. St., 372; Oakland Ry. Co. \u00ab. Fielding, 48 Pa. St., 320; Philadelphia City Passenger R. R. Co. <em>t&gt;. </em>Hassard, 75 Pa. St., 367.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-13\">Under the conflicting evidence in this case, it was a question for the jury whether or not the employment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>a dangerous one. If dangerous, the defendants in employing a minor under the age of fifteen were guilty of a misdemeanor \u2014 act of 24th May, 1878, (P. L., p. 119.) They were doing an illegal act, and if by their wrongful act they did injury to the plaintiff, they ought to be responsible in damages. The cupidity of corporations and large operators induces them, in violation of law, to employ mere children in the most hazardous and dangerous employments, and the only protection for society and the children of poor parents is to hold such employers to the strictest accountability for any injury done for such violation of law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-4\"><em>J. A. Marchand </em>and <em>John F. Wentling </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-5\">The rule laid down by the plaintiff in error as to when the question of negligence should be submitted to the jury, is entirely too general, and not within the scope of the evidence and circumstances in this case: Reading R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Heil, 5 W. N. C., 93; Honer <em>v. </em>Albrighton, 8 W.N. C., 295.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">Before the jury can be allowed to determine the case, the plaintiff must show culpable negligence on the part of the defendants, just as in the cases cited by the plaintiff in error, and so much relied on, namely: 48 and 75 Pennsylvania State Reports, pages 320-367; and in cases of injury to children unless this is first shown, the incapacity of the child cannot be considered by the jury: Kay \u00ab. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 65 Pa. St., 276 ; Reading R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Hummell, 44 Pa. St., 377; Nagle <em>v. </em>Allegheny Valley R. R. Co., 88 Pa. St., 39.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-7\">The act of 24th May, 1878, cited by plaintiff, only applies to masters of apprentices, guardians, fathers, and such \u201c having the care, custody, and control of children,\u201d 'and not the employers thereof, such as the defendants, for a time to be agreed upon by the parties. And still further, this act cannot be intended to fix the age at which children can be employed in dangerous legitimate pursuits of life, unless it repeals the tenth section of the act of the 3d of March, 1870, which we think it does not do, found in Purd. Dig., page 1070, where the age of a boy is fixed at twelve years, when he can. \u2018 \u2018 work or enter a coal mine.\u201d Therefore, under all the evidence and circumstances in the case, we think the Court was clearly right in directing a verdict for the defendants.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b483-8\">October 20th, 1884.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AsD\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"AEI\">The act of 24th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>May, 1878, P. L., 119, is not applicable to the kind of employment in which the plaintiff was engaged. It cannot be declared-to be negligence in an employer to put a person of the age and size of the plaintiff, at work in a place where machinery is used. The labor which he was performing was adapted to one of his age. Other boys had done the same kind of work without being injured. The use of all kinds of machinery may result in possible injury to one at work near by. It is not, however, within such reasonable probability as to hold the employer guilty of negligence by reason of the age of the plaintiff. The machinery was not defective nor out of repair. There was no negligent act of the defendants or their superintendents which contributed to the injury. There was some evidence of negligence on the part of the plaintiff-.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
