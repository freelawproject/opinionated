On March 2, 1874, Conrad Bender entered judgment against Louis Drummerhausen, in the Armstrong county common pleas, for $2,100, interest from February 11, 1877, waiver of inquisition and all exemption laws, upon which a <em>ft. fa. </em>was issued July 18, 1878, an inquest summoned by the sheriff in jmrsuance of the act of 23d March, 1877, entitled \u201cAn act to regulate stay of execution in certain cases,\u201d and lot No. 94, which had been levied upon on July 23, 1878, was valued and appraised at $5,250. The writ was stayed on application August 30, 1878, till September 2, 1878 ; and on September 4, 1878, the lot was sold by the sheriff to John Dampman for $2,500. The sheriff\u2019s deed to Dampman was presented in court for acknowledgment on September 11, 1878 ; objection made thereto, and the acknowledgment was held over. Exceptions were filed September 14,1878, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows : \u201cFourth.
