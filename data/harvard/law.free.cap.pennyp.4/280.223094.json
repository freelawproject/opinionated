Defendant\u2019s counsel object to the proposed evidence as immaterial and incompetent in this action; that the remedy would be by action on a breach of that contract; that evidence of promises made at a time prior to this settlement would be immaterial so far as relates to the setting aside of this settlement made on the 26th of August, 1882, before the magistrate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-9\"><em>Second. </em>That the facts proposed to be proved, even if true and established, would be incompetent evidence for the purpose proposed, inasmuch as they show neither fraud, imposition, nor undue influence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-10\"><em>Third. </em>That even if it were true, and thereby any right of action accrued to the plaintiff in this case, it would not be such an action as the present, but would be an action for the breach of the mentioned contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-11\">Plaintiff more fully stated the offer as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-12\">We propose to show that Mr. Staub promised to the plaintiff that if she would leave his house and give him a receipt, then he would find lodging for her, would find meat and drink for her, and she could live there without doing any work ; he would provide for her if she would give him that receipt. Also, that the witness was taken then to Wilkes-Barre; that a constable went along; that she was kept in the office of Esquire Ziegler from eight o\u2019clock until twelve o\u2019clock, and that she was prevailed on there to consent and to sign her name to the receipt, and that afterwards the defendant did not fulfill his promise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-13\">The defendant\u2019s counsel objected for the same reasons as before.

He said to me that he wanted me to go with him to Wilkes-Barre, and I remarked that I would not go with him unless I knew where I was going and whether I was to have something to eat and drink. He said that I would get a dwelling, and eat and drink, and a stove, and everything that was necessary for me. I -went with him to go into that dwelling. He told me to come along, and I thought that was the place where I was to live when I went up the stairs. I didn\u2019t know it was Squire Ziegler\u2019s office. I took a seat and they commenced writing. They were talking English together and Mr. Ziegler wrote it down. I did not understand what they said. He said I was to have $2 25 a week. Staub said I would get, after I signed the paper, a dwelling and everything. I lived with Mr. Staub seventy-three weeks and not eighty-three. It was a mistake that we calculated six days to a week.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-7\">Q.

Therefore, if the jury believe the actual claim of the plaintiff to be, as she distinctly testified, $492, the present action is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>maintainable, ancl the verdict must be for the defendant; and the correction by the plaintiff of the amount of her claim, under the direction of -her counsel, simply for the purpose of reducing it to an amount within the jurisdiction of the justice, is not available to confer jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-4\"><em>Answer. </em>We say, in answer to this point,' that so far as regards the first portion of it, it is affirmed, that portion being \u201cthat a justice of the peace has no jurisdiction of a claim exceeding $300, and upon appeal the court of common pleas has no jurisdiction, and that a party cannot give jurisdiction to a justice by remitting a part of the actual\u2019 claim and suing for the balance.\u201d The remainder of the point we decline to affirm, because it assumes questions of fact which are to be found by the jury. We further say to you, that a witness who has made a mistake in naming the amount of her claim, when upon the witness-stand, has a right, upon reflection, to go upon the stand again and correct that mistake, and her doing so does not affect the status of the case against her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">(Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>That even if the jury believe the statement of the plaintiff that she was induced to make the settlement by reason of defendant\u2019s promise to find her lodging and living subsequently, that would not amount to a fraud upon her or be evidence of imposition or undue influence ; if such promise were made and subsequently broken, that would simply furnish ground of action for breach of such agreement, but would not warrant the bringing of the present action in disregard of such settlement. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-7\">(Sixth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-8\"><em>Answer. </em>We decline to affirm that point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-9\"><em>Fifth. </em>That there is no sufficient evidence of either fraud, imposition, or undue influence to warrant the jury in finding that the settlement in the case is vitiated by fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-10\">(Seventh assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-11\"><em>Answer. </em>We decline so to charge you, and say that the question is for the jury, under our general instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-12\">[Now, gentlemen, we say to you that, on its face, this paper is a full and final settlement between the parties ; that it amounts to an acquittance and receipt by the plaintiff to the defendant and from the defendant to the plaintiff, of any mutual demands existing between them ; and unless you believe that her signature to this paper was obtained from her by what amounts in law to a deception and a fraud practic\u00e9d upon her, or that she la<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>bored under some mistake of fact or law when she signed it, it is conclusive of this controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-4\">It is alleged, however, on the part of the plaintiff, -that while it is true she signed this paper, she acted under a misapprehension, and was defrauded. She defines the fraud to exist in this: That she was willing to give up any claim upon the defendant for wages, upon the consideration and agreement upon his part, as she alleges, made by him to her, that he would provide lodgings for \u2019 her and support, elsewhere than in his own family ; and that, having failed to furnish such lodgings and support, he is in default, has violated his contract, and that therefore it cannot be set up against her in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">This brings us to one of the main questions of fact in the case, which is for you. Is this paper free and clear, under the evidence, from the allegation of fraud, made by the plaintiff <em>% </em>If it is, it is a final answer to her claim for wages in this action.

The transcript shows that the plaintiff claimed $225 from the defendant, as a balance due her for work and labor done by herself and her child. It also shows that she testified to that amount, and that a judgment was rendered in her favor for that sum by the justice. On her examination in chief, she said her claim was for $492, and the next day, under objection and exception by the defendant, she said this was a mistake, and that her claim was for $225. We are not able to perceive any legal reason for refusing to permit her to give this testimony. She is a very ignorant woman, did not understand the English language, and might easily have made a mistake in stating the amount of her claim when on the witness-stand in a court of justice. The fact that she had, before the justice, presented a claim of $225, and testified in support of it, is conclusive that there was a mistake somewhere, and that being so, there was certainly a right of explanation. The evidence as to the time over which her work extended, and the rate of wages paid for such labor, corroborates the correctness of her explanation. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>can. we discover any error in the action of the court in reference to the written evidence of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The Court charged the jury that on its face it was a full and final settlement between the parties, and amounted to an acquittance. The question whether it was obtained from her by fraud and deception was a pure question of fact, and was necessarily and very fairly submitted to the jury by the Court. The jury found that it was so obtained, and we think there was sufficient testimony in the case both to justify the court in leaving the question to the jury and to warrant the jury in finding the verdict they did. No money or other thing of value was given to the plaintiff at the time the paper was signed. As the jury has found that she was then entitled to more than a $100, in addition to -whatever she may have received before, we are bound to assume that the effect of the paper upon its face was to deprive her of that amount, which, irrespective of the paper, she had a right to demand of the defendant. A person in her situation and circumstances is entitled to perfectly fair and upright treatment in making a settlement and signing a paper such as this. She testified that she was induced to sign it by reason of promises made by the defendant to furnish her with a house and support. She was asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>State what the conversation was between Staub and you in Esquire Zieglers.office?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\"><em>A. </em>That they had now settled and everything was in the paper, and I would get just what was stated, I would get all that was stated.\u201d And again :</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>State whether or not he made you any promises in Squire Ziegler\u2019s office ?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\"><em>A. </em>He told me all the time that I was provided for, that I would get it all.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\"><em>Q. </em>In Squire Ziegler\u2019s office?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\"><em>Q. </em>What promise did he make to you in Squire Ziegler\u2019s office?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\"><em>A. </em>He promised me a dwelling and all that I needed that was necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">There was other testimony of a similar import in the case, and the Court below, in dealing with this branch of the case, charged the jury that if the plaintiff signed the paper, understanding fully what she was doing, and if the representations about the furnishing a house and support for her were not the inducement for her signing, or if such representations were not made, then she was debarred by the paper, and could not recover. But if, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the contrary, the jury believed such statements were made to her, and if they were the inducement and consideration for her execution of the paper, and it failed by the defendant refusing to perform his agreement, then if any money was due her and unpaid for her wages, she could recover, notwithstanding the paper. In all this we think there was no error. It cannot be said there was no evidence, or only a scintilla upon this subject. It is not difficult to understand that a woman, situated as this one was, ignorant, in a strange land, unacquainted with the people around her, alone, friendless, in destitute circumstances, with an aged mother and two small children dependent upon her, without a home, without food or any provision for her support, and unable to speak our language, might very easily be induced to sign almost any paper, upon a promise that if she would do so she should have a home and support provided for her. In such a case, nice and critical discriminations upon the very words of the testimony are not requisite, nor are they conducive to the due administration of justice. It is the substance only of the language and statements employed that needs to be considered. Upon a review of the whole testimony, we are satisfied with the manner in which the subject Avas treated by the court below. This practically disposes of the case, as the several assignments of error raise only questions which relate to the matters we have considered. As to the ninth assignment, it is only necessary to say that the Supreme Court will not reverse a judgment because the court below erred in prescribing the order in which counsel should address the jury: Smith v. Frazier, 3 P. F. S., 226; Richards <em>v. </em>Nixon, 8 Harr., on p. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
