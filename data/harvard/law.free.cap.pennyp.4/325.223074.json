For instance, a person on this or the other side of the river has a boat, raft, float, or an ark. that he desires to have towed across the river from one side to the other \u2014 no one would have the right, according to this act of Assembly, to either push, row, or tow it for hire, except an agent or employ\u00e9 of the Steam Ferry and Tow Boat Company, and for so towing he would be liable to a penalty of $20.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-9\">\u201cIt seems to me, at present, that this was all that was intended by the Legislature when it passed the act incorporating the Sunbury Steam Ferry and Tow Boat Company, and inasmuch as it has not been proved by any testimony in the case that George W. Heim, the defendant, either pushed, rowed, or towed any boat, raft, float, ark, flat, or other vessel, either laden or unladen, for pay, hire, gift, or reward, over the Susquehanna river, to and from any point opposite or within the limits of the borough of Sunbury, aforesaid, your verdict will have to be in favor of the defendant.

The prohibition against pushing, rowing, and towing any boat for pay or hire includes a boat propelled by a screw propeller.

Prom the express letter of the act incorporating the plaintiff company, it was intended by the Legislature to be limited to the towing traffic. Two classes of employments are mentioned in the sixth section, viz: \u201c towing \u2019 \u2019 and \u201ccarrying.\u201d The eighth section prohibits \u201ctowing,\u201d but not \u201ccarrying.\u201d A legislative grant will not be deemed exclusive unless the intention is perfectly clear: Johnson \u00ab.

The reversal of the court below would involve a disregard of both these rules. If we examine the' charter of the company plaintiff, we will find that whilst it has the power to carry passengers, freight, &amp;c., and charge tolls therefor, that power is not exclusive. Its privileges as a transporter will be found in the sixth section of the act of incorporation, which reads as follows: \u201cThe said company shall be, and they are hereby authorized to charge such rates of fare and tolls for the carrying of passengers, freight, merchandise, live stock, vehicles, and every species of property, and for towing boats, rafts, arks, &amp;c., as the, board of managers shall direct.\u201d An analysis of this section will show that the privileges as therein recited are divisible into two dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>tinet classes; first, the carrying of passengers, freight, merchandise, &amp;c.; second, the towing of boats, rafts, &amp;c., and the essential difference in the methods of transportation is marked by the words \u201ccarrying\u201d and \u201ctowing.\u201d Then, when we turn to the eighth section, which is penal in its character, and designed to protect the business of the company, we find it does not embrace the first class as mentioned in the preceding section, but only the second. The prohibition is against \u201cpushing, rowing, or towing any boat, raft, ark, float, flat, or other vessel, laden or unladen, for pay, hire, gift, or reward, over the said Susquehanna river.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">But there is here no specific prohibition against the carrying of passengers, freight, merchandise, &amp;c. This omission is significant, and, as we think, reveals the legislative intention. It was thought proper to give the company the monopoly of transporting for hire every species of floating craft or vessel from the one side of the river to the other, and in order to accomplish this a penalty was imposed upon all others who should engage in a like business of transportation for hire. But it does not prohibit any person from towing or rowing his own boat across the river, whether laden or unladen. Had the Legislature designed to confer upon the plaintiff a general monopoly of the carrying business, it certainly would not have omitted from the eighth section the prominent,and most important feature of the sixth. This omission shows conclusively that, for the welfare of the public, the carrying of freight and passengers was left open to competition. Even were there a doubt concerning this, it would,, under the well-settled rules above stated, be our duty to resolve that doubt in favor of the public. The plaintiff is not entitled to what the statute does not clearly give it, and, on the other hand, the penalty cannot be imposed on the defendant if we have any serious hesitancy as to whether he has or has not done that which subjects him to its imposition. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
