A testator devised his real estate to his widow for life, with remainder to his son. The son, who was a man of drinking habits, but whose mental capacity was not impaired, afterwards became indebted to his mother for borrowed money, and executed to a third person for her a bond and mortgage upon the real estate for $4,000, in which the mother joined. The mortgage was then immediately assigned to the mother. The real estate was afterwards sold by the sheriff under foreclosure proceedings upon the mortgage, and was bought in for her benefit. The mother, as executrix of testator, was adjudged to have about $2,300 in her hands, to which the son would be entitled upon her death, and the orphans\u2019 court had ordered her to enter security therefor, in default of which she was discharged as executrix. A bill in equity was filed by the son\u2019s widow against the widow of testator and the assignee of the mortgage, praying for an injunction to restrain the sheriff from delivering a deed for the property, and for the cancellation of the mortgage, on the ground that it was given to defraud her of her dower in the land. The bill contained.no prayer for general relief, and the master found that there was no fraud in the giving of the mortgage: The court below ordered that the sale under the judgment on the mortgage should be set aside, that the mortgage should only be held as security for $2,000, and that the plaintiff should be restrained from issuing any further execution on the judgment until the entry of security by her for the proper application of the proceeds of the execution, &amp;c. <em>Held, </em>to be error, the court having no jurisdiction in this proceeding to make any part of the decree. <em>Held, further, </em>that such a decree should not be made in a proceeding which did not raise such questions, and as to which the parties were never heard.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-12\">4.

Morio, (now deceased,) of whom the plaintiff is the widow and sole devisee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\"><em>Second.. </em>That on the 22d day of July, 1875, the said Elizabeth Morio and the said Peter J.

Morio to the said Joseph Leibrand, conditioned for the payment of the sum of $4,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-8\"><em>Fourth. </em>That, at the time the mortgage was assigned, the said Peter J. Morio was indebted to his mother for borrowed money, the amount of which, however, was not proven, as the mother claimed that the mortgage was a gift to her, and had no moneyed consideration to support it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-9\"><em>Fifth. </em>That Peter J.

The master is of the opinion that it cannot be a security for more than $2,000, and that Elizabeth Morio cannot collect under it the sum of $4,000, for which she is jointly liable; that she cannot use the mortgage to compel her coobligor to pay, individually and in full, an indebtedness created by .tlieir joint bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-7\">The master is of opinion that the case is a proper one for the application of the doctrine of contribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-8\">It was shown before the master that Elizabeth Morio, as executrix of Peter Morio, deceased, had been adjudged by the orphans\u2019 court of Philadelphia to be in default in the sum of about $2,300, which amount Mr. Moyer claimed should be applied to the payment of the mortgage in issue ; the master is, however, of opinion that the enforcement of the decree of the orphans\u2019 court must properly rest with that court, and that in this proceeding no decree could be made which would exempt the executrix from the process of the court having exclusive jurisdiction over her accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-9\">The master is of the opinion that, under all the circumstances, the sheriff\u2019s sale, under the mortgage, should be set aside, and that the assessment of damages should be corrected with the views herein expressed, before an alias execution should issue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-10\">The defendants\u2019 counsel filed exceptions to the master\u2019s report, which were dismissed by the Court below, Mitchell, J., delivering the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-11\">\u201cWe see no ground to disturb the master\u2019s finding that the mortgage in question was a gift by Peter J. Morio to his mother, and that it was his voluntary and intelligent act. The master has reported, however, that the mortgage being the joint act of Peter and his mother, she is equally bound by it, and cannot now enforce it against his estate for more than one half its nominal amount. While it may be doubtful whether this conclusion can be sustained technically on the ground of contribution, it is nevertheless quite clear that Peter, having the reversion, joined his mother, who had the life estate, with the purpose of making a good mortgage of the fee for $4,000. For this purpose, the parties appear to have treated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>life estate and the reversion as equal in value, and all that Peter intended to pledge was his portion. The clear intent of Peter, therefore, was to make a gift of his half of the mortgage to his mother, and we think his estate is entitled in equity to be relieved from any greater burden. \"We are, therefore, of the opinion that defendant, Henry Morio, holds the mortgage in question as a valid security for $2,000, and for no more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-6\">It appears from the bill and answer, and the records of the orphans\u2019 court in evidence, that Elizabeth Morio, the mother, has been adjudged to have in her hands, as executrix of Peter Morio, Sr., the sum of $2,330 25; that she has been ordered to enter security \u201cto protect the persons entitled thereto after her death;\u201d that she has been discharged from her office of executrix for failure to enter such security; 'that she has been ordered to pay over that sum to the administrator, <em>c. t. </em>a., of Peter Morio, Sr., and that proceedings for attachment for contempt in not paying over said amount are now pending in the orphans\u2019 court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-7\">It further appears by paragraphs two and three of the bill, admitted by the answer to be true, that under the wills of Peter Morio, Sr., and Peter J. Morio, the present complainant, Theresa A. Morio, will be entitled to the said sum of $2,330 25, upon the death of Elizabeth Morio. Under these circumstances, it would not be equitable to permit Elizabeth Morio to enforce her collection of $2,000 against Theresa, and to put the money in her pocket without security for the compliance with the order\" of the orphans\u2019 court. But, at the same time, it may be that the collection of this debt may be necessary to enable Elizabeth to comply with such order. An injunction will, therefore, b,e granted against the issue of execution upon the mortgage, until, by entry of security for the application of the money, or in some other mode which counsel may suggest, the reversionary rights of complainant, Theresa Morio, in the estate of Peter Morio, Sr., are secured. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-8\">And now, to wit: January 11, 1883, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the exceptions be dismissed; that Henry Morio, trustee, holds the mortgage in question as a valid security for the sum of $2,000, and accrued interest; that the sheriff\u2019s sale be set aside at the costs of plaintiff in the execution ; and that said plaintiff be restrained from issuing further execution upon said mortgage until the entry of security for the application of the proceeds of execution, or until the further order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Court, and for any greater amount than $2,000 and accrued interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-4\">Defendants then appealed, and assigned as error the refusal to dismiss the bill and the entry of the above decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-5\"><em>Edmund Randall </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">The bill should have been dismissed, as there was nothing left in it for the consideration of the master or the court. There was no fraud shown, and there was no loss of dower by the mortgage given by the husband, because there is no dower right in such estate: 2 Serg. &amp; R., 556; and if there was such right, plaintiff below waived it by accepting as sole devisee under her husband\u2019s will: Reed <em>v. </em>Reed; 9 Watts, 263; Kellinger \u00bb. Reidenhauer, 6 Serg. &amp; R., 531. This claim was, however, abandoned before the master, and a new one urged, to wit: That the mortgage was not the intelligent act of Peter J. Morio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">If the right of contribution existed in this case, the master had no right to award it, as the plaintiff had waived it by not setting up such a claim: Harrisburg Bank <em>v. </em>German, 3 Barr, 300; Cutter <em>v. </em>Emery,' 37 N. H., 577; Mosier\u2019s Appeal, 56 Penna., 76 ; McCormick <em>v. </em>Irwin, 11 Casey, 111. The right of contribution does not exist between a donor and a donee. There can be no contribution between coobligors where one signs at the request of the other: Hendrick <em>v. </em>Whittemore, 105 Mass., 23; Cutter <em>v. </em>Emery, 37 N.

Morio to his mother, on the ground that it was given to defraud the widow of Peter J. Morio of her dower in the land bound by the mortgage. The averments of the bill all relate to that one subject, and the prayer for relief was that the mortgage might be declared fraudulent and void as to the widow. There was no prayer for general relief, and the prayer for an injunction is simply to restrain the delivery of a deed by the sheriff, on the ground that the property was sold under a judgment obtained on a fraudulent mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">There was nothing in the case, therefore, except the question of a fraudulent mortgage. There was an allegation of waste, but no prayer to restrain it, and the master has made express finding that there was no evidence, to support the charge of waste. He also finds that \u201c the single ground on which the mortgage is attacked by the plaintiff fails entirely to be sustained by the testimony.\u201d Having found that there was nothing to sustain the bill, he says he would have dismissed it, had it not been for the charge of waste, and then, having found there was no waste, instead of dismissing the bill, he proceeds to consider a question which was not raised by the pleadings, and upon which neither party was heard. Upon that question, he decides that the mortgage could only be held for $2,000, because Elizabeth Morio, the mother of the mortgagor, was a party to it. \u25a0 He infers that she was bound to pay one half of the mortgage, because she was jointly liable on the bond and mortgage, and was, therefore, bound to pay one half of it on the principle of contribution. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>then introduces another subject altogether, equally foreign to the pleadings, to wit: That Elizabeth Morio was executrix of her husband\u2019s estate, and had settled her account in the orphans\u2019 court, showing a balance of $2,300 in her hands, which he says the counsel for the plaintiff claimed should be applied to the payment of the mortgage. He declines, however, to interfere with the province of the orphans\u2019 court in enforcing any decree that court -might make, but he recommends a decree setting aside the sheriff\u2019s sale of the land in question under the judgment on the mortgage, (though no such relief had been asked,) and a re-assessment of damages in the <em>sci.fa. </em>on the mortgage, in accordance with his views on the subject of contribution, although there had been full opportunity to make that defense in that proceeding, and an application to open the judgment on the <em>sci. fa. </em>had been made and refused by the court in which it was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In all this there was clear error on the part of the master. Having found that there was nothing in the testimony to sustain the bill as it was filed, it was his plain duty to report- a decree dismissing it. He had no authority to go outside of the bill and raise and decide questions which were not presented by the pleadings, upon which the parties were never heard by testimony or by counsel, and. report a decree entirely foreign to the whole subject of the contention before him. The Court below did not adopt the views of the master on the subject of contribution by Elizabeth Morio, but reached the same conclusion upon the theory that the parties to the mortgage must be presumed to have treated the life estate and the reversion as of equal value, and, therefore, that Peter J. Morio\u2019s intent could only have been to give one half of the mortgage to his mother. Whether this was so in fact, we will not undertake to decide, because the parties have never been heard upon that question, and there is nothing in the .pleadings to raise it. The learned judge of the Court below thought that the decree of the orphan\u2019s court for securing the payment of $2,300 in the hands of Elizabeth Morio, as life tenant, should be considered, and, therefore, ordered the sale under the judgment on that mortgage to be set aside, that the mortgage in question should only be held as security for $2,000, and that Elizabeth Morio should be restrained from issuing any further execution on her judgment until the entry of security by her in the orphans\u2019 court for the proper application of the proceeds of the execution. We are constrained to say that in our opinion there was no jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>tion in this proceeding to make any part of this decree. The court in which the judgment on the mortgage was obtained has full power to determine how much was due on the mortgage, and the orphans\u2019 court is the proper tribunal to make whatever order may be necessary to enforce its own decree. In any event, such a decree should not be made in a proceeding which did not raise such questions', and as to which the parties were never heard.</p>\n<p id=\"ALd\">Decree reversed and bill dismissed at the costs of the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
