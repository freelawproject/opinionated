He filed his account as such receiver January 10, 1881, and it was referred to William Drayton as auditor. <em>t</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-15\">The auditor reported, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-16\">During the six months after his appointment, the receiver, at the request of both parties, retained possession of the factory, stock, and fixtures of the firm, and carried on the business.

As soon as the sale had taken place, the machinery was removed to the tobacco warehouse by the receiver, and stored at an expense of $120 per annum, and insured for $25 per annum. No application was made by him to the court at any time to sanction this expenditure, which was continued until-1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">In \u2014\u2014\u20141881, the auditor, having filed an interlocutory report, the Court ordered that the .machinery and patent right should be sold without conditions or limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">Acting under this order, the machinery and patent right were exposed to sale on May 26, 1881, and the terms of this sale not being complied with, were again exposed to sale on October 4, 1881. The amount realized from this sale, over expenses, was $260 69.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-10\">No inventory of the sale of November 22, 1871, was ever filed by the receiver, nor was any inventory filed by him of the assets which came into his hands as receiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-11\">The open accounts of the firm, when he took possession, amounted to a balance of $3,246 61.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-12\">The receiver claims that he sent these to a collection agency, and produced a paper stating that this was a list of the claims in the hands'of Fairthorn &amp; Rand, and, also, a letter from them stating that this was a final report of that firm on the claims sent to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-13\">The receiver also rented a box at the Fidelity Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>for the deposit of the receipts of P.

He has nowhere charged himself with this profit, nor has he accounted for the two years and a half interest thereon. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">Counsel for plaintiff asks that the receiver be surcharged, and accuses him of negligence and mismanagement of the estate:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\"><em>First. </em>In continuing to carry on the business for six months after his appointment, viz: From May 6, 1871, until November 22, 1871, and in postponing the sale of whiskey until the latter date, at an extra expense of $1,536 91, the total of sales being only $168 73.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\"><em>Second. </em>In failing to make sale of the machinery, or to offer it for sale, between November 22, 1871, and May 26, 1881, and in not applying to the court for leave to sell until March 24, 1881, but keeping the same on storage at an expense of $10 per month, and paying insurance thereon for ten years at $25 per annum, making storage $1,200, insurance $250, total $1,450, while the machinery only netted, at 'the sale, $260 69.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-9\"><em>Third. </em>In his dealing with the money of the estate, loaning them to others, and using them for his own purposes, and so mixed with his private funds as to make it impossible to distinguish whether they are his private moneys or those of the firm.

The courts are generally adverse to assuming the management of a business, except as incidental to the object of the suit, and for the purpose of closing it up and dividing the proceeds, yet they will not surcharge a receiver for keeping up a business for a time, so as to wind it up for the benefit of all interested: High on Deceivers, \u00a7 36 ; Hooper <em>v. </em>Winston, 24 111.; 353 Booth e. Clark, 17 How., 331.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>In this case, the business was undoubtedly carried on at a considerable loss, as appears both from the calculation submitted by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and from the testimony of the receiver. He urges in justification that he carried this on at the request of both parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\">\u201cI did not sell at the request of Messrs. Hevner and Mc-Clelland. They desired a private sale until it was found impossible to do so. Then I urged my attorney, Mr. Ruddiman, to obtain the order of court for me to sell, which was done. It was my desire, as soon as I was appointed receiver, to effect a public sale, and I would have done so, but for this arrangement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">In view of this testimony, it became the duty of the plaintiff to contradict the allegations of the receiver, if possible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\">Had a complaint been made, at the time of the continuance by the receiver of the business, to this court, it would have put an end to such extravagance on the part of its officer, or had it been shown that the plaintiff had remonstrated with the receiver for his conduct, the latter-would undoubtedly have been surcharged under the above authorities ; but, as no evidence was offered to contradict the testimony of the receiver, it must be accepted as true, and a great neglect of duty is attributable to the plaintiff, for it has always been held that it is the duty of plaintiff\u2019s solicitor to watch the actions of the receiver: Miller \u25a0\u00bb. Elkins, 3 L. J. Ch., 128, and in High\u2019s work on Receivers, 181.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-8\">It is said that while formerly courts held a receiver could not make application to the court in the first instance, but should apply to counsel of plaintiff, and only on his refusal to act, apply, yet now a more .liberal rule* prevails ; it does not seem proper, as no active steps were taken by the parties interested at the time, that at this late day one of them should be allowed to come in and ask that the receiver be surcharged for what was a mistake in his authority, that mistake having been encouraged by the very party who now seeks to take advantage of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-9\">The action of the receiver having been, although not in the line of his duty, yet not in direct violation thereof, this surcharge is therefore refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-10\">In answer to the second charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-11\">There is no doubt that the receiver\u2019s conduct in paying such large bills for storage, rent, and insurance on his own authority, and continuing so to do without ever ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>plying to the court for sanction, is not justified by any reported case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-6\">The receiver is an officer of the court, and is bound to apply to the court before making any outlay,' except such as is imperative and urgent, and in the latter case should obtain the sanction of the court at the earliest opportunity: Edwards on Receivers, \u00a7 104; Adams\\\u00bb. Woods, 15 Cal., 206 ; Tempest v. Ord, 2 Meriv., <em>55.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-7\">But the receiver justifies his conduct in this particular by alleging the advice of counsel as to the effect of the order of court made November 21, 1871</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-8\">Mr. McDowell testifies:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-9\">\u201cOn asking the advice of my counsel, I -understood him to say that Mr. Hagert had enjoined me from selling the machinery and patent, whicli formed part of the assets of the estate, for a less sum than $10,000, through the court-. I could not file any report until Mr. Hagert joined him before the court- to have that order rescinded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-10\">With regard to the request relative to the sale of the machinery, Mr. Ruddiman corroborates Mr. McDowell\u2019s statement, and says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-11\">\u2018 \u2018 I advised him that until there should be some modification of the order, either by the court itself or by the parties allowing him to make sale of the property at a less figure than that to which he had been restricted, it was his business to hold the property the best way lie could without allowing it, as far as he was able, to suffer either diminution or depreciation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-12\">How far will the advice of a counsel protect a receiver who has so managed the estate that the whole balance in his hands is consumed by the expenses of ten years, during which he has never filed an inventory or account, or applied to the court, whose officer he is, to sanction a single item of expenditure from November 11,1871, until January, 1881 ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-13\">The English rule, as laid down in Vez <em>v. </em>Emery, <em>5 </em>Ves., 141, is that if an executor, in a doubtful matter, had taken the advice of counsel, and been advised by any gentleman of the law in this country that he was bound to make a certain payment, the chancellor would not have held him liable. * * <em>*</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-14\">The general rule, as to persons in a fiduciary capacity, is followed in several Pennsylvania cases: During\u2019s Appeal, 1 Har., 234; Neff\u2019s Appeal, 7 P. F. S., 91; Calhoun\u2019s Estate, 6 Watts, 186; Frankenfield\u2019s Appeal, 11 W. N. C., 373.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-15\">As in this case, there does seem to be a wide difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>of opinion as <em>to the </em>effect <em>of the order of </em>November 21, 1871, the receiver, as he employed counsel and followed his advice, should be protected. It is, therefore, with some hesitation that the auditor finds that the receiver, although guilty of neglect and outstepping the bounds of his duty and authority, is protected from responsibility by his action in taking and following the advice of counsel, and by the neglect on the part of plaintiff for so long a time to object to his course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-4\">' The third, fourth, and fifth charges the auditor reserves for further consideration, and in answer to the sixth and ninth points finds, that as to the neglect of the receiver to file an inventory of the assets in his hands, and his neglect to file an account until January, 1881, the testimony \u25a0is conflicting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">In view of this conflict of testimony, and the advice above acknowledged on the part of Mr. Ruddiman, it seems improper to inflict a penalty on this account on the receiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">This surcharge is therefore refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-7\">In answer to the fifth charge, the failure of the receiver to account for the uncollected accounts of P. Hevner &amp; Co., the auditor finds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-8\">\u201cThe accountant testified that a statement, which he identified, and which is appended, marked Exhibit X), was handed him by the book-keeper of the firm at the time he took possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-9\">\u201cThis statement shows the amount of open accounts to be $3,929 61, less payments of $683, leaving a balance due of $3,246 61.

Of these claims, $84 41 are noted in Exhibit E.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">\u201cThe balance of the claims mentioned in Exhibit D are not accounted for in any way by the receiver, except in so far as his statement goes, that he took them all to Fairthorn <em>&amp; </em>Rand. But this statement he does not adhere to, as shown by the testimony in one place, saying that part were in the hands of Fairthorn <em>&amp; </em>Rand, and part were in those of Tener &amp; Oo. It appears, from his accounts, he had dealings with the latter firm. But he gives no account of which claims were placed in their hands, nor what was done with them, nor does he give any corroborating testimony to show what was the status of these debtors. The auditor has prepared a table showing what disposition was made of each claim in Exhibit E.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-11\">\u201cThe duty of a receiver to obtain payments and to keep strict and exact accounts of all his proceedings is a fundamental principle, and a failure so to do will subject him to punishment: See High, \u00a7 38.

He claims to have advanced money to the estate, and that- several of the checks were drawn to repay himself for these advances. The auditor has endeavored to show how this exchange of checks stands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-13\">\u201c In May, 1873, he invested $947 50 in the purchase of a Lehigh six per cent, bond, on which he did receive interest for about two years and six months, when he sold it for $1,100.

The receiver had never, therefore, occasion to be out of pocket over $500 at any time, and allowing this as a large balance, the interest on that sum for six months would be $15.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-6\">\u201cAs the receiver has derived the benefit of interest on the money in his hands, and has loaned it out and taken no interest, he should be charged with interest on this balance of $1,647 98 from January 1, 1871, to the present day. This course is.approved in the following cases: Utica Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Lynch, 11 Paige, 520; Cowdry \u00ab. R. R.. 1 Wood, 337; Drever <em>v. </em>Maudesley, 13 L. J. Ch., 433.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-7\">\u201cHe should also be surcharged with the profit made on the sale of the bond, as asked for in the seventh charge, and the item of deposit in his bank-book of May 8, 1875, $31 81, which he failed to explain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-8\">\u201cThe receiver does not show any good ground for so great an expenditure as $140 for a safe to keep the few papers shown to the auditor. As the receiver incurred this expense without an order of court, and without the advice of counsel, he must depend on the propriety of his conduct for the approval of the expenditure. The auditor finds that a charge of $5 per annum would have been a proper allowance for safe rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-9\">\u2018 \u2018 The allowance for counsel fee is rejected on the ground that he never asked for such an allowance from the court, but a fee of $100 is allowed him for stating this account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-10\">' \u201cThe extra costs of this audit are also imposed on the receiver. The auditor has fixed his fee at the request of counsel at $200 ; of this amount $50 should be imposed on the estate, and the balance on the receiver.

The evidence fails to show that the receiver was guilty of any negligence or want of diligence in collecting the claims which came into his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-12\">It has been repeatedly held that it is the harshest demand that can be made in equity to compel trustees to make Tip a deficiency not owing to their willful neglect: Jackson <em>v. </em>Jackson, 1 Atk., 513; Johnson\u2019s Appeal, 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>S. &amp; R., 317; Neff\u2019s Appeal, 7 P.

At the solicitation of both partners, and with the view of better disposing of the stock on hand, he continued the business for about six months after the dissolution of the firm ; and, when he obtained an order' of court for the sale of all the property, including the patent and machinery, they interposed' and had the order so modified as to require the patent and machinery to be sold together for not less than $10,000. Pursuant to the order of sale, all the property was promptly sold, except the patent and machinery. For those articles, only a small percentage of the sum fixed by the Court, was offered and they were accordingly withdrawn. It is not even alleged that they, could have been sold then or since for anything near the amount named, and the partners made no effort to have the order so modified that a sale could be effected. It is true, the receiver himself might have applied to the court for a rescission or further modification of the order ; but, under the circumstances, it was quite as much their duty as his to make the application. Being thus prevented, by the active interference of the partners, from effecting a sale of the patent and machinery, the receiver was obliged to provide for the safe-keeping of the latter at considerable expense. It is not alleged that the amount paid for storage and insurance was unreasonable. The learned auditor substan-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>tially found that in disposing of the property and stock on hand, the receiver acted in good faith, under the advice of counsel, and that the parties now complaining either urged him to do what he did or acquiesced; and hence, he very properly refused to surcharge him either with the expenses of continuing the business, the amount expended for storage and insurance, or the alleged value of the machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In view of the fact found by the auditor, we think there was error in refusing to allow appellant any compensation for his services as receiver. While he was clearly not entitled to the full amount claimed, it does not appear that anything was done or omitted to be done by him that should work a forfeiture of his entire claim. By far the greater part of the services for which compensation is claimed were either rendered at the instance of the partners or made necessary by their active interference. Objection to the allowance of compensation, therefore, comes with bad grace from them. Taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances, as shown by the auditor\u2019s report, we think appellant is entitled to at least $300 for his services, and that sum is accordingly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The subject of complaint in the sixth specification of error is the surcharge of thirteen uncollected accounts amounting to $894 95, a schedule of which is appended to the auditor\u2019s report. It was the duty of appellant to account for the property and assets that came into his hands as receiver, and if he failed to show that the accounts referred to were uncollectible or worthless, he was properly chargeable with whatever, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, he might have realized therefrom. He therefore undertook to prove that such of the accounts as were available had been collected, and on that subject he was examined by the auditor. Speaking of the accounts, a schedule of which had been furnished by the book-keeper of the firm, he testified in substance that he collected all he could; that he took the accounts to Fairthorn <em>&amp; </em>Rand, a reliable collecting agency, and instructed them to collect all that were available ; that some of the accounts were refused by them as uncollectible ; and, as to those retained by them, they reported to him from time to time, collected all they could, paid over the proceeds, and he charged himself therewith in his account. There appears to have been no conflict of testimony as to these facts, and the only inference that can be fairly drawn from them is that appellant was reasonably diligent in endeavoring to collect the accounts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>came into his hands.- Bnt, even if this were not so, there is nothing by which to determine the valne of the accounts with which he was surcharged. They were old accounts, some of them long past due, and for aught that appears, they were entirely worthless ; and, from the facts reported by the auditor, it may be fairly inferred that such was the fact. The evidence was insufficient to justify the surcharge complained of, and it should therefore be stricken out. The surcharge of interest complained of in the fourth specification is erroneous as to the amount thereof. The account of the receiver shows that the average annual disbursements made by him from 1872 to 1880, exceeded the interest on the fund assumed to be in his hands during that time. In computing the interest with which he should be charged, these disbursements should be taken into account. The fund on which interest is properly chargeable is still further reduced by the allowance of compensation to which he was entitled when it was earned, and that also lessens the item of interest making up the surcharge; but it is unaffected by striking out the surcharge for uncollected accounts, for the reason that no interest appears to have been charged thereon. The result of these corrections in the computation of interest is a reduction of $401 68 in the amount surcharged; and, to that extent, the fourth specification of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">There is nothing in the remaining assignments of error that requires special notice. They are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">After deducting expenses of audit, $230 75, and the sums awarded to creditors, viz: $138 88 and $341 61, the balance found by the Court to be in the hands of appellant, and which was awarded to EL S. Hagert, Esq., attorney for Thomas A.
