A receipt for this amount was annexed to the deed in the usual form. On February 26,' 1875, Thomas Blythe, the grantee, executed two mortgages on the premises, one to the Mechanics\u2019 Building Association for $1,400, and one to Harrison Fairlamb for $500. Both of these mortgages were recorded on March 10, 1875, at 10, A. m.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">On May 4, 1876, Harrison Fairlamb executed and delivered to Dillwyn P.

Paiste executed and delivered an absolute assignment of the $500 mortgage to Joseph J. Taggart. On November 3, 1879, the Mechanics\u2019 Building Association recovered a judgment against Thomas Blythe for $1,720 in a suit upon its riiortgage. On November 29, 1879, on a writ of <em>levari facias </em>issued upon this judgment, the'sheriff sold the property for $50 to the building association, and subsequently executed a deed for the premises to the association. On October 20, 1882, the building association conveyed the premises to John Spencer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-8\">On April 20, 1883, a writ of <em>scire facias </em>was issued on the $500 mortgage, wherein \u201cJoseph J.

The words \u201cassignee of Harrison Fairlamb and Dillwyn P. Paiste\u201d are merely descriptive. Fairlamb parted with all his interest in the mortgage by his assignment to Taggart: Steele <em>v. </em>Ins.

He was not, nor was the plaintiff, the successor in the title of a dead assignor of a thing in action, but a living person who had made an absolute assignment of the mortgage in question several years before suit brought. There was no deceased assignor of this mortgage in the case, and hence the proviso of the act of 1869, which excludes its application where the assignor of the thing or contract in action is dead, is inoperative. As Fairlamb is not a party to the record, and has no interest in the result, and as the policy of law, which would otherwise render him incompetent, has been removed by the act, he is a competent witness. The circumstance that Taggert\u2019s administrator, in bringing his action, styles himself as assignee of Paiste and Fairlamb, does not make either of those persons parties to the record. There is no question as to the validity of the assignment from them to Taggert. The action is brought in the name of Taggert by his administrator, and this is authorized by the act of April 22, 1863: Purdon\u2019s Digest, 485 pl., 130. The reference to Paiste and Fairlamb is mere matter of description. On the question of the piroof offered and rejected, it is only necessary to consider whether the fact propiosed to be piroved was, in any aspiect of the case, a competent fact. It is quite useless to discuss the question whether that one fact alone would be sufficient to charge the purchaser at the sale under the mortgage of the Mechanics\u2019 Building Association, with notice that the Fairlamb mortgage was a piurchase-money mortgage. It may well be that the bare fact of its being a pDurchase-money mortgage would not of itself alone prove notice to anybody. But that is no reason why the fact, when offered in proof, should be excluded. It is certainly essential to the plaintiff\u2019s case. It may be that when his testimony is all\u2018in it may not make out his case, but the Court cannot pre-determine that matter on this one offer. Whether there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>other evidence tobe given we do not know, bnt, o\u00ed course, if this fact is excluded, other evidence would be of no avail. W 3 decide nothing more than that the offered proof was competent testimony. The final effect of the whole testimony is not before us, and cannot be now decided. The j udgment is reversed on these first and second assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">J udgment reversed and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
