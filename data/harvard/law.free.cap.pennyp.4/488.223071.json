The defendants claim that they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the owners of this land under the Statute of Limitations. Whether they have acquired a title under the Statute of Limitations is a question for you to determine under the evidence ; and this may depend largely upon what you find to have been the nature of the entry by Alexander Craig upon the land in controversy here. It is claimed by defendants that he- entered under a gift of Samuel Moorhead\u2019s, as evidenced, in part, at least, by a letter written by Samuel Moorhead to him, and dated in 1828. They claim that he went upon this land in pursuance of the letter and under acts and conduct of Sam uel Moor-head, evincive of a gift on his part to Mr. Craig ; and that since that time he has been in possession of the land, paying the taxes and making improvements, and continuing possession from 1828 down to 1869, the time of his death. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that he and his wife went into possession upon a gift of Samuel Moor-head to his daughter Rebecca ; and they contend that Alexander Craig did not claim to own the land in his own right, but held it in subserviency to the title of Samuel Moorhead, or in recognition of the gift that had been made by Moorhead to his daughter Rebecca. A person may acquire a valid title to land under the Statute of Limitations \u2014 a title, not only upon which such person could defend successfully in an action of ejectment brought against him, but a title upon which he may recover possession. The object of the statute was repose and quietness of title; to prevent litigation after the lapse of a period of twenty-one years, and to make people feel secure in their title and possession, and thus encourage improvements. When a person, however, sets up a title under the Statute of Limitations, it is his duty to establish all the elements necessary to constitute such a title. It must appear that he has been in the actual, visible, distinct, continuous, and adverse possession of the land for a period of twenty-one years \u2014 when the circumstances of the case are such that a period of twenty-one years is the time necessary to confer a title. The quality in the possession of Alexander Craig, which is assailed here, is its want of hostility, as alleged, to the title of Samuel Moorhead, and those claiming under his will. We have already said to you that a claim, in order to become a valid claim, or right, under the statute, must be adverse. That is to say, the party claiming title under the Statute of Limitations must be claiming the land as his own, and not for, or on account of, any other person. He must claim for himself. If he does that, and main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tains his possession for the period of twenty- one years, and especially where he makes improvements and pays the taxes, the law would vest a title in him. But when the possession is not adverse, but in allegiance to the title of a superior, or in recognition of the title of somebody else as the owner, then his possession will not operate to confer title upon him as against the true owner of the land. The law deems it the duty of the owner of land' to make an entry upon it, or to bring an action for its recovery within the period of twenty-one years when in the adverse possession of another, and upon his neglect or failure to do so, his right to recovery will be determined or at an end. He cannot recover after the lapse of that time; and there is no hardship in that, where he knows, or has reason to know, that another person is claiming his land adversely ; but, if holding it under or subject to him, it is otherwise, because he would then have no reason to believe that his title was assailed. But when he sees another in the occupancy of his land, appearing to claim the ownership of it, and continuing to exercise acts of ownership over it for the period o.f twenty-one years, then, unless he moves and asserts his rights within that period, either by making an entry upon the land or by bringing an action of ejectment and recovering it before the statute has closed upon his title, the neglect is his, and his right is lost. What was the nature of the claim that Alexander Craig set up to this land ? Was it adverse to the rights of Samuel Moorhead? Or, in other words, [was Alexander Craig claiming this land for himself ? If so, and he continued his possession \u2014 his adverse possession \u2014 for the period of twenty-one years, from 1828 up to 1853, the time of the death of Samuel Moorhead, he would have a good title under the Statute of Limitations. If, however, his claim was not adverse, but in recognition of the title of Moorhead, or in recognition of the fact that the gift was to his wife, then his possession would not be adverse, and he could not obtain a title under the Statute of Limitations.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">(Fifth assignment.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-7\">February 21, 1882, verdict for the plaintiffs for the undivided two thirds of the premises, with six cents damages and costs, upon which judgment was subsequently entered.

The Supreme Court said, in Campbell \u00ae. Braden, that the real question was not so much what was intended by the donor, as what the donee\u2019s understanding was, what he claimed and did. Did he consider the gift absolute, and under that idea did he hold adversely <em>% </em>This was the law as laid down by th\u00bf Supreme Court, but the court below diverted the attention of the jury from this vital question to. another and different question, namely: Whether Craig had a right to understand that the gift was to him. This was in effect to say to the jury: \u201c Craig may have claimed this land adversely for more than twenty-one years, under the belief that Moorhead had made to him an absolute gift, but such claim and adverse holding would not avail him unless you find from the evidence that he had a right to come to such a conclusion.\u201d The vital question was whether Craig, in point of fact, held adversely to Moor-head\u2019s title from the time of the donation. The court below say that is not the question for the jury, but that the question was whether he had the right to understand that the gift was to him : Campbell \u00ae.

When carefully examined, there is no error in the answer to the third point submitted by the plaintiff in error. Craig should not be permitted, without evidence or reason, to understand the gift was made to him. The language and acts should be such as to satisfy the jury that the conclusion claimed by him was a reasonable one. That is the substance of the answer affirming the point.
