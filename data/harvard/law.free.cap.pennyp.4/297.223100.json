We met Mr. Zimmerman by appointment, I think at Phcenixville. We rode then out together to see some woodland where he was cutting telegraph poles tha 11 was getting from him. On the way out they talked about this bargain of trading the farm for those eight houses in Philadelphia. Mr. Galbraith offered Mr. Zimmerman seven houses in trade for his farm. Mr. Zimmerman refused to take seven, but said he would take eight. Mr. Galbraith agreed to give him the eight houses, seven of which were finished, or about being finished, and one which was to be finished in January. Each were to prepare their own deeds. That was about the substance of the agreement that day.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">Zimmerman .executed a deed to Galbraith for the farm, but it was never delivered. August 29, 1878, Galbraith executed deeds to Zimmerman for the houses. These deeds were subsequently recorded. On the 6th of January, 1879, they were handed over to O\u2019Connel, who gave the following receipt for them :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">\u201cPhiladelphia, <em>January 6, 1878.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-7\">\u201cReceived of William Galbraith deeds of six houses on Garret street, one house on Wilder street, and one house on Vernon street, eight in all, said deeds being a conveyance from William Galbraith and wife to Joshua Zimmerman of the premises therein described, to be delivered to said Joshua Zimmerman by me.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-8\">\u201cP.

He then said it is a bargain, that he was to get eight houses from me, valued at $500 each, subject to ground rents, for his farm, valued at $4,000, which was to be clear of incumbrance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-13\">\u201cOn the 13th of January, 1879, Mr. O\u2019Connel and I came to Norristown with all these deeds to be given to Mr. Zimmerman. We met Mr. Zimmerman on the street. I told him we had been to Rogers' office' and the deed was not there ; and I asked Zimmerman where the deed was, and he said at the Rambo House. I told him that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>* * I had written once or twice for the title to the farm, and that he had not answered my letter, and that if he did not give me the deed at once I would have to enter suit against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\">\u201cMr. O\u2019Connel then offered him all the deeds to the houses and said ' Here are all the deeds and papers.\u2019 He made some excuse and said the deed to the farm was at the Rambo House; we went there and could not find it; he then went into the car and called me in by myself; he said, \u2018Galbraith, I don\u2019t want to give that farm now, I don\u2019t want houses in the city now, and the houses are with you and the farm is with me, and I would rather keep the farm.\u2019 I said, \u2018 Mr. Zimmerman, that won\u2019t do ; we have made a fair and square bargain ; you will be well satisfied, as far as I know,\u2019 and that was the first that he. ever complained to me that I know of. I said when I made a bargain I always lived up to it, and that I had fulfilled my contract with him and that he had not fulfilled his, and that I was determined to have my bargain. He said,- \u2018 I will make it all right with you if you back down from your bargain;\u2019 I told him nothing but my bargain would do anything for me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-7\">The defendant offered to prove that the Galbraith properties in Philadelphia were sold by the sheriff of the city of Philadelphia, in the year, 1879, on process against William Galbraith, and that sheriff\u2019 s deeds therefor were made to the purchaser for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-8\">Refused. Exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-9\">The defendant presented, <em>inter </em>alia, the following point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-10\">\u201cThat if the jury can find, from the evidence, the parol contract as alleged, the measure of damages is the actual expense only of the plaintiff in pursuance of said contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-11\"><em>Answer of the Court. </em>\u2014 This, as stated, the Court decline to affirm. The measure of damages is not the expense to which he was put on account of the contract before it was finally repudiated by Zimmerman, but also the property of which he deprived himself upon the faith of Zimmerman\u2019s promise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-12\">The Court charged the jury, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-13\">\u201cThe true measure of damages in this case, if you find the foregoing facts, is the value of the houses conveyed at the time of the conveyance, that is when the deeds for the same were recorded, so far as the seven houses are concerned, November 8, 1878, and interest upon that amount to this time from that date ; that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>November 8, 1878. To this you will add expenses incurred by the plaintiff before the contract was finally repudiated by Zimmerman, and which were incurred necessarily and reasonably upon the faith of the contract. Clearly in this would be included the cost of the manure which was put upon the place, and the cost of the deeds of conveyance, and the recording of them, and whatever other expenses were properly and necessarily incurred by the plaintiff upon faith of Zimmerman\u2019s promise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">\u2022 Verdict for plaintiff for $4,633 and judgment thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">The defendants thereupon took this writ, assigning for error, <em>inter </em>alia, the refusal of their point as above, the rejection of the evidence offered, and the charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-7\"><em>George W.

For if the plaintiff receives the full value of the houses, it would be equivalent to an order for purchase money, which cannot be done: Meason <em>v. </em>Kaine, 13 P. F. S., 335; 17 P. F. S., 126.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-9\">Damages are such only as the plaintiff suffered in performing his part of contract, and not the value of the land: Bender <em>v. </em>Bender, 1 Wr., 419.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-10\">If such a recovery be allowed, it would be a virtual repeal of the statute, and to allow a recovery for the value of the land would be equivalent to specific performance of the contract: Thompson <em>v. </em>Sheplar, 22 P. F. S., 160.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-11\">The question of the delivery of the deeds should have been left to the jury. The Supreme Court, in the ejectment case, 12 W. N. C., 53, only said that it was a good delivery on Galbraith\u2019s part, but in order to constitute a good delivery, there must be a handing over of the deeds, with intention to part with the title, and an acceptance of the deed by the recipient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-12\">The recording of a deed is not delivery, but evidence of it: Chess \u00bb.

The offer was to prove that they had been sold on- process against Galbraith, which must have been liens previous to the execution of the deeds.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-4\"><em>George N.

The jury have found the contract. That it could not be enforced specifically because not in writing does not prevent the recovery of damages for its breach. The damages were substantial and the jury have so found. The plaintiff was to convey certain houses in the city of Philadelphia, each subject to an incumbrance of $800, in exchange for defendant\u2019 s farm in Montgomery county. The plaintiff conveyed seven houses and placed the deeds on record; the defendant then refused to convey the farm. Under this state of facts, the defendant asked the Court to instruct the jury that \u201cthe measure of damages is the actual expense only of the plaintiff in pursuance of the contract.\u201d The instruction the learned judge refused, saying: \u201cThe measure of damages is not the expense to which he was put on account of the contract before it was finally repudiated by Zimmerman, but also the property of which he deprived himself upon the faith of Zimmerman\u2019s promise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We see no error in this ruling. The plaintiff had performed his part of the contract; he has done what was the equivalent of the payment of the purchase money ; he had conveyed the houses to the defendant and placed the deed on record. That the houses were subsequently sold by the sheriff upon the incumbrances does not affect the case. The defendant knew the title had been conveyed to him ; that the control of the houses had passed from the plaintiff to Mm, and if he chose to allow them to be satisfied in this manner, he has no ground of complaint. If he intended to repudiate the contract \u25a0 after full performance on the part of the plaintiff, he should at least have reconveyed the houses to the plaintiff, and thus have placed him in a position where he could protect himself. He made no such conveyance, nor do I find any evidence that he offered to convey. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the consideration which he had given ; it would be inequitable to confine him to the expenses which he had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u2022 A careful examination of the case fails to disclose any serious errors in the rulings of the Court, and the judgment therefore is</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
