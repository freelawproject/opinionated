While it is not incumbent on the plaintiff in an action of deceit to show affirmatively that he himself is not to blame for the injury complained of, if it appears from the evidence on either side that his own neglect of duty or bad faith towards the-defendant has brought about or materially contributed to bring about the result of which he complains he should not be permitted to recover.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-9\">2. In an action.of deceit founded upon the execution of a release by the defendant of certain lands, bought by plaintiff, from the operation of a deed of trust given to secure the payment of promissory notes, it appeared that at the time of the making of the release, some of the notes were not in the possession of the defendant, and that subsequently in proceedings by the owners to recover upon these notes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>lands were sold. The release recited the sale to the plaintiff as of a prior date. <em>Held </em>that this recital was notice to the plaintiff that the release was executed by the defendant on the faith of information he had received, and in tlie belief not that the sale was then being negotiated or was dependent in any manner on the release, but that it had been fully consummated and the deed accepted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b40-6\">3.

A witness testified that he attended to the survey of the lands in. question, that he was there for two months, became well acquainted with the lauds, learned of actual sales of two thousand acres four miles away, and that what he heard of lands selling surrounding them, and .what the citizens there said that land was worth, was his only source of knowledge. <em>Held </em>that he was competent to testify as to their value.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b40-8\">5. In an action of deceit the plaintiff called a witness who testified that at the time defendant executed the release of lands from a deed of- trust given to secure certain notes, defendant told him that he did not hold all of the notes secured by the deed, and that he, witness, explained the entire .transaction and everything within his knowledge to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was then called and asked whether the witness had told him that the defendant did not own the notes. <em>Held </em>that the testimony was properly admitted.</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b40-9\">Before Mercur, C.

Williams, of Pittsburgh, was the owner of three thousand nine hundred and fifty-four acres of land in Raleigh county, W. Va. Upon this tract of land Williams had, at the date of his purchase, given a deed of trust to Henry L. Gillespie, of Raleigh county, W. Va., to secure $6,000 of the purchase money. The deed recited that Williams was indebted to Charles C. Craft \u201cin the sum of $6,000, for which amount he holds six promissory notes, each dated April 1, 1875, each for the amount of $1,000, \u2018viz: One note at one year, one note at two years, two notes at three years, two notes at four years, said notes to bear interest at six per cent, per annum from date, two to the order of William Williams, and four to his own order, made payable at the Third National Bank.of Pittsburgh.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-13\">The deed further set forth that it was \u201cgiven to secure the payment of the said recited notes, they being given to secure the balance of the unpaid purchase money.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-14\">In 1876, Williams entered into negotiations with Wil: son Phillips to exchange a portion of his lands in West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Virginia for a half interest in a mill property which Phillips owned in Mercer county, Pa. On July 28,1876, Williams, by deed of that date, conveyed to Phillips, four hundred and eighty-four acres of the West Virginia lands, the deed reciting the same as nine hundred and ninety-nine and one half acres.

In some way Mr. Mc-Vay and Mr. Williams came together in the matter. Mr. Williams appeared to be the owner of a large tract of land in Raleigh county, W. Va. \u2014 altogether about four thousand acres, according to the title papers. There was a proposition to trade nearly one thousand- acres of this tract of land owned by Williams for the half interest in the mill property owned by Phillips. The parties were brought together through Mr. McVay, and negotiations were carried on \u2014 the land in West Virginia being examined and found satisfactory, and also the mill property. If you believe the evidence, it was required on both sides, and understood and believed at the time the deeds were exchanged and delivered, that both properties were free from incumbrance. Mr. Phillips obtained his deed and took possession of property, and after that it was sold by proceedings had on a trust deed, which is equivalent in that State to our mortgage in this State. If you will consider that the trust deed that has been talked of is a mortgage, you will probably comprehend it better. It is the usual form in West Virginia and some other States for securing a debt on land. It seems from the recoi'ds and documents in evidence, which are uncontradicted, that prior to this transfer, Mr. Williams, who had bought the land from Mr. Craft, executed a trust deed, or mortgage, securing six notes for $1,000 each, which the trust, deed asserts belonged at the time to Mr. Craft, and describes two of them made to the order of William Williams, and the others to the order of J. C. Williams, himself, and of course indorsed. It seems that on the 21st of August, 1876, Mr. Craft executed a release of that trust deed, or mortgage, and acknowledged' it in the city of Pittsburgh before William F. Robb, a notary, so that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>could go on record in West Virginia, where the mortgage was also of record,' releasing this property bought, or about to be bought, by Phillips from Williams. It turned out afterwards, however, that Mr. Craft was not the owner of all the notes secured by that mortgage at that time ; that he had parted with two of them, and one was held by the Allegheny National Bank and the other by the First National Bank both of this city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-6\">Proceedings were had on the mortgage at the instance of a trustee named therein, on notice by the holders, of the notes, and a bill in equity was filed in the proper court, in that county and State. An order was made to sell the property, and it seems that the property of Mr. Phillips, the plaintiff, with the exception of one hundred and fifty-seven acres, was sold. He claims it was by the wrong or neglect of Mr. Craft, the defendant, that he lost his property. In the outset there is a serious dispute between the parties upon a vital question. The release, on its face, is an assertion by Mr. Craft that he was the owner of those notes, and unless we conclude that parties who do not know the facts are bound to assume that a man asserts a falsehood in a formal paper of this sort, then anybody who had not notice that he was not the owner of the notes had a right to assume, so far as Mr. Craft was concerned, that he was at the time the owner. I take it that it was an assertion to everybody.who had any interest in that land, or the released part of it, by Mr. Craft at the time that he owned the notes or they were paid to him, and he had a right to satisfy the mortgage. Mr. Phillips was entitled to treat that as a truthful assertion, so far as Mr. Craft was concerned, unless he had information to the contrary. He was not entitled to treat it as truthful as to any persons outside who happened to hold these notes ; as to them he would be guilty of negligence, which would cause him to lose his property; but as to Mr. Craft, as we have said, he was not guilty of negligence unless we can say that a man is bound to assume another asserts a falsehood in a formal paper of this sort. In saying this, I do not intend to intimate anything against the intentions \u2014 the really honest intentions \u2014 of Mr. Craft. I know him too well to believe that he would purposely be guilty of a fraud, or aid in a fraud, but when a man puts in the hands of another a paper which asserts impliedly that which is not true, and enables that other one into whose hands he puts the paper to cheat and defraud a third party, we think he is liable for his neglect. Mr. Craft did wrong in executing this paper. He should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>have followed his own first impulses, and his own judgment in regard to the matter, and refused to execute a release at all, or else to have put in what he released from, viz: The notes that he actually held himself. In executing this release he did a wrong to the parties to whom he transferred the notes, and to anybody else who would rely upon this paper. Now comes an important question on which there is evidence on both sides, and as to which you must find the fact. It is claimed, on part of the plaintiff, that neither he nor Mr. McVay, who transacted business for him and Was his agent, had any knowledge or any intimation from Mr. Williams or Mr. Craft, or anybody else, that would lead them to doubt that Mr. Craft owned the notes secured by this trust deed which he was releasing, or that would make them suspect anything else than that that paper was a proper one. On the other hand, Mr. Williams testified that he thinks Mr. Phillips, or his agent, was informed by him that Mr. Craft did not own all these notes. Mr. Craft\u2019s testimony is that he told Williams he did not own the notes. Williams knew that Craft did not own them all, because he knew, if the evidence is to be believed, that Ruff had one of them. If Williams did tell Phillips Craft was not the possessor of all the notes, or if Phillips had notice in any other way of that fact, then he cannot recover \u2014 it is an end of this case. You will see it is a vital question. If you determine it in favor of the defendant, you need not inquire any further ; if in favor of Mr. Phillips, then you go to further inquiries. Did the plaintiff rely upon that release <em>% </em>You must not only find that he did not know that Craft was not the owner of these notes, but you must find that it was on the strength and faith of this release being what it purported to be \u2014 the assertion of Mr. Craft that he had the right to release \u2014 that he parted with his money or property. This release must have been received by him in good faith, without knowledge or notice of any kind that Craft did not own the notes, and in addition he must have parted with his property and taken the conveyance on the strength of it; otherwise he cannot recover. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff. If he did so take it, without any knowledge or notice that Craft did not own the notes, and had no right to release the-lien of the trust deed, and the property was sold from him without any fault of his, then he is damaged by Mr. Craft\u2019s negligent act, and he is entitled to recover. All these questions of fact are for you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3Z\">Verdict for plaintiff for $1,212 72, and judgment there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>on.

His own testimony to that effect was distinct and positive, and he is fully corroborated therein by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>recital in the release, which describes the land with \u201c being the same which J. C. Williams aforesaid sold and conveyed to Wilson Phillips, .of Mercer county, Pa., by his deed, dated July 26, 1876, said deed being recorded in the recorder\u2019s office in Raleigh, Virginia,\u201d etc. This recital was notice to plaintiff that the release was executed by the defendant on the faith of information he had received, and in the belief, not that the sale was then being negotiated, or dependent in any manner on the release, but that it had been fully consummated and the deed accepted nearly a month before. Under these circumstances, was it not the duty of plaintiff to correct the misapprehension of fact under which defendant had evidently executed the release, rather than to permit him to remain in ignorance of the deception that appears to have been practiced on him ? If he had been informed that the negotiation was still pending, that plaintiff refused to accept the deed and -part with the consideration until the release was procured ; <em>non </em>constat. that he would not have objected on the ground that the release had been obtained by misrepresentation. Knowing, as the plaintiff must have known from the face of the release itself, that it was given under a misapprehension of fact \u2014 that it was not executed for the purpose of inducing him to purchase the land \u2014 how could he, in the exercise of good faith, remain silent and afterwards claim that it was given by defendant, and accepted by himself, as an inducement to purchase the land and part with the consideration therefor? His silence, under the circumstances, was virtually an affirmation of the misrepresentation under which he had every reason to believe the release was procured. Th e use of the release as an inducement to purchase is by no means an immaterial fact. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is based mainly on the ground that it was given and accepted as such inducement. After reciting the deed of trust as a lien on the land, and averring that it so remained until plaintiff was about to purchase, the declaration further avers that defendant, \u201c in order that the sale to plaintiff should be made, wrongfully intending to injure plaintiff, executed a written release of said land, and caused the same to be delivered to plaintiff, whereby he was deceived, and on the faith of said release parted with the consideration therefor to said J. S. Williams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">These are not merely formal averments. They are matters of substance, and constitute the most essential part of plaintiff\u2019s case. Some of them, so far, at least, as defendant is concerned, were not sustained by the evidence. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>appears to be nothing in the case to support the averment that defendant executed the release \u201c in order that the sale to plaintiff should be made.\u201d That was, doubtless, the purpose for which Williams procured it and intended to use it, but there is no testimony tending to show that defendant intended it for that purpose. On the contrary, the release itself shows it was executed in the belief that the sale had been consummated several weeks before. With explicit notice of this fact brought home to him, what right had the plaintiff to act on the faith of the release and neglect the duty of making that inquiry which the recital plainly suggested 1 If that inquiry had been made, it, doubtless, would have led to such an understanding of the facts connected with the release as would have avoided the loss that appears to have resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In view of the pleadings and evidence, we think, for reasons above suggested, that- defendant\u2019s first and second points, covered by the third and fourth specifications, should have been affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The remaining assignments of error are not sustained. The testimony complained of in the first and second specifications of error was not incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">With some modification, defendant\u2019s third point might have been affirmed ; but, as presented, there was Ho error in refusing it. Whether Williams \u201cgave plaintiff full information and concealed nothing,\u201d was a question of fact for the jury. The testimony on that point was conflicting and was rightly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
