J., the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-10\">Conrad Friday, the plaintiff, was the owner of a farm, which was purchased by him in April, 1861, containing thirty-one acres, and situated about five miles from Tyrone, on the eastern slope of the Allegheny mountain, in Snyder township, Blair county. At the time of this purchase, the Tyrone and Clearfield railroad had been located. The road was afterwards completed, and ran upon the south-west side of this land for a distance of two thousand seven hundred and forty feet. The land, which was used as a farm, consisted of a long narrow strip on the lower or north-east side of the road. From the natural formation of the land, being on the slope of the mountain, there was an extensive water-shed to the southwest of it, from which, before the railroad was built, the surface-water flowed upon plaintiff\u2019s land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-11\">About the time of the construction of the railroad, a stone culvert, two feet square, was constructed by the railroad company under the road-bed, and the surface-water, flowing down the mountain, was collected in a small artificial -chamber on the upper side of the railroad, and, being conducted along this channel, was discharged through the culvert upon the plaintiff\u2019s land below. After complaints by plaintiff, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, then operating under the charter of the Tyrone and Clearfield Railroad Comyjany, paid to the plaintiff $100, on December 14, 1876, and took from him the following release:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u201cKnow all men by these presents, That, whereas, I, Conrad Friday, of the township of Snyder, in the county of Blair, and State of Pennsylvania, am seized in fee of a tract or piece of land in the township, county, and State aforesaid, situate, lying, and being on east side of the Tyrone and Clearfield railroad; and, whereas, I have made a claim for damages against the Pennsjdvania Railroad Company operating the Tyrone and Clearfield railroad, for and by reason of the overflow of my said lands caused by a culvert under the said Tyrone and Clearfield railroad, about two miles from Yail station, on said railroad, which said culvert discharges the water from an extensive watershed on the west side of the said railroad, the water being collected from said water-shed in a small artificial channel on the west side of said railroad, and being conducted along said channel a considerable distance, and discharged through said culvert upon my said lands, overflowing said lands and damaging the same; and, whereas, it has been agreed between the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and me that said company shall pay me the sum of $100, in full satisfaction for all damages which I have sustained or which I may hereafter sustain for or by reason of the overflow of my lands from the cause aforementioned. Now, I, the said Conrad Friday, in consideration of the sum of one hundred dollars to me in hand paid by the said, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, have remised, released, quit-claimed and forever discharged, and by. these presents do remise, release, quit-claim, and forever discharge, for myself, my heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, the said, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, its successors and assigns, of and from all and all manner of action and actions, cause and causes of action and actions, suits, sum and sums of money, claims, demands, and damages whatsoever, in law, equity, or otherwise, for or by reason of the overflow of my said lands from the cause aforementioned, either at any time before the date of these presents or at any time after the date hereof, this release to operate as a full and complete satisfaction and discharge for all damages that have been heretofore sustained, or that may at any time hereafter be sustained under any circumstances from the cause aforementioned, or for or by reason of any other matter, cause, or thing touching or concerning the same.

In some places, the water lay on the ground, soaked in, and the sun baked the soil hard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">A number of witnesses testified as to the yearly and as to the permanent damage to the crops and the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel presented to the court the following points for charge, which, with the answers thereto, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\"><em>First. </em>The complaint in this action being that the water was discharged through culverts, or box-drains, upon the land of the plaintiff below the railroad to his injury, the remedy is not by a common law action on the case, but the exclusive remedy is that provided by the act of Assembly for the assessment of damages, and this action, therefore, cannot be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\"><em>Answer. </em>We would have no hesitation in affirming this point if the statutory remedy had been adopted by either party at the time the road was laid out and constructed; but the evidence does not show that the method pointed out by the act of Assembly for ascertaining damages was ever invoked. This being the case, we are not now prepared to affirm the point, and therefore reserve it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\"><em>Second. </em>The alleged injury results from the construction of culverts, or box-drains, made for the purpose of draining surface-water accumulating or flowing upon the lands west of the railroad, and the defendant is not liable therefor; the defendants had a right t\u00f3 drain the surface-water frorh the land above their road in order to protect their road-bed, and they are not answerable for damages arising therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-10\"><em>Answer. </em>This point is denied.

The cause of action was the damage done by flooding the plaintiff\u2019s land with water discharged through several drains under the bed of the defendant\u2019s road. The water, which accumulated over a widely spread surface above the road, was formerly discharged through a single artificial channel or culvert upon the plaintiff\u2019s land. This was from the time the road was built, in 1861, and the plaintiff complained frequently of the injury, until 1876, when his claim for damages was settled and a sum of one hundred dollars was paid him and a formal release executed. It was. contended for the defendant that this release was a bar to the present claim, as it included future as well as past damages. The release was given in 1876, and in 1878 the defendant opened several additional small drains under the road bed, so that thereafter water was discharged through all the drains, instead of through the one which was in existence when the release was given. It was contended by the plaintiff, -and held by the court below, that the release operated only upon the claim for damage done by the flow through the culvert, and therefore the plaintiff might recover for flowing water through the other drains. If the words of the release had been confined to the injury done by the water which flowed through the culvert, this contention and ruling would have been correct. But the language of the release is, as it seems to us, much broader than this. The instrument recites that the plaintiff held a claim for damages for discharging water from an extensive water-shed on the west side of the railroad, through a culvert under the road, and that it was agreed between him and the company that he should be paid one hundred dollars in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>full satisfaction for all damages which the plaintiff had sustained, or might thereafter sustain', for or by reason of the overflow of his lands \u201cfrom the cause aforementioned.\u201d Then follow the clauses of the release discharging the defendant from all claim for damages for, or by reason of, the overflow \u201cfrom the cause aforementioned,\u201d either at any time before or after the date of the release, and concluding thus : \u201cThis release to operate a\u2019s a full and complete satisfaction and discharge for all damages that have been heretofore sustained, or that may at any time hereafter be sustained, under any circumstances, from the cause aforementioned, or for or by reason of any other matter, cause, or thing touching or concerning the same.\u201d It is contended that the words \u201c from the cause aforementioned,\u201d limit the injury covered by the release to that which was occasioned by means of the culvert. There is plausibility in the argument, growing out of the collocation and incorrect use of the words in the earlier portion of the reciting clause of the release. In describing the claim for damages, the paper states it as being \u2018 \u2018 for and by reason of the overflow of my said lands <em>caused </em>by a culvert under the said Tyrone and Clearfield railroad,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c. It is certainly not the <em>culvert </em>that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury, but the flowing of water upon his land, and this flooding is the <em>gravamen </em>or immediate and direct occasion of the damage suffered by the plaintiff, as indeed appears by the remainder of the reciting clause. When, therefore, the words \u201cthe cause aforementioned\u201d are repeated in the subsequent parts of the release, we must refer them to the substance of the injury complained of, rather than to the mere channel or vehicle through which the injury was inflicted. Thus read, the instrument means that the damage done to the plaintiff\u2019s land by casting upon it the water gathered from the water-shed above the railroad was liquidated and discharged, both for the past and the future, by the release in question. This view is confirmed by the words \u201cunder any circumstances,\u201d which appear in the concluding or releasing clause. They can only have significance by reading them as covering the flooding of the plaintiff\u2019s land by discharging upon it the water from above the railroad in any manner, under any circumstances. If they are to be limited to a flooding through the culvert, they have no meaning which affects the operation of the instrument as a release. It would read precisely the same if they were omitted. If there were any doubt as to the true meaning of the paper, it would be resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>against the plaintiff, on the principle that the words of a deed or grant, in cases of doubt, are to be construed most strongly against the grantor, but we think there is no doubt about it, and that the legal and necessary interpretation of the instrument is as we have stated it. These being our views of the case, the third and fourth assignments of error are sustained, and on them</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The judgment is reversed</p>\n<judges id=\"A9j\">Trunkey, Steerett, and Clark, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
