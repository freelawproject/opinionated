J., the following facts appeared :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-7\">On March 11, 1872, an execution issued upon a judgment in the court of common pleas of Luzerne county in favor of I. Y. Lynch to the use of R. L. Beecher <em>v. </em>Charles Grambs. By virtue of this execution levy was made on two lots of land, the ownership of which was in the defendant. The lots were described in the levy as being \u201csituated upon the easterly side of Franklin avenue, in the city of Scranton, county of Luzerne, and State of Pennsylvania,\u201d and as being lots numbers three and four \u201cin square or block number three hundr\u00e9d and six (306) upon the plot of Meylert\u2019s addition to the city of Scranton and Green Ridge.\u201d These two lots adjoined each other, were of the same size, each having a two-story plank dwelling-house and barn. These lots, however, were not actually within the corporate limits of the city of Scranton. The borough of Dunmore had a prolongation of narrow width reaching out into and cutting through the territory of the city of Scranton, and terminating in a point on the bank of the Lackawanna river. A. N. Meylert had owned a piece of land covering a portion, if not the whole, of the said prolongation of the borough of Dunmore. As the growth of the city increased, its streets were extended, and ran directly across this prolongation. On the northeasterly side, George Sanderson, many years before, had laid out a town plot and gave it the name of Green Ridge. The trustee for creditors of Meylert caused his land at the place in question to be subdivided, and styled the plot \u201cMeylert\u2019s addition to the-city of Scranton and Green Ridge.\u201d The two lots levied upon, as aforesaid, were on this plot, and were sold by the sheriff on the 6th day of April, 1872. They were bought by Peter Davidson for $4,210..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-8\">The attention of Grambs, the defendant in the execution, was called to the advertisement of the sheriff\u2019s sale. He recognized it as describing his property, and attended the sale. After the sale he endeavored to procure it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>be set aside, because of misdescription, on the ground that the property was in Dunmore borough instead of the city of Scranton as advertised. The rule to set aside the sale was discharged, and on January 25, 1873, the sheriffs deeds for the lots were acknowledged in opon court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-4\">Defendants\u2019 counsel offered in evidence exemplification of the record of judgment No. 1922, October term, 1871, court of common pleas of Luzerne county, in favor of I.

I simply offer the certificate there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-12\">The Court. Judge Streeter, in passing upon this question in Montrose, where an exemplification from Pike county was offered, showing an award of arbitrators in the suit of Charles Biddee <em>v. </em>J. B. Quick, this exemplification was objected to for three reasons, the last of which was that it is not an entire record, and the part omitted was a part of some documents signed by a man by the name of F. A. L. Smith. Judge Streeter admitted the exemplification except as to that part and as to that he sealed a bill. Now we are willing to pursue the same course in this case. We will admit this exemplification, omitting this paper marked exhibit A, and also paper marked exhibit B. That leaves the question open for you to go before the jury and argue that the whole record in this case has not been presented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Mr. Farnham.

We admit it for all it is worth just as you have it made up. We exclude those two papers because they are not part of the case. We will admit it with the exception of those two papers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-11\">Mr. Farnham. I do not wish to be understood that when I made the admission at the request of the court that the two papers referred to by the court would not be taken as part of the record. That I made it absolutely, but only with the understanding that the court admitted the record generally as an exemplification under the certificate of the prothonotary,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-12\">Mr. Smith.

Davidson conveyed the property to John Stuart, who made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors to Charles P. Davidson.

We never submit a question of: fact to a jury unless one witness goes upon the witness stand and swears to one thing, and another witness contradicts him ; where A goes upon the witness-stand and swears the cloth was black, and another witness goes upon the witness-stand and swears it was white, there is a direct contradiction, and in cases of that kind we always submit to the jury the question in dispute. But there is no evidence in this case, remember, contradicting Mr. Louder, or contradicting Mr. Sahm, the chief clerk of the prothonotary, or contradicting the sheriff, Whitaker. Where a witness goes upon the witness-stand and swears positively to a fact, and that fact is not contradicted, it is established in the eyes of the law, and there is nothing to submit to the jury.

'He had, first, the right to go to Lynch and pay it, and at any time within six months thereafter bring an action to recover such excessive interest, with costs ; that is one way he could pursue under the statute of 1858. The other way was to go into court, and, by filing proper affidavits, ask for a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be marked paid, and then, upon taking testimony and bringing home conviction to the mind of the court and the jury that would try the case, that this judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>was based solely upon usury ; that' it was given for excessive interest over and above six per cent., the judgment -would have been marked' of record satisfied, and Lynch -would have held no judgment against this plaintiff, .and hence no execution could have issued. Now, who is to blame because there is a fatal omission in this case ? Mr. Grrambs, as you will see, is a German, and while the law presumes every man understands the law, yet we, as men, fully understand that a man of Grambs\u2019 nationality depends more or less upon some other person to watch his legal rights.

It was the record of the judgment upon which the real estate in controversy was sold. The objection that the certificate of the prothonotary is defective, inasmuch that it does not purport to certify the whole record, might be answered by saying that said certificate is not printed in plaintiff\u2019s paper-book with the record. It appears, however, in the defendants\u2019 book, and from it we learn that the prothonotary certified \u2018 \u2018 that, the above and foregoing is a true and correct copy of the whole record * * * so full and entire as the same now remains of record and on file in said court.\u201d That this was sufficient is settled by Eberts <em>v. </em>Eberts, 5 P. F. S., 120; Improvement Company <em>v. </em>McCreary <em>et </em>al., 8 Id., 304; Reber v. Wright, 18 <em>Id., </em>471. The Court below committed no error in admitting this -paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The objection to the exemplification of the two sheriff\u2019s deeds (see second assignment) is equally void of merit. There was an erasure and interlineation in each deed, the words \u201cBorough of Dunmore\u201d having-apparently been written over an erasure. This affected the description of the property, but the deputy sheriff was called and testified that he made the alterations befor\u00e9 the deeds were acknowledged and without the privity of the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale. This removed the objection to the admissibility of the deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The third and fourth specifications may be considered together. In answer to the defendants\u2019 point, the Court instructed the jury: \u201c That \"under the law and the evidence in the case, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and the verdict must be for the defendants.\u201d The learned judge appears to have been under the impression that, because certain'witnesses were not contradicted upon a particular point, there was nothing for the jury to find. This will appear from an extract from his charge, (see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>fourth specification:) \u201cWhere a witness goes upon the witness stand and swears positively to a fact, and that fact is not contradicted, it is established, and there is nothing to submit to a jury. We say to you, there is nothing in this case for you to pass upon, save only to agree to a verdict in favor of these defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">This is an erroneous statement of the case. There is the question of the credibility of the witness, and this cannot be taken from the jury. It is their duty to credit a witness if there is no good reason to the contrary, but the mere manner of a witness may discredit him with the jury, and his story may be so against all the probabilities of the case that a jury may be justified in not believing him. It is settled law that when a case depends upon oral testimony, such testimony must be submitted to the jury. Authorities are hardly needed for so obvious a proposition. It is sufficient to refer to Lamb <em>v. </em>Irwin, 19 P. F. S., 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The fifth and sixth assignments may be dismissed with the remark that the portion of the charge of the Court contained in the fifth, and the point and answer embraced in the sixth, had no separate bearing upon the case, and the instructions complained of could have done the plaintiff no harm. But for the errors already noticed, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Judgment reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
