We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">The record supports the following facts. Malouin was employed for approximately ten years by the respondent, Oasis Health <em>&amp; </em>Sports Center, Inc., d/b/a The Executive Health &amp; Sports Center (Club). At the time of his injury in 2004, Malouin served the Club as a personal trainer and was also the director of medical outreach.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Unlike the rest of the Club\u2019s personal trainers, who were paid on an hourly basis, Malouin was paid a salary. In addition, both Malouin and the other personal trainers received commissions based on the number of personal training sessions they had with members (clients) of the Club. Club staff, including the personal trainers, were permitted, but not required, to perform personal workouts while they were on duty. Club management suggested or encouraged that some members of the staff, including Malouin, perform personal workouts during their shifts as a way of attracting additional clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">On September 17, 2004, Malouin was scheduled to finish work at 5:00 p.m. After finishing with his last client at approximately 4:00 p.m., he began a personal workout and intermittently filled out payroll sheets. At approximately 4:45 p.m., while using one of the Club\u2019s strength-training machines, Malouin suffered a rupture of his left biceps tendon.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Malouin sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The Board rejected his contention that he suffered a work-related injury under RSA 281-A:2, XI (1999), and denied his motion for reconsideration and rehearing. This appeal followed. Malouin contends that the Board erred in ruling that his injury was excluded from the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d under a 1997 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>amendment to RSA 281-A:2, XI. Alternatively, he contends that his injury is compensable under the savings clause of the amendment. Finally, he argues that the Board\u2019s application of the amendment violated the equal protection guarantee of Part I, Articles 12 and 14 of the New Hampshire Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In denying Malouin\u2019s claim, the Board interpreted provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, RSA chapter 281-A (1999 &amp; Supp. 2006). We will not overturn the Board\u2019s decision except for errors of law, or if we are satisfied by a clear preponderance of the evidence that its decision is unjust or unreasonable. The Board\u2019s findings of fact will not be disturbed if they are supported by competent evidence in the record, upon which the Board\u2019s decision reasonably could have been made. <em>See Appeal of Lorette, </em>154 N.H. 271, 272 (2006); <em>see also </em>RSA 541:13 (2007). Interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo, Lorette, </em>154 N.H. at 272. On questions of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. <em>Appeal of Kraft Foods, </em>147 N.H. 572, 574 (2002). Our goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme. <em>Cloutier v. City of Berlin, </em>154 N.H. 13, 17 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Malouin\u2019s entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits depends upon whether he suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d under RSA 281-A:2, XI. The statute reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201cInjury\u201d or \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as used in and covered by this chapter means accidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment .... Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, \u201cinjury\u201d or \u201cpersonal injury\u201d shall not mean accidental injury, disease, or death resulting from participation in <em>athletic/recreational activities, </em>on or off premises, unless the employee reasonably expected, based on the employer\u2019s instruction or policy, that such participation was a condition of employment or was required for promotion, increased compensation, or continued employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">(Emphasis added.) To determine whether an injury arose \u201cout of and in the course of employment,\u201d a claimant must prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>: \u201c(1) that the injury arose out of employment by demonstrating that it resulted from a risk created by the employment; and (2) that the injury arose in the course of employment by demonstrating that (A) it occurred within the boundaries of time and space created by the terms of employment; and (B) it occurred in the performance of an activity related to employment, which may include a personal activity if reasonably expected and not forbidden, or an activity of mutual benefit to employer and employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><em>Appeal of Estate of Balamotis, </em>141 N.H. 456, 458 (1996) (quoting <em>Murphy v. Town of Atkinson, </em>128 N.H. 641, 645-46 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"A1o\">In its decision, the Board used the above-quoted test and found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiu\">In applying that test to the current facts, there is little doubt that the claimant\u2019s injury arose during the course of his employment. The claimant was performing the same actions that he might expect to demonstrate to a club member who had retained his services as a personal trainer. Sufficient evidence exists to find 'that the injury occurred within the \u201cboundaries of time and space created by the terms of employment,\u201d and that the activity was not only reasonably expected and not forbidden, but was expressly permitted and even encouraged by the employer. Furthermore, the activity had a mutual benefit to both the employer and the employee, in that the activity aided the employee\u2019s knowledge and use of the equipment and increased ' his visibility and exposure to members of the club who might retain his services. Members who hired the personal trainers for various sessions both increased the club\u2019s revenue and the commission paid to the individual employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Neither party has contested these findings. Subsequently, the Board examined the exclusionary language of RSA 281-A:2, XI and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adm\">The first issue that must be addressed is whether the claimant was engaging in athletic/recreational activity and would thus fall into the statutory exclusion. It is difficult to characterize the claimant\u2019s activities at the time as anything but athletic/recreational. Even though such activities were also the business of the employer, that fact does not remove the claimant\u2019s activity from the statutory characterization. And the statute contains no exception for athletic/recreational activities that are directly related to an injured worker\u2019s employment \u25a0 activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Finally, the Board considered whether Malouin fell within the statute\u2019s savings clause (\u201cunless the employee reasonably expected, based on the employer\u2019s instruction or policy, that such participation was a condition of employment or was required for promotion, increased compensation, or continued employment\u201d). The Board ruled that he did not, as \u201c[n]othing indicate[d] that [his] work-out was <em>required </em>for his continued employment, promotion or increased compensation.\u201d Accordingly, the Board denied his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Both parties contest the effect of the last sentence of RSA 281-A:2, XI, which was added to the statute in 1997. <em>See </em>Laws 1997, 163:1. The Club contends that the language is \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d and precludes compensation for Malouin\u2019s injury. Malouin argues that the amendment was \u201cdesigned to exclude injuries that arose out of activities that were not usual, normal or customary with respect to an employee\u2019s work activities.\u201d He contends that the language is ambiguous, and must consequently be construed in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The term \u201cathletic/recreational activities\u201d is not defined in RSA chapter 281-A, nor have we previously construed the term. When the issue raised presents a new question of statutory construction, we begin our analysis with an examination of the statutory language. <em>Appeal of Ann Miles Builder, </em>150 N.H. 315, 318 (2003). Although we give undefined language its plain and ordinary meaning, we must keep in mind the intent of the legislation, which is determined by examining the construction of the statute as a whole, and not simply by examining isolated words and phrases found therein. <em>Id. </em>When a statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute for further indication of legislative intent. <em>Kraft Foods, </em>147 N.H. at 574. Where the statutory language is ambiguous or where more than one reasonable interpretation exists, however, we review legislative history to aid in our analysis. <em>Ann Miles Builder, </em>150 N.H. at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Although the words \u201cathletic\u201d and \u201crecreational\u201d are both susceptible to plain and ordinary meanings, the term \u201cathletic/recreational activities\u201d does not enjoy the same level of clarity. The words \u201cathletic\u201d and \u201crecreational\u201d are separated by a slash. The slash \u201cis inherently ambiguous: its function may be conjunctive ... or disjunctive.\u201d B. GARNER, The Redbook: A Manual on Legal Style \u00a7 1.80, at 43 (2002); <em>see also </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 622 (unabridged ed. 2002) (providing seven definitions for slash symbol, including \u201cor\u201d and \u201cand or\u201d). The pertinent definitions of \u201cactivity\u201d may be read to include an employment or vocational component, as well as a non-vocational component. <em>See </em>WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 22 (\u201can <em>occupation, </em>pursuit, or <em>recreation, </em>in which a person is active ... a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>form, of organized, supervised, and often extracurricular recreation (as athletic games, dramatics, or dancing)\u201d (emphases added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Consequently, we believe that the term \u201cathletie/recreational activities\u201d may reasonably be construed in a variety of ways, including: (1) the conjunctive \u201cathletic and recreational activities,\u201d where the activities in question are both athletic and recreational in nature, to the exclusion of athletic activities that are vocational in nature; and (2) the disjunctive \u201cathletic or recreational activities,\u201d where the activities in question are either athletic or recreational in nature, and could either include or exclude athletic activities that are vocational in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In light of these varied reasonable interpretations, we conclude that the term \u201cathletie/recreational activities\u201d in RSA 281-A:2, XI is ambiguous. <em>See, e.g., Warner v. Clarendon Ins. Co., </em>154 N.H. 331, 334 (2006) (where relevant insurance policy language susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, one providing coverage and the other limiting coverage, policy provision considered ambiguous). Consequently, we look to the legislative history of RSA 281-A:2, XI to aid in our analysis. <em>See Ann Miles Builder, </em>150 N.H. at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Both parties agree that the 1997 statutory amendment was arguably adopted in reaction to our decision in <em>Appeal of Estate of Balamotis. </em>In <em>Balamotis, </em>the decedent was a field service engineer, employed by Digital Equipment Corporation, who played volleyball with his co-workers several times per week during his lunch-hour break. <em>Balamotis, </em>141 N.H. at 457. Although the volleyball game was not among several company-sponsored activities available to employees, it was not forbidden. <em>Id. </em>During one of those lunchtime volleyball games, the decedent died, presumably as a result of an aggravated heart condition. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to the version of RSA 281-A:2, XI in effect at that time, the Board denied compensation to the decedent\u2019s estate, ruling that his death did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. <em>Id. </em>Holding that, in general, on-premises recreational activities conducted during the workday arise out of the employment and that the decedent\u2019s injury arose in the course of his employment, we reversed and remanded the case for a determination of the cause of death. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\"><em>Balamotis </em>informs our examination of the legislative history concerning the 1997 amendment to RSA 281-A:2, XI. That legislative history, however, reveals that the legislature was concerned over the availability of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries sustained while employees participated in a variety of pursuits, occurring both during and after work hours, and both on and off work premises. When the amendment was introduced in the Senate as SB 38, the voiced concern was for \u201cparticipation in athletic activities.\u201d N.H.S. JOUR. 221 (1997). At a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>on SB 38, there were concerns over \u201ca sport or activity,\u201d \u201cactivities not performed in the duties of your job,\u201d \u201csports activities,\u201d and \u201crecreational activity.\u201d Hearing on SB-38 Before the Senate Comm, on Ins. at 1-3 (January 14, 1997). At subcommittee work sessions on SB 38, the \u201cComments and Recommendations\u201d annotations indicate that there were concerns with \u201csporting or exercise activities,\u201d \u201cactivities,\u201d \u201chealthy exercise activities,\u201d \u201cathletic activities,\u201d \u201cfitness programs,\u201d \u201cwellness programs,\u201d and \u201cexercise or physical conditioning activities done for job related fitness, physical conditioning and performance.\u201d SUBCOMMITTEE Work Session Before the House Comm, on Labor, Industrial &amp; Rehabilitative Services at 1-3 (April 3 and 9, 1997) [hereinafter Subcommittee Work Session].</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Much of the legislative history indicates that the legislature intended the 1997 amendment to RSA 281-A:2, XI to apply to those sorts of activities at issue in <em>Balamotis </em>and other earlier cases where the claimant\u2019s injury occurred during a recreational athletic activity separate from the claimant\u2019s usual employment functions. <em>See, e.g., Appeal of Cooper, </em>141 N.H. 184 (1996) (holding injury compensable where chemical company employee was injured playing softball for company softball team). Other parts of the legislative history, however, indicate concerns with purely athletic activity, sports, non-athletic recreational activities, and certain employment-related physical fitness programs or activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Without further examination, we believe the legislative history is inconclusive as to the exact definition intended by the legislature for the term \u201cathletic/recreational activities.\u201d Indeed, the subcommittee work session comments indicate that Representative Maxfield believed that the change proposed by SB 38 was \u201cvague by design.\u201d SUBCOMMITTEE Work Session, <em>supra, </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The Club argues that Malouin\u2019s personal workout \u201ccan only be characterized\u201d as falling within the term \u201cathletic/recreational activities.\u201d Due to the ambiguous nature of the term and the inconclusive legislative history, we assume, without deciding, that for the purpose of this case, Malouin\u2019s workout was an \u201cathletic/recreational activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Given our assumption, above, we turn our attention to the statute\u2019s savings clause, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">unless the employee reasonably expected, based on the employer\u2019s instruction or policy, that such participation was a condition of employment or was required for promotion, increased compensation, or continued employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>RSA 281-A:2, XI. The .Board found that Malouin did not fall within the statute\u2019s savings clause, as \u201c[njothing indicated] that [his] work-out was <em>required </em>for his continued employment, promotion or increased compensation.\u201d Conspicuous by its absence in the Board\u2019s conclusion, however, is any reference to the term \u201ccondition of employment.\u201d If Malouin reasonably expected that participation in his workout was a \u201ccondition of employment,\u201d then the statute would not preclude compensation for his injury. Either the Board neglected the term or equated it with one or more of the follow-on statutory terms. In giving the term effect as we must, we hold that the Board erred in either case. <em>See N.H. Motor Transport Assoc. Employee Benefit Trust v. N.H. Ins. Guaranty </em>Assoc., 154 N.H. 618, 625 (2006) (\u201cWhen construing a statute, we must give effect to all words in a statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">At the subcommittee work sessions on SB 38, Representative Clegg had successfully moved to amend the bill by including \u201ccondition of employment\u201d in the last sentence. SUBCOMMITTEE WORK SESSION, <em>supra </em>at 2-3. Given the varied definitions of the word \u201ccondition,\u201d the term \u201ccondition of employment\u201d might, at first blush, appear to be ambiguous in nature. <em>See </em>WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD New INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 473 (defining \u201ccondition\u201d as, among other things, \u201csomething established or agreed upon as a requisite to the doing or taking effect of something else\u201d or \u201ca mode or state of being\u201d). If we were to use the first definition of \u201ccondition\u201d in our construction of the term \u201ccondition of employment,\u201d the term could refer to those things requisite or mandatory for Malouin to gain employment by the Club. To define \u201ccondition of employment\u201d in that manner within the context of the complete statutory language, however, would be problematic for two reasons. First, we could be in the peculiar position of including, as compensable, injuries resulting from activities undertaken by a claimant prior to his employment. Second, such a construction would render redundant and superfluous the final words of the savings clause (\u201cwas required for ... continued employment\u201d). We would have little tolerance for such results. <em>See Weare Land Use Assoc. v. Town of Weare, </em>153 N.H. 510, 511 (2006) (\u201cThe legislature will not be presumed to pass an act leading to an absurd result.\u201d); <em>N.H. Motor Transport, </em>154 N.H. at 625 (\u2018When construing a statute, we ... presume that the legislature did not enact superfluous or redundant words.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">If, however, we rely upon the second definition of \u201ccondition\u201d in our construction of the term \u201ccondition of employment,\u201d as used in the savings clause, the term would refer to the usual or normal employment environment at the Club. Given our rules of statutory construction, we hold that this latter construction is the only reasonable one for the purpose of maintaining the savings clause as a \u201cclear and exacting statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>standard.\u201d <em>See Kraft Foods, </em>147 N.H. at 575; <em>see also Ann Miles Builder, </em>150 N.H. at 318 (\u201c[W]e must keep in mind the intent of the legislation, which is determined by examining the construction of the statute as a whole, and not simply by examining isolated words and phrases found therein.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\">In addition, this construction is consistent with our decision in <em>Maheux v. Cove-Craft Co., </em>103 N.H. 71 (1960). In <em>Maheux, </em>the claimant suffered permanent injury to his eye while engaged, at the place of his employment during the noon lunch hour, in operating a table saw to manufacture a checkerboard for his own use. <em>Maheux, </em>103 N.H. at 72. While the commissioner of labor had denied the claimant compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, the trial court found that Maheux\u2019s injury was suffered in the course of, and arose out of, his employment, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">the plaintiff had never been told not to use any machine for personal use during the noon hour and that for several months prior to the accident such use had been made by employees who ate their lunch at the factory. The Court further found it was a custom or practice for such employees to use their employer\u2019s machines during the lunch hour for individual projects, and that the defendant employer had through the knowledge of its owner ... and that of a supervisory employee ... notice of this practice or custom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Id. (quotations, ellipses, and brackets omitted). We affirmed the decision of the trial court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">The plaintiff could fairly infer not only that the use which he was making of the employer\u2019s machinery was known to the employer and so a permitted use, but also that under the terms upon which he was hired, it was a use encouraged by the employer as a condition of the employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 75 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Most important, our conclusion is in accordance with \u201cour practice to liberally construe the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, resolving all reasonable doubts in statutory construction in favor of providing the broadest reasonable effect to the statute\u2019s remedial purpose of compensating injured employees,\u201d <em>Appeal of Hypertherm, </em>152 N.H. 21, 24 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Accordingly, we hold that the Board erred as a matter of law in finding that Malouin\u2019s claim failed under the statute\u2019s savings clause. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>need not determine here the absolute parameters for the statutory term \u201ccondition of employment.\u201d Instead, under the facts of this case, we simply conclude that Malouin reasonably expected that the on-premises personal exercise workout of a salaried personal trainer at a health and sports club, conducted during the course of his normal working hours for an employer that both permitted and encouraged its personal trainers to perform such workouts while they were on duty in order to provide a direct benefit to the club by securing additional clients, was encompassed by the term \u201ccondition of employment\u201d for the purpose of RSA 281-A:2, XI. Of course, if the legislature disagrees with our construction of the statutory language, it is free to amend it as it sees fit. <em>See Marceau v. Concord Heritage Life Ins. Co., </em>149 N.H. 216, 221 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Because of our holding that Malouin\u2019s participation in his personal workout was encompassed by the term \u201ccondition of employment\u201d in RSA 281-A:2, XI, we need not address his argument concerning the equal protection guarantee of the New Hampshire Constitution. Instead, we remand this case to the Board for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-7\">Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred; Galway, J., with whom Dalianis, J., joined, dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b576-8\">GALWAY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AebR\">dissenting. \u201cWe are the final arbiter of the meaning of the workers\u2019 compensation statute, and <em>the nature and extent of compensation to the injured employee is governed by the express statutory language </em>and that which can be fairly implied therefrom.\u201d <em>Appeal of Woodmansee, </em>150 N.H. 63, 67 (2003) (emphasis added). In construing a statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to words used, considering the statute as a whole and interpreting it consistent with its purpose. <em>Appeal of Denton, </em>147 N.H. 259, 260 (2001). Any reasonable doubt in construing a workers\u2019 compensation statute is resolved in favor of the injured employee. <em>Appeal of Hypertherm, </em>152 N.H. 21, 24 (2005). In this jurisdiction, statutory words and phrases are interpreted according to their common and approved usage, unless the terms have a technical or otherwise peculiar meaning. <em>Appeal of Town of Hampton Falls, </em>126 N.H. 805, 809 (1985); <em>see also </em>RSA 21:2 (2000). The compensation appeals board\u2019s decision will not be overturned unless it is erroneous as a matter of law or the petitioner has demonstrated that the order is unjust or unreasonable. <em>Appeal of Kraft Foods, </em>147 N.H. 572, 574 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">RSA 281-A:2, XI provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, \u201cinjury\u201d or \u201cpersonal injury\u201d shall not mean accidental injury, disease, or death resulting from participation in athletic/recreational activities, on or off premises, unless the employee reasonably expected, based on the employer\u2019s instruction or policy, that such participation was a condition of employment or was required for promotion, increased compensation, or continued employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The majority concludes that portions of RSA 281-A-.2, XI are ambiguous, and that, even assuming the petitioner was participating in an athletic/recreational activity, he is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation because his personal workouts were a condition of his employment. Because I disagree with both conclusions, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">First, the majority concludes that the phrase \u201cathletic/recreational activities\u201d is ambiguous. \u201cAthletic/recreational activities,\u201d when read in context, however, is not ambiguous. According to the majority, the phrase may be read as covering activities that are both athletic and recreational, to the exclusion of vocational athletic activities, or as covering activities that are athletic or recreational, which could include vocational athletic activities. The statute, however, includes in the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d only those athletic/recreational activities in which the employee, based upon the employer\u2019s instruction or policy, reasonably expects to participate because of his employment. It is immaterial whether the athletic/recreational activities in question are vocational in nature. What is relevant is whether the employee\u2019s participation in the activity was related to his employment on account of his employer\u2019s instruction or policy. Because the majority\u2019s conclusion that RSA 281-A:2, XI is ambiguous relies upon the possibility that vocational athletic activities might be included, and because, under the unambiguous language of the statute, it is irrelevant whether the activities are vocational, I believe the majority incorrectly concludes that the phrase \u201cathletic/recreational activities\u201d is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Next, the majority concludes that the \u201csavings clause\u201d of RSA 281-A.2, XI appears to be ambiguous, but is not. We stated in <em>Kraft Foods, </em>however, that the requirement of RSA 281-A:2, XI, that participation in a particular activity be a \u201ccondition of employment\u201d or be \u201crequired for promotion, increased compensation, or continued employment,\u201d is a \u201cclear and exacting statutory standard.\u201d <em>Kraft Foods, </em>147 N.H. at 574. The majority\u2019s opinion disregards the conclusion in <em>Kraft Foods </em>and concludes that this language, which has not changed since <em>Kraft Foods </em>was decided, is now ambiguous. Because, however, RSA 281-A-.2, XI is not ambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute for further indication of legislative intent, <em>Kraft Foods, </em>147 N.H. at 574, and we need only determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the compensation appeals board (board) correctly applied the statute as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">As to whether the petitioner\u2019s personal workouts were a \u201ccondition of employment,\u201d the majority relies upon differing common definitions of the term \u201ccondition\u201d in concluding that the phrase \u201ccondition of employment\u201d is susceptible of varying interpretations and is thus ambiguous. The phrase \u201ccondition of employment,\u201d however, is one with a peculiar, and specific, legal meaning. <em>See </em>RSA 21:2. Because we have stated that RSA 281-A:2, XI provides a clear and exacting standard, it is to this specific definition we must look, and not to the varied common definitions. A \u201ccondition of employment\u201d is a \u201cqualification or circumstance required for obtaining or keeping a job.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DlCTIONABY 314 (8th ed. 2004). Here, the petitioner testified that the Club did not require him to perform personal workouts while on duty and that he was interviewed for hire based upon what he knew and could teach, rather than upon what he could physically do. Thus, performing personal workouts at the Club was not a qualification or circumstance required for obtaining or keeping his job, and was not, therefore, a condition of his employment. Accordingly, I would conclude that the board did not err in determining that the petitioner\u2019s personal workouts were not a condition of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Additionally, the board determined that the petitioner\u2019s personal workouts were not required for promotion, increased compensation, or continued employment. Because the petitioner does not argue that his personal workouts were required for promotion or continued employment, we need only analyze whether the petitioner reasonably expected, based upon the Club\u2019s instruction or policy, that his personal workouts were required for increased compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Although performing personal workouts was a method that personal trainers could use to attract clients, thereby increasing their commissions, the petitioner, as noted previously, testified that the Club did not require the trainers to perform any personal workouts. Additionally, the petitioner testified that the Club had a policy, which he followed, requiring him to remove the Club-issued shirt identifying him as an employee during any personal workouts. Moreover, according to the petitioner, although he primarily attracted clients through demonstrations of his knowledge, he also did so because he was well known in the community due to having had his own television show for a time, having been a competitive bodybuilder during the 1990s, his degree in exercise science, and his time as a model. Furthermore, the petitioner testified that around the time of his injury he had a \u201ctremendous\u201d client base which required him to work out after the Club had closed, when few people were present, because being approached by clients during the Club\u2019s regular hours was \u201calmost bothersome.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Finally, the petitioner could not point to any data that showed a correlation between his personal workouts and the attraction of new clients. Therefore, the petitioner did not reasonably expect, based upon the Club\u2019s instruction or policy, that his personal workouts were for the purpose of increasing his compensation because they were not done for the purpose of attracting clients to increase his commissions. The board, therefore, correctly determined that the petitioner\u2019s personal workouts were not required for increased compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Because the petitioner\u2019s personal workouts, including the one during which he was hurt, fall under the unambiguous exclusionary language in RSA 281-A:2, XI, the board properly determined that he did not suffer an \u201cinjury\u201d for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation. Because the board did not err as a matter of law, and because the petitioner has not otherwise shown the board\u2019s decision to be unjust or unreasonable, I believe that the board\u2019s decision should be affirmed. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">DALIANIS, J., joins in the dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
