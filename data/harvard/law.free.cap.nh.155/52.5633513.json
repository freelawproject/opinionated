We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The record supports the following. The petitioner and the respondent, Michael Mannion, married in June 1989 and had one child. On January 9, 2004, the petitioner obtained an emergency restraining order against the respondent for an alleged assault that occurred at their home earlier that day. The petitioner filed for divorce based upon irreconcilable differences on January 13, 2004. Following a final hearing held on January 21, 2004, pursuant to RSA chapter 173-B (2004) (Supp. 2006), a finding of abuse was entered by the Derry Family Division against the respondent for the \u201cunprivileged physical conduct\u201d that allegedly occurred on January 9, 2004. On March 22, 2004, the petitioner amended her divorce petition to assert fault-based grounds as a result of a pattern of abusive conduct including the alleged January 9 assault. The final contested divorce hearing occurred on November 3,2005, after which the trial court awarded the respondent a divorce upon the grounds of irreconcilable differences. The court found that there had been \u201cno domestic violence on January 9, 2004 nor was there prior verbal abuse by the Respondent against the Petitioner.\u201d The final decree awarded the respondent sole parental decision-making responsibility and primary parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">On appeal, the petitioner argues that the court erred when it: (1) failed to apply the finding of abuse throughout the divorce and custody proceeding as required by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel; (2) failed to apply RSA 461-A:5, III (Supp. 2006) and awarded sole parental decision-making responsibility to the respondent; and (3) awarded the respondent a divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">\n<em>I. Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">The petitioner first argues that it was legal error for the trial court to find that no assault occurred on January 9, 2004, in light of the final domestic violence order which included a finding to the contrary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Specifically, she argues that res judicata and collateral estoppel barred the trial court from finding that no abuse occurred on January 9. The record reveals, however, that this issue was not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u201cThe general rule in this jurisdiction is that a contemporaneous and specific objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate review.\u201d <em>State v. Winstead, </em>150 N.H. 244, 246 (2003) (quotation omitted). The objection must state \u201cexplicitly the specific ground of objection.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 103(b)(1). \u201cThis requirement, grounded in common sense and judicial economy, affords the trial court an opportunity to correct an error it may have made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u201cThe appealing party bears the burden of demonstrating that it raised its issues before the trial forum.\u201d <em>Tiberghein v. B.R. Jones Roofing Co., </em>151 N.H. 391, 393 (2004). \u201cParties are not entitled to take later advantage of error they could have discovered or chose to ignore at the very moment-when it could have been corrected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">At trial, petitioner\u2019s counsel questioned her about the alleged assault that occurred on January 9,2004. Respondent\u2019s counsel then objected. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">[Respondent\u2019s counsel]: I, I\u2019m going to object. You know, we\u2019ve been through this and we\u2019ll stipulate there\u2019s a finding before the Court. The Court can take judicial notice there\u2019s a finding, you know. No reason to relitigate this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">[Court]: I don\u2019t... think I can. I mean I think I have to accept the fact that there was a finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">[Petitioner\u2019s counsel]: Oh, yes. But it\u2019s also part of our fault grounds so \u2014 I\u2019ll be happy to move on if there\u2019s a stipulation there was abuse and then, and then I\u2019ll make a connection to our fault .grounds and I\u2019ll just move on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">[Respondent\u2019s counsel]: I will only stipulate that Master DalPra made a finding under the statute that this incident arose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">Aside from this discussion regarding the prior finding of abuse, no res judicata or collateral estoppel argument was raised at the final hearing. At no point during the trial did petitioner\u2019s counsel assert that the doctrines required the court to accept the finding of assault by the Derry Family Division and apply the finding when making parental rights and responsibility determinations. Nor did the petitioner, after the trial court issued the divorce decree in which it first made its finding that no abuse had occurred, raise the issue in a motion to reconsider. <em>See LaMontagne Builders v. Bowman Brook Purchase Group, </em>150 N.H. 270, 274 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Because the petitioner neither made \u201ca contemporaneous and specific objection\u201d to the respondent\u2019s testimony nor raised her theory in a motion for reconsideration, the issue is not preserved for our review. <em>Id.; Winstead, </em>150 N.H. at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\n<em>II. RSAW-A-.5, III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The petitioner next argues that, collateral estoppel notwithstanding, the court erred when, despite the prior finding of abuse against the respondent, it awarded sole parental decision-making responsibility under RSA 461-A:5, III to him. Specifically, she argues that the court was required to award sole decision-making power to her because of the prior finding of abuse. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">When determining matters of custody, a trial court\u2019s overriding concern is the best interest of the child. <em>In the Matter of Hampers &amp; Hampers, </em>154 N.H. 275, 281 (2006).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">In doing so, the trial court has wide discretion, and we will not overturn its determination except where there has been an unsustainable exercise of discretion. This means that we review the record only to determine whether it contains an objective basis to sustain the trial court\u2019s discretionary judgment. The trial comb\u2019s determination in any custody case depends to a large extent upon the firsthand assessment of the credibility of witnesses, as well as the character and temperament of the parents, and the findings of the trial court are binding upon this court if supported by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-9\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Pursuant to RSA 461-A:4 (Supp. 2006), the trial court formulated a parenting plan for the parties because communication between them was not possible. The trial court found that the petitioner remained \u201cterrified of the Respondent for events which did not occur and the Respondent [was] mistrustful of the Petitioner since he [had] already been subjected to the criminal justice system as a result of Petitioner\u2019s unfounded allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">When devising a parenting plan relating to decision-making responsibility under RSA 461-A:5, there is a presumption that joint decision-making responsibility is in the best interest of the child unless there has been a finding of abuse. RSA 461-A:5.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">RSA 461-A:5, III provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-13\">Where the court finds that abuse as defined in RSA 173-B:1, I has occurred, the court shall consider such abuse as harmful to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>children and as evidence in determining whether joint decision-making responsibility is appropriate. In such cases, the court shall make orders for the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities that best protect the children or the abused spouse or both. If joint decision-making responsibility is granted despite evidence of abuse, the court shall provide written findings to support the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The trial court, however, found that no abuse had occurred. While the court acknowledged that the Derry Family Division had made such a finding, the statute is not triggered by a finding of <em>another court </em>that abuse has occurred. The statute applies only when \u201cthe court\u201d responsible for allocating parental rights finds that <em>abuse </em>has occurred. It is clear from the context that \u201cthe court\u201d making orders for the allocation of parental rights must be the same court that makes the finding of abuse. Here, that court was the Portsmouth Family Division, which found that no abuse occurred. Accordingly, RSA 461-A:5, III did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The court considered the testimony of the guardian ad litem that the respondent should have sole decision-making responsibility, the parties\u2019 inability to communicate, the behavior of the parties and the child\u2019s stability and normalcy. Because there is evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s determination regarding decision-making responsibility, we cannot say that the court\u2019s exercise of discretion was unsustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\n<em>III. Grounds for Divorce</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Finally, the petitioner argues that the trial court erred by not granting the divorce on fault grounds. She again argues that the court erred by not considering the finding of abuse against the respondent. We disagree. Whether the irremediable breakdown of the marriage was caused by irreconcilable differences or the respondent\u2019s misconduct was a factual question for the trial court. <em>See Hampers, </em>154 N.H. at 279. We will affirm the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence does not support them or they are legally erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">There is no statutory presumption that relates to fault under RSA 458:7 (2004). To obtain a divorce on fault grounds, the petitioner was required to show that: (1) the respondent so treated her as \u201cseriously to injure health or endanger reason\u201d during the marriage, RSA 458:7, V; and (2) the respondent\u2019s behavior was the <em>primary cause </em>of the breakdown of the marriage. <em>See Ebbert v. Ebbert, </em>123 N.H. 252, 254 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Both parties testified that their marriage began to deteriorate around 2003 and that they entered marriage counseling that same year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The trial court found that the alleged \u201cincidents of physical and verbal abuse\u201d did not occur. While the testimony presented by the parties conflicted, the trial judge was in the best position to evaluate the evidence, measure its persuasiveness and assess the credibility of witnesses. <em>In the Matter of Gronvaldt &amp; Gronvaldt, </em>150 N.H. 551, 554 (2004). The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings, and we find no error in its decision to grant the divorce on the ground that irreconcilable differences caused the irremediable breakdown of the marriage. <em>See </em>RSA 458:7-a (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b79-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
