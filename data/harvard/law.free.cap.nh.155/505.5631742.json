We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">Following a competency evaluation performed by James J. Adams, M.D., Chief Forensic Examiner for the New Hampshire Department of Corrections, the defendant was found incompetent to stand trial. After charges were dismissed, he filed a motion for the return of two firearms that had been seized pursuant to his bail order. The State argued that under federal firearms law, the defendant was a \u201cmental defective\u201d as a result of the incompetency finding and, therefore, was prohibited from possessing firearms. The trial court denied the return of the firearms and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">\n<em>I. \u201cMenial Defective\u201d under Federal Firearms Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">The defendant argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law in equating a finding of incompetence to stand trial with an adjudication as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>mental defective under federal law. The State counters that because the defendant was found incompetent to stand trial, he has been \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective\u201d and is, therefore, prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4) (2000), a part of the Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, from owning firearms. <em>See </em>27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.32(a) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo: In the Matter of Liquidation of Home Ins. Co., </em>154 N.H. 472, 479 (2006). The meaning of the phrase \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4) is a question of federal law. <em>Cf. Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 111-12 (1983). In construing the statute, we first examine its language and structure, <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 819 (1974), and interpret it in accordance with federal policy taking into account whatever guidance, if any, state law may offer. <em>United States v. Chamberlain, </em>159 F.3d 656, 658 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Subsection 922(g) lists nine categories of people who may not possess a firearm. \u201cThe principal purpose of the federal gun control legislation ... was to curb crime by keeping firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency.\u201d <em>Huddleston, </em>415 U.S. at 824 (quotation omitted). In enacting these categories, Congress was \u201creaching far and was doing so intentionally.\u201d <em>Dickerson, </em>460 U.S. at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Subsection 922(g)(4) \u2014 the provision at issue in this case \u2014 prohibits possession of a firearm by anyone who \u201chas been adjudicated as a mental defective.\u201d The term \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">A determination by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">(1) Is a danger to himself or to others; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">(2) Lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11(a) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">Because it appears that the trial court ruled as a matter of law that \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective\u201d means the same thing as incompetent to stand trial, we hold that it erred. In a criminal case, a competency determination is a limited inquiry to determine \u201ccompeten[ce] to stand trial\u201d that focuses upon \u201c[w]hether the defendant has a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings against him or her, and sufficient present ability to consult with and assist his or her lawyer on the case with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u201d RSA 135:17, 11(b), III (2005). Under the terms of this statute, competency is not directly related to dangerousness or the ability to contract or manage one\u2019s own affairs\u2014 requirements of the federal definition of \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective.\u201d Therefore, because the trial court impermissibly equated incompetency to stand trial with \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective,\u201d we vacate the trial court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">On remand, the trial court shall determine whether the defendant meets the definition of \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective\u201d either because \u201cas a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition or disease\u201d he is \u201ca danger to himself or others\u201d <em>or </em>he \u201clacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs.\u201d 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>II. Disposition of Property Under RSA 595-A:6</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The defendant also argues that the trial court erred in refusing to return his firearms because there was no evidence before the court that he was statutorily barred from possessing a handgun under federal law. The State argues that the defendant\u2019s firearms are contraband because they are \u201cgoods that are unlawful to possess\u201d under federal law. <em>State v. Cohen, </em>154 N.H. 89, 91 (2006) (quotation, brackets and ellipsis omitted). Therefore, the State contends the firearms should be forfeited under RSA 595~A:6 (2001). We do not resolve this issue, as the matter of whether the defendant\u2019s firearms constitute contraband should be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b529-9\">Duggan, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
