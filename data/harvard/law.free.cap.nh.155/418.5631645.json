The sole issue on appeal is whether the State proved that the defendant operated his vehicle on a \u201cway\u201d as defined by RSA 259:125,1 (Supp. 2006). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">The following facts were adduced at trial. On April 17, 2005, at about 8:50 p.m., Fire Chief Richard Whitney and Firefighter David Dumas were working just outside the fire station on Loudon Road in Concord when Whitney heard the screeching of tires behind him. The car was going \u201cway too fast\u201d and went between Whitney and Dumas. Whitney saw the car, a black Mercedes, head behind the station. Concerned that the car had almost \u201cclipped\u201d them, Whitney instructed Dumas to pull a rescue vehicle out of the station to block the Mercedes from leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">Whitney then walked around to the back of the building and approached the driver who had stopped and gotten out of the vehicle. Whitney asked the defendant why he had been driving so fast. The defendant said that he was sorry and that he was looking for an ATM. The defendant then added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>that he was trying to get directions, thought he was at the 7-11 next door and had not seen Whitney or Dumas. Whitney called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The defendant was charged with reckless driving. Prior to trial, he notified the State pursuant to District Court Rule 1.22 that he \u201cd[id] not waive formal proof that he engaged in reckless operation on a \u201cway\u2019 as defined in RSA 259:125.\u201d At trial, after the State rested its case, the defendant moved to dismiss arguing, in part, that the State had failed to prove that he operated the vehicle on a \u201cway.\u201d The court denied the motion stating, \u201cThe Court\u2019s going to take judicial notice that this is a way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">At the close of the evidence, the court found the defendant not guilty of reckless driving because the State failed to prove that the defendant had acted recklessly. The court, however, found the defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of negligent driving. The defendant then moved to set aside the verdict, arguing that the State had failed to prove that the paved area around the fire station was a \u201cway\u201d as defined by RSA 259:125, I, and that the court erred in taking judicial notice that the paved area is a \u201cway.\u201d The State objected. The court denied the motion stating, \u201cNo reasonable person could conclude that the parking area and access area to the front of the Concord Fire Station fails to meet the definitions of \u201cway\u2019 as established by the legislature. RSA 259:125 and RSA 265:1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">On appeal, the defendant again argues that there was insufficient evidence that he operated on a way, and that the court erred by relying on judicial notice to fill the evidentiary void. We begin with the defendant\u2019s contentions concerning judicial notice, and review the court\u2019s decision to take judicial notice for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Cox, </em>133 N.H. 261, 266 (1990); <em>see State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining \u201cunsustainable exercise of discretion\u201d standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 201(a) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">[a] court may take judicial notice of a fact. A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Rule 201 thus describes two categories of facts that are subject to judicial notice: (1) those that are generally known; and (2) those capable of ready and accurate determination. \u201cIn practice, courts often have difficulty distinguishing between [the two categories].\u201d J. WEINSTEIN &amp; M. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7201.10[1], at 201-19 (J. McLaughlin, ed., 2d ed., 2007). However, the \u201cunderlying theory [of judicial notice] is that there is no need to prove what everyone already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>knows.\u201d C. Douglas, New Hampshire Evidence Manual 59 (4th ed. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The applicable definition of \u201cway\u201d is found in RSA 259:125, I, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">Except as provided in paragraph II, the entire width between the boundary lines of any public highway, street, avenue, road, alley, park or parkway, or any private way laid out under authority of statute, or any such way provided and maintained by a public institution to which state funds are appropriated for public use</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Thus, in order to satisfy RSA 259:125,1, in this case, each of the following requirements must be met: (1) the \u201cway\u201d must be provided by a public institution; (2) it must be maintained by a public institution; and (3) the public institution must be the beneficiary of state funds, appropriated for public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The State argues that it was proper for the trial court to take judicial notice that the paved surface around the fire station is a \u201cway\u201d because the surface is: (1) generally known to be a \u201cway\u201d; and (2) its status as a \u201cway\u201d is capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">With respect to the State\u2019s first argument, even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that it is a matter of general knowledge that the fire department is a \u201cpublic institution\u201d that provides and maintains the paved surface around the fire station, we are not prepared to conclude that it is a matter of general knowledge that the fire department is the recipient of state funds, appropriated for public use. Thus, unlike a typical road, for example, we hold that the paved surface around the fire station is not generally known to meet the definitional elements of a \u201cway.\u201d <em>See State v. Deane, </em>101 N.H. 127, 131 (1957) (court did not err in taking judicial notice that Route 3 in Nashua was a \u201cway\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">With respect to the State\u2019s second argument, the trial court, in taking judicial notice that the surface at issue was a \u201cway,\u201d did not specify which source it believed could provide the requisite \u201caccurate and ready determination\u201d of whether the fire department was the beneficiary of state funds appropriated for public use. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 201(a)(2). Nor did the State, at trial, make any proffer in this regard. On appeal, the State argues that this fact was capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to a line in the State\u2019s budget. In support of this argument, it has attached to its brief a page from the 2006-2007 State of New Hampshire Operating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Budget that has a line item of \u00a781,300 in each year of the biennium for \u201cConcord \u2014 Fire and Municipal Svcs.\u201d The State\u2019s effort comes too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Where, as here, a court takes discretionary judicial notice of a fact because it considers the fact to be \u201ccapable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 201(a)(2), \u201c[t]he judge\u2019s choice of sources of information [is] unlimited.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 201 Reporter\u2019s Notes (citation omitted). However, implicit in this principle is that a choice must be made. This is not to say that the source necessarily must be produced in court; rather, the source simply must be identified. If the court taking the notice does not identify the source upon which it is relying, the ability of a party to dispute it is frustrated, <em>see </em>N.H. R. Ev. 201(e) (party entitled to opportunity to be heard as to propriety of taking judicial notice), and an appellate court cannot meaningfully review whether the trial court resorted to a source \u201cwhose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\u201d because no source was ever named. <em>See </em>J. WEINSTEIN &amp; M. BERGER, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 201.31[4][a], at 201-68 (J. McLaughlin, ed., 2d ed., 2007) (\u201cthe court taking judicial notice should ensure that the record reflects the fact noticed and any sources consulted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Indeed, in the context of identical (or nearly identical) rules of evidence, courts routinely identify the sources upon which their taking of judicial notice is based. <em>See, e.g., Patrolmen\u2019s Benev. Ass\u2019n of City of New York, Inc. v. City of New York, </em>No. 02 Civ. 3976(BSJ)(FM), 2004 WL 3262798, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 2004) (ruling, in context of identical federal rule of evidence, that question of whether agency was recipient of funds from City could be resolved by taking judicial notice of facts in City\u2019s budget); <em>March Madness Athletic Ass\u2019n, L.L.C. v. Netfire, </em>310 F. Supp. 2d 786, 803 n.65 (N.D. Tex 2003); <em>United, States v. Behmanshah, </em>49 Fed. Appx. 372, 376 n.2 (3d Cir. 2002); <em>Kirby v. Field, </em>923 So. 2d 131, 138 n.10 (La. Ct. App. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>925 So.2d 1230 (La. 2006); <em>Doe v. Golden &amp; Walters, P.L.L.C., </em>173 S.W.3d 260, 264-65 (Ky. Ct. App. 2005). Because the trial court did not identify, on the record or in its orders, the budget as the source to which it was referring, we reject the State\u2019s argument. Thus, on the facts of this case, we are unable to conclude that the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion in taking judicial notice that the paved surface around the fire station was a \u201cway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In addition, and assuming <em>arguendo </em>it would be permissible, we decline to use the budget as a source to take judicial notice for the first time on appeal, <em>see </em>N.H. R. Ev. 201(f), because the State has not expressly invoked New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 201(d) by requesting that we do so, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>because we decline to exercise our discretion on matters not presented to the trial court, <em>see </em>N.H. R. Ev. 201(c); <em>compare Deane, </em>101 N.H. at 131 (upholding judicial notice that Route 3 in Nashua is a public way because \u201cthe defendant was aware that the court was taking judicial notice and was not deprived of the opportunity of disputing the matter judicially noticed\u201d), <em>with State v. Duranleau, </em>99 N.H. 30, 32 (1954) (emphasizing the right of the defendant to dispute the taking of judicial notice in the trial court and noting that \u201cfairness in trial practice demands that the opposing party have an opportunity to dispute it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">At oral argument the State also contended that the funding requirement is satisfied because the City of Concord receives funds from the State to tx'ain the City\u2019s firefighters. We decline to consider this argument because it was not raised in the State\u2019s brief. <em>State v. Bader, </em>148 N.H. 265, 277 (2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1014 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Our holdixxg is not inconsistent with <em>State v. Barkus, </em>152 N.H. 701, 710 (2005). There, the State filed a motion <em>in limine, </em>requesting that the court take judicial notice that \u201cInterstate 93 is generally known within the jurisdiction of this court to be such a \u2018public highway or street\u2019 and is capable of ready determination by simply verifying the same through the records that are maintained by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709-10. In connection with the motion, the State made a proffer concerning records at the Department of Transportation that could provide easily obtainable, accurate and ready evidence that 1-93 is a \u201cway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agreed with the State and held that the trial court erred by not taking mandatory judicial notice that 1-93 was a \u201cway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710; <em>see also State v. Day, </em>101 N.H. 289, 290-91 (1958) (proper to take judicial notice that Main Street in Dover is a way). Here, however, the record does not indicate that the State made a similar proffer <em>at trial </em>with respect to the paved area around the fire station. Moreover, <em>Barkus </em>involved mandatory judicial xxotice whereas the instant case involves discretionaxy judicial xiotice. Thus, <em>Barkus </em>is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Before concluding, we address one final issue. The trial court stated, on the record, that it <em>found </em>that the paved surface met the definition of a \u201cway.\u201d To the extent that the trial court engaged in fact finding, the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is squarely before us. To prevail in a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant bears the burden of proving that no rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Drake, </em>155 N.H. 169, 173 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">In arguing that the trial court properly deemed the paved surface around the fire station a \u201cway,\u201d the State points out that Fire Chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Richard Whitney testified that, although it was rare for others to use the area, there were no restrictions on access to it and it was maintained by the employees of the fire department and City of Concord Department of Public Works. Citing RSA 153-A:2, XVIII (Supp. 2006) (defining \u201cpublic agency\u201d to include subdivisions of the state that provide \u201cfirefighting services\u201d), the State then contends that the fire department is a public institution. Thus, the State argues, the surface at issue was provided and maintained by a public institution. Even assuming, without deciding, that the evidence supports the State\u2019s position that the surface was provided and maintained by a public institution, the definition of \u201cway\u201d contains an additional requirement that the Concord Fire Department be an \u201cinstitution to which state funds are appropriated for public use.\u201d We have reviewed the transcript and materials provided to us in connection with this appeal, and do not conclude that any rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the Concord Fire Department was an institution to which state funds are appropriated for public use. <em>Drake, </em>155 N.H. at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
