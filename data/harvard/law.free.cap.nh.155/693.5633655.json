Bleiler, appeals from the order of the Dover District Court <em>(Weaver, </em>J.) upholding the decision of the respondent, the Chief of the Dover Police Department, to revoke the petitioner\u2019s permit to carry a concealed weapon. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">On March 16, 2006, the petitioner went to the office of the Dover City Attorney to discuss his recently filed lawsuit challenging the contracts of several city employees, including the city attorney. During the conversation, the petitioner removed a loaded pistol from his pocket and placed it on the desk as a \u201cprop\u201d in a story he was telling, which involved threats .that allegedly had been made upon him several years ago by organized crime members. The city attorney\u2019s paralegal overheard the conversation and described it as \u201cunusual and heated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">After the petitioner left, the city attorney spoke to his paralegal, who felt worried, particularly after learning that the petitioner had had a loaded weapon in the office. The city attorney called the respondent and informed him about the incident. He also told him that the petitioner planned to attend the next city council meeting about the respondent\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">On March 31, 2006, the respondent notified the petitioner by letter that he had decided to revoke the petitioner\u2019s license to carry a concealed firearm because the petitioner was \u201cnot suitable at this time\u201d to carry a concealed weapon. <em>See </em>RSA 159:6-b (2002). The letter informed the petitioner that \u201c[t]he proper handling of firearms mandates that a weapon not be displayed in any manner which may cause concern to another unless there is justification under New Hampshire law\u201d and that the way that the petitioner handled his weapon in the city attorney\u2019s office was \u201cunsafe and inappropriate.\u201d In addition, the letter explained that the petitioner\u2019s license was being revoked because: (1) he had previously made improper comments about using his firearm, such as \u201cwe let Smith &amp; Wesson handle it\u201d when referring to disputes, and had displayed his weapon in a manner that would cause concern; (2) a local neighborhood association had hired a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>police officer to attend its next meeting because of concern about the petitioner\u2019s past actions and expectations that he would carry a concealed weapon to the meeting; and (3) the petitioner refused to speak to investigators to explain his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The petitioner appealed the revocation of his license to the district court, which affirmed it following a one and one-half day evidentiary hearing. <em>See </em>RSA 159:6-c (2002). The trial court found that the petitioner\u2019s \u201creckless behavior, his lying to others about that behavior, his misleading statements to the press, his manner and conduct, and his failure to cooperate in the police investigation as to his suitability to retain his license to carry a concealed weapon [constituted] just cause to revoke his license.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 159:6-b. The petitioner does not challenge these factual findings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The district court also ruled that the statute under which the petitioner\u2019s license had been revoked, RSA 159:6-b, did not impinge upon his right to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Federal Constitution and Part I, Article 2-a of the State Constitution, and was not void for vagueness. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">We first address whether to dismiss this appeal as moot. The respondent argues that the appeal is moot because the petitioner\u2019s permit to carry a concealed weapon expired as of January 2007, and he has not reapplied for one. The doctrine of mootness is designed to avoid deciding issues that have become academic. <em>Sullivan v. Town of Hampton Bd. of Selectman, </em>153 N.H. 690, 692 (2006). However, the question of mootness is not subject to rigid rules; it is regarded as one of convenience and discretion. <em>Id. </em>A decision upon the merits may be justified where there is a pressing public interest involved, or future litigation may be avoided. <em>Id. </em>We find sufficient public interest in the outcome of this controversy to justify an exception to the doctrine of mootness. <em>Id. </em>at 692-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">We next address whether to dismiss this appeal because the petitioner waived all of his appeal arguments by not including them as questions in his notice of appeal. <em>See </em>SUP. Ct. R. 16(3)(b). The respondent observes that the questions in the petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal concern RSA 159:6-c, not RSA 159:6-b, upon which his brief focuses. We accept the petitioner\u2019s assertion that the reference to RSA 159:6-c was a typographical error and conclude that he has not waived his arguments concerning RSA 159:6-b. We agree with the respondent, however, that the petitioner has waived all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>issues that he raised in his notice of appeal, but did not brief. <em>See In re Estate of King, </em>149 N.H. 226, 230 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The petitioner first argues that RSA 159:6-b violates his state constitutional right to substantive due process because it impairs his right under the State Constitution to keep and bear arms. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, arts. 2-a, 12. The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Gonya v. Comm\u2019r, N.H. Ins. Dep\u2019t, </em>153 N.H. 521, 524 (2006). \u201cIn reviewing a statute, we presume it to be constitutional and we will not declare it invalid except upon inescapable grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the petitioner argues only under the State Constitution, we base our decision upon it alone, citing federal cases for guidance only. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Part I, Article 2-a of the State Constitution provides: \u201cAll persons have the right to keep and bear arms in defense of themselves, their families, their property and the state.\u201d This provision was added to the constitution in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">RSA 159:6-b is part of a statutory scheme that requires individuals to obtain permits to carry loaded, concealed weapons. <em>See </em>RSA 159:4 (2002). RSA 159:4 makes it a crime for an individual to carry a loaded pistol or revolver in any vehicle or \u201cconcealed upon his person, except in his dwelling, house or place of business, without a valid license.\u201d In addition to exempting law enforcement personnel, court security and members of the armed services, the statutory scheme exempts the regular and ordinary transport of pistols or revolvers as merchandise from this license requirement. <em>See </em>RSA 159:5 (2002). New Hampshire has required some form of license to carry a concealed weapon since at least 1923. <em>See </em>Laws 1923,118:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Licenses are issued pursuant to RSA 159:6 (Supp. 2006), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">The selectmen of a town or the mayor or chief of police of a city or some full-time police officer ..., upon application of any resident of such town or city, or the director of state police,... upon application of a nonresident, shall issue a license to such applicant authorizing the applicant to carry a loaded pistol or revolver ..., if it appears that the applicant has good reason to fear injury to the applicant\u2019s person or property or has any proper purpose, and that the applicant is a suitable person to be licensed. Hunting, target shooting, or self-defense shall be considered a proper purpose. The license shall be valid for all allowable purposes regardless of the purpose for which it was originally issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Licenses to carry concealed weapons may be \u201csuspended or revoked for just cause, provided written notice of the suspension or revocation and the reason therefore is given to the licensee.\u201d RSA 159:6-b, I. If requested, the licensee is entitled to a post-suspension or post-revocation hearing in front of the issuing authority. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAny person whose application for a license to carry a loaded pistol or revolver has been denied ... or whose license to carry a loaded pistol or revolver has been suspended or revoked\u201d may also petition the district court for a hearing upon whether he or she is entitled to a license. RSA 159:6-c. \u201c[T]he statute contemplates that the district court ... hear evidence and make its own determination [upon] whether the petitioner is entitled to a license.\u201d <em>Kozerski v. Sleeve, </em>121 N.H. 469, 472 (1981) (quotation omitted). Additionally, \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a violation of the licensing sections of [RSA chapter 159 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2006)] by a licensing entity may petition the superior court of the county in which the alleged violation occurred for injunctive relief.\u201d RSA 159:6-e (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The petitioner argues that because the state constitutional right to bear arms is a fundamental right, we must review the constitutionality of RSA 159:6-b under strict scrutiny. The respondent and <em>amicus </em>counter that the right at issue is the right to carry a concealed weapon, which is not a fundamental right, and that, therefore, we may review the statute\u2019s constitutionality under rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">We agree with the petitioner that the respondent and <em>amicus </em>define the right at issue too narrowly. We define the question before us as whether revoking the petitioner\u2019s license to carry a concealed weapon for just cause impermissibly infringed upon his state constitutional right to bear arms. We assume, without deciding, that the state constitutional right to bear arms is a fundamental right. Because of this assumption, we need not address the petitioner\u2019s alternative argument that requiring him to carry a loaded weapon in plain view subjected him to \u201cstigma\u201d and thus deprived him of a constitutionally protected liberty interest. <em>See Short v. School Admin. Unit 16, </em>136 N.H. 76, 83-84 (1992); <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 572-74 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">We reject the petitioner\u2019s assertion, however, that if the state constitutional right to bear arms is fundamental, we must apply strict scrutiny to our review of RSA 159:6-b. While \u201cgenerally, when governmental action impinges upon a fundamental right, such matters are entitled to review under strict judicial scrutiny,\u201d <em>Akins v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>154 N.H. 67, 71 (2006), \u201c[n]ot every restriction of a right classified as fundamental incurs \u2018strict\u2019 scrutiny.\u201d Fallon, <em>Some Confusions About Dtie Process, Judicial Review, and Constitutional Remedies, </em>93 COLUM. L. Rev. 309, 315 (1993); <em>cf. Estate of Cargill v. City of Rochester, </em>119 N.H. 661, 666-67 (1979) (citing cases and noting that merely because statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>touches upon a right that may be fundamental for some purposes does not mean that it must be evaluated under strict scrutiny for equal protection purposes), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>445 U.S. 921 (1980). \u201cFor example,\u201d in the federal arena, \u201cthe fundamental right to marry has always tolerated reasonable or de minimis burdens.\u201d Fallon, <em>supra </em>at 315. The United States Supreme Court also has engaged in an \u201cad hoc balancing\u201d of the individual\u2019s liberty interest against the \u201cdemands of an organized society\u201d in cases involving the fundamental right to travel, for instance. <em>Id. </em>at 317 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Additionally, the United States Supreme Court has explained the need to apply a test other than strict scrutiny in the context of an election law challenge as follows: \u201c[T]o subject every voting regulation to strict scrutiny and to require that the regulation be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest ... would tie the hands of States seeking to assure that elections are operated equitably and efficiently.\u201d <em>Burdick v. Takushi, </em>504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992). Thus, even though certain voting rights \u201care fundamental, not all restrictions imposed by the States ... impose constitutionally suspect burdens on voters\u2019 rights ____\u201d <em>Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 788 (1983). Therefore, the United States Supreme Court applies a balancing test that \u201cweights] the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights ... that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule, taking into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Burdick, </em>504 U.S. at 434 (quotations omitted). Under this test, \u201cwhen the election law at issue subjects the plaintiff\u2019s rights to severe restrictions, the regulation must withstand strict scrutiny to be constitutional. When the election law imposes only reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions upon the plaintiff\u2019s rights, then the State\u2019s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>154 N.H. at 72 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">We adopted this balancing test in <em>Akins, </em>154 N.H. at 72, and <em>Libertarian Party New Hampshire v. State, </em>154 N.H. 376, 381 (2006). In those cases, we balanced the legislature\u2019s right to regulate elections pursuant to Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the Federal Constitution with the citizens\u2019 right to vote and be elected. We explained: \u201cSimply because the [rights] under Part I, Article 11 [are] fundamental does not mean that any impingement upon [them] triggers strict scrutiny.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>154 N.H. at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">We have also declined to apply strict scrutiny in the context of other fundamental rights. In the zoning context, for instance, we have explained that \u201c[although property ownership rights are fundamental, zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ordinances regulating the use of property do not receive strict scrutiny analysis, because [they] regulate property for the public good and balance the use and enjoyment of property of some residents against the use and enjoyment of other residents.\u201d <em>Asselin v. Town of Conway, </em>135 N.H. 576, 578 (1992) (quotation omitted); <em>see Boulders at Strafford v. Town of Strafford, </em>153 N.H. 633, 636 (2006) (applying rational basis review to substantive due process challenge to zoning ordinance).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">With respect to substantive due process challenges to gun control legislation, such as RSA 159:6-b, \u201c[n]o state\u2019s judiciary applies a heightened level of scrutiny, much less strict scrutiny.\u201d Winkler, <em>The Reasonable Right to Bear Arms, </em>17 STAN. L. &amp; POL\u2019Y Rev. 597, 600 (2006). \u201c[S]tate courts universally reject strict scrutiny or any heightened level of review in favor of a standard that requires weapons laws to be only \u2018reasonable regulations\u2019 on the [right to bear arms].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599; <em>see State v. Cole, </em>665 N.W.2d 328, 336-37 (Wis. 2003) (citing cases); <em>see also </em>Monks, <em>The End of Gun Control or Protection Against Tyranny ?: The Impact of the New Wisconsin Constitutional Right to Bear Arms on State Gun Control Laws, </em>2001 WlS. L. Rev. 249, 259 (\u201cWhen a court reviews a gun control statute, the test is almost always whether the gun restriction is a \u2018reasonable regulation\u2019 under the state\u2019s police power.\u201d). \u201cEven courts that have found [the right to bear arms] to be fundamental have used a reasonableness standard.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>665 N.W.2d at 337; <em>see also Robertson v. City and County of Denver, </em>874 P.2d 325, 329-30 (Colo. 1994) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">We agree with every other state court that has considered the issue: strict scrutiny is not the proper test to apply when evaluating whether gun control legislation, such as RSA 159:6-b, violates substantive due process. Winkler, <em>supra </em>at 600. \u201cStrict scrutiny, with its presumption of unconstitutionality, is a standard of review traditionally used in areas where courts deem any burdensome legislation to be \u2018immediately suspect.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599. Gun control legislation, by contrast, \u201cwith its legislative motivation of public safety ... is not inherently suspicious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T'Jhere has been a long history of weapons regulations,\u201d which suggests that \u201csuch laws are not inherently invidious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Moreover, as numerous courts in other states have recognized with respect to their state constitutional right to bear arms, <em>see id. </em>at 602-03, the New Hampshire state constitutional right to bear arms \u201cis not absolute and may be subject to restriction and regulation.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>132 N.H. 756, 758 (1990); <em>see Arnold v. Cleveland, </em>616 N.E.2d 163, 172 (Ohio 1993). \u201c[S]ome regulation of firearms is necessary\u201d because of the \u201cobvious public dangers of guns.\u201d Winkler, <em>supra </em>at 600. Such regulation is a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>subject of the legislature\u2019s police power. <em>See Soucy v. State, </em>127 N.H. 451, 454 (1985); <em>see also State v. White, </em>64 N.H. 48, 50 (1886); <em>Carter v. Craig, </em>77 N.H. 200, 205 (1914) (general court\u2019s power to make \u201creasonable and wholesome laws\u201d gives it the power to impose \u201creasonable and wholesome restrictions\u201d on the rights of individuals).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In light of the compelling state interest in protecting the public from the hazards involved with guns, <em>see Cole, </em>665 N.W.2d at 344, we agree with numerous courts from other jurisdictions that the reasonableness test is the correct test for evaluating a substantive due process challenge to gun control legislation. <em>See </em>Monks, <em>supra </em>at 259. This test analyzes whether the statute at issue is a \u201creasonable\u201d limitation upon the right to bear arms. <em>Cole, </em>665 N.W.2d at 338. Such a test differs from traditional rational basis because it \u201cfocuses on the balance of the interests at stake, rather than merely on whether any conceivable rationale exists under which the legislature may have concluded the law could promote the public welfare.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Applying this test, we now examine whether, in balancing the legislature\u2019s authority to enact legislation for the health, safety and welfare of the public, RSA 159:6-b goes too far and unreasonably impinges upon the constitutional right to bear arms. We conclude that RSA 159:6-b is a reasonable limitation upon the state constitutional right to bear arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">RSA 159:6-b does not prohibit carrying weapons; it merely regulates the manner of carrying them. <em>See Cole, </em>665 N.W.2d at 343; <em>see also Klein v. Leis, </em>795 N.E.2d 633, 638 (Ohio 2003). Moreover, \u201c[t]he statute has a reasonable purpose \u2014 it protects the public by preventing an individual from having on hand a [loaded] deadly weapon of which the public is unaware.\u201d <em>Dano v. Collins, </em>802 P.2d 1021, 1023 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1990), <em>rev. dismissed, </em>809 P.2d 960 (Ariz. 1991). Additionally, the statute uses a reasonable means to achieve this purpose. Even without a license, individuals retain the ability to keep weapons in their homes or businesses, and to carry weapons in plain view. <em>See </em>RSA 159:4. While it \u201cmight be argued that [RSA 159:6-b] impede[s] the ... self-defense [aspect of the constitutional right to bear arms], [t]his argument is countered by two considerations: the danger of [the] widespread presence of [concealed] weapons in public places and police protection against attack in these places.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>665 N.W.2d at 344 (quotation omitted). In view of the benefit to public safety and in light of the lack of restriction on possession of loaded weapons in one\u2019s home or business, we conclude that RSA 159:6-b does not \u201csubvert unduly\u201d the self-defense aspect of the state constitutional right to bear arms. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see also Dano, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>802 P.2d at 1022 (\u201cThe right to bear arms in self-defense is not impaired by requiring individuals to carry weapons openly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Therefore, we hold that, given the compelling state interest in public safety, RSA 159:6-b is a reasonable regulation of the time, place and manner in which the state constitutional right to bear arms may be exercised. <em>See Cole, </em>665 N.W.2d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The petitioner next asserts that RSA 159:6-b is void for vagueness both facially and as applied under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution and Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution. He argues that the phrase \u201cjust cause\u201d as used in RSA 159:6-b is undefined and does not sufficiently limit the discretion of the licensing authority. We first analyze the petitioner\u2019s claim under the State Constitution, <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231 (1983), citing federal authority for guidance only, <em>id. </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Vagueness may invalidate a statute for either of two independent grounds. <em>See City of Chicago v. Morales, </em>527 U.S. 41, 56 (1999). \u201cFirst, it may fail to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits; second, it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Id.; see State v. Porelle, </em>149 N.H. 420, 423 (2003). A statute that fails under either test violates the constitutional guarantee of procedural due process. <em>See State v. Albers, </em>113 N.H. 132, 133-34 (1973). \u201cA party challenging a statute as void for vagueness bears a heavy burden of proof in view of the strong presumption favoring a statute\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d <em>State v. MacElman, </em>154 N.H. 304, 307 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The \u201cprohibition against excessive vagueness does not invalidate every statute which a reviewing court believes could have been drafted with greater precision. Many statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for in most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties.\u201d <em>Rose v. Locke, </em>423 U.S. 48, 49-50 (1975) (quotation and brackets omitted). Nor is mathematical certainty required. <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 110 (1972); <em>see Porelle, </em>149 N.H. at 423. Moreover, the specificity required by due process \u201cneed not be contained in the statute itself, but rather, the statute in question may be read in the context of related statutes, prior decisions, or generally accepted usage.\u201d <em>In re Justin D., </em>144 N.H. 450, 453-54 (1999). We note that, while the analysis is different under state and federal law, neither party has argued that our analysis should be different when a licensing statute, and not a criminal statute, is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The respondent and the <em>amicus </em>assert that the petitioner may not bring a facial challenge to RSA 159:6-b because it does not implicate a fundamental right. See <em>MacElman, </em>154 N.H. at 307; <em>cf. Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 467 (1991) (because \u201cFirst Amendment freedoms are not infringed by [the criminal statute at issue],... the vagueness claim must be evaluated as the statute is applied\u201d). We assume, without deciding, that the petitioner may challenge RSA 159:6-b facially under both the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">We address the petitioner\u2019s facial challenge first. <em>Cf. Boulders at Strafford, </em>153 N.H. at 641-42 (discussing equal protection). <em>But see Hoffman Estates v. Flipside Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. 489, 497, 500 (1982) (where statute does not \u201creach constitutionally protected conduct,\u201d challenger must show that it is vague in all of its applications; if statute is sufficiently clear as applied to party challenging it, it is not facially invalid). The petitioner asserts that the phrase \u201cjust cause\u201d in RSA 159:6-b is vague because it fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand the conduct it proscribes and because it allows for arbitrary enforcement. He argues that RSA 159:6-b is invalid because it \u201cprovides absolutely no guidance whatsoever to permit-holders apprising them of what conduct might lead the issuing authority to <em>revoke </em>a permit.\u201d Additionally, he contends that the phrase \u201cjust cause\u201d is \u201ccompletely without objective standards and rel[ies] entirely on the opinion of the issuing authority or reviewing court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">We interpret the phrase \u201cjust cause,\u201d however, in the context of the entire statutory scheme. <em>See In re Justin D., </em>144 N.H. at 453-54. In context, \u201cjust cause\u201d refers to a licensee\u2019s use of a weapon for an improper purpose or to the licensee\u2019s status as an unsuitable person. <em>See </em>RSA 159:6. By statute, hunting, target shooting and self-defense are proper purposes. <em>Id. </em>RSA 159:3 (2002) and RSA 159:3-a (2002) provide that certain convicted felons are unsuitable for the purposes of obtaining a license to carry a concealed weapon. An individual may also be unsuitable if he or she has a \u201csignificant and unexplained arrest history.\u201d <em>Silverstein v. Town of Alexandria, </em>150 N.H. 679, 683 (2004). In conjunction with other provisions in the same statutory scheme and our prior decisions, therefore, the phrase \u201cjust cause\u201d adequately warns licensees that their licenses may be revoked if they use their weapons for improper purposes or are unsuitable to have such licenses. <em>See Lillios v. Justices of the New Hampshire Dist. Court, </em>735 F. Supp. 43, 47 (D.N.H. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertions, \u201c[a] law is not necessarily vague because it does not precisely apprise [an individual] of the standards by which [a permitting authority] will make its decision.\u201d <em>Webster v. Town of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>Candia, </em>146 N.H. 430, 435 (2001) (quotations and brackets omitted). In <em>Derry Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. v. Town of Londonderry, </em>121 N.H. 501, 505 (1981), for instance, we upheld a dump ordinance that permitted town selectmen to issue a license for \u201cgood cause and sufficient reason.\u201d We interpreted this phrase in light of the purpose of the ordinance, which was to establish provisions for the orderly and sanitary disposal of garbage. <em>Derry Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc., </em>121 N.H. at 505. In context, therefore, we held that \u201cgood cause and sufficient reason\u201d meant any circumstances that furthered those goals. <em>Id.; see also Dow v. Town of Effingham, </em>148 N.H. 121, 132-33 (2002) (race track ordinance is not void for vagueness because it does not specify the exact standards required by the selectmen in assessing a request for a race track permit; it is implied that the selectmen will exercise their discretion consistent with the purpose of the race track ordinance).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The plain language of RSA 159:6-b, read in conjunction with other provisions in the same statutory scheme, as well as our prior decisions, gives notice to a person of ordinary intelligence of the conduct that may result in the revocation of his or her license to carry loaded weapons concealed. <em>See MacElman, </em>154 N.H. at 308; <em>Lillios, </em>735 F. Supp. at 47. In light of the statutory limitations on the phrase \u201cproper purpose\u201d and the judicial narrowing of the term \u201csuitable person,\u201d discussed above, we conclude that RSA 159:6-b \u201cprovides such minimal guidelines ... that the degree of judgment [it requires] is acceptable.\u201d <em>MacElman, </em>154 N.H. at 309; <em>see Iverson v. City of St. Paul, </em>240 F. Supp. 2d 1035, 1037 (D. Minn.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>74 Fed. Appx. 676 (8th Cir. 2003). Accordingly, we hold that RSA 159:6-b is not unconstitutionally vague on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We next address the petitioner\u2019s as-applied challenge. To determine whether a statute is vague as applied to the petitioner, we examine whether it gave him a \u201creasonable opportunity to know that [his] particular conduct was proscribed by the statute.\u201d <em>MacElman, </em>154 N.H. at 309. The petitioner, who knew the proper procedure for handling a loaded weapon and failed to follow it, had a reasonable opportunity to know that using a loaded weapon in a public place to tell a story about organized crime threats was not a proper purpose and could result in the revocation of his license to carry a concealed weapon. We hold, therefore, that RSA 159:6-b was not impermissibly vague as applied to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">As the Federal Constitution offers the petitioner no greater protection than does the State Constitution under these circumstances, <em>see Porelle, </em>149 N.H. at 423, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>For all of the above reasons, therefore, we decline the petitioner\u2019s invitation to declare RSA 159:6-b unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b726-5\">Duggan, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
