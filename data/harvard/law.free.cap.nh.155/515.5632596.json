The question before the court was whether Carter\u2019s Concord General policy provided coverage for injuries she sustained when her feet were run over by a wagon pulled by a tractor at a hayride. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">It. is undisputed that in October 2003, Carter was at Appleview Orchard for a \u201chaunted hayride\u201d event where her feet were run over by a wagon pulled by a tractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">Photographs of the Appleview wagon submitted to the trial court and as part of the record on appeal show that it has neither brake lights nor fenders. The record contains no information, other than the photographs, concerning the mechanism by which the wagon was hitched to the tractor or whether the wagon was capable of being hitched to other kinds of motor vehicles. Carter advises us that those photographs \u201cconstitute!] all the available evidence with respect to this [wagon] that could be submitted.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>In its brief, Concord General refers to the Appleview wagon as a \u201cfarm wagon,\u201d and while Carter does not dispute the facts set out in Concord General\u2019s brief, she \u201cdoes dispute the labels or terms used to describe the object that ran over [her] feet,\u201d noting that \u201c[t]he nature of the parties\u2019 dispute with respect to the term used to describe the object that ran over [her] feet will be apparent from the body of the parties\u2019 Arguments.\u201d In the trial court, Carter disputed \u201cthe characterization of the [wagon] that ran over her feet as a \u2018farm trailer\u2019 to the extent that this characterization by [Concord General] is meant to indicate that [it] cannot be pulled by an automobile, pick-up or van and/or it is mainly designed for use off public roads.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">After her accident, Carter made claims against both the tractor operator\u2019s liability policy and her own Concord General personal auto insurance policy. Both insurers denied coverage; thereafter, Carter filed a petition for a declaratory judgment to determine coverage. <em>See </em>RSA 491:22 (1997). The tractor operator\u2019s liability insurer prevailed on its motion for summary judgment, and that ruling is not at issue in this appeal. The trial court also ruled, however, that Carter was entitled to both uninsured motorists coverage and medical payments coverage under her policy with Concord General. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">When we review a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Tech-Built 153 v. Va. Surety Co., </em>153 N.H. 371, 373 (2006). If our review of the evidence does not reveal any genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">In a declaratory judgment action to determine the coverage of an insurance policy, the burden of proof is always on the insurer, regardless of which party brings the petition. RSA 491:22-a (1997). The interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law for this court to decide. <em>Tech-Built, </em>153 N.H. at 373. When interpreting an insurance policy, we give the language used by the parties its reasonable meaning, based upon a reading of the policy as a whole. <em>OB/GYN Assocs. of S.N.H. v. N.H. Ins. Guaranty Assoc., </em>154 N.H. 553, 562 (2006). If more than one reasonable interpretation is possible, and one of them provides coverage, the policy contains an ambiguity and will be construed against the insurer. <em>Catholic Med. Ctr. v. Executive Risk Indem., </em>151 N.H. 699, 701 (2005). Our practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>of construing ambiguities against the insurer is particularly applicable when the language at issue is part of an exclusionary clause. <em>Contoocook Valley Sch. Dist. v. Graphic Arts Mut. Ins. Co., </em>147 N.H. 392, 394 (2001). However, we will not perform linguistic gymnastics to find a term ambiguous. <em>Catholic Med. Ctr., </em>151 N.H. at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In its order, the trial court determined that both the medical payments section and the uninsured motorists endorsement of Carter\u2019s Concord General policy were ambiguous and, therefore, properly construed against Concord General and in favor of coverage. We consider each portion of the policy in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The medical payments section of the policy provides, in pertinent part, that Concord General \u201cwill pay reasonable expenses incurred for necessary medical ... services because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 ... [claused by accident; and ... [sustained by an \u2018insured\u2019.\u201d The policy then defines the term \u201cinsured\u201d to mean \u201c[y]ou ... [a]s a pedestrian when struck by ... a motor vehicle designed for use mainly on public roads or a \u2018trailer\u2019 of any type.\u201d The term \u201ctrailer\u201d is defined in the policy\u2019s general definition section: \u201c\u2018Trailer\u2019 means a vehicle designed to be pulled by a: 1. [pjrivate passenger auto; or 2. [p]ickup or van ... [and to] mean[] a farm wagon or farm implement while towed by a vehicle listed in 1. or 2. above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The trial court found the foregoing language to be ambiguous but did not explain its reasoning. On appeal, Concord General argues that the policy unambiguously informed Carter that coverage for her injuries was not available under the medical payments section because the Appleview wagon was a farm wagon being pulled by a tractor, rather than a private passenger auto, pickup or van, thus placing it outside the definition of \u201ctrailer\u201d and placing her outside the definition of \u201cinsured.\u201d More specifically, Concord General argues that: (1) photographs of the Appleview wagon \u201cconclusively establish that [it] would constitute a farm wagon or farm implement\u201d; (2) that a farm wagon or farm implement only qualifies as a \u201ctrailer\u201d under its policy when it is towed by a private passenger auto, pickup or van; (3) it is undisputed that the Appleview wagon was being pulled by a tractor; and (4) because the wagon was not being pulled by a private passenger auto, pickup or van, it was, necessarily, not a \u201ctrailer\u201d as that term is defined in the policy. Concord General also notes that Carter produced no evidence to counter its argument \u2014 based upon photographs of the wagon \u2014 that the wagon was not designed to be pulled by a private passenger auto, pickup or van. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Carter contends, to the contrary, that an ambiguity is created by the tension between the phrase \u201ca \u2018trailer\u2019 of any type\u201d in the medical payments section and the more narrow definition of \u201ctrailer\u201d in the definition section, and that even if the policy is unambiguous, photographs of the wagon disclose that it was designed in a manner such that it could be pulled by a private passenger auto, pickup or van, as required by the policy\u2019s definition of \u201ctrailer.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\">To begin, we discern no ambiguity in the language of the policy. The petitioner argues that giving full effect to the qualifier \u201cof any type\u201d in the phrase \u201ca \u2018trailer\u2019 of any type\u201d creates a conflict between that provision and the narrower definition of \u201ctrailer\u201d in the general definition section. That is not so. First, the general definition section comes before the medical payments section of the policy, meaning that by the time a reader gets to the phrase \u201ca \u2018trailer\u2019 of any type,\u201d the term \u201ctrailer\u201d has already been given its narrow, specialized meaning. More importantly, the phrase at issue is not \u201ca trailer of any type\u201d but \u201ca \u2018trailer\u2019 of any type.\u201d The former phrase might create ambiguity; the latter does not. The latter phrase merely says that a person is an \u201cinsured\u201d if she is a pedestrian struck by any type of \u201ctrailer,\u201d as that term has already been defined. Moreover, as the term \u201ctrailer\u201d appears in quotation marks in the phrase \u201ca \u2018trailer\u2019 of any type,\u201d the qualifier \u201cof any type\u201d cannot reasonably be read to expand the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d to include pedestrians struck by trailers excluded from the definition of \u201ctrailer.\u201d Rather, the qualifier \u201cof any type\u201d is most reasonably read in the context of the larger phrase in which it appears: \u201ca motor vehicle designed for use mainly on public roads or a \u2018trailer\u2019 of any type.\u201d A pedestrian policyholder struck by a motor vehicle is an \u201cinsured\u201d only when that motor vehicle was \u201cdesigned mainly for use on public roads,\u201d but if a pedestrian policy holder is struck by a vehicle towed by a motor vehicle, she would qualify as an \u201cinsured\u201d if the towed vehicle was \u201cdesigned mainly for use on public roads,\u201d and could qualify as an \u201cinsured\u201d even if the towed vehicle was a \u201cfarm wagon or farm implement\u201d not \u201cdesigned mainly for use on public roads,\u201d so long as it was being towed by a private passenger auto, pickup or van. Because the term \u201c\u2018trailer\u2019 of any type\u201d is not ambiguous, we reverse the trial court\u2019s determination that the medical payments section of the policy contains an ambiguity that must be construed against Concord General.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Carter also argues that even if the policy is not ambiguous, the Appleview wagon falls within the policy\u2019s narrow definition of \u201ctrailer.\u201d Carter made this argument in her motion for summary judgment, but given the trial court\u2019s ruling that the medical payments provision was ambiguous, it had no need to determine whether the wagon met the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>policy\u2019s definition of \u201ctrailer,\u201d and it did not do so. However, because the application of the law to the facts is a question we review <em>de novo, see Tech-Built, </em>153 N.H. at 373, we can make that determination ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The facts in this case concerning the wagon \u2014 such as they are \u2014 consist of four photographs. In each one, the wagon is hitched to a tractor. No photograph depicts the precise hitching mechanism. The photographs do show, however, that the wagon has neither brake lights, nor fenders, fender guards, or flaps. Carter argues, without pointing to any fact other than the photographs, that the wagon is \u201cdesigned and capable of being pulled by either an auto or pickup or van\u201d and further argues that \u201c[s]ince Respondent did not demonstrate that the trailer involved in this accident was designed such that it could not be pulled by an auto or pickup or van, summary judgment was appropriate and Petitioner is entitled to medical payments coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">While Carter correctly states that Concord General had the burden of proving a lack of coverage, that burden required Concord General only to prove that the wagon in question was not designed to be pulled by a private passenger auto, pickup or van. In other words, Carter misapprehends what Concord General had to prove when she suggests that Concord General was obligated to prove that the wagon was incapable of being pulled by a private passenger auto, pickup or van. The policy\u2019s definition of \u201ctrailer\u201d is not based upon what a particular vehicle <em>could </em>do, but, rather, it is based upon what that vehicle was <em>designed </em>to do. <em>Cf. Trombley v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>148 N.H. 748, 752 (2002) (finding, in context of uninsured motorist coverage dispute, that \u201cintegrated toolcarrier\u201d was \u201cdesigned for use mainly off public roads\u201d despite being licensed for, properly equipped for, and capable of using public roads).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The lack of brake lights demonstrates that the wagon in this case was not designed to be pulled by a private passenger auto, pickup or van. In New Hampshire, all motor vehicles, except farm tractors, are required to have brake lights. <em>See </em>RSA 266:38 (2004). The wagon in this case does not have brake lights. If it were hitched to a private passenger auto, pickup or van \u2014 each of which is required to have brake lights \u2014 the wagon would block the brake lights of the motor vehicle towing it, and would not compensate by having brake lights of its own. Accordingly, we conclude that a trailer designed to be pulled by a private passenger auto, pickup or van is one whose design includes brake lights. The trailer in this case, designed without brake lights, was not designed to be pulled by a private passenger auto, pickup or van.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Because the Appleview wagon was not designed to be pulled by a private passenger auto, pickup or van, it was not a \u201ctrailer\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>meaning of the medical payments section of Carter\u2019s Concord General policy, and because Carter was not struck by \u201ca \u2018trailer\u2019 of any type,\u201d she was not an \u201cinsured\u201d for the purpose of qualifying for medical payments coverage. Accordingly, Concord General correctly denied Carter\u2019s claim for coverage under the medical payments section of her policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The uninsured motorists endorsement of the Concord General policy provides, in pertinent part, that Concord General \u201cwill pay compensatory damages which an \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of... [a]n \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 ... because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by an \u2018insured\u2019 and caused by an accident.\u201d The endorsement defines \u201c \u2018[uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 [to] mean[] a land motor vehicle or trailer of any type.\u201d The endorsement, however, contains an exclusion providing that \u201c \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 ... [does not] include!] any vehicle or equipment\u201d that falls within any one of six described categories. At issue here is the fifth of those exclusions, which covers \u201cany vehicle or equipment ... [d]esigned mainly for use off public roads while not on public roads.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">According to Concord General, the uninsured motorists endorsement unambiguously limited the term \u201ctrailer of any type\u201d by expressly excluding \u201cany vehicle or equipment ... [d]esigned mainly for use off public roads while not on public roads.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">As a preliminary matter, it is undisputed that the accident took place on the property of Appleview Orchard, not on a public road. Moreover, we agree with Concord General that the Appleview wagon was \u201c[d]esigned mainly for use off public roads.\u201d To operate lawfully on public roads in New Hampshire, a trailer must have brake lights, <em>see </em>RSA 266:38, and \u201cproper fenders to prevent the throw, spray, or splash of water, dirt, or other matter [or] suitable fender guards or flaps which shall effectively reduce the throw, spray or splash likely to be emitted from any wheel or tire,\u201d RSA 266:57 (2004). The Appleview wagon was not designed to meet either of these requirements for operating on public roads. Thus, it necessarily was designed mainly for use off public roads, where those requirements do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Because the Appleview wagon was \u201c[designed mainly for use off public roads\u201d and was \u201cnot on [a] public road[]\u201d at the time of the accident, the applicability of the \u201coff public roads\u201d exclusion depends upon construction of the phrase \u201cany vehicle or equipment\u201d which introduces the policy\u2019s list of six exclusionary categories. If the wagon qualifies as \u201cany vehicle or equipment,\u201d the \u201coff public roads\u201d exclusion applies, and Concord General is not obligated to provide coverage. If the wagon does not qualify as \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>vehicle or equipment,\u201d or if that phrase is ambiguous, then Carter is entitled to coverage. <em>See Catholic Med. Ctr., </em>151 N.H. at 701. We assume, for purposes of the analysis that follows, that it is reasonable to interpret the phrase \u201cany vehicle or equipment\u201d to include the Appleview wagon. The question before us is whether it is also reasonable to interpret that phrase not to encompass the Appleview wagon. We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">When disputed terms are not defined in the policy or by our cases, we apply an objective standard, construing the terms in context and as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured, based upon more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole. <em>Catholic Med. Ctr., </em>151 N.H. at 701. The definition section of the uninsured motorists endorsement begins by defining an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d as \u201ca land motor vehicle or trailer of any type\u201d and subsequently limits that definition by excluding \u201cany vehicle or equipment\u201d that falls within any one of six described categories. And, of course, absent statutory provisions or public policy to the contrary, insurers have a right to limit their liability by exclusions written in terms appropriate to convey their meaning and effect to a reasonable person in the position of the insured. <em>Empire Ins. Cos. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>128 N.H. 171, 175 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Here, a reasonable person in the position of the insured would note the shift in language from \u201cland motor vehicle or trailer of any type\u201d to \u201cany vehicle or equipment.\u201d The former phrase plainly includes the Appleview wagon; that wagon is, indisputably, a \u201ctrailer of any type.\u201d If the phrase introducing the six categories of exclusion were intended to cover exactly the same items as the phrase in the main definition, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cland motor vehicle[s] or trailers] of any type,\u201d that intent would have been most clearly communicated by using the same phrase in both places. Accordingly, it is reasonable to conclude that the phrase \u201cany vehicle or equipment\u201d was intended to convey a different and narrower meaning than the phrase \u201cland motor vehicle or trailer of any type.\u201d It is also reasonable to conclude that one of the different meanings conveyed by the shift in language is an exemption from the exclusion for trailers such as the one that injured Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Perhaps our construction of the relevant terms is best illustrated with the concrete example of a pickup truck, a boat trailer and an air compressor designed to be towed by a truck with a trailer hitch. In terms of the definition of an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle,\u201d the pickup truck would be a \u201cland motor vehicle\u201d while the boat trailer and compressor would each be a \u201ctrailer of any type.\u201d The boat trailer would be the type of trailer that is designed to carry something else, and the compressor would be the type of trailer that is not designed to carry something else. In terms of the phrase that introduces the list of exclusions, the pickup truck would be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u201cvehicle\u201d; the air compressor would be \u201cequipment\u201d; and the boat trailer, as a type of trailer other than equipment, would be neither \u201cvehicle\u201d nor \u201cequipment.\u201d In this example, the boat trailer, by virtue of its exemption from the exclusion, would be an uninsured motor vehicle under any circumstances, while the pickup truck and the compressor would be uninsured motor vehicles only if they did not fall within any of the six exclusionary categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">At first blush, it might seem unreasonable to say that a trailer designed to carry something else is not a vehicle. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2538 (unabridged ed. 2002) (defining \u201cvehicle\u201d as, among other things \u201ca means of carrying or transporting something\u201d). But it is not unreasonable, in the context of the specific policy language we are interpreting, to construe the word \u201cvehicle\u201d in the phrase \u201cany vehicle or equipment\u201d as referring only to a motor vehicle, given the previous use of the word \u201cvehicle\u201d in the phrase \u201ca land motor vehicle.\u201d That previous usage makes it reasonable to construe the term \u201cvehicle,\u201d when used subsequently, as referring only to motorized vehicles. And because the wagon in this case was not motorized, it is reasonable to construe the term \u201cvehicle,\u201d in the context of this particular policy, as excluding the Appleview wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Because only the uninsured motorists endorsement may be properly construed as providing coverage for Carter\u2019s injuries, we affirm in part, reverse in part and remand with instructions that the trial court enter judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in pari; and remand,ed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-9\">Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
