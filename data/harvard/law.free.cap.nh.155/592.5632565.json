We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The following facts appear in the trial court\u2019s order or are supported in the record before us. The plaintiff commenced this action by filing a petition for declaratory judgment on March 5, 1999. The petition alleged, among other things, the following: The plaintiff was the holder of a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Permit to build an AM broadcast station with 266-foot radio transmitter towers in Lebanon. The zoning ordinance of the defendant, the City of Lebanon (City), \u201ceffectively prohibit[ed] all new radio towers\u201d in Lebanon. The plaintiff applied for a variance, but was denied. The petition claimed, among other things, federal preemption, and violation of free speech rights and \u201cthe express requirements of federal and state law allowing radio broadcasts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">After its claims were disposed of by summary judgment, the plaintiff appealed and we affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded. <em>See Koor Communication v. City of Lebanon, </em>148 N.H. 618 (2002). We concluded that the City\u2019s zoning ordinance was preempted because \u201cfor anyone seeking to operate a new FCC-licensed AM station in the city, compliance with both the zoning ordinance and federal law is a physical impossibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">On remand, the plaintiff moved for attorney\u2019s fees, claiming that it was a prevailing party entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The trial court denied the motion, noting that prior to the plaintiff\u2019s motion for fees, it had neither pled nor raised any claims under sections 1983 or 1988. Therefore, the court ruled, it did not need to reach the plaintiff\u2019s substantive arguments on whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1988 apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard, giving deference to the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Van Der Stok v. Van Voorhees, </em>151 N.H. 679, 683 (2005) (quotation omitted). Before turning to the merits of the appeal, we first examine the applicable statutes. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (2000) provides, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>pertinent part: \u201cIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section[]... 1983 ... of this title ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs____\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), in turn, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in denying its request for attorney\u2019s fees for failure to previously raise either 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 in its pleadings. The plaintiff correctly notes that the prayer for relief in its petition for declaratory judgment requested that \u201cthe Plaintiff be awarded attorney\u2019s fees in this action.\u201d It then contends, citing <em>Morency v. Plourde, </em>96 N.H. 344, 346 (1950), that under New Hampshire law, this adequately informed the City of its claim for redress. It also argues that under federal law, it was not required to specifically cite 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. In support, it cites the following conclusion of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">Section 1988 is concerned with the substance of a prevailing party\u2019s action rather than the form in which it is presented. The mere failure to plead or argue reliance on \u00a7 1983 is not fatal to a claim for attorney\u2019s fees if the pleadings and evidence do present a substantial Fourteenth Amendment claim for which \u00a7 1983 provides a remedy, and this claim is related to the plaintiffs\u2019 ultimate success.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\"><em>Berger v. City of Mayfield Heights, </em>265 F.3d 399, 404 (6th Cir. 2001) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Assuming, without deciding, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion to be valid, we note that the plaintiff must still present a claim \u201cfor which \u00a7 1983 provides a remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff concedes that this is a case of first impression, but argues that it meets the criteria established by the United States Supreme Court for determining whether a particular statute or regulation creates a right that is enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>The plaintiff cites the <em>Blessing </em>test, <em>see Blessing v. Freestone, </em>520 U.S. 329 (1997), a three-factor inquiry to guide the determination of whether a statute establishes such a right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-3\">[1] Congress must have intended that the provision benefit the plaintiff, [2] the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence, and [3] the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><em>Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, </em>536 U.S. 273, 282 (2002) (quotations omitted). In <em>Gonzaga University, </em>the Supreme Court clarified that \u201cif Congress wishes to create new rights enforceable under \u00a7 1983, it must do so in clear and unambiguous terms \u2014 no less and no more than what is required for Congress to create new rights enforceable under an implied private right of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290. Looking, then, to the caselaw involving private rights of action, the Supreme Court has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">[T]he question whether Congress intended to create a private right of action is definitively answered in the negative where a statute by its terms grants no private rights to any identifiable class. For a statute to create such private rights, its text must be phrased in terms of the persons benefited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 283-84 (citation, quotations, brackets and ellipsis omitted). Applying the above-cited test, we conclude that the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-613 (2000), does not confer upon the plaintiff private rights enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">We need not go further than the first factor \u2014 that Congress intended that the provision benefit the plaintiff. <em>See Gonzaga, Univ., </em>536 U.S. at 282. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted in <em>Howard v. City of Burlingame, </em>937 F.2d 1376, 1379 (9th Cir. 1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">In the [Federal Communications Act of 1934], Congress defined its intended beneficiaries as \u201call the people of the United States,\u201d and described its purposes as promoting national defense, safety of life and property, and centralizing regulatory authority over the airwaves. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151____[T]he Act is thus intended to benefit the general public, as opposed to any individual operator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The Supreme Court has also stated that \u201c[t]he Communications Act of 1934 did not create new private rights. The purpose of the Act was to protect the public interest in communications.\u201d <em>Scripps-Howard Radio v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, </em>316 U.S. 4, 14 (1942); <em>see also Howard, </em>937 F.2d at 1379 (noting same).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The plaintiff cites no specific provision of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 that it claims entitles it to a right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, but rather contends that the \u201cinstant case involves AM broadcasting, governed by\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 73.45, 73.189 and 73.190 (2006). It is unclear whether a regulation alone can create a right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \u201cAlthough the circuits are divided on the question, the majority have determined that where a regulation\u2019s enforcing statute confers no federal right, the regulation alone cannot create a right enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>D.D. ex rel. V.D. v. New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>465 F.3d 503, 513 (2d Cir. 2006), <em>amended in unrelated part on denial of rehearing, </em>480 F.3d 138 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In any event, we need not address the issue, as we have examined 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 73.45, 73.189 and 73.190 and see no intent, expressed \u201cin clear and unambiguous terms,\u201d <em>Gonzaga Univ., </em>536 U.S. at 290, to benefit the plaintiff. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.45 details the requirements that applicants for AM station facilities and certain existing licensees must meet regarding the specification of antenna systems. \u201cSection 73.45 requires that [such applicants] shall specify a radiating system, the efficiency of which complies with the requirements of good engineering practice for the class and power of the station.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.189(a). 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 73.189 and 73.190, entitled \u201cMinimum antenna heights or field strength requirements\u201d and \u201cEngineering charts and related formulas,\u201d respectively, set forth technical requirements related to such antenna systems. None of these regulations \u201cgrants ... private rights to any identifiable class\u201d or is \u201cphrased in terms of the persons benefited.\u201d <em>Gonzaga Univ., </em>536 U.S. at 284 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The plaintiff urges us to look to \u201csatellite TV dish antenna cases which allowed \u00a7 1988 recovery of fees when the municipality ignored FCC regulations,\u201d and cites <em>Loschiavo v. City of Dearborn, </em>33 F.3d 548 (6th Cir. 1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1150 (1995), and <em>Ermler v. Brookhaven, </em>780 F. Supp. 120 (E.D.N.Y. 1992). Assuming these cases were correctly decided, we decline to adopt the reasoning therein in this case. <em>Loschiavo </em>and <em>Ermler </em>turn upon the specific language of 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 25.104, which, in turn, is a product of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. <em>Loschiavo, </em>33 F.3d at 551.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">The 1984 Act was passed in part to promote the growth of satellite programming and to facilitate individual reception of unencrypted satellite signals. In view of this goal, Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>amended the Communications Act to authorize the receipt of unscrambled satellite programming for private viewing....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-3\">Shortly thereafter, the FCC, concluding that local regulations regularly interfered with the right recognized by the 1984 Act to receive satellite signals for home viewing, adopted a rule preempting discriminatory local ordinances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 551-52 (citation omitted). In light of this background, the <em>Loschiavo </em>court concluded: \u201cWe have no doubt that the Loschiavos, as the owners of a satellite antenna used to receive programming for home viewing, were intended beneficiaries of this regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">By contrast, as the plaintiff itself recognizes elsewhere in its brief, the purpose of \u201c[t]he FCC\u2019s regulation of minimum antenna heights [in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 73.45, 73.189 and 73.190 is] to avoid interference with other stations on the same or nearby frequencies.\u201d This is entirely consistent with the purpose, stated in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, of \u201cmak[ing] available, so far as possible,\u201d radio service \u201cto all the people of the United States.\u201d In other words, it is entirely consistent with an intention to benefit the listening public, rather than the broadcaster. <em>Cf. Howard, </em>937 F.2d at 1379. The plaintiff has cited no statute, regulation or legislative history suggesting a contrary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We conclude that the plaintiff has failed to establish that either the Federal Communications Act of 1934 or 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 73.45, 73.189 or 73.190 satisfy the first factor of the <em>Blessing </em>test \u2014 that Congress intended that the provision benefit the plaintiff. <em>See Gonzaga Univ., </em>536 U.S. at 282. Accordingly, the plaintiff has failed to establish a right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The plaintiff nevertheless argues in its reply brief that it \u201cmade two constitutional arguments early on and carried them forward,\u201d and that it is entitled to \u00a7 1988 fees on either of those claims. The first argument, which the plaintiff contends this court \u201cnever reached\u201d in the prior appeal, is a First Amendment claim. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that as \u201ca broadcaster, [it] was deprived of its First Amendment right of free speech by means of a City zoning ordinance which prevented the erection of an antenna system tall enough to meet the Federal requirements set forth in\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 73.45, 73.189 and 73.190.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">In its June 25, 2001 order on the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court ruled that the City\u2019s zoning ordinance did not restrict free speech, having \u201cpreviously ruled that the zoning ordinance is a permissible content-neutral restriction on the plaintiff\u2019s state and federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>rights to free speech.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff did not prevail on its First Amendment claim. Accordingly, it is not entitled to fees on this basis. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (authorizing fees to prevailing party).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s second argument is that \u201cpreemption is itself a constitutional claim upon which [it] prevailed\u201d and upon which it is therefore entitled to \u00a7 1988 fees. We disagree. In <em>Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, </em>493 U.S. 103 (1989), the Supreme Court clarified that \u201cthe Supremacy Clause, of its own force, does not create rights enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">That clause is not a source of any federal rights; it secures federal rights by according them priority whenever they come in conflict with state law. Given the variety of situations in which pre-emption claims may be asserted, in state court and in federal court, it would obviously be incorrect to assume that a federal right of action pursuant to \u00a7 1983 exists every time a federal rule of law pre-empts state regulatory authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 107-08 (quotations, citations, footnote and brackets omitted). Thus, we reject the plaintiff\u2019s contention that its success on the preemption claim alone entitles it to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b620-9\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
