RSA 358-A:2 (Supp. 2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-16\">The essential facts are not in dispute. At an Ohio auction on April 24, 2004, \u201cLazy H\u201d Horse and Trailer Sales (Lazy H) sold a horse named \u201cALS April Magic\u201d (Magic) as a gelding to Hollis Ranch. Hollis Ranch sold Magic as a gelding one month later to Kelton for $4,535. Soon thereafter, while stabled next to a mare, Magic began to display \u201cstud-like\u201d qualities.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-17\">Magic, it turned out, had a trick up his sleeve. He had an undescended right testicle that produced testosterone, causing the stud-like behavior. Kelton took Magic to the Tufts University Hospital for Large Animals on March 15, 2005. There, Dr. Jose Garcia-Lopez, a veterinarian with ten years experience treating large animals, performed an examination. The trial judge highlighted pertinent parts of Dr. Garcia-Lopez\u2019 testimony in his order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-18\">[Dr. Garcia-Lopez] stated that an examination of the horse, even by a veterinarian, would not have indicated it had a recessed testicle. The horse had a surgical scar on its scrotum consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>with a gelding procedure. His own physical examination, including an ultrasound and palpitation [sic] of the area, did not indicate a recessed testicle. The only evidence of testicular tissue was the positive testosterone lab results. Such a test is not a usual and customary exam to be administered prior to purchasing a horse, including one represented as being a gelding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Neither Hollis Ranch nor Kelton would have had reason to know of the undescended testicle. Dr. Garcia-Lopez testified that there was \u201cno reason for Hollis Ranch or Kelton to question [that] the horse was a gelding and no layperson or veterinarian would have any reason to suspect otherwise.\u201d On March 18, 2005, Dr. Garcia-Lopez removed Magic\u2019s undescended testicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Kelton filed a CPA claim to recoup the cost of the procedure, other related medical and travel expenses, and attorney\u2019s fees. She argued that Hollis Ranch violated RSA 358-A:2, VII, which prohibits \u201cRepresenting that goods or services are of a particular standard, quality, or grade, or that goods are of a particular style or model, if they are of another\u201d and RSA 358-A:2, V, which prohibits \u201cRepresenting that goods have ... characteristics ... that they do not have.\u201d Kelton argues that by misrepresenting Magic as a gelding, Hollis Ranch violated subsections V and VII regardless of its good faith lack of knowledge. Hollis Ranch argues that because it acted in good faith, it did not act unfairly or deceptively as the statute requires. The trial court ruled that \u201cin order for a misstatement to constitute a violation [of the CPA], the defendant must be aware or, at a minimum, have a reasonable basis to suspect that its representation is unreliable or untrue.\u201d The court found that: \u201cHollis Ranch\u2019s justifiable reliance on representations made by a third party when it had no reason to know or suspect otherwise does not rise to the level of [an] unfair or deceptive [act or practice]____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in ruling that RSA 358-A:2 requires Kelton to show that Hollis Ranch, \u201cat a minimum, [had] a reasonable basis to suspect that its representation is unreliable or untrue\u201d in order to constitute a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law. Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo. See State v. Boulais, </em>150 N.H. 216, 218 (2003). When construing a statute, we first examine its language ascribing the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used by the legislature. <em>Id. </em>We will neither ignore the plain language of the legislation nor add words which the lawmakers did not see fit to include. <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>133 N.H. 442, 445 (1990). \u201cThe legislative intent is to be found not in what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>legislature might have said, but rather in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Corson v. Brown Prods., Inc., </em>119 N.H. 20, 23 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\u201cLegal liability is said to be strict when it is imposed even though the defendant has committed no legal fault consisting of the violation of a common law or statutory duty.\u201d <em>Bagley v. Controlled Environment Corp., </em>127 N.H. 556, 558 (1986). However, \u201cstrict liability for damages has traditionally met with disfavor in this jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559. In New Hampshire, strict liability is available only \u201cwhere the Legislature has provided for it or [in] those situations where the common law of this state has imposed such liability and the Legislature has not seen fit to change it.\u201d <em>Moulton v. Groveton Papers Co., </em>112 N.H. 50, 53 (1972) (ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The plain language of the statute, as the trial court noted, indicates that some element of knowledge on the part of the defendant is required. The relevant portion of RSA 358-A:2 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">It shall be unlawful for any person to use any unfair method of competition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of any trade or commerce within this state. Such unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice shall include, but is not limited to, the following____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The statute expressly states that only practices which are \u201cdeceptive\u201d or \u201c\u00fcnfair\u201d subject the actor to liability. The first definition of \u201cdeceive\u201d listed in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary is \u201cto take unawares esp. by craft or trickery.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW International Dictionary 584 (unabridged ed. 2002). Webster\u2019s defines \u201cunfair\u201d as being \u201cmarked by injustice, partiality, or deception: unjust, dishonest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2494. The trial court properly construed the legislature\u2019s use of the words \u201cdeceptive\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d as requiring a degree of knowledge or intent. This construction is entirely consistent with our holding in <em>State v. Moran </em>requiring a level of rascality to establish a CPA violation. <em>State v. Moran, </em>151 N.H. 450, 452 (2004). Kelton has pointed to no language in the statute which, either expressly or impliedly, imposes strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Accordingly, we hold that RSA 358-A:2 did not impose strict liability upon Hollis Ranch. <em>See Moulton, </em>112 N.H. at 53; <em>accord Bergman v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., </em>No. Civ. A. 03-4459, 2003 WL 23142155 (D. Pa. December 30, 2003); <em>Samuels v. Fox, </em>No. Civ. A. 98-3426, 2000 WL 1059822 (D. La. July 31, 2000); <em>Millen Industries Inc. v. Flexo-Accessories Co., </em>5 F. Supp. 2d 72 (D. Mass. 1998); <em>Crabtree Investments v. Merrill Lynch, </em>577 F. Supp. 1466, 1469 (D. La. 1984), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>738 F.2d 434 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>1984). There is ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s factual determination that Hollis Ranch made a good faith mistake. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b691-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
