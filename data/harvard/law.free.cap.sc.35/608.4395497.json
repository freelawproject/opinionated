Railway Company, ante </em>307, and the decision in this case simply referred to that as its decision here. Appellant further contended that his motion for non-suit should have been granted. It seems that after verdict for plaintiff, the presiding judge (Hudson) set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial. This court held, under the authority of <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>24 S. C., 86, that there could be no appeal from the refusal to grant a non-suit, as there was no final judgment. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
