Respondent contended that appeal could not be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>from a mere order for judgment and that no appeal had been taken from the judgment itself.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3Vb\"><em>W.

Respondent thereupon demanded three printed copies of the \u201cCase\u201d as served upon him; but no further service was made. Respondent contended that the \u201cCase\u201d as served upon him in manuscript was no sufficient \u201cCase and if it was, then it should have been printed and served just as it was when served in manuscript.</p>\n<p id=\"ARm\">The motion was refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
