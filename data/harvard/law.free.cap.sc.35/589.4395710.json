K. Carson, </em>for motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AM9\"><em>R. W. Shand </em>and <em>W. W. Thomson, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Respondent claimed that the \u201cCase\u201d had not been prepared and filed as required by rule 5 of the Supreme Court. But this court held that rule 5 refers to the preparation of the \u201cCase\u201d for argument in this court and not to the \u201cCase\u201d to be filed in the Circuit Court within ten days after settlement as required by rule 49 of the Circuit Court. The motion was therefore declared to be not well founded and was accordingly dismissed by a formal order passed December 10, 1891.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
