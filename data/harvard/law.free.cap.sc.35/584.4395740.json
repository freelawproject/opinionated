Because the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ment agreed upon was not intended for the return, but constituted the \u201cCase\u201d for hearing. 2nd. Because the return, assuming the agreed statement to be the return, was not filed in the time required by the rules of this court. The first objection is disposed of by the decision in the case of <em>McNair </em>v. Craig, 34 S. C., 9, and the reasoning in the opinion then filed is adopted as the reasoning in this case. The fact that the statement of the case for the Supreme Court, agreed upon by counsel for the respective parties, will not deprive it of that character, as the Code of Civil Procedure, section 345, subd. 5, provides that where counsel for the respective parties agree on a statement of the case for the Supreme Court, \u201cno return or other paper from the Circuit Court shall be required;\u201d and rule 2 of the Supreme Court provides that such agreed statement, with the notice of appeal and exceptions, shall constitute the return. This decision explains <em>Nabors </em>v. Latimer, 30 S. C., 607. The affidavits of appellant\u2019s attorneys concede that the return was not filed in the time required by the rule of court; but they allege that the critical illness of the attorney having sole charge of the appeal caused the delay. This is 'considered by the court a sufficient excuse for non compliance with the rule of court.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqv\"><em>Wilson, Wilson &amp; McDow, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A2gv\"><em>W.
