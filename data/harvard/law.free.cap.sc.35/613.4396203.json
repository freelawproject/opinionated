It alleged three payments, the last being dated May, 1886, but did not say by whom the payments had been made. And judgment was demanded for the principal of the note with interest from November 15,1880. The defendant, among other defences, plead the statute of limitations. Judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ment was for plaintiff and defendant appealed, alleging error to the trial judge (Kershaw) \u201cin holding that the plaintiff\u2019s action was upon the new promise implied from the payments recited in the complaint, and for error in not holding that the action was simply upon the note, and was therefore barred by the statute.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AXC\"><em>N.

This court has held that such <em>promise </em>in writing does not revive the balance of the old note, which is barred and dead, but is a new promise to pay what remains unpaid of the old debt, and that, to be recovered, it must be expressly and in terms sued upon, as such <em>neiv promise. </em>See <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>33 S. C., 510. I am not able to distinguish the case now before us from that, and therefore there must be a new trial.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b624-6\">Mr. Chief Justice McIver</author>\n<p id=\"ASW0\">(the only other justice who heard the case) said : \u201cI concur. It should be observed that there is no allegation in the complaint that the alleged payments were made by the defendant; and this case, therefore, is precisely like the case of <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Fleming.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
