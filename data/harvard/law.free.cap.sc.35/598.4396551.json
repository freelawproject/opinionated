C., at page 112. The petition alleged error as to a matter of fact, and further alleged the grounds taken in the motion considered by this court in the opinion reported in this volume, <em>ante, </em>150.</p>\n<p id=\"AHU\">The following order was passed</p>\n<author id=\"b608-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Au7\">We have carefully examined this petition, and finding that no material fact or important principle of law has been either overlooked or misunderstood, there is no ground for a rehearing. One of the grounds upon which this petition is based, to wit, the unconstitutionality of the tribunal which undertook to hear the case, we do not consider appropriate to a petition for a rehearing; but as the same question will be presented by a motion to set aside the judgment [see <em>ante, </em>150], the petitioner will sustain no prejudice by this defect in form of the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>for rehearing. It is therefore ordered, that the petition be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
