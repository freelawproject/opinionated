F. Butler, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad\">1. A conviction in a criminal prosecution is not conclusive in any civil case, because it is <em>res inter alios, </em>and may have been obtained on the evidence of the party seeking to use it. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>3 Cush. 407. Here the plaintiff offered to show that the verdict of guilty against him was obtained by the false testimony of one of these defendants, and the official connivance of the other. If this be conclusive in their favor, then any man who goes far enough in a fraudulent conspiracy to obtain one verdict, though no judgment be ever rendered thereon, is safe from any action by the party injured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-7\"><em>2. </em>A verdict is not a conviction until it is accepted and recorded by the court. Rev. Sts. c. 123, \u00a7 3. A verdict in a criminal prosecution, which has been set aside, cannot be evidence. 1 Stark. Ev. (4th Amer. ed.) 245, 246. <em>Ridgeley </em>v <em>Spenser, 2 </em>Binn. 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-8\">3. If this conviction is evidence at all, it is only <em>prima facie, </em>not conclusive; it is like the finding of an examining magistrate. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Towne, </em>4 Cush. 233. <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Place, </em>4 Wend. 591.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-9\">4. This verdict of guilty, so set aside, if held to be conclusive, has been met by a verdict of not guilty, duly accepted and recorded, at least equally conclusive.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-10\"><em>J. Q. Abbott, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b47-11\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS2\">There is nothing in this case, as it now stands before us, which has not heretofore been decided against the plaintiff, in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>10 Cush. 279, and <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Huntington, 2 </em>Gray, 124, or, at least, intimated in the latter case to be insufficient to maintain his action. What we then intimated, we now adjudge. This case furnishes no exception to the rule, that a conviction of a party, by a jury, is conclusive evidence of probable cause for the prosecution. See also <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>4 Gray, 105, that an injury caused by perjury is not a legal ground of action. <em>Judgment on the </em>verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
