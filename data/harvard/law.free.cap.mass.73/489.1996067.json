The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-9\"><em>D. </em>Peabody, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-10\"><em>O. P. Lord Sf S. B. Ives, Jr. </em>for the defendant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACH\">As between the parties thereto, a mortgage of subsequently acquired chattels is valid or, at least, may be made good by some new act or ratification. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>10 Met. 493. <em>Lunn </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>1 C. B. 379. The plaintiff having accepted a bill of sale, which expressly recited that all the property, including that claimed in this suit, was subject to the mortgage to the defendant,. is estopped to deny that the mortgage included this property, or that whatever was necessary to make it so attach had in fact been done. This admission of the plaintiff, inconsistent with the claim now set up, and the entry of the defendant for foreclosure, founded upon that admission, constitute an estoppel <em>in pais. Stephen </em>v. Baird, 9 Cow. 277. 2 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cas. (4th Amer ed.) 562, note to <em>Duchess of Kingston\u2019s case.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b500-5\">Bigelow, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABo\">A mortgage of chattels cannot convey property of which the mortgagor is not the owner at the time of the conveyance. Whatever may be the agreement between the parties, the mortgage cannot bind property subsequently acquired, without some further act of assurance or ratification. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>10 Met. 481. <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>2 Cush. 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The bill of sale, under which the plaintiff claims, does not describe all the property included in it as subject to the mortgage to the defendant, nor in any way indicate what portion is covered by the mortgage; but merely contains covenants of title and good right to sell, subject to the mortgage, leaving the mortgage to apply to such portion of the property as was legally conveyed by it. Nor is there any evidence that the defendant, when he entered under his mortgage, relied on any admission in the bill of sale, or even knew that the sale had been made. There is no ground therefore for holding that the plaintiff is estopped to claim the property acquired by the mortgagor after the mortgage to the defendant. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
