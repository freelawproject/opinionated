Freize, of Providence, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, in trust to pay the creditors of James, in a designated order of priority; and at the \u2022same time gave him an additional assignment of these shares, upon the same trusts; but no notice of this assignment was then given to the defendants. On the 13th of February 1852 Freize assigned these shares to Willis &amp; Co., creditors of James, in consideration of their cancelling their debt, and as part of an arrangement by which they had paid a certain sum to another creditor of James, who claimed a right in these shares. On said 13th of February Willis &amp; Co. handed said assignment to the defendants\u2019 treasurer, with a request for a new certificate, which he declined to make, but took the assignments and placed them among the papers of the company, and promised to deliver a new certificate to Willis &amp; Co. as soon as they should return the old certificates to him, which they afterwards did, and obtained from him a new certificate on the 14th of October 1852, upon giving him a bond of indemnity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>On the 23d of February 1852 the plaintiff attached these shares as the property of James, and in April 1855 recovered judgment against him, and took out execution thereon, which was levie 1 upon said shares, and a demand made upon the defendants\u2019 treasurer for a certificate thereof, and refused.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-5\"><em>G.
