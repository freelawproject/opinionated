The owners of the wharf had the exclusive control and management thereof. It was usual to leave cars, which came down loaded with ice, on the wharf over night, to be unloaded by the occupants of the wharf, and be taken up again the next day. The cars, for injury to which this action was brought, were drawn from Fresh Pond over the Fitchburg and Charles-town Branch Railroads, and left for one night on the track at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the extreme end of the wharf, four hundred and forty feet from the line of the Charlestown Branch Railroad, with no agent or servant of the plaintiffs in charge of them, and near a shed, used to store shavings and sawdust for packing ice by the occupants of the wharf. The next morning, the fire originated in this shed, and was thence communicated to these cars. The shed was an extrahazardous risk, which the defendants had refused to insure.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-5\"><em>H.

It was not even on the plaintiffs\u2019 premises, nor under the care of their servants; but was near an extrahazardous risk, which the defendants had refused to insure, and which was the cause of the fire which occasioned the loss.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b75-7\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoZ\">The present case, though not one free from difficulty, must be decided by the view to be taken of the intent of the parties in the contract of insurance. The question is, whether the property destroyed by the fire was embraced within the terms of the policy, giving them a reasonable construction, The property insured is thus described in the policy: \u201c Their road furniture, consisting of locomotive engines, cars of all descriptions, and snow ploughs, on the line of their road, and in actual use, but not in machine or repair shops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">It is said that the description excludes cars not at the moment of the loss on the Fitchburg Railroad or its Charlestown branch and that the words, \u201c the line of their road,\u201d mean exclusively to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>confine the policy to cars while on these particular roads, in distinction from any spurs used in connection with them. This we think is too narrow a construction, looking at the nature of the property insured and the language of the policy. It seems more consonant to the probable purpose of the parties to understand the policy as an insurance upon cars, &amp;c. in actual use upon their road. These cars, as we understand, were in such use, daily passing over the Fitchburg Railroad or its Charles-town branch, carrying ice, and, for convenience of delivery, passing upon a railway constructed for this purpose by the proprietors of the wharf. Such spurs seem to have been authorized by <em>St. </em>1836, <em>c. </em>187, the act creating the Charlestown Branch Railroad, and legalized as branches that might use the Charlestown road. Still they were private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">But it being in the usual course of business of the plaintiffs to use their cars in conveying ice over their own road, and delivering it at the wharf in the manner stated, this entire line became by adoption, to all practical purposes, their line of road, and the cars were in actual use upon the line of their road at the time of the loss by fire. We do not understand that the insurance was limited to cars in motion, but to cars in actual service, fit for use, and in daily use, doing the business of the company, those <em>\u201c </em>in machine or repair shops \u201d being only excluded. \u201c Snow ploughs \u201d were insured; but it is presumed that they would be only at particular seasons and for short periods in use on the railroad track.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">If this view is correct, no question can arise as to any forfeiture of the policy by increase of risk; as no change of circumstances or other use than originally contemplated by the parties to the policy is shown. <em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
