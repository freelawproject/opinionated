The alleged trespass was committed on the flats adjoining said upland, within one hundred rods of high water mark, and within the ebb and flow of the tide. The defendant came upon the premises when the tide was up, with his scow or gondola, and having moored it there, waited till the tide had ebbed \u00e1nd left the flats bare. He then filled his scow with what is called 6 muscle bed,\u2019 consisting of living and dead shell fish of the species known as muscles, and the soil or clay in which they were found, as described below. These fish do not imbed themselves in the soil, but attach themselves to it, and form large clusters, upon which the sediment of the two rivers is brought down at their conflux, and retained. The article taken is not more than one third shells, the remainder being mud and clay. This substance is highly esteemed as a manure, for which purpose only has it any value, and for which purpose only was it taken by the defendant. The locus is close to the edge of the channel of Bass River, near the point of junction with the other channel, and is very valuable to the plaintiffs, if they have the exclusive right to take this substance from it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">\u201c If on these facts the court are of opinion that this action can be maintained, the defendant is to be defaulted, and damages are to be assessed by a jury, unless the parties agree; otherwise, the plaintiffs are to become nonsuit.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-7\"><em>S.

No such public right exists, to take the soil of flats belonging to the proprietor of upland bounding on the sea, to be used as manure, although some living shell fish may be mixed in it. . <em>Defendant defa/nlted.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
