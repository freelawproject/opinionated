This was all the material evidence for the Commonwealth. The defendant called no witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-5\">The defendant in each case contended that the facts proved were not sufficient in law to constitute the crime charged in the indictment; and requested the judge to instruct the jury, \u201c that it was incumbent upon the government to prove, by direct evidence, some definite arrangement or appointment to fight; by whom it was made, and where, and something of what the appointment or arrangement was ; that it was distinct from, and previous to, the time when the parties met, and before separating fought; and that the arrangement or appointment was concluded in Massachusetts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-6\">But the judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury, if they believed sufficient had been proved, in finding a verdict of guilty; and instructed the jury \u201c that it was incumbent upon the government to prove that Welsh and Clarson met and fought within the county of Bristol, as charged in the indictment; and that said meeting and fighting were by appointment or arrangement previously made; that such arrangement or appointment need not be proved by direct evidence, but might be inferred from the conduct of the parties and other circumstances; that if the fact of such previous appointment was proved, the details of it need not be shown, and that it was immaterial whether or not it was made in this commonwealth,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-7\">Each defendant, being convicted, alleged exceptions; and also moved in arrest of judgment, and again excepted to the overruling of that motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-8\"><em>J. </em>Brown, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar5\">1. The object of the <em>St. </em>of 1849, <em>c. </em>49, as declared in its title, is \u201c to prevent prizefighting.\u201d The facts proved do not constitute one of those public, brutal exhibitions of a fight for a reward or prize, to which the legislature intended to give the character of a felony ; but only an affray or ring fight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>2. A previous appointment or arrangement was a material fact; and it should therefore have been distinctly averred in the indictment, and proved with substantial certainty, and not left to mere inference from circumstances, what the appointment was; when, where, and by whom it was made; that the defendant was a party to it; and that it was made in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-5\">3. It requires the participation of two persons, at least, to make the appointment or arrangement, and to constitute the offence created by this statute; and a single individual cannot be charged with its commission, unless in connection with persons unknown. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>15 Verm. 22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-6\">4. The averment, that Welsh \u201c did meet and engage in a fight with\u201d Clarson, does not sufficiently describe the nature of the fight, nor show whether Welsh and Clarson fought with each other, or with some third person or thing. The indictment therefore does not set forth the offence <em>\u201c </em>fully and plainly, substantially and formally.\u201d Declaration of Rights, art. 12. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>2 Pick. 139. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pray, </em>13 Pick. 362. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thurlow, </em>24 Pick. 379.

By \u00a7 2, \u201c every person who shall be present at such fight, as an aid, second or surgeon, or who shall advise, encourage or promote such fight, shall be punished,\u201d &amp;c. One of these defendants has been indicted and found guilty on the first section of this statute, and the other on the second section; and each has moved in arrest of judgment for insufficiency of the indictment against him. But the court are of opinion that both are sufficient, within the rule, which has been repeatedly recognized and applied, that a charge in an indictment may be made in the words of a statute, without a particular statement of facts and circumstances, when, by using those words, the act in which an offence consists is fully, directly and expressly alleged, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>any uncertainty or ambiguity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashley, 2 </em>Gray, 357, and authorities there cited; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kesslering, </em>12 Missouri, 565 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Click, </em>2 Alab. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The court are also of opinion that the rulings and instructions at the trial were all clearly right. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
