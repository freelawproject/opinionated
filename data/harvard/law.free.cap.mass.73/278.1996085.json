McDougald <em>vs. </em>Joseph W. Capron.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-8\">A bond for the conveyance of land upon the performance of certain conditions does not give the obligee a sufficient title to enable him to maintain a bill in equity against a mortgagee for the redemption of a prior mortgage thereon.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-9\">Bill in equity filed on the 28th of July 1855 to redeem land from a mortgage made to the defendant by William C. Kent and David D. Kent. The plaintiff\u2019s only interest in the premises was by virtue of a bond made to him by the mortgagors since said mortgage, and conditioned to convey the land to him upon his paying the obligors certain sums of money at certain times, and paying or satisfying this defendant for the amount due on this mortgage, and all taxes to be assessed upon the property. The defendant denied that the plaintiff had fulfilled his part of the conditions of the bond; and also contended that, if he had, he could not maintain this bill, because no conveyance of the premises, or of the equity of redemption therein, had ever been made to him. <em>Bigelow, </em>J. reported this preliminary question for the consideration of the full court; the parties agreeing that if the bill could be sustained this point, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>trial should be had on the questions of fact involved in the case; if not, the bill should be dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-5\"><em>C.
