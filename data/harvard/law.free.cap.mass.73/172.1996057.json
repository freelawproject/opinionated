Said action was not continued after the term at which the respondent was defaulted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">The court heard evidence upon the reasons.for the delay in furnishing the papers to complete the record, and thereupon ordered the record to be completed as prayed for. And to this order the respondent alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-6\"><em>S. A. Brown, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKZ\">By the rules of the court of common pleas and of this court, a judgment, after the completion of the record thereof at a subsequent term, is to be considered, in all respects, as a judgment of the term at which it was originally awarded. To allow a judgment to be so made up after the lapse of nearly twenty years might do great injustice to the defendant, by barring him of his writ of error, which must be brought within six years after judgment. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>112, \u00a7 19. If judgment is to be considered as of the term at which it is finally ordered to be made up and recorded, the notes are then barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-7\">If the court might, in its discretion, order the judgment to be made up after such a lapse of time, there was not sufficient evidence of the execution by the respondent of the notes produced, to authorize this judgment to be completed. If the order of the court of common pleas was erroneous, or not made in the exercise of a sound discretion, exceptions lie. Rev. Sts. c. 82, \u00a7 12. <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>2 Cush. 1.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-8\"><em>E. R. Hoar 8f E. A. Kelly, </em>for the petitioner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWB\">were stopped by the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b183-9\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aop\">The court of common pleas undoubtedly had authority to complete their records, in the action on the notes <em>Batch </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>7 Cush. 282. And the order to complete them was made on petition, and after notice to the adverse party, according to a rule of that court, which is like a rule of this court, published in 24 Pick. 396. Whether the court would order the completion of those records was a matter of judicial discretion; and the action of the court, within the limits of its authority, is not a subject of exception. But if these exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>were properly before us, we should overrule them; being of opinion that they do not show that the order was wrongly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The exceptions are dismissed, and the case is to be sent back to the court of common pleas for the execution of their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The court of common pleas ordered the record to be made up and completed, and that the respondent recover of the petitioner full costs in that court and in this; the eighth rule of that court (like the thirty-sixth rule of this court) providing that \u201c the party delinquent in such case shall pay to the clerk the costs of recording the judgment anew, and also the costs on the petition, and the costs of the adverse party, if he shall attend to answer thereto.\u201d To so much of this order as allowed the petitioner costs accrued subsequently to the term of that court at which the record was originally ordered to be amended, the petitioner alleged exceptions, which were argued in this court at October term 1857, and overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
