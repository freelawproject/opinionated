At the time of the accident, there were dwelling-houses and a saw-mill on Water Street, and persons were accustomed to pass over the plank crossing. In August 1854 the public authorities of Lawrence caused sign boards to be put up about eighty feet from the end of Water Street, towards the turnpike, with this notice in large letters on them: \u201c Public are cautioned not to use .this private street, as it is dangerous.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-8\">The plaintiff admitted that Water Street was not a turnpike or highway, but contended that it was \u201c a public way or travelled place, where the defendants were bound to erect sign posts and use all the other securities and precautions prescribed in the Rev. Sts. c. 39, and the acts in addition thereto, when approaching this crossing with their locomotive engines.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-9\">The defendants asked the court to instruct the jury as follows : \u201c 1. That, upon the evidence in this case, the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>are not bound to maintain a sign post at this crossing, and to exercise the precautions prescribed by law at crossings over turnpikes, highways and town ways. <em>2. </em>That the plaintiff, upon the evidence, was upon the railroad at a point where he had no right to be, as against the corporation, and so was not entitled to recover. 3. That the words \u2018 travelled place \u2019 in <em>St. </em>1849, <em>c. 222, </em>apply only to legally authorized ways, and not to private ways or ways not under the control of the public au thorities. 4. That this being a private street, which the authorities had cautioned the public against using, because it was dangerous ; if the plaintiff chose to travel thereon, he did so at his own risk. 5. That the care required of the plaintiff is such as is required of a man travelling upon a way known to be dangerous, and more than would be required of a man passing an ordinary highway in good repair.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-5\">The court declined to give to the jury any of the above instructions except the last one; but did instruct the jury \u201c that if Water Street, where the plaintiff was at the time he was injured, was an open and travelled street in Lawrence, though the said street was not so laid out and established that the city of Lawrence would be responsible for damages occasioned by defects therein, yet said street would be a travelled way, within the meaning of the <em>St. </em>of 1849, <em>c. 222, </em>\u00a7 <em>2, </em>and the defendants would be bound to maintain a sign post at this crossing, and to use and exercise there all the other securities and precautions prescribed by the Rev. Sts. c. 39.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-7\"><em>C.
