The learned justice, on considering the evidence, determined that the violation complained of was complete. And so it appears upon an examination of the advertisement in question. It was so apparent, indeed so flagrant, that it is hardly worth serious consideration. The defendant said: \u201cWe desire to <em>state that the </em>recent decision by Judge Lawrence in a suit brought against us by our competitors in trade is not a final disposition of the case.\u201d And then in reference to a recent decision in the Philadelphia courts it is said: \u201cIn these cases our right to use our corporate name and trade-mark were fully sustained, and we are confident that upon the final hearing of the case upon its merits our rights in the city of New York will also be sustained by the New York court.\u201d This was a substantial denial of the right of the plaintiff to use the designation, and the decision of the court below was not only proper but imperatively demanded by the evidence. Por these reasons the order should, be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
