F, Coston against Benjamin F. Morris, to recover for services rendered by plaintiff in manufacturing a rocket gun and rockets for life-saving purposes. The defendant alleged that the price charged therefor was excessive, and not in accordance with a written estimate given to him before he ordered the goods. He also denied plaintiff\u2019s right to recover for services rendered in attending a trial of the rocket gun, and contended that an order of reference was not proper. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals. '</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b109-15\">Argued before Barnard, P.

The price of goods was adopted in accordance with trie written estimate, and not according to the inflated valuation of the plaintiff. It is not denied that plaintiff attended the trials of the gun at defendant\u2019s request, and it is not claimed that there was any agreement that the services should be gratuitous. No different value was suggested for that service than the one testified to by plaintiff, which we cannot say was exorbitant. The reference was assented to by defendant as a condition of postponement of the trial, and the order thereupon made was regular. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
