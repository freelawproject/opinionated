A reargument, therefore, cannot be granted under the rules laid down and adhered to by this court. <em>Curley </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>5 Daly, 283. The-appellant seeks to present again to the court for further consideration the same points urged upon the argument of the appeal. The refusals of the referee to find as requested by defendant were before the court, and there is nothing to-show that the exceptions to such refusals were disregarded. The record shows that the facts as to which defendant requested findings were not supported\"by uncontradicted evidence. The sum of $853.73 paid by Gillespie on August lltli were not paid in settlement of the bills mentioned in defendant\u2019s fourth request, but were paid on another account, and credited at first by a mistake, which was afterwards rectified. The fourth finding of fact negatives the finding as requested by defendant, and brings before the court for review the same question which defendant\u2019s exception raised, and which was the principal contention on the appeal. The general term considered and disposed of it. Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
