The consignee\u2019s daughter afterwards called at defendant\u2019s office, and directed the package to be sent to her mother\u2019s store. No authority in the daughter to give the order was shown. The package was then carried to the consignee\u2019s store, and delivered to one W., who was behind the counter, and appeared to be a clerk. W. receipted for the package in his own name. The consignee denied that W. had any authority to receive goods for her. It was held by the common pleas that the evidence was not sufficient to prove W. an agent of the consignee. <em>Held, </em>that leave to appeal to the court of appeals would be refused.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-8\">Motion for leave to appeal to the court of appeals.

There can be no doubt as to the opinion of the court of appeals on that subject. <em>Leslie </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>63 N. Y. 27; <em>Svenson </em>v. <em>Steam-Ship Co., </em>57 N. Y. 108. The district court, and the former general term of this court, were of the ppinion that the inference to be drawn from the presence of Warschofsky behind the counter of Mrs. Frankel\u2019s store (which, for aught that appears to the contrary, was without the knowledge or consent of Mrs. Frankel, and merely,a momentary and accidental occurrence) was not sufficient to overthrow Mrs. Frankel\u2019s denial that she ever purchased the goods, or that she ever gave to any one authority to receive them. It was also proved that Mrs. Frankel refused to take the goods when they were tendered to her, and that Warschofsky signed the receipt to the express company in his own name, and not in the name of Mrs. Frankel; showing that he did not profess to act as her agent. It was not that no force or consideration was given to the presumption arising from the presence of Warschofsky behind the counter of Mrs. Frankel\u2019s store, but for the reason that the presumption was rebutted and overcome, that judgment against the express company was given. Leave to go to the court of appeals denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
