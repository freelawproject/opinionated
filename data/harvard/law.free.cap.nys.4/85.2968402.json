The company has two routes, crossing each other at right angles,\u2014one through Hudson avenue, and the other through Myrtle avenue. To avoid\u00abthe danger of collision at this point, the company decided to turn its Hudson-A venue trains into Myrtle avenue, instead of allowing them to cross the latter. In order to provide the curve required for this purpose, it is necessary to acquire the corner property, owned by Levy and others. The rapid transit act, \u00a7 17, (Laws 1875, c. 606,) under which the company was formed, gives such companies \u2018\u2018the right to acquire and hold such real estate, or interest therein, as may be necessary to enable them to construct, maintain, and operate the said railway or railways.\u2019\u2019 The application was granted, and the property owners appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b105-12\">Argued before Barnard, P.

Experience has shown that to carry on the operation of the road in the restricted manner first attempted will expose the public to great danger. Were the charter a narrow one, the court might well feel itself called upon to be astute in construing the charter in aid of the public welfare. Ho such necessity is imposed upon it. The charter is amply broad to convey the power to erect all needed appurtenances. As was well said.by the judge at special term, to hold that this road could compel a connection with the roads of other corporations, and was yet without the power to connect its own branches, would be an absurdity. Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
