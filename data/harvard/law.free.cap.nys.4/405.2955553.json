The arrear, thus ascertained, not being a new tax, but an abatement of the old, the objection that the legislature cannot delegate the power of taxation, within an incorporated city, to a commission newly created by itself, is irrelevant.

White against George S. Wheeler and others. Verdict was directed for plaintiff, and defendants\u2019 exceptions ordered to be heard at general term. Plaintiff claims title under tax deeds based on Laws iST. Y. 1883, c. 114, relating to arrearage tax sales in the city of Brooklyn. For an abstract of that act, see <em>Terrill </em>v. <em>Wheeler, 2 N. </em>Y. Supp. 86. Code Civil Proc. FT. Y. \u00a7 1531, referred to in the opinion, is as follows: \u201cIn an action brought as described in this article, [action to recover real property,] the plaintiff, where he recovers judgment for the property, or possession of the property, is entitled to recover, as damages, the rents and profits, or the value of the use and occupation of the real property recovered, for a term not exceeding six years; but the damages shall not include the value of the use of any improvements made by the defendant, or those under whom he claims. * * *\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b425-19\">Argued before Barnard, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-D\">It is provided by chapter 114, Laws 1883, under which the sale in question was made, that the purchaser \u201cshall take a good and suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ficient title in fee-simple absolute to the property sold, of which the said deed shall be presumptive evidence.\u201d The objection that it was not in the power of the legislature to so declare is not good. The power has been usually exercised in official sales for taxes. The same provision exists as to state comptroller\u2019s deed, except that the words are absolute,\u2014\u201cshall vest in the grantee an absolute estate in fee-simple.\u201d 2 Rev. St. (Banks\u2019 7th Ed. 1028,) \u00a7 63. The court of appeals made no question of the power of the legislature, but permitted proof of irregularities to destroy the conveyance. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Elwood, </em>53 N. Y. 431. Chapter 65, Laws 1878, and chapter 573, Laws 1880, make similar deeds on tax sales evidence of title. The present law makes the cleed presumptive evidence of title, thus in words making the conveyance conform in legal effect to the decision of the court of appeals as to deeds where the words are absolute as to the transfer of title. The plaintiff is therefore bound to prove nothing but his deed, and his title was presumed. If he was to prove the negative as to the non-payment of the tax to authorize the sale, the presumption of the deed is of no value to him. The uniform presumption is in favor of the performance of official duty. In the absence of proof to the contrary, the sale will and must be deemed to be based upon an existing arrear.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The proof shows that there had been a ward map before this assessment was levied, and that a new one had been made. The charter requires that all assessments must refer \u201cto said maps.\u201d The charter referred to maps \u201cmade or to be made, \u201d and required further that they should remain with the assessors. The old map referred to these lots by one designation and number, and the new map referred to them by different numbers, but according to the number on the new map. There was no necessity for the assessors to refer to both maps. Both maps were in the office, but only one was used-as a basis for assessment, and that was in the assessors\u2019 office for reference for any tax-payer. A reference to any former map is not required by the charter. The case shows that the board of assessors mads their certificate, and delivered the same to the register of arrears. The advertisement of sale, by the terms of the act, must state the ward in which the property to be sold is situate, but shall state that further particulars could be obtained at the register\u2019s office, \u201cand it shall not be necessary to include any further particulars of the property to be sold. \u201d If the land was assessed properly, and the arrears properly determined, and advertised properly, it is of no moment that the register, as. a further description to that given by the map numbers, which was contained in his certificate, also added the number of feet in a named street. It was an addition to the certificate required by law, and designed to aid the tax-payer by giving a more specific description. The evidence of the rental value was proper, under section 1531 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The question of the validity of the arrears law was decided at the May term of this court, in the case of <em>Terrill </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>2 N. Y. Supp. 86. We held in that case that the act was not in violation of the constitution, and until the court of appeals passes upon the question that conclusion is controlling in all actions involving the validity of the principles of the act itself. The exceptions should be overruled, and the plaintiff have judgment on the verdict, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
