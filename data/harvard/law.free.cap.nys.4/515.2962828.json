Maxim against the town of Champion, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff by falling from an embankment or bridge across a ravine in defendant town; said embankment being a part of the public highway. The evidence showed that plaintiff was mot familiar with the locality, and that the accident occurred about 9 o\u2019clock .at night. He testified: \u201cIt was very dark and rainy. I thought we had gone about far enough, and began to look around for the turn. I had never \u00a1been over the road before, except that portion of it lying between the cheese factory and the village. I had never been on the road at the place where the .accident occurred, before. * * * In hunting for the turn, I stepped down -this embankment, and got started under headway, and consequently went off from the bridge or culvert, down this incline-way, like a gable roof. It was \u25a0 so dark I couldn\u2019t see, and, by this hollow or ravine looking darker than anything else around, I took it to be the road; and after I got started down this .slant from the road-bed to the edge of the wall I got started with such force \u2022that I couldn\u2019t save myself, and went off from the bridge, and struck the rocks below. * * * The bottom of the gully is covered with rocks and stones that had fallen off from the wall. They were laid up along the sides of the culvert, laying there on the rocks. The perpendicular height is eleven .feet. At the place the side is perpendicular. The road measures about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>twenty-four feet from retaining wall to retaining wall. The road-bed itself' is ten feet wide. There is a slope of seven feet from the outer edge on each side of the road-bed to the retaining wall, and top of the retaining wall is two- and a half feet lower than the level of the road-bed. The highway is two and a half feet higher than the top of the wall on the side I went off, and three- and a half feet on the other side. The slope is something like the gable roof of a house. The bridge or embankment is about three rods in length. There-are no guards or barriers along this highway on either side; nothing to prevent persons from going off.\u201d Another witness testified: \u201cWhere the embankment is there is a gully and bridge over the creek, built upon the embankment. There is a retaining wall on each side,\u2014a dry stone wall. It is made for the purpose of a bridge, and has a box culvert underneath it. The-bridge proper is covered with logs, and then stones and dirt built over it. The-walls are about eleven feet high at the highest point, and run out to nothing on either end, but at the creek the highest height is eleven feet. The walls-are about eleven feet high. Right over the creek they are about <em>24 </em>feet apart. It is a rough, dry wall, laid up in some places two or three feet higher than the others. There is no railing there whatever, and this dirt is filled in between the two walls, and ridged up in the center. If I was driving I would not want to let a team pass me on this embankment.\u201d Defendant gave evidence tending to establish the fact that the embankment had been in substantially the same condition for the last 68 years, and that no railing had ever been erected along its sides. Judgment was entered for plaintiff upon a verdict for $2,000, and defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b536-5\">Argued before Hardin, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aax\">Carefully and clearly the trial judge submitted the question* of fact to the jury, in respect to whether or not the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence on the occasion of receiving the injuries complained of. We think the evidence warranted the submission of that question to the* jury, and that their verdict is conclusive upon that aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The trial judge also submitted to the jury, upon the whole evidence, the question whether \u201c this road at the point where this accident occurred, on and prior to the date of the accident, was in a reasonably safe and suitable condition for the public travel; that is, whether the commissioners kept it in such repair and in such condition at that point as that it was reasonably safe, and suitable for public travel. \u201d He also instructed the jury, viz.: \u201c Highway-commissioners do not undertake for the absolute safety of the highways of' the town. They are only required to do what is reasonable\u2014what is reasonable and proper under all the circumstances\u2014for the purpose of keeping the-roads in such repair that they shall be reasonably suitable for the public-travel. \u201d At the close of the charge the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the-court to \u201ccharge the jury that there can be no recovery in this fiction, except for an omission to provide a railing upon the embankment. \u201d The court remarked, viz.: \u201cA railing or some guard.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cRailing- or barrier.\u201d Court: \u201cI think I will charge that. What I mean is, I don\u2019t, think that the jury could be allowed to say that these commissioners ought to have built this road over, or made it wider. I do not see any neglect that, fairly, they could be charged with here, unless it be a neglect to furnish some barrier or rail to prevent a person going off at night. \u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel further requested the court to charge \u201cthat there can be no recovery in' this action by the plaintiff, unless the accident which happened to him was to have been reasonably foreseen by a prudent man as likely to happen to a person traveling the road-way and using ordinary care.\u201d To that request the-court responded: \u201cYes; if I understand that correctly. Of course, traveling at such a time, and under such circumstances, the plaintiff claims that this. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>was such an accident as even the commissioners should have foreseen.\u201d Thereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel further requested the court to charge, viz.: \u201cThat the commissioners of highways were not bound to erect railings which would protect travelers on the outside of the usually traveled portion of the highway.\u201d The court replied: \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand that proposition. I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cI mean to say if a man was outside, traveling along outside of the usually traveled portion of this highway, that they were not bound to erect a railing which would protect him against the danger of running off this embankment.\u201d Thereupon the court responded as follows: \u201cCertainly, if a man attempted to travel outside of the highway, I charge it; but if you mean a man who, without intention to do so, gets oiit of the traveled part of the highway, and falls over, that he should not be protected, that I cannot charge.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge, \u201calso, that the fact that no accident had occurred at the place before is cogent proof of the absence of negligence on the part of the defendant.\u201d The court responded: \u201cI say that is evidence which the jury may consider; but I refuse to say that it is cogent evidence in this case. * * * I leave it for the jury to say how valuable the evidence is in this case, and to give it such weight as they deem proper. \u201d The defendant took an exception. The defendant\u2019s counsel further requested the court \u201cto charge the jury that failing to erect guards or barriers does not constitute negligence on the part of the defendant.\u201d To that request the court responded: \u201cI refuse to charge that; I refuse to charge that it does. I leave it for the jury to say whether it does or not.\u201d The defendant excepted. Defendant\u2019s counsel also asked the court \u201cto charge that there is no evidence in the case that warrants a finding that the road in question was out of repair.\u201d The court responded: \u201cI refuse to charge that; I leave that for the jury to say whether it was out of repair or nut;\u201d and the defendant took an exception. The defendant\u2019s counsel also asked the court to instruct the jury \u201cthat they are not to consider the condition of the highway, except as it bears upon the question of the necessity of barriers.\u201d To that the court responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think I can charge that, that they ought not to consider the condition of the highway. I do not leave any other ground of negligence to them. They cannot charge the commissioners of highways with negligence in not having a wider filling there, or not having a different shaped road. I charge, in other words, practically, that the only ground of negligence is the question whether they ought to have had on such road as that, under those circumstances, a barrier or rail. If that is what you mean, I charge it.\u201d The defendant took an exception to the \u201csubmission of the case to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Trustees, </em>44 Barb. 386, a question was presented very similar to the one before us. In that case it appeared that \u201con the upper side of the road is a high bank, and on' the lower side also a steep, precipitous bank, forty-one feet high, at the foot of which Bondout creek flows. The road is directly on the edge of the bank, and there was no guard or fender there to prevent a wagon and horse from going off.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s horse shied on account of some boatmen below the hill swinging lights, backed, and went over into the creek with load and all. The plaintiff recovered a verdict; and in the charge to the jury the court, among other things, instructed the jury to pass upon the question: \u201cWhether it was or was not the duty of the defendants to put a guard at the point where the injury occurred; whether it was or was not negligence in omitting to do so.\u201d In the course of the opinion delivered by Hogeboom, J., it is said, viz.: \u201cIt would appear to be sufficiently obvious that the duty of keeping a bridge or a highway in repair extended not merely to the floor of the bridge or the road-bed of a highway, but to proper guards or railing on their sides or borders, where necessary for the safety or protection of the public, but the point has been repeatedly adjudicated.\u201d <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Andover, </em>2 Cush. 600; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Inhab</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>itants of Attleborough, </em>7 Gray, 338; <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>35 N. H. 271. The opinion concludes with an assertion that it was a question for the jury to determine \u201c whether the place where the accident occurred required a guard or barrier in order to the safety and protection of travelers, and whether the defendants were guilty of actual negligence in not constructing such guard or barrier. \u201d The verdict was sustained, and the case was taken to the court of appeals, and affirmed in 41 N. Y. 619. That case is referred to in <em>Monk </em>v. <em>Town of New Utrecht, </em>104 N. Y. 557, 11 N. E. Rep. 268. The same principle was approved by this court in <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Clement, </em>24 Hun, 472, and the following language is used in respect thereto: \u201cIt is difficult in this case to suppose the defendants performed their duty if, during the two years they knew that the approach wras unsafe and insecure and the place dangerous, they omitted to repair it or guard it by the expenditure of five dollars of the funds passing through their hands in that period.\u201d That case was cited approvingly in <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>29 Hun, 187, and referred to andAommented upon in 24 Alb. Law J. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The principle is laid down in Shear. <em>&amp; </em>R. Heg. \u00a7\u00a7 390, 391. In the latter section cited it is said: \u201cThus it is gross negligence to construct a passageway along a precipice without having sufficient guards for the protection of travelers. \u201d And in Whart. Heg. \u00a7 974, it is said: \u201c The absence of any guard! or railing at the side of a bridge forming part of a highway is a fact from which the jury may find that the bridge was defective, within the meaning of the statute rendering towns liable for injuries resulting from defective highways;\u201d and in section 976 the same author says, viz.: \u201cThe true test (as to negligence in fencing roads) is whether there is such a risk of a traveler, using ordinary care in passing along a street, being thrown or falling into the dangerous way, (adjoining the highway,) that a railing is requisite to make the place safe and convenient. Hence a municipal corporation, charged with building and repairing roads, is guilty of negligence in constructing a passage-way by the side of a hill without sufficient guards to protect travelers. \u201d And 2 Dillon on Municipal Corporations (section 1004) states, viz.: \u201cWant of a railing, when necessary, is an actionable defect.\u201d In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>34 N. Y. 389, Peckhah, J., said: \u201cA failure to keep a public highway in repair by those who have assumed that duty from the state, so that it is unsafe to travel over, is a public nuisance, making the party bound to repair liable to indictment for the nuisance, and to an action at the suit of any one who has sustained special damage. There is no decision in our courts at war with these principles;\u201d citing <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>8 Cow. 151; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>24 Barb. 170; <em>Adsit </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>4 Hill, 630. In <em>Weed </em>v. <em>Village of Ballston Spa, </em>76 N. Y. 332, the injury sustained by plaintiff was in consequence of a trench, extended from near the gutter several feet into the street. The finding was that the barrier was insufficient. By reason thereof plaintiff was injured, and the defendant was held liable and chargeable with \u201cnegligence in not abating the nuisance, or so guarding the excavation as to prevent accident to persons using the streets. \u201d And it was further held that a person traveling-upon a highway is, as a \u201cgeneral rule, justified in assuming that it is safe.\u201d In <em>Morrell </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>88 N. Y. 398, it appeared that the injuries were received because the-bridge was, at the time of the accident, \u201c without any guards or railing to protect passengers, and- had been knowingly and negligently left so by defendants ; that plaintiff, who was walking in the traveled track of the highway,, in the evening, encountering a loaded team on the bridge, stepped aside to allow it to pass, and in so doing, without negligence or fault on his part, fell over the unprotected side of the bridge and was injured.\u201d The verdict for the-plaintiff was sustained. In <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>73 N. Y. 368, a horse was injured by reason of the absence of a string-piece, by backing off a dock, which the defendant was charged with the duty of keeping in repair; and the court-observed, viz.: \u201cThe absence of the string-piece must, for the purpose of the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>action, be deemed, to be proximate cause of the loss. * * * The city was charged with the duty of keeping the dock in a safe condition, and if in using it in the customary way the plaintiff\u2019s horse, without his negligence, was lost, the city is liable, although the horse was not, at the moment, obedient to the will of the owner. \u201d In <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Andover, </em>2 Cush. 600, it was held that a liability attached for an injury \u201calleged to have been caused by a defect in a highway occasioned by the want of a rail or barrier, * * * if such rail or barrier were necessary for the proper security of travelers, and would have prevented happening of the injury complained of.\u201d The court remarked, in delivering the opinion in the case, viz.: \u201cTo guard against damage by such accidents the law requires suitable railings and barriers, a proper width to the road, and whatever may be reasonably required for the safety of the traveler. \u201d Tiie same doctrine was asserted in <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Attleborough, </em>7 Gray, 338. A like doctrine was held in <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Dorchester, </em>6 Cush. 396. The absence of a railing which would have prevented an accident was held to be sufficient ground for a liability on the part of the town. See, also, <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>35 N. H. 271; <em>Willey </em>v. <em>Portsmouth, </em>Id. 304; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>41 N. H. 329; <em>Joliet </em>v. <em>Verley, </em>35 Ill. 58; <em>Houfe </em>v. <em>Town of Pulton, </em>29 Wis. 296; <em>Hey </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>81 Pa. St. 44. In <em>Jewhurst </em>v. <em>City of Syracuse, </em>108 N. Y. 303, 15 N. E. Rep. 409, it was held that \u201c where there is no visible boundary to the line of a street, and a portion of the roadway traveled on is so near the line, although really outside of the street, as to induce the belief in any one passing upon the street and exercising reasonable care that he is within the line thereof, if such portion-is for any reason rendered dangerous for travel, and the city has notice thereof, and such danger can be remedied by the exercise of reasonable care, either by the erection of a guard or railing along the line of the street, or in some other way, and the city neglects to do thi\u00e1, it is liable to one injured because of such defect while traveling upon such portion of the road-way, if he himself is free from any contributory negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We are of the opinion that the learned trial judge, in committing the case to the jury, kept within the principles laid down in cases to which we have referred; but it is insisted by the learned counsel for the appellant that if the commissioners of highways omitted to erect a barrier or guard along the wall where the plaintiff received the injury, that such omission was \u201cof a judicial character, and could not be redressed in an action for damages, \u201d and in support of his argument in that aspect of the case he calls our attention to <em>Urquhart </em>v. <em>City of Ogdensburg, </em>91 N. Y. 67. That was a case where power was conferred upon a municipal corporation to make local improvements, and it was held that the exercise of the power was <em>\u201cquasi </em>judicial or discretionary, and for a failure to act on an erroneous estimate of the public needs a civil action cannot be maintained against it; and that where the injury was alleged to have been occasioned by an alleged defect in the plan upon which the sidewalk was constructed, in that the slope was too great, furnished no foundation for a recovery.\u201d That case was again before the court in 97 N. Y. 238, and it was there held that \u201c where a change in the grade or slope has been made by the owner of adjoining premises in rebuilding, making the sidewalk dangerous for travel, an omission on the part of the corporation, after notice, to take any action in reference to the matter, is not a defense in an action brought against it to recover damages for injuries caused by the defect. \u201d We think that case does not stand in the way of the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel also urges upon our attention the case of <em>Monk </em>v. <em>Town of New Utrecht, </em>104 N. Y. 552, 11 N. E. Rep. 268. That was a case where Eighty-Sixth street was laid out under special statutes by commissioners appointed in virtue thereof. Laws 1869, c. 670; Laws 1873, c. 364. The street was laid out with a road-bed 60 feet wide, planked on either side by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>sidewalks 11 feet wide, raised about a foot above the level of the road, bordered near the gutter with a row of trees. It was th^re held that the omission to erect a railing or a fence at the top of the bank was a defect incident to the plan of the road, and the learned chief judge, in delivering the opinion, says, viz.: \u201cThe town had furnished a safe and sufficient road-way of usual width, whose boundaries were indicated on either side by a gutter and elevated sidewalk, bordered by rows of trees, and was under no obligation to erect barriers to prevent travelers from wandering into the adjoining fields. No possible difficulty existed in this case to prevent a traveler from following either the road or sidewalk by marks which could both be seen and felt; and it would be imposing a burden beyond all precedent to require a town to remove irregularities in the surface of the land, outside of the road, for fear that some traveler might wander there, and thus sustain injury.\u201d We think that case is clearly distinguishable from the one before us. There, in addition to what we have already said in respect to it, it appeared very clearly that the plaintiff had been \u201cdrinking heavily,\u201d and was guilty of contributory negligence. Nor do we see anything in <em>Hubbell </em>v. <em>City of </em>Yonkers, 104 N. Y. 434, 10 N. E. Rep. 858, which aids the appellant. In that case the accident was one of \u201ca class so rare, unexpected, and unforeseen, defendant could not be charged with negligence for a failure to guard against it.\u201d And the opinion delivered in that case recognizes the authority of <em>Kennedy </em>v. Mayor, 73 N. Y. 365, and <em>Macauley </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>67 N. Y. 602. And the learned judge who delivered the opinion, after referring to several cases cited to establish the duty of a town or city to guard the edge of a road passing along a precipice, observes, viz.: \u201cThose are cases where the road-way itself runs along such a place, and danger, from the want of a railing, was naturally to be apprehended; while here the road-way was perfectly safe, in first-class condition, bounded by a gutter or curb-stone eight inches high, and ten feet of sidewalk, and where no danger from the embankment was possible until the horse should leave the road, drag his wagon over this curb-stone and sidewalk, and then fall over the exposed place. * * * The same reasons prevail as to railings on a bridge, for their absence would strike every one as a plain, if not criminal, neglect of even ordinary care.\u201d And it was concluded in that case that the injury resulted from a cause too remote, and that, considering the facts in that case, the exposed places or dangerous places were not such that a failure to guard them with railings could fairly be called negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">It was insisted by the defendant that, because no injury had resulted from the roads being substantially in the same condition for 68 years, the \u201ccommissioners and the defendant are exonerated from any negligence in continuing the highway in its then condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We think the trial judge properly passed upon that question when he determined to submit the question to the jury with the instruction that that circumstance should be considered by the jury, and that he was warranted in the position announced, that he would \u201cleave it for the jury to say how valuable the evidence is in this case, and to give it such weight as they deem proper.\u201d We are of the opinion that no error was committed by the judge in refusing to charge the jury \u201cthat a failure to erect guards or barriers does not constitute negligence on the part of the defendant, \u201d and that his position that he would \u201cleave it for the jury to say whether it does or not\u201d was correct. Since the passage of chapter 700 of the Laws of 1881, imposing a liability upon towns \u201cfor all damages to person or property by reason of defective highways or bridges in such town in cases in which the commissioner or commissioners of highways of said towns are now by law liable therefor, instead of such commissioner or commissioners of highways,\u201d actions may be maintained against the town if the evidence would warrant the recovery against the commissioners of highways, but for the passage of the statute. In <em>Bidwell </em>v. <em>Town of Murray, </em>40 Hun, 192, the court, in speaking of the duties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>commissioners of highways of the town to use ordinary care to keep the bridges in the town in suitable repair for the purpose of the public travel over them, and declaring that a failure^gives a right of recovery to persons suffering damages occasioned by such neglect, the court adds, viz.: \u201cThis is an active duty of the commissioners, in so far that they are required to use reasonable diligence to ascertain the situation of the bridges and highway\u2019s of their respective towns; and, although they do not have actual notice of defective condition, they may be chargeable with notice of the defects which would have come to their observation by the use of reasonable diligence.\u201d We are of the opinion that the verdict before us establishes that the commissioners of highways of the town of Champion had not discharged their duty in the premises. Therefore the town of Champion, by reason of the negligence of the commissioners, was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries which he sustained. The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
