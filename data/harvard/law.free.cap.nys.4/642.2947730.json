Within the upper semi-circle are the words \u201cFleischmann &amp; Co.\u2019s,\u201d printed circularly, and in the lower are the words \u201cCompressed Yeast,\u201d each word forming a line. These five words and characters are in comparatively large type. Within these are the words \u201cNone Genuine, \u201d also printed circularly, and in somewhat smaller type, and the words \u201cWithout Our <em>Fae Simile </em>Signature,\u201d in small type, each of the words \u201cWithout\u201d and \u201cOur\u201d forming a line, and the words <em>\u201cFae Simile </em>Signature\u201d forming a line on the diameter of the circle. Between these latter words and the words \u201cCompressed Yeast,\u201d above mentioned, is the <em>fae simile </em>of the signature \u201cFleischmann &amp; Co.,\u201d printed very finely in one line. The label is square, and of a yellow color, and across the lower right-hand corner, without the circle, is the word \u201cPatented.\u201d Defendant\u2019s label is also square, and of about the same size, and of about the same shade of yellow. On it are four lines, forming a square, whose sides are parallel with the corresponding margins of the label. Within the square the words \u201cAtlantic Yeast Company\u201d in prominent letters, and the words \u201cS. Newman, Prop.,\u201d in small script, form a circle, of which the latter words are the lower arc. Within the upper arc the words \u201cNone Genuine\u201d form an arc in letters of medium size, and the words \u201cWithout My Signature. S. Newman, Prop. Compressed Yeast,\u201d form five lines, of which the first three are in two lines in the same type, and the words \u201cS. Newman, Prop.,\u201d are in one line on the diameter, and the words \u201cCompressed Yeast\u201d are in two lines in the lower semi-circle; the latter five words and letters being in somewhat heavier type. The letters used on defendant\u2019s label are prominent, as compared with those used on plaintiffs\u2019 label. Several labels used by the various proprietors of compressed yeast were given in evidence, all of which were yellow in color, though the shades were various, and were square, and of about the same size as the labels of the parties. On all of these labels the words \u201c Compressed Yeast\u201d were used. Black ink only was used on all the labels, including those of the parties.

These findings are borne out fully by the evidence in the ease. Specimens, not only of the labels used by the parties, but of the packages designed for the trade also, have been submitted on this appeal to our inspection; and it appears therefrom that there is such a great dissimilarity between the two that no charge of simulating or infringing the plaintiffs\u2019 trade-mark, or of imitating the design in which their packages are wrapped, can be maintained against the defendant. The only point of similarity between the two is in the shade of yellow which the ground-work of the labels has. In the case of both plaintiffs and defendant, the shade is lighter than that used by other dealers for 12 years past. But each has its distinctive characteristics, none of which would, be liable to mislead even a careless purchaser, as may plainly be seen by an inspection of the labels contained in the preliminary statement. Under these circumstances, the defendant cannot be deemed to have simulated the design of the plaintiffs\u2019 package, so as to give a right of action against him, for the simple reason that he has done no more than other dealers have done in putting up packages of this description, which must necessarily be of about a prescribed size in order to be marketable, and there is no law of this state which prohibits a manufacturer or dealer from using the words \u201cCompressed Yeast.\u201d The manufacture of this article is open to all competitors, and they cannot be held liable in any action to restrain them where they plainly put their name upon the label, even though they do happen to use light yellow for the background of the paper upon which the description of the commodity is given. <em>Enoch Morgan's Sons\u2019 Co. </em>v. <em>Troxell, </em>89 N. Y. 292. Under these circumstances the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
