The certificate was conclusive upon the taxing officer, <em>(Lillis </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>8 Hun, 280,) and he therefore committed no error in entering judgment so as to include costs. I do not believe that the granting of a certificate is such an intermediate order as is when specified in the notice of appeal brought up for review by an appeal from a final judgment, and therefore I think there can be no available exception to the granting of a certificate. To my mind, therefore, no ground for the reversal or modification of the judgment has been presented. If the certificate was improperly granted, it may be set aside on a motion made for that purpose. <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>6 Wend. 555. It seems that no order granting the motion for a certificate was formally made or entered; and so, as the matter stands, the defendant\u2019s remedy, if aggrieved, is by motion, and not by appeal. The appeal must be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">Sedgwick, C. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
