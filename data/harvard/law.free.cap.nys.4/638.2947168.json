It was for breaking this latter pipe that the action was brought. Qua, plaintiff\u2019s superintendent, testified that McIntyre said that if the company laid the pipe he wanted to be paid for it, and $50 would be satisfactory; that witness said that he had nothing to do with making the trade, but would report.

The plaintiff acquired a right to lay pipe along the line definitely described therein by courses and distances, and not elsewhere. Nor was any right to lay pipe elsewhere acquired by the conversations between Qua and McIntyre; certainly no right which could not be revoked at any time. The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
