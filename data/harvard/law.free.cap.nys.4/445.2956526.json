The fact of ownership, and that the premises abutted on the street, must be presumed to have been proved by competent evidence. A photograph of the house in question was received in evidence, but is not printed with the case. There is no evidence to show how Fifty-Third street in front of the premises in question was opened as a street, or as to the ownership of the fee of the street. The abutting owners were therefore presumed to own the fee of the street. See <em>Wager </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>25 N. Y. 529, where Smith, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201cIt is an established inference of the common law that the proprietors of the land adjoining a public highway are the owners of the fee of said highway; that the rights of the public therein and thereto are no higher or other than those of a mere easement; and that the proprietors on each side presumptively own the soil in fee to the center of the highway. There is no distinction in this respect between the streets of a city and highway in the country. \" The plaintiff being presumed to be the owner of the fee of Fifty-Third street, the erection of the defendant\u2019s structure on the street was an encroachment upon her freehold, and a trespass. <em>Wager </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., supra. </em>It was therefore no error to deny the motion of the defendant to dismiss the complaint, and the motion to direct a verdict for nominal damages only. As the only exceptions that appear in the case are the exceptions to these rulings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>no other question is presented. The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\">Freedman, J. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
