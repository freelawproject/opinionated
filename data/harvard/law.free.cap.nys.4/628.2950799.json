They were not irrelevant to the position taken by the defendant, either as a defense or by way of counter-claim. Her position may not have been correct. That could not be determined against her, on the motion to strike out matter as irrelevant. The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Truax, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
