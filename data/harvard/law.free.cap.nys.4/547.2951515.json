I think the use of this property by the plaintiff is that of an almshouse, as defined by the court of appeals in the case of <em>Association </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>104 N. Y. 587, 12 N. E. Rep. 279, and that it was exempt on that ground from taxation. I think, therefore, plaintiff is \u2022entitled to judgment declaring the property described exempt from taxation, .and that said taxes are illegal and void, and directing the cancellation thereof .upon the books and records of the defendant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
