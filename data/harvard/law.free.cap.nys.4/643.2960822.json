The defendant claimed that the horses had entered upon the track through a bar-way at a farm crossing. Judgment was given for plaintiff, and defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b663-10\">Argued before Hardin, P.

On the former trial there was no evidence that the bar-way had been open for any length of time before the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>accident, while on the last trial there was proof that the bars had been down for at least three months before. As the evidence stood upon the last trial, we do not think the court would have been justified in directing the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, if they found that the horses entered upon the track through the bar-way. But it was conceded by the defendant that if the plaintiff\u2019s horses entered upon the defendant\u2019s track through the burned opening in its fence, plaintiff was entitled to recover in this ease. On the last trial that specific question was submitted to the jury, and they found that the horses entered upon the track through the burned opening in the defendant\u2019s fence. That question was fairly submitted to the jury upon sufficient evidence to sustain their finding, and.the verdict should, we think, be upheld. The jury having found that the horses did not enter upon the track where the defendant claimed they did, it becomes unnecessary to consider what the defendant\u2019s liability might have been if the jury had found otherwise. We have examined the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the rulings and charge of the court, but have found none that would justify a reversal of the judgment, or that require special discussion. Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
