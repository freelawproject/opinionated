The defendants demurred severally, on the ground that the complaint did not state a cause of action. The court below sustained the demurrer, and upon the decision then made the judgment was entered, and from this the present appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The plaintiff was not a party to the accounting, and the final adjudication was not in his behalf, in the sense that it would give him a cause of action upon it directly. Up to the time of the adjudication, the plaintiff\u2019s rights were confined to a cause of action he had against Campbell personally, and not relatively as assignee. This cause of action was not affected by the conduct of the parties to the accounting. As he was not bound by the adjudication, so he could not take advantage of it as an adjudication, and if Campbell was not liable to the plaintiff upon it, Campbell\u2019s sureties would not be liable. If any use could be made of the adjudication iti an action between the plaintiff and Campbell, the action it would tend to support would be against Campbell personally, and not as assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The learned counsel for appellant claims that the direction of the order to pay to the plaintiff established a duty upon Campbell, as assignee, to pay to the plaintiff, and the failure to perform this duty made the sureties liable. The single phrase that directs the payment is not to be taken and construed by itself, its meaning and effect are to be ascertained from it and its connections in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The plaintiff had no claim against the estate. He did not present a claim. If that were necessary to the formation of a cause of action, it was to be pleaded. There is therefore no adjudication, as in <em>Casoni </em>v. <em>Jerome, </em>58 N. Y. 315, that he had a claim. In <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>81 N. Y. 29, it appears that the attorney who made the claim must have been a party to the proceedings before the surrogate, for he was the respondent in the appeal. It is clear that on the accounting the claim made by Campbell as to this matter was not made as assignee. It was made for himself, individually and personally. He personally was giving account of his action as assignee. He took the position that he had become personally liable for services of the plaintiff. If he had paid for those services he would have had a right to reimbursement of the money he had paid. If, as in this case, he had not paid, he would have a right\u2014as indeed was competently adjudged\u2014to obtain leave to pay for the services out of funds of the estate. If he then paid, the transaction would be in effect the transfer of money held by him as assignee to himself personally, and then the payment of it in discharge of his own obligation. Such a pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ment would be payment by him personally, and not as assignee. The neglect to pay would not be an omission of duty as assignee. So long as payment was not made, the money would be part of the assigned estate. There might be a ease where it would be his duty to refuse to pay, even after provision for reimbursement had been made. When the provision was made for the future payment, it was implied that the payment was to be necessarily made for the purpose indicated. The fund was not to be left in his hands, or set apart for any purpose other than a disbursement. So that the direction to pay to the attorney was not more than a direction to perform the condition upon which Campbell\u2019s right to have the fund set apart depended. As in all that would follow the order Campbell would act for his own personal interest, and not as assignee, I am of opinion that the omission to pay to the attorney was not a breach of duty by Campbell as assignee, and therefore that the sureties are not liable for the omission. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Truax, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
