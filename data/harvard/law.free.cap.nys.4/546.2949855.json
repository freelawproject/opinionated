Y. \u00a7 1189, the duty of entering judgment upon a general verdict is upon the clerk; and, where one of several defendants claims that a judgment entered against him alone should have been entered against him and another defendant jointly, his remedy is not by appeal from the judgment, but by motion to the court, and then by appeal from the order made on such motion.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b566-9\">2.

The complaint alleged that plaintiff\u2019s assignor bought as stockbroker for the defendants jointly, and thereafter carried for them, a certain number of shares of stock in a railroad corporation, and that the defendants had failed to take up the stock, whereby plaintiffs had suffered loss. On the trial the evidence showed that the purchase of the stock was to be for the account of a \u201cpool\u201d consisting of the defendants.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b566-13\">Argued before Sedgwick, O.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq_e\">The action was upon a joint liability on contract. One defendant was not served, and did not appear. The trial proceeded against the other two defendants. The verdict was against one of these, and in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u25a0of the other. Judgment was entered against the former individually, who is the appellant here. On the appeal he claims that the judgment should have been entered against him and the defendant not served jointly. The duty of \u2022entering judgment upon a general verdict is upon the cleric. See section 1189, Code Civil Proe. A mistake by him is to be remedied by motion to the court, and then, if the motion be denied, by appeal from, the order made. The remedy is not by an appeal from the judgment. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Nostrand, </em>94 N. Y. 41, and the cases there cited. Upon the trial the defendant asked for a dismissal of the complaint, on the ground that the evidence did not show any joint venture or joint liability. The learned counsel for appellant supposes that the only testimony that would tend to show a joint interest or contract was the use by witnesses of the word \u201cpool,\u201d and he urges that the word \u201cpool\u201d is unknown to the law, and was not at all explained on the trial. This \u2022does not do justice to the evidence. The jury could know what was intended by the parties, because the testimony showed what was done in the \u201cpool\u201d under the joint order given by the parties, and the recognition by the appellant that the plaintiff had acted properly. I think, also, that so many decisions have been made concerning pools that resort to the cases might be made properly for a definition of the word. It is unnecessary to refer to them, be\u2022cause the acts and declarations of the parties showed what they meant when the word was used. The condition of the testimony would not justify a setting aside of the verdict, as against the weight of evidence. The judgment \u2022and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\">Ingraham, J\u201e concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
