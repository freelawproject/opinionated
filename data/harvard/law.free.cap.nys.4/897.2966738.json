Y. Supp. 15. The order of the city court, affirmed at the general term thereof, vacating the order of arrest unless the affidavit on which it was granted should be amended, was reversed, the order was vacated in the court of common pleas, (no opinion written,) and plaintiff makes this motion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b918-8\">Argued before Larremore, C. J., and Allen and Bookstaver, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b918-9\"><em>Franklin Bien, </em>for motion. <em>L. L.

The affidavit upon which the order of arrest was granted was the basis of the judge\u2019s action. If defective, the proceeding must fall. The lack of venue has been decided <em>to </em>make an affidavit a nullity. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Burhans, </em>61 N. Y. 63; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>6 How. Pr. 394; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Staats, </em>18 Barb. 407; <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>People, </em>5 Parker, Crim. R. 88; <em>Thurman </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>24 Wend. 87. The case of <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>55 N. Y. 150, allowed an amendment to a confession of judgment where the venue was omitted, but we do not think this rule should be extended, in the absence of any authority /upon the subject, in cases where personal liberty is involved. We think, \u00a1upon the authority of the court of appeals already expressed, that leave to make a further appeal to them upon this subject is entirely unnecessary, as the decisions cited clearly show what would be the ultimate result of such application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
