L. c. 265, \u00a7 17) and of three counts of assault by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B) after a trial in the Superior Court. We transferred the case here on our own motion (G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10 [A]). His appeal is before us pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Cavanaugh argues that the trial judge erred by: (1) denying a motion for a continuance; (2) forcing Cavanaugh to proceed to trial pro se despite Cavanaugh\u2019s refusal to waive his right to counsel; (3) denying Cavanaugh\u2019s motion to inspect certain grand jury minutes; and (4) failing adequately to inform the jury about certain security measures taken at trial. We conclude that Cavanaugh was denied his right to counsel at trial without a waiver of that right. His convictions must be reversed. We consider only those facts and issues necessary to explicate our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Cavanaugh was indicted on June 18, 1974. He was arraigned on June 28, 1974. A private member of the bar, who apparently represented Cavanaugh on other pending matters, filed a limited appearance for the arraignment only on that day. This limited appearance was accepted by a judge other than the trial judge. The defendant pleaded not guilty to all counts and was incarcerated pending trial. No attorney was appointed to represent Cavanaugh for purposes of trial until November 11,1974.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Various motions were filed in the period November 13-19,1974, and were ruled on by the judge on the first day of trial, November 19,1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">On the day before trial, Cavanaugh\u2019s counsel moved for a postponement of trial \u201cto allow the defendant and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>counsel sufficient time to adequately prepare his defenses in this matter.\u201d This motion was argued before the trial judge on the next day. Cavanaugh\u2019s counsel stated that he had had \u201ca difficult time in trying to prepare\u201d for the case because of the number of pre-trial motions that were to be filed and because \u201cof the other load of cases that are being called each day and which I find myself connected with____\u201d He concluded by saying: \u201cI feel, and the defendant feels, but particularly the defendant, that we are not adequately prepared because we have not had the time [necessary to prepare for trial]. I haven\u2019t had the time to ... interview any witnesses that might be of great assistance to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The trial judge responded to defense counsel\u2019s claim of lack of time for adequate preparation: \u201cI am quite sure with the expertise acquired over the past six months, he [the defendant] would be more willing and able to advise you in those matters in which you feel you might be deficient. I think with this expert assistance and advice, you can well be prepared to try an excellent case----I am quite sure he will render you about every bit of assistance in his power to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The assistant district attorney argued that there had been sufficient time to prepare; he stated that counsel \u201chas had knowledge of this case since ... June [1974] when he filed an appearance albeit for an arraignment, and has conferred with his client many times since then----\u201d This last assertion was emphatically denied by Cavanaugh\u2019s counsel, who replied that he had not conferred with Cavanaugh at all in the period between the arraignment and his reappointment eight days before the trial, and that he had only met once with Cavanaugh during the previous eight days.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The judge denied the motion. After three other motions were heard and disposed of, Cavanaugh\u2019s counsel asked that Cavanaugh be allowed to address the court. Cavanaugh told the judge that there had been little time to prepare the case and concluded: \u201cI believe I am arbitrarily being denied the right to prepare any defense because none of the facts have been brought forth by me to [the attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ney].\u201d The judge stated: \u201cWe will empanel tomorrow... and you will have plenty of opportunity this afternoon and this evening to talk to [the attorney]____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The next morning, the judge was told by Cavanaugh\u2019s counsel that Cavanaugh \u201cdidn\u2019t want... [his] services as his attorney.\u201d The judge responded by stating that Cavanaugh had rejected the Massachusetts Defenders Committee as counsel and that he knew \u201cof no more capable counsel... than yourself.\u201d He continued: \u201cNow, if the defendant is adamant in his position that he does not wish to have you represent him, that leaves us with but one alternative: he will have to represent himself____[I]f he wishes to represent himself, that is his prerogative. However, I would ask you, please... to sit by on a consulting basis____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Shortly thereafter, in reference to some motions that had not yet been filed, the judge said: \u201c[Cavanaugh] has had six months, at least, to prepare these motions. Apparently, he has been consulting all the law books available at the House of Correction____If he insists on acting as his own counsel and will not take advice from anyone, I am afraid he will have to take the consequences of his dilatoriness.\u201d Counsel responded that Cavanaugh had not had counsel from the arraignment to the date of appointment. Counsel further pointed out that law books were \u201cnot in plentiful availability at the ... House of Correction.\u201d Cavanaugh addressed the judge, stating: \u201c[M]y position is that I do need counsel____I have no knowledge of ... legal litigation.\u201d The judge replied that Cavanaugh had not accepted the aid of the public defenders. There then occurred a significant colloquy between Cavanaugh and the judge, which is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The trial began. Cavanaugh did consult with the attorney but he continued to inform the judge of his unfamiliarity with the law and of his desire to be represented by adequately prepared counsel. It is clear from the record that Cavanaugh would not have objected to his appointed counsel\u2019s representing him if counsel had felt that he was prepared for the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">1. The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution afford a defendant the right to assistance of counsel in all State criminal prosecutions which may result in the loss of his liberty. <em>Argersinger </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25 (1972). <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335 (1963). See also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>350 Mass. 732 (1966). Counsel for a defendant must be afforded \u201ca reasonable opportunity to prepare and to present the defence,\u201d <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 1, 2 (1954). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>346 Mass. 202 <em>(1963); Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 169 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Ordinarily, the granting of a continuance rests in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>sound discretion of the trial judge, and a denial of a continuance will not constitute error absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Klangos, </em>326 Mass. 690 (1951). The discretion of the trial judge cannot be exercised in such a way as to impair the constitutional right to have counsel who has had reasonable opportunity to prepare a defense. See <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Fretag, </em>348 U.S. 3 (1954). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>335 Mass. 106, 111 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">There is no \u201cmechanical test\u201d for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate a defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel and to due process of law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>353 Mass. 442, 445 (1968). \u201cThe answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.\u201d <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u201cIn considering a request for a continuance, a trial judge should balance the movant\u2019s need for additional time against the possible inconvenience, increased costs, and prejudice which may be incurred by the opposing party if the motion is granted. He must also give due weight to the interest of the judicial system in avoiding delays which would not measurably contribute to the resolution of a particular controversy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilchrest, </em>364 Mass. 272, 276-277 (1973). In considering these factors, a \u201cmyopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality.\u201d <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, supra </em>at 589, quoted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 445. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>361 Mass. 515 (1972), denial of petition for writ of habeas corpus aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Frates </em>v. <em>Bohlinger, </em>472 F.2d 149 (1st Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The \u201cfacts\u201d on which the trial judge acted in denying counsel\u2019s motion for a continuance in this case are shown by careful review of the record to be substantially and materially erroneous. The trial judge assumed that he was the judge who had presided over the arraignment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>defendant; the docket shows otherwise. The trial judge assumed he had set bail for this defendant; the docket shows otherwise. The trial judge assumed that attorneys of the Massachusetts Defenders Committee had been appointed to represent this defendant whereas the docket clearly shows that this was not the case; indeed, a certificate of record filed by another judge showed that attorneys of the committee could not represent the defendant. He assumed the defendant had consulted with attorneys of the committee, but there was no evidence of such consultation and the representations of both the defendant and appointed counsel were to the contrary. The trial judge further indicated he believed the defendant to be dilatory and to have obtained prior continuances, but the record shows no prior continuances. The position of the trial judge that the defendant lacked diligence and was seeking to disrupt the administration of justice was not warranted by the facts of record at that time. Nor was there any showing by the Commonwealth that any public inconvenience, increased costs or prejudice would occur if the request for a continuance was granted. Thus, this case is distinguishable from prior decisions holding that a denial of a continuance in circumstances involving lack of diligence and dilatory tactics by a defendant is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. See e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>360 Mass. 695 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>346 Mass. 202 (1963). Additionally, this case is not one where counsel sought delay and the judge forced the defendant to trial while still represented by counsel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, supra. </em>Rather, this case involves a circumstance where the defendant was forced to trial representing himself with an attorney whom both defendant and the attorney described as unprepared, standing by under order of the judge on \u201ca consulting basis.\u201d The Commonwealth now seeks to sustain the ensuing conviction on the alternative ground that (1) the defendant waived his right to counsel, or (2) he was, in effect, adequately represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>by counsel. Neither of these arguments is persuasive in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Assistance of counsel, \u201cdeemed necessary to insure fundamental human rights of life and liberty,\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 462 (1938), may be waived; there is a corresponding constitutional right to proceed pro se. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806 (1975). When a defendant indicates his desire to proceed pro se, the trial judge has \u201cthe serious and weighty responsibility... of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver,\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, supra </em>at 465, and, in such a case, \u201ca defendant... should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that \u2018he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, supra </em>at 835, quoting from <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 279 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">When the question of waiver is raised, \u201c \u2018courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u2019 of fundamental constitutional rights and... [they] \u2018do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, supra </em>at 464 (footnotes omitted). See generally <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 148-149 (1968); <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The Commonwealth argues that the transcript \u201cclearly shows\u201d that Cavanaugh \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d waived his right to counsel by \u201celect [ing] to discharge appointed counsel and proceed pro se.\u201d The Commonwealth also claims that the defendant was advised \u201cmany times\u201d by the trial judge of the \u201cpitfalls in proceeding pro se.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 47, 52 (1974). Finally, the Commonwealth places great significance on the fact that Cavanaugh frequently consulted with the attorney \u201cconsultant,\u201d concluding that Cavanaugh \u201cwas in fact represented by counsel.\u201d The basic difficulty with these arguments, and, indeed, with the trial itself, is the failure to recognize the Hobson\u2019s choice with which Cavanaugh was faced. On the one hand, he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>proceed to trial represented by counsel who characterized himself as \u201cunprepared\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the other, he could demonstrate his justifiable concern about that state of affairs only by proceeding to trial pro se. To argue that proceeding to trial, with consulting counsel who felt he was not adequately prepared, amounted to a knowing and intelligent waiver is to suggest that a defendant may only reserve his rights on the issue by refusing to go to trial at all, or by remaining entirely silent throughout the trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The record in this case must be strained to reach the Commonwealth\u2019s conclusion. First, Cavanaugh refused to sign the waiver of counsel form. While this is by no means conclusive, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass. 188, 368 (1971), cert. denied, sub nom. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 910, and sub nom. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 914 (1972), it is certainly indicative of Cavanaugh\u2019s position.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, the judge did not engage in an appropriate inquiry, as required most recently by <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806 (1975). Third, Cavanaugh\u2019s repeated statements to the judge made it clear that he did not wish to waive his right to counsel; rather, he wanted \u201cprepared\u201d counsel. Fourth, Cavanaugh\u2019s statements during the course of trial displayed a similar desire to be represented and an acknowledgment of his inability properly to conduct a defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>This inability, even with the aid of consulting counsel, is made abundantly clear by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Other courts, faced with the type of problem we confront in this case, provide strong support for the result we reach. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Renshaw, </em>276 Md. 259, 263-264 (1975), the court found that \u201cthe trial judge treated [defendant\u2019s] expression of dissatisfaction with assigned counsel, his request for a change of counsel and his silence [at trial] as a waiver of the right to counsel and an election to proceed in proper person.\u201d After reviewing Supreme Court precedents, including the recent case of <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806 (1975), the Maryland Court of Appeals concluded: \u201c[I]n a case like the one at bar, where the accused fails to waive his right to counsel by making an unequivocal choice, but merely insists on a different lawyer, effective legal representation must be required by the court---- The criminal defendant... is entitled to genuine and effective representation.\u201d 276 Md. at 268, citing <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 (1970). In <em>Renshaw, </em>unlike the case before us, counsel had done a substantial amount of pre-trial research and had conferred with the defendant at least nine times prior to trial. See 276 Md. at 261 &amp; n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">As the Maryland court pointed out, insistence on obtaining a new lawyer is not necessarily either \u201ca waiver of... [the] right to counsel... [or] an indication of a desire to proceed alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>364 F.2d 219 (2d Cir. 1966), and <em>Patton </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>315 F.2d 643 (4th Cir. 1963). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>487 F.2d 1218 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Sawicki </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>475 F.2d 183 (6th Cir. 1973). Nor did the Maryland court find reliance on consulting counsel, at various stages of the trial, inconsistent with assertion of the right to assistance of counsel: \u201cIn addition to his explicit statements ... [that he wanted to be represented by counsel, defendant\u2019s] acceptance of appointed counsel\u2019s assistance prior to trial and after the verdict was rendered indicated a desire to be represented.\u201d 276 Md. at 266, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Also instructive is the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>43 Mich. App. 459, 461 (1972), where the defendant claimed that his attorney was not adequately prepared. The court reversed the trial judge\u2019s ruling that the defendant had to accept his present attorney or proceed pro se (which the defendant \u201creluctantly\u201d did). As the appellate court noted: \u201cThe coercive effect of such a mandatorily imposed choice without the benefit of an evaluation of [the defendant\u2019s] claims negates any contention that defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461 n.1. And, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>229 Pa. Super. 419 (1974), where the defendant\u2019s request for different counsel resulted in the trial judge\u2019s forcing the defendant to fire his appointed counsel and proceed pro se (with appointed counsel consulting) , the court reversed, finding no voluntary and intelligent waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Given the facts of the case before us and the legal precedent in this area, we hold that, under the unusual circumstances of this case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendant neither waived his right to counsel, nor elected to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the defendant was \u201cin effect given the \u2018effective assistance\u2019 of counsel as required by the Constitution\u201d by the appointment of the attorney as a \u201cconsulting attorney\u201d is without merit. The Commonwealth relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 895 (1974), for this proposition. <em>Maynard </em>did involve a similar \u2019consulting arrangement but it was one which was worked out by the defendant without objection and with his acquiescence. Additionally, in <em>Maynard, </em>no question was raised as to the attorney\u2019s competence and preparation for trial. <em>Maynard </em>is thus clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>distinguishable on its facts. A defendant\u2019s right to counsel is not satisfied by the mere presence of a competent attorney if that attorney is not prepared. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>487 F.2d 1218 (5th Cir. 1973). Accord, <em>State </em>v. <em>Renshaw, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, supra. </em>Consequently, Cavanaugh\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated, and the convictions must be reversed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although we reverse on this basis, two other matters raised by the defendant require brief comment here as similar issues may arise at retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">2. Prior to trial, Cavanaugh\u2019s attorney sought to gain access to the grand jury testimony of an Officer Santos who was scheduled to, and did, testify at trial. Although Cavanaugh was indicted by the June, 1974, grand jury for the crimes of which he was convicted below, a November, 1974, grand jury indicted Cavanaugh for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. The November indictment was based on the same events as the June indictments. Officer Santos did not testify before the June grand jury, but he did testify before the November grand jury. The motion to obtain these minutes was denied by the trial judge on the basis that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>365 Mass. 99 (1974) , limits access to grand jury minutes to the grand jury returning the indictments for which the defendant is being tried. Although we did not face such a question in <em>Stewart, </em>we find the language of that case and the language of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewinski, </em>367 Mass. 889 (1975), which expanded the <em>Stewart </em>rule of discovery to written statements within the prosecution\u2019s control, indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>cate that it is substance, not form, that should control. <em>Lewinski, </em>which was decided subsequent to Cavanaugh\u2019s trial, provides ample guidance in the event a similar problem should arise on retrial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">3. It appears special security precautions were taken as to Cavanaugh throughout the trial in that two guards were positioned near him and followed him about the court room as he conducted his pro se defense. On the third day of trial Cavanaugh complained to the judge about this; in response the judge stated to the jury that this had been \u201cdone at the suggestion of the Court.\u201d Cavanaugh argues on appeal that this should have been coupled with a cautionary instruction that no adverse inferences should be drawn by the jury in a case where court room security is substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">We addressed the problems presented by unusual court room security procedures and by shackling in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>364 Mass. 471 (1973), and we need not repeat at length what was said there. However, it may be helpful to reemphasize that, \u201c[w]hen special restraints are imposed, the judge\u2019s charge to the jury should seek to quell prejudice by reasoning and warning against it\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 476. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>368 Mass. 195, 201 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">4. Because Cavanaugh\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated at trial, his convictions in the Superior Court are to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\n<em>Judgments reversed. Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\"> Although Cavanaugh was indigent, the Massachusetts Defenders Committee was not appointed to represent him because of a conflict of interest between the defendant and defendants in companion cases and the committee\u2019s work load, which would have made it impossible to \u201cprepare and defend... [the] case in the near future.\u201d It is unclear whether Cavanaugh consulted with a member of the committee between arraignment and trial, but it is clear that the committee was never appointed to defend him, and that he strenuously claimed he had no consultation with any counsel from June 28 until November 11, 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-13\"> The judge: \u201cYou are not going to play games with this Court.

Let the record indicate that the defendant refuses to sign a waiver of counsel; that the defendant has refused to sign a waiver of counsel after having been informed of his right to have counsel appointed by the Court to represent him at every stage of the proceedings in this case. He has elected to proceed without counsel. He has refused to sign the waiver. We will proceed with the empanelment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b68-6\"> This fact serves to distinguish this case from others in which counsel has represented himself as prepare'd but the defendant has disputed that representation or sought to change counsel at the time of trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miskel, </em>364 Mass. 783 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>360 Mass. 695 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\"> This was the case in <em>State </em>v. <em>Renshaw, </em>276 Md. 259 (1975), where the defendant did not examine witnesses, made no objections, took no exceptions, and filed no motions. <em>Renshaw </em>is discussed in the text <em>infra; </em>however, the Maryland court found, as we do, that there was no waiver under the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\"> Just as it is true that signing a waiver form is some evidence of intent to waive counsel, see <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>349 Mass. 776 (1965), so is failure to sign a form some evidence of intent not to waive counsel. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miskel, </em>364 Mass. 783 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\"> As we have already indicated, the granting or denial of a continuance vests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. Defendants or attorneys who attempt to engage in either dilatory tactics or schemes to disrupt the orderly administration of criminal justice should not receive relief below and will not receive it on appeal. See cases cited p. 52 and note 3 <em>supra. </em>However, in this most unusual case, where the trial judge\u2019s denial of a continuance was based on a number of important misapprehensions of fact which resulted in a denial of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel, relief is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\"> The Commonwealth does not explicitly argue that, even if the trial judge erred, he committed harmless error. Such an argument would seem precluded by the Supreme Court\u2019s forceful language in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18 (1967): \u201c[Ojur prior cases have indicated that there are some constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23 &amp; n.8, citing <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335 (1963) (right to counsel). As Mr. Justice Stewart noted in his concurrence in <em>Chapman: </em>\u201cWhen a defendant has been denied counsel at trial, we have refused to consider claims that this constitutional error might have been harmless. ... That, indeed, was the whole point of <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335 [(1963)] ....\u201d 386 U.S. at 43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b72-9\"> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewinski, </em>367 Mass. at 902: \u201cWritten statements for this purpose include any statement made by the [trial] witness and in some definite way approved by him, a transcript of a contemporaneous verbatim or substantially verbatim stenographic or other recording of an oral statement by the witness, and a written report consisting of a statement by the witness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
