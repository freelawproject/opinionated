We hold that, pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 3 (6) and (7), the commission does have such power.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">On June 10, 1971, the commission, of its own initiative, issued a complaint against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual) pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, as amended through St. 1969, c. 751, \u00a7\u00a7 10-12.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint was accompanied by a letter addressed to Liberty Mutual indicating that the \u201cfunction of... [the] charge is to initiate an investigation.\u201d The letter asked that a questionnaire relating to the matters under investigation be filled out and returned. On July 6,1971, Liberty Mutual notified the commission that it would not respond to the questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">On September 7, 1971, the commission issued a subpoena duces tecum requiring Liberty Mutual to produce specified books and records<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cfor examination\u201d by the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>mission \u201crelative to a matter under investigation or in question____\u201d On September 21, Liberty Mutual filed a petition with the commission to vacate the subpoena alleging, inter alia, that the commission was without power to issue such subpoena. After amending its complaint to state more specifically the alleged unlawful employment practices referred to in the original complaint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the commission, on December 17, 1971, denied Liberty Mutual\u2019s petition to vacate, withdrew items six and ten from the list of material to be produced, and ordered the production of all other items for immediate inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Liberty Mutual continued to refuse compliance with the commission\u2019s subpoena. As a result, the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>brought a \u201cBill of Enforcement\u201d on January 21, 1972,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 10. After a hearing in the Superior Court, the judge entered an order and judgment denying the commission\u2019s \u201cBill of Enforcement\u201d in its entirety and quashing the subpoena duces tecum. The case is before this court on appeal from that judgment, it having been transferred from the Appeals Court to this court on our motion. G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10 (A), inserted by St. 1972, c. 740, $ 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">It is well settled that the commission, as a board created by statute (G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 56, and G. L. c. 151B, both as amended), has only those powers, duties and obligations conferred upon it by statute and those reasonably necessary for its proper functioning. <em>Scannell </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Comm\u2019n, </em>324 Mass. 494, 501 (1949). <em>Hathaway Bakeries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>316 Mass. 136, 141 (1944), and cases cited. The power to issue a subpoena is one which the commission would not possess absent such statutory authority. See <em>Donatelli Bldg. Co. </em>v. <em>Cranston Loan Co., </em>87 R.I. 293, 297 (1958). See also Cooper, Federal Agency Investigations: Requirements for the Production of Documents, 60 Mich. L. Rev. 187, 188 (1961). Accordingly, our inquiry must begin with the statutes creating the commission and vesting powers therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The commission is established by G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 56, as amended, and its functions, powers and duties, in so far as this case is concerned, are prescribed by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 3, as amended. Pursuant to the latter statute, the commission has the power \u201c6. [t] o receive, investigate and pass upon complaints of unlawful practices.\u201d It also has the power \u201c7. [t]o hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, administer oaths, take the testimony of any person under oath, and in connection therewith, to require the production for examination of any books or papers relating to any matter under investigation or in question before the commission.\u201d It is clear that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>mission has authority to order the production of books and records during the hearing stage of the proceedings. The commission argues that this power extends to the investigatory stage, claiming that the language \u201crelating to any matter under investigation or in question\u201d controls. Liberty Mutual argues that the subpoena power exists only \u201cin connection\u201d with hearings, relying on that particular language of the statute. It is our duty to determine which reading, if either, of the two readings is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u201cIn construing statutes, \u2018[t]he general and familiar rule is that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975), quoting from <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975). <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). Where there is a contradiction in the statute, \u201c[i]t is our duty to interpret... [it], if possible, so \u2018as to make it an effectual piece of legislation in harmony with common sense and sound reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atlas Distrib. Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>354 Mass. 408, 414 (1968), quoting from <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Weymouth, </em>279 Mass. 486, 492 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The statute in question, G. L. c. 151B, \u201cin certain aspects lacks precision and verbal consistency.\u201d <em>LaPierre </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>354 Mass. 165, 174 (1968). Where, as here, \u201c[t]he draftsmanship is faulty, ... the duty devolves upon us to give... [the statute] a reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authority </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>347 Mass. 524, 528 (1964). In doing so, we should take care to construe the statute to carry out the legislative intent, <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 364; <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 32, 36 (1949), giving effect to all words in the statute but not overemphasizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>any. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. </em>Authority, 352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercy Hosp., </em>364 Mass. 515, 521 (1974). It is therefore necessary that we look to the intent of the Legislature in enacting G. L. c. 151B to determine whether the commission has power to issue a subpoena duces tecum during the course of an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">General Laws c. 151B was enacted in response to the growing concern over the existence of discrimination in employment. 1946 House Doc. No. 400. \u201cThe law [was] based on the concept that opportunity for employment without discrimination is a civil right.\u201d Governor\u2019s Committee for Racial and Religious Understanding, Public Policy Pamphlet 9 (Rev. 1947), quoting from New York State Commission Against Discrimination, \u201cInside Facts.\u201d Largely, the purpose of the bill was to educate employers and employees and, through the existence of the law, to encourage an end to discrimination. 1946 House Doc. No. 400, at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">While the act stressed the use of \u201ceducation, persuasion, and conciliation\u201d to eliminate discrimination, it nevertheless gave the commission considerable power to proceed where appropriate to ensure that efforts to eliminate discrimination would be successful. L. Mayhew, Law and Equal Opportunity 111 (1968). It was in this context that the power to investigate and process complaints was included among those granted to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The investigation of complaints \u201cis an important step in a longer process that may eventually lead to a formal hearing followed by findings and an order. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5.\u201d Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 95, 96 (1969).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>out adequate investigation, the commission\u2019s functions \u201cwould be seriously hampered and the realization of the statdte\u2019s broad and humane purposes would be materially impaired.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Unless the commission has the power to obtain necessary information during the course of its investigations, the broad remedial purposes of the legislation cannot be effectuated, and the commission will be unable to function effectively. See Comment, 43 U. Colo. L. Rev. 345 (1971). Cf. <em>Graniteville Co. </em>v. <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n, </em>438 F.2d 32, 36 (4th Cir. 1971). A construction of the statute which leads to such a result is disfavored and should not be adopted. Stone, Common Law in the United States, 50 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 18 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">It is clear that the commission has power to subpoena documents during the hearing stage. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 3 (7). The question before us is whether that power also extends to the investigation. In light of the importance of the investigatory stage of the proceedings,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and considering the stated legislative policy that the act be \u201cconstrued liberally for the accomplishment of... [its] purposes,\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, as amended through St. 1965, c. 397, \u00a7 7, we hold that the logical reading of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 3 (6) and (7), when taken together, authorizes the commission to issue a subpoena duces tecum during the course of an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Our holding here is consistent with the conclusion reached by the Attorney General in his opinion on the subject. Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 95, 97 (1969). It is also consistent with the interpretation given to the New York statute on which the Massachusetts statute was based.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Liberty </em>Mut. <em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>City of N.Y., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n on Human Rights, </em>31 N.Y.2d 1044 (1973), aff\u2019g 39 App. Div. 2d 860 (1972), aff\u2019g No. 19284/1971 (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County); <em>State Comm\u2019n for Human Rights </em>v. <em>Local 13, United Ass\u2019n of Plumbing &amp; Pipe Fitting, </em>56 Misc. 2d 98 (N.Y. 1968); <em>In re Broido, </em>40 Misc. 2d 419 (N.Y. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We note that neither this court\u2019s decision in <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R., </em>357 Mass. 783, 784 (1970), nor the decision of the Colorado Court of Appeals in <em>Colorado Civil Rights Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Adolph Coors Corp., </em>29 Colo. App. 240 (1971), compels a different result. In the <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R. </em>case, the trial judge had determined that the information and material sought by the subpoena issued by the commission did not \u201cin any way relate to the matter\u201d under investigation and was therefore not authorized by statute. We expressed no opinion, however, as to the investigatory subpoena power of the commission itself. In the <em>Coors </em>case, the Colorado court was asked to determine whether the Civil Rights Commission had statutory authority to issue an investigatory subpoena. The court held that it did not. However, the wording of the Colorado statute is significantly different from that of the Massachusetts statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and thus that court\u2019s interpretation is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">We are similarly not persuaded by the Legislature\u2019s failure in 1972 to enact legislation which would have amended the statute to authorize specifically the issuance of a subpoena during the course of an investigation by the commission. See 1972 House Bill No. 80; 1972 House Bill No. 2780. Such inaction by a subsequent legislative body \u201chas no persuasive significance\u201d with reference to the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>tent of the Legislature which passed the original bill. <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>364 Mass. 435, 442-443 (1973). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>370 U.S. 405, 411 (1962). \u201c[T]he views of a subsequent [Legislature] form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>361 U.S. 304, 313 (1960). <em>Wong Yang Sung </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>339 U.S. 33, 47-48, modified, 339 U.S. 908 (1950). <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Hallock, </em>309 U.S. 106, 119-121 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Additionally, we will not draw the inference that the commission believed it was without the power requested from the fact that the legislation was introduced. Such an inference would be merely speculative and might serve to chill the agency\u2019s freedom to seek \u201cclarifying legislation on a genuinely debatable point of agency procedure____\u201d <em>Wong Yang Sung </em>v. <em>McGrath, supra </em>at 47. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authority, </em>352 Mass. 617, 619-620 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">On the basis of what we have said above, we reverse the judgment of the Superior Court quashing the subpoena in its entirety and denying the commission\u2019s \u201cBill of Enforcement.\u201d We remand the case to the Superior Court to consider and decide whether the subpoena is so broad, oppressive and burdensome that it should be quashed in its entirety or whether it should be quashed in part and upheld in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\"> The complaint stated that \u201c[t]he Commission has reason to believe and thus specifically charges that [Liberty Mutual] has engaged in unlawful employment practices in violation of Chapter 151B, Section 4 ....\u201d It went on to charge that \u201c[t]he recruitment, hiring, promotion and other employment practices of [Liberty Mutual] have resulted in the exclusion of many women from positions equal to their education and experience.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-10\"> The subpoena ordered the production of the following documents: \u201c(1) The original or a copy of all organizational charts or line and staff descriptions of the company\u2019s operations for the period 1965 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>date.

If probable cause is found, the investigating Commissioner calls the parties together in an effort to conciliate. If that fails, an adjudicatory hearing is held. If no probable cause is found, the party initiating the complaint may request a preliminary hearing to determine whether probable cause exists. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. See also L.
