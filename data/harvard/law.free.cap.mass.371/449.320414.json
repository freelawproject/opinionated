A Superior Court judge ruled that Mr. Serlin had rendered services to the decedent valued at $3,000 and was entitled to enforce his lien against proceeds derived from any settlement or judgment obtained by the defendant for the decedent\u2019s tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The judge found that the decedent hired Mr. Serlin sometime in April, 1970, to handle a personal injury case arising out of a motor vehicle accident and that Mr. Serlin hired another attorney, Mr. Albert Escott, to assist him in prosecuting this claim with the knowledge and approval of his client. The judge found that the decedent received a $15,000 settlement offer because of Mr. Serlin\u2019s activities. The judge further found that there was insufficient evidence to establish the existence of a contingent fee arrangement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the judge ruled that the total fee charged the decedent was reasonable, and he did not hold the decedent\u2019s estate financially responsible to Mr. Escott for his services in prosecuting the tort claim. No evidence clarified the financial arrangements between Mr. Serlin and Mr. Escott for fee sharing.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Mrs. Rotman contended that the judge erred in his findings that Mr. Serlin hired Mr. Escott with the decedent\u2019s knowledge and approval, and that Mr. Serlin rendered valuable services worth $3,000. She maintained, consequently, that the estate owes Mr. Serlin nothing. Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:22, 359 Mass. 796, 808 (1972), prohibits the division of fees for legal services without client consent to the employment of a second attorney after full disclosure of the fee sharing arrangement (Canons of Ethics and Disciplinary Rules Regulating the Practice of Law, DR 2-107). W\u00e9 need not decide whether this rule applies in this case, given the time sequence involved, because we conclude that the evidence supports the judge\u2019s findings that Mr. Serlin hired Mr. Escott with the dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>dent\u2019s knowledge and that Mr. Serlin himself was responsible for Mr. Escott\u2019s compensation. Mr. Serlin testified that he told Hyman Rotman he wanted to hire Mr. Escott, \u201c[A]s I had with another case that [Mr. Rotman\u2019s] son Josiah had with me,\u201d and that the decedent responded, \u201c \u2018Whatever you do, Mr. Serlin, you do the right thing.\u2019 \u201d From this testimony the judge warrantably inferred that the decedent not only knew and approved of the hiring of Mr. Escott but was aware from previous experience that Mr. Escott would be paid by Mr. Serlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">On the issue of the fair and reasonable value of his services, Mr. Serlin testified that the fair value of his services was $35 to $40 an hour. In finding that Mr. Serlin\u2019s services resulting in a settlement offer were worth $3,000, the judge apparently established Mr. Serlin\u2019s useful work at seventy-five hours using an hourly rate of $40. The evidence supports such findings since Mr. Serlin testified that he devoted substantially more than seventy-five hours to the case. That this court might have reached a different conclusion, less favorable to Mr. Serlin, is not a relevant argument, since the evidence supported the judge\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-14\"> The defendant Sally Rotman is deceased now and Albert D. Rot-man has been appointed administrator de bonis non. A motion that he be substituted for Sally Rotman, administratrix, as the defendant, was allowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> Further, we note that such a contingent fee arrangement could not be enforced in the absence of a showing that a written agreement sufficient to satisfy S.J.C. Rule 3:14, 351 Mass. 795 (1967), had been executed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
