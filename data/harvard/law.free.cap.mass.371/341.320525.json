On motion of the plaintiff to confirm and of the city to reject the report, the judge accepted the master\u2019s subsidiary fact findings, but, disagreeing with the master\u2019s general findings (grounded on legal rulings) and conclusions of law, the judge ultimately directed entry of judgment for the city.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff having appealed to the Appeals Court, we brought the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">On sundry occasions the Boston police enlisted the aid of tow companies to remove private vehicles from the city streets. The most common occasion was when a car was parked in a prohibited area, such as a hospital zone, or offended the law in some similar fashion. So also the police saw to the removal of abandoned or stolen cars, and cars left after traffic accidents or like casualties. Yet another category was cars constituting evidence in criminal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In any of these instances a police officer from a police division would telephone one of the tow companies \u2014 the plaintiff was but one of a number of companies engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>this line of work \u2014 and notify it of the location of the car to be towed. A company was not obligated to act in response to any call received but customarily it would respond if its equipment was then available. The plaintiff towed \u201chundreds\u201d of cars during the period in question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In by far the larger number of cases the car owners, after doing what was necessary to discharge any violations, would appear at the company\u2019s storage lot, pay the towing and storage charges,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and remove their vehicles,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the city not being expected to play any part. In a relatively few cases the owners did not turn up and the cars accumulated charges. The 104 cars involved in the present lawsuit were thus unclaimed; a breakdown by the categories in which the cars fell is given in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The plaintiff asserted in this lawsuit that the city was responsible for payment of the charges accumulated on these vehicles, but we agree with the judge below that there was no legal basis for that assertion. The measure of the case lies in the finding of the master that \u201c[n]o express conversation or communication ever occurred between City of Boston officials and plaintiff regarding payment for towing and storage of motor vehicles.\u201d No doubt it was most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>imprudent of the parties not to have entered into an express contract about vehicles that would remain in the plaintiff\u2019s hands, for it was plainly foreseeable that some might be so stranded. That the parties were neglectful, however, did not repair the absence of the elements, fixed by statutes, which were essential here to the formation of a contract casting liability on the city: a public bidding procedure, as the estimated cost of the contemplated work might exceed $2,000;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a writing and other formalities as required for a contract of that size;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> an official acting for the city who was authorized thereunto;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>appropriation to which the claimant can point (there being no \u201cextreme emergency\u201d warranting an exception)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As was said in <em>Adalian Bros. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>323 Mass. 629, 632 (1949), those who deal with the city of Boston are \u201cbound by the statutory regulations as to the manner in which the city [can] legally make contracts,\u201d and these limitations \u201ccannot be evaded by first rendering services or furnishing supplies without an express contract and then claiming under an implied contract for work performed or for goods sold and delivered. In such cases there is no implied contract.\u201d See <em>Sancta Maria Hosp. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>369 Mass. 586, 595 (1976); <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>355 Mass. 788, 789 (1969); <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., </em>313 Mass. 257, 272 (1943); <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>253 Mass. 247 (1925); <em>McGovern </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>229 Mass. 394, 397-398 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The plaintiff has cited various statutes under which motor vehicles privately owned may lawfully be cleared from the city streets but, upon inspection, none of them goes to the point of charging the city with the costs of towing and storage at the suit of a company which answered the calls of police officers without the protection of a contract.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\"> Also named as defendants were the Commonwealth and Boston police Sergeant Anthony DiNatale. The Commonwealth was dismissed by consent. The master found no basis for liability on the part of DiNatale, and the plaintiff does not pursue the matter further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\"> A claim for general damages, originally made, may be taken as abandoned. The figure in the text represents the computation made by the master.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\"> This is proper procedure under Mass. R. Civ. P. 53, 365 Mass. 817 (1974) (see, e.g., <em>W.R.B. Corp. </em>v. <em>Geer, </em>332 F.2d 180 [5th Cir.], cert. denied, 379 U.S. 841 [1964]), just as it was under our prior practice. See, e.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Worcester Insulation Co., </em>338 Mass. 44, 46-47 (1958); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Graham Refrigeration Prods. Co., </em>333 Mass. 181, 184 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\"> The plaintiff also towed cars on notification by the Metropolitan District Commission and Capitol police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\"> The charges were regulated by the Department of Public Utilities. (It appears that the amount claimed in this action is calculated according to such regulated rates.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\"> The usual routine described by the master was for the company to give the police officer on the scene an identification card, retaining the ticket portion; the car owner obtained the identification card and presented it when claiming the car from the company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\"> As listed by the master with amounts claimed: abandoned, thirty-two vehicles, $14,690; stolen, ten, $2,709; custody (evidence in case), three, $796; accident, twenty-two, $6,551; \u201ctow and hold,\u201d eighteen, $10,088; Hotel Vend\u00f3me fire, two, $1,308; traffic hazards, seventeen, $9,868.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\u201cTow and hold\u201d apparently represents cars on which there were numerous violations that had to be made good before the owners could claim the cars from the plaintiff (see St. 1929, c. 263, \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1973, c. 253).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Apparently the plaintiff was rid of all these cars by August 31, 1972; details are not clear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b358-5\"> Statute 1909, c. 486, \u00a7 30, as amended through St. 1955, c. 60, \u00a7 2, provides that, unless the mayor gives written authority to do otherwise, those having power to incur obligations on behalf of the city must \u201cinvite proposals ... by advertisements in the City Record\u201d for contracts for any work or purchase, \u201cthe estimated cost of which alone, or in conjunction with other similar work or purchase which might properly be included in the same contract, amounts to or exceeds two thousand dollars.\u201d Although each tow was in some sense' a separate transaction which likely would not reach $2,000, one could foresee multiple similar situations of unclaimed cars which would aggregate that amount and so the public bidding procedure was appropriate under the statute and the decisions. Cf. <em>Armco Drainage &amp; Metal Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Pinellas, </em>137 So. 2d 234 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1962); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kollarik, </em>22 N.J. 558 (1956); <em>Fonder </em>v. <em>South Sioux Falls, </em>76 S.D. 31 (1955); <em>Menzl </em>v. <em>Milwaukee, </em>32 Wis. 2d 266, 272-273 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Some of the tows were presumably referable to St. 1929, c. 263, \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1973, c. 253, which authorizes the traffic and parking commission to permit removal of certain illegally parked or obstructing vehicles by employees of the police department, or \u201cby an independent contractor selected on the basis of competitive bids invited by advertisement in the City Record ....\u201d The master found that the plaintiff had submitted a bid under such a proposal but no contract was awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We are not called on here to suggest the terms of such public bid proposals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> St. 1890, c. 418, \u00a7 6, as amended through St. 1955, c. 60, \u00a7 1: \u201cAll contracts made by any department of the city of Boston .. . shall, when the amount involved is two thousand dollars or more,... be in writing\u201d; approved in writing by the mayor; and with certification by the city auditor \u201cthat an appropriation is available\u201d or statutory authority exists which excuses the lack of an appropriation. \u201cAll such contracts shall be accompanied by a suitable bond or deposit of money or other security ....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\"> St. 1885, c. 266, \u00a7 6, as amended through St. 1941, c. 604: The several officers and boards of the city \u201cshall, in their respective depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ments, make all necessary contracts for the employment of labor, the supply of materials, and the construction, alteration and repair of all public works and buildings ....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\"> St. 1909, c. 486, \u00a7 16: \u201cNo official of [the] city, except in case of extreme emergency involving the health or safety of the people or their property, shall expend intentionally in any fiscal year any sum in excess of the appropriations duly made in accordance with law, nor involve the city in any contract for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriation....\u201d That the problem that developed in the present case was foreseeable and thus not an \u201cextreme emergency\u201d under the statute, see <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>255 Mass. 220, 225 (1926).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\"> See G.
