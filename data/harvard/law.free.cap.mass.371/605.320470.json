L. c. 278, \u00a7 30A. The defendant had been indicted for murder as defined in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, following which a motion was filed requesting that the defendant be permitted to waive his right to a jury trial. The judge in his report stated that the defendant had been questioned \u201cas to his knowledge of the consequences of executing such a waiver,\u201d and that he found that \u201cthe execution of the waiver was the intelligent and voluntary act of the defendant.\u201d At a hearing on the motion the defendant stated his position that, since capital punishment is not a penalty currently recognized by the law of the Commonwealth, there are no longer any \u201ccapital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>case[s] \u201d and that \u00a3\u00a3[h]ence the defendant... pursuant to the provisions of General Laws Chapter 263 Section 6 ... [can] waive a trial by jury and proceed to [a jury waived] trial... in precisely the same manner as in any criminal case.\u201d The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for waiver of trial by jury and subsequently reported the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The defendant offers a number of unique and intriguing arguments as to why he should be allowed to waive his jury trial. We, however, do not agree with them. To begin with, G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 6, requires a jury trial in a \u201ccapital case.\u201d The defendant leans heavily on his assertion that in the absence of a death penalty there are no longer capital cases in Massachusetts. In so stating, he makes reference to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millen, </em>289 Mass. 441 (1935), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>357 Mass. 168 (1970), which reaffirmed the <em>Millen </em>case. The <em>Smith </em>case stated at 175, \u201cOur law provides for no form of trial in a capital case, whether the defendants choose to waive their constitutional right to jury trial or not, except trial by jury____,\u201d quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millen, supra </em>at 465. In an earlier day, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ibrahim, </em>184 Mass. 255, 258 (1903), had stated, \u201cA capital crime is one punishable with the death of the offender.\u201d However, the Legislature has in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended through St. 1974, c. 457, defined a \u201ccapital case\u201d for purposes of review by the Supreme Judicial Court to be one \u201cin which the defendant was tried on an indictment for murder in the first degree and was convicted of murder either in the first or second degree.\u201d This section illustrates the special care with which the Legislature has approached these most serious criminal cases. Expanded review by the Supreme Judicial Court is not limited to cases in which a death sentence has been imposed, but extends to convictions of murder in the first or second degree on an indictment charging murder in the first degree. We believe that the prohibition on waiver of jury trial in capital cases (c. 263, \u00a7 6) reflects the same legislative concern with safeguards as does \u00a7 33E. It is thus our view that the \u00a7 33E definition of \u201ccapital case\u201d governs the meaning of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>phrase in c. 263, \u00a7 6, at issue here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, we do not believe that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>367 Mass. 440 (1975), since it deals only with the constitutionality of the death penalty, forecloses the issue whether \u201ccapital cases\u201d may still exist in Massachusetts. See <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153 (1976), and affiliated cases. We conclude that the Legislature has classified that type of crime in which a jury waiver may not be accepted, and we are not disposed to engage in a reform of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 6, along the lines which the defendant seeks. Any change in this conclusion must await action by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion to be permitted to waive trial by jury was correctly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-13\"> See also G.
