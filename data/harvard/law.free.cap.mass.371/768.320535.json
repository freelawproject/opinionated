Davis sued the defendants Steven DelRosso, Millbury Cafe, Inc. (Mill-bury) , and the city of Worcester for damages for an as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>sault on him by DelRosso, a Worcester police officer who was serving in off-duty hours on paid detail at Millbury\u2019s premises. At trial to a jury, the city of Worcester\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was granted, and the plaintiff took no appeal from the ensuing judgment. Verdicts of $45,000 each having been returned against Millbury and DelRosso, Millbury moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or a new trial; DelRosso moved for a new trial. The trial judge denied the motion for judgment n.o.v. but granted each defendant a new trial unless the plaintiff agreed to remit $20,000 from the verdicts. When the plaintiff agreed to the remittiturs, the judge denied the new trial motions and entered judgments for $25,000. Appealing from the respective judgments, Millbury claims error in the denial of judgment n.o.v. or a new trial; DelRosso claims error in the denial of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Under the verdicts, the jury can be taken to have accepted the following version of the facts. The plaintiff, thirty-one years old, an executive of a computer service company, on finishing end-of-month work on Friday, December 29, 1972, about 11:15 P.M., drove a few blocks to Millbury\u2019s caf\u00e9, called \u201cSteeple Bumpstead,\u201d located on Millbury Street, Worcester. In the evenings the caf\u00e9 provided music, dancing, and other entertainment,\u2019 besides food and drink. The place was crowded as the plaintiff entered. He stood at the bar and ordered a beer, his only alcoholic drink of the day. He recognized a young woman with whom he was casually acquainted \u2014 a registered nurse, as it happened \u2014 and began to chat with her at the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">A man approached and asked the young woman for a dance. She declined. He returned in a few minutes, and, on being again refused, took the young woman by the arm. The plaintiff said, \u201cLeave her alone.\u201d At this point the man grabbed the plaintiff by his shirt. The plaintiff pushed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>him away. Neither landed any blows or, it seems, attemped any.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Almost instantly \u2014 perhaps in response to a call by a bartender for \u201cStevie\u201d \u2014 DelRosso, evidently in uniform, appeared and stepped between the two. Without inquiring into the merits, he pushed the plaintiff against a wall, and as the plaintiff rebounded, or was pulled from the wall by DelRosso, DelRosso struck him a blow on the mouth with his right fist. This did considerable damage to the plaintiff\u2019s upper teeth and bridgework and he began to bleed profusely. DelRosso seized the plaintiff by the hair, pulled or dragged him outside, and shoved him to the ground. The young woman followed outside and asked DelRosso whether she might help the plaintiff; DelRosso rebuffed her and ordered her back into the caf\u00e9. After perhaps ten minutes, a police wagon arrived and the plaintiff was driven to a hospital where, after waiting a half hour, he was given medication, and a cut in his upper lip was stitched. He was then driven to the Waldo Street jail; there he spent the night in a cell. (The record does not indicate on what charges he was held. DelRosso said he had \u201carrested\u201d the plaintiff in the caf\u00e9 for disturbing the peace, and outside the caf\u00e9 for drunkenness.)</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Reconstruction of the plaintiff\u2019s teeth required visits to a dentist over a period of several months. The medical bills came to about $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">On this evidence, DelRosso\u2019s own liability for the use of force or excessive force, and for his subsequent behavior, is clear enough. The jury could find the involvement of Millbury was as follows. Millbury had an informal arrangement with the Worcester police department by which the department cooperated in supplying the caf\u00e9 with an off-duty policeman for the hours from about 9 p.m. to closing each night, Tuesdays through Saturdays. Millbury paid for these services at an hourly rate by checks to the order of the police department; after tax withholding, the policemen received their shares. (It may be surmised that the routing through the department was intended, at least in part, to assure fairness in the allocation of the work to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>the volunteers.) DelRosso had worked at the caf\u00e9 on a previous occasion and knew the manager. It was understood, without need for express instructions, that the policeman was there to inhibit disturbances and, if any arose, to quell them.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Whether one who uses the services of policemen on paid detail may be held responsible as a principal for their particular conduct has been made to depend on whether the policemen were properly classified, in respect to conduct of that sort, as \u201cindependent contractors\u201d or as \u201cservants\u201d or \u201cemployees.\u201d This in turn has depended on a multifactored estimate which expresses itself mainly in a conclusion regarding the principal\u2019s \u201cright to control\u201d the policemen\u2019s activities. See <em>Luz </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>348 Mass. 198 (1964); <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>330 Mass. 135, 141 (1953); <em>Posner </em>v. <em>Paul\u2019s Trucking Serv. Inc., </em>380 F.2d 757, 759 n.3 (1st Cir. 1967).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In the present case we are to assume that the judge instructed the jury correctly, since the defendants do not complain of the instructions and indeed the record appendixes do not reproduce them. Except for very plain cases, the discrimination and determination are for the jury as a question of fact. See <em>Seelig </em>v. <em>Harvard Coop. Soc\u2019y, </em>355 Mass. 532, 537 (1969); <em>Cowan, supra </em>at 142. So they were here. In reaching verdicts for the plaintiff, the jury were entitled to attach significance to the circumstances, among others, that DelRosso\u2019s task (as the jury might believe) was similar to that which has been customarily confided to the bartender or \u201cbouncer\u201d; that his work was to be performed on the principal\u2019s premises though it might spill over to the sidewalk (see <em>Cowan, supra </em>at 143, 144; cf. <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>342 Mass. 460 [1961]; <em>Kidder </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>336 Mass. 307 [1957]); and that he was engaged alone and not, as in some decided cases, in company with other po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>licemen under the command of a superior officer. See <em>Luz, supra </em>at 201; cf. <em>Kidder, supra </em>at 308. The jury could find that DelRosso was \u201cacting not as [a] public [officer] in a public place but as [an employee] of the defendant for its private purposes on its private premises.\u201d <em>Cowan, supra </em>at 144. That DelRosso, implicitly authorized by the principal to use force in appropriate situations, in fact used force inappropriately or excessively, would not relieve the principal here by putting those tortious acts beyond the scope of the employment. See <em>Suckney </em>v. <em>Bert P. Williams, Inc., </em>355 Mass. 62, 63-65 (1968); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Beliauskas, </em>341 Mass. 95, 98 (1960); <em>Cowan, supra </em>at 145; Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 245 (1958); Note, 45 U. Ginn. L. Rev. 235 (1976). We perceive no error in the denial of judgment n.o.v.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Nor was there error in the denial of a new trial. It is argued that a verdict of $45,000 was so far excessive that it showed a bias in the jury that could extend as well to their other findings, and so a new trial should have been ordered without opportunity for remittitur. The judge must be taken to have believed otherwise, as he acted under the terms of Mass. R. Civ. P. 59 (a), 365 Mass. 827 (1974),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and there is no basis for overriding his judgment in the matter. Cf. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>210 Mass. 563, 567-569 (1912). In protesting the size of the verdicts and of the judgments after remittitur, the defendants seem to suggest that the recovery should have been measured by reference only to the physical damage to the plaintiff and the cost of the physical repairs, as in an action for negligent injury. But more was involved \u2014 the shock and humiliation of a sudden deliberate assault, not to speak of the jailing that followed. As Justice Holmes put it, \u201ceven a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\"> Millbury had previously moved for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence, a predicate for a motion for judgment n.o.v.
