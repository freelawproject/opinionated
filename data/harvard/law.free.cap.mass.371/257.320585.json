We conclude that under the terms of the applicable motor vehicle insurance policy the insurer had no obligation to provide Coverage U benefits in the circumstances and that the policy provisions do not violate statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">The husband of the defendant administratrix (defendant) was a passenger on a motorcycle on a public way in Worcester in July, 1970. The motor vehicle insurance policy covering the motorcycle did not provide guest coverage and, therefore, as the parties concede, the motorcycle was an uninsured motor vehicle under the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle insurance policy. An accident occurred involving the motorcycle and another motor vehicle, a taxicab. The defendant\u2019s intestate died as a result of that accident, and the defendant settled a claim against the operator and the owner of the taxicab, receiving $5,000, which we infer was paid by the taxicab\u2019s insurer. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>defendant made a claim against the plaintiff (Aetna) under the Coverage U portion of her own motor vehicle insurance policy and sought arbitration of her claim as provided in that policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Aetna commenced this proceeding in the Superior Court seeking a determination of the extent, if any, of its liability and also seeking a stay of the arbitration proceedings. Arbitration was permitted to proceed reserving the legal question of the availability of coverage for subsequent determination. Almost two years later, the arbitrator filed his report in which, pursuant to order of the court, he made detailed findings of fact. The arbitrator found that the operator of the taxicab was not negligent. A decree was entered declaring that Aetna had no obligation to provide Coverage U benefits to the defendant. On our own motion we granted direct review of the defendant\u2019s appeal from the decree in Aetna\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The defendant argues here that the applicability of the policy provision was a question solely for the arbitrator and thus not for the court. Under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 111D, inserted by St. 1959, c. 438, \u00a7 2, a motor vehicle liability policy, which must contain uninsured motorists coverage (G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L), must provide \u201cthat determination as to whether the insured or his legal representative is legally entitled to recover such damages [i.e., against the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle], and if so the amount thereof, shall be made... by arbitration,\u201d if the parties do not agree. Aetna\u2019s bill refers to G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 2 (6), in support of its application for a stay of arbitration proceedings. However, \u00a7 2 (6) refers in terms only to a stay where there is no agreement to arbitrate. In <em>Employers\u2019 Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Garney, </em>348 Mass. 627, 632 (1965), we said that factual questions concerning Coverage U should be resolved by arbitration, and we assumed, without deciding, \u201cthat the general scope and meaning of the policy provisions may be matters not exclusively to be dealt with by arbitration.\u201d We think that the judge prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>erly reserved for his decision the meaning of provisions in the motor vehicle insurance policy, leaving to the arbitrator for resolution all questions concerning the insured\u2019s rights against the owner and operator of the uninsured motor vehicle, the issue which, barring agreement, must be submitted to arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 HID.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In defense of the decree in its favor, Aetna relies on that provision in its policy issued to the defendant which makes Coverage U inapplicable \u201cto bodily injury to an Insured with respect to which such Insured, his legal representative or any person entitled to payment under this coverage shall, without written consent of [Aetna], make any settlement with any person or organization who may be legally liable therefor.\u201d The settlement made by the defendant with the insurer of the taxicab literally falls within this quoted exclusion. We do not understand the defendant to argue otherwise. Death resulting from bodily injury is included expressly within mandatory Coverage U. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 HID.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument is that this policy provision is illegal and ineffective because it conflicts with the statute governing Coverage U in motor vehicle insurance policies. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant relies on \u00a7 113L (4), inserted by St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 5, which provides that an insurer making payment under uninsured motorists coverage \u201cshall, to the extent thereof, be entitled to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment resulting from the exercise of any rights of recovery of such person against any person or organization <em>legally responsible for the bodily injury </em>for which such payment is made\u201d (emphasis supplied). The defendant argues that Aetna has a right to the proceeds of any settlement only if the proceeds were received from one who was legally responsible. She points to the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ator of the taxicab was not negligent as conclusive proof that she did not receive a settlement from one legally responsible for the injuries which caused the death of her husband. Her argument is that the purported policy exclusion is overbroad in seeking to deny coverage where the settlement is received from one who may be, but in fact is not, liable for the injury sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Analyzing the purposes of \u00a7 113L, including the intention to resolve disputes by arbitration without costly litigation (see c. 175, \u00a7 111D), we conclude that the policy provision involved here correctly reflects the legislative intent. We note that the Commissioner of Insurance must have reached the same conclusion because the Coverage U provisions of the policy must be approved by him. Section 113L (1) specifically requires the Commissioner\u2019s approval of Coverage U provisions. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A, for provisions concerning the Commissioner\u2019s authority to disapprove the form of motor vehicle insurance policies as defined in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The language of \u00a7 113L (4) concerning the insurer\u2019s right to the proceeds of any payment in settlement made by a legally responsible person presents no real conflict with the policy\u2019s reference to one who \u201cmay be legally liable.\u201d The defendant obviously once asserted that the operator and owner of the taxicab were legally liable. She collected $5,000 relying on a claim that the taxicab\u2019s insureds were legally responsible. Her argument now that she had no basis for collecting the $5,000 settlement lacks consistency. We think any settlement made in response to a claim of legal responsibility conclusively establishes the existence of legal responsibility for the purposes of \u00a7 113L (4). The Legislature hardly could have intended by \u00a7 113L (4) that that question should be open for contest between the insurer and the insured subsequent to the insured\u2019s acceptance of the proceeds of a settlement from a third party. The defendant should not have it both ways. The language of the policy conforms appropriately to the clear legislative intent in \u00a7 113L (4) that there not be recovery under Coverage U to the extent that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>recovery from another alleged tortfeasor. See <em>Tuthill </em>v. <em>State Farm Ins. Co., </em>19 Ill. App. 3d 491, 497 (1974).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We leave open the question, not involved here, whether the policy provision should be read to bar all recovery against the insurer where the amount of any settlement made without the insurer\u2019s consent is all that could be collected from the third party and is less than the policy limits of the insured\u2019s Coverage U. If an- insured shows that the insurer was not prejudiced by a settlement with a third party, perhaps the exclusion in the policy should not be read as a bar to all recovery by the insured. Compare <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Phoenix of Hartford Ins. Co., </em>215 So. 2d 893, 894-895 (Fla. App. 1968), with <em>Tuthill </em>v. <em>State Farm Ins. Co., supra </em>at 500-501. Here, however, the insured collected $5,000 from the third party, the precise limit of her uninsured motorists coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\"> The limit of the defendant\u2019s Coverage U was $5,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> The defendant does not challenge here, as she did below, the direction of the judge that the arbitrator determine and report the facts so that the judge may determine the legal questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\"> See St. 1973, c. 380, for an amendment to \u00a7 113L concerning optional so called \u201cunder-insured motor vehicle coverage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b276-13\"> Similarly, the policy provision requiring the consent of the insurer to any settlement adheres to the statutory purpose that the insurer\u2019s subrogation rights not be infringed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
