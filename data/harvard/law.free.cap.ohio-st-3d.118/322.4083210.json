Sargeant Jr. of Fremont, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0013261, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1958. Since 1979, respondent has served as a judge of the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we publicly reprimand respondent for allowing six civil cases to languish in his court for an inordinate amount of time. We agree with the board that respondent\u2019s unjustified delay in these cases, and in other cases on his docket, violated the Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with violations of Canon 3 (\u201cA judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently\u201d), Canon 3(B)(8) (\u201cA judge shall dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently, and fairly and comply with guidelines set forth in the Rules of Superintendence for the Courts of Ohio\u201d), and Canon 3(C)(2) (\u201cA judge shall require staff, court officials, and others subject to the judge\u2019s direction and control to observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the judge * * * \u201d). A panel of the board considered the case against respondent on the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement. See Section 11 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). The panel recommended acceptance of the agreement, which included stipulations to the cited misconduct and a joint proposal for a public reprimand. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">II. Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">\n<em>A. Respondent Unnecessarily Delayed Proceedings in an Appeal of a Child-Support Modification Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">{\u00b6 4} On March 1, 2001, Tiffany Wehring appealed an administrative order modifying child support. Respondent held a hearing on the merits of the case in January 2002 and held what was called a \u201cfinal hearing\u201d in March. From June 2002 through October 2003, respondent also scheduled and rescheduled additional hearings to resolve a dispute over the medical bills for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Respondent did nothing more to dispose of Wehring\u2019s appeal for many months. Concerned about the delay, Wehring\u2019s attorney began writing letters to respondent in May 2004, inquiring about when to expect a decision in the case. Receiving no satisfactory response, Wehring\u2019s lawyer wrote four more letters to respondent, the last dated January 10, 2006, in frustrated attempts to obtain a ruling. Finally, after conducting a March 2006 pretrial proceeding to review the parties\u2019 arguments, respondent issued a two-and-one-half-page decision in Wehr-ing\u2019s appeal on June 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent conceded that he \u201cfailed to timely take necessary action on Tiffany Wehring\u2019s appeal of the administrative child-support modification for over 51 months after the final hearing.\u201d Respondent\u2019s unnecessary and unjustified delay violated Canons 3, 3(B)(8), and 3(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\n<em>B. Respondent Unnecessarily Delayed Proceedings in Three Divorce Cases.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">1. The First Divorce Case</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 7} On September 30, 2003, Anne Burchett filed a complaint for a divorce. Respondent conducted a hearing on the merits on November 1, 2004, and over the next two weeks, the parties filed their final legal arguments. Again, respondent did nothing more to further a disposition in the divorce for more than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">{\u00b6 8} On January 11, 2006, Burchett\u2019s attorney sent respondent a letter inquiring as to the status of the case. Burchett later called respondent\u2019s office herself to determine when a final divorce decree would be issued. In late June 2006, still without a final divorce decree, Burchett filed a grievance with relator. Upon receiving notice of the grievance, respondent apologized to Burchett, and by August 10, 2006, he issued his decision and ordered Burchett\u2019s attorney to prepare the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent conceded that he \u201cfailed to make a decision on Burchett\u2019s divorce for 20 months after the final hearing.\u201d Respondent\u2019s unnecessary and unjustified delay violated Canons 3, 3(B)(8), and 3(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">2. The Second Divorce Case</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">{\u00b6 10} On September 7, 2004, another plaintiff filed for divorce in respondent\u2019s court. Respondent conducted the final hearing on the issue of divorce on June 13, 2005, granting the divorce and noting the possibility of foreclosure on the marital residence. Respondent scheduled and then continued further hearings on spousal and child support until, at the urging of the plaintiffs attorney, he reset the hearing for November 7, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">{\u00b6 11} After the November 7 hearing, respondent did nothing to further a disposition in the divorce for approximately six months. Finally, on June 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>2007, after the defendant had also urged the court to rule in the case, respondent issued a two-page decision and ordered plaintiffs attorney to prepare the final divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent conceded that he \u201cfailed to issue a final decision on this case until 20 months after the final hearing\u201d in this second divorce case. Respondent\u2019s unnecessary and unjustified delay violated Canons 3, 3(B)(8), and 3(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">3. The Third Divorce Case</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 13} On June 11, 2004, a third plaintiff filed a complaint for a legal separation from her husband, and in October 2004, a magistrate for the Sandusky County Common Pleas Court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $1,100 per month in temporary spousal support. On May 25, 2005, the magistrate noted in court records that a divorce had been granted and that the parties had resolved all disputes other than the issue of spousal support. The magistrate scheduled a hearing to address spousal support for June 21, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 14} Twelve months later, the magistrate still had not issued any decision as to spousal support in the plaintiffs case. In July 2006, defendant\u2019s counsel requested a rehearing, arguing a change of circumstances. The magistrate then issued a decision on August 2006, in which he granted the plaintiff $600 per month in spousal support. The plaintiff objected to the reduction, and in December 2006, the parties filed a proposed consent judgment, together asking respondent to consider the spousal-support issue de novo because so much time had passed and circumstances had changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 15} Respondent heard the parties\u2019 spousal-support claims on January 17, 2007. On June 13, 2007, he issued a two-page decision granting the plaintiff $1,500 per month in spousal support, effective July 1, 2007, and directing her counsel to prepare the final divorce decree. Two years had passed from the order granting the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 16} Respondent conceded that the two-year delay in this divorce case complicated the parties\u2019 lives unnecessarily. Respondent\u2019s unnecessary and unjustified delay violated Canons 3, 3(B)(8), and 3(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">\n<em>C. Respondent Unnecessarily Delayed Proceedings in a Personal-Injury Claim.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">{\u00b6 17} On November 24, 2004, Danielle Tester filed a personal-injury lawsuit against Shain Dietz related to an automobile accident. Dietz filed an answer in December 2004, and by the end of March 2005, Tester had responded to Dietz\u2019s discovery requests. Respondent took no action in the case until July 10, 2006, when he conducted a pretrial hearing. The parties later settled the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Respondent conceded that he unnecessarily delayed proceedings in Tester\u2019s personal-injury suit over 18 months. Respondent\u2019s unjustified delay violated Canons 3, 3(B)(8), and 3(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\n<em>D. Respondent Unnecessarily Delayed Proceedings in a Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 19} On July 2, 2002, Lisa Smith challenged an administrative order in her workers\u2019 compensation claim. By the end of August 2002, both defendants had answered her complaint. Respondent conducted pretrial proceedings during 2003 and 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 20} Respondent asserts that at an August 4, 2004 pretrial, he proposed a mediation conference and that one of the parties proposed mediation through the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation. Almost two years passed before respondent inquired, in June 2006, as to the status of the case. Nothing had happened. In July 2006, respondent referred the case to mediation, and the parties resolved the case during that process.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 21} Respondent concedes that he failed to take necessary action in Smith\u2019s case between August 4, 2004, and June 7, 2006. Respondent states that he assumed that the parties were exploring settlement during this 22-month period and acknowledges that he failed to ascertain the parties\u2019 progress or lack thereof. Respondent\u2019s unjustified delay violated Canons 3, 3(B)(8), and 3(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\n<em>E. Judicial Notice of Case-Management Statistics</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">{\u00b622} The board recommended a public reprimand based solely on the foregoing cases. However, these cases provide only isolated evidence of respondent\u2019s dilatory conduct. To obtain a clearer picture of respondent\u2019s management of the cases assigned to him, we turn to facts not presented in the underlying proceedings. Courts may take judicial notice of certain relevant facts, regardless of whether the parties request it. Evid.R. 201(C). \u201cA judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably] be questioned.\u201d Evid.R. 201(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">{\u00b6 23} Ohio appellate, common pleas, county, and municipal courts are subject to time limits within which dispositions must be made of the cases assigned to them. Sup.R. 39(A) provides that \u201c[t]he time limits for disposition of appellate and civil cases shall be as indicated on the Supreme Court report forms.\u201d Appendix A of the Rules of Superintendence contains the report forms for common pleas court judges and establishes time guidelines for disposition of various matters. See Sup.R. Appx. A, Forms A, B, C, and PCRP. Forms A and B provide the standards for the types of cases involved in this case: 12 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>for modification or enforcement of support orders, 18 months for divorces involving children, 12 months for divorces without children, 24 months for torts, and 12 months for workers\u2019 compensation appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">{\u00b6 24} The Rules of Superintendence require every judge on the appellate, common pleas, county, and municipal courts to file with this court case-status reports. See Sup.R. 37 and Appendix A to the Rules of Superintendence. These reports are compiled by this court\u2019s Case Management Section and can be arranged to provide both information about individual judges and comparisons between groups of judges. The statistics from the Case Management Section qualify for judicial notice as facts determined by a source whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. See Evid.R. 201(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b625} We have reviewed respondent\u2019s caseloads and case-flow performance from 1998 through 2007, both individually and in comparison to other common pleas court judges in his county and in similar counties across the state. We focused on one specific factor in this review, the percentage of cases on respondent\u2019s docket that were pending beyond the time guidelines prescribed by this court. For this factor, a rate of 0 percent indicates that the judge is resolving all cases in his or her court within the suggested time; a rate of 10 percent or higher indicates a case-management problem. This statistic reveals that respondent frequently kept cases pending for longer than the time guidelines prescribed by the rules of superintendence and that he reported a far greater percentage of such pending cases than his peers.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 26} Respondent\u2019s failings in that regard are most apparent when one examines the contested divorce cases on his docket. In contested divorces in which the parties had children, respondent\u2019s peers had, on average, between 2 percent and 5 percent of their cases pending beyond this court\u2019s guidelines from 1998 to 2007. In 2001, respondent had 21 percent of such cases pending beyond the guidelines. From 2002 through 2005, respondent kept between 13 percent and 19 percent of those cases pending beyond the guidelines, though he reduced these numbers to 8 percent in 2006 and 3 percent in 2007. The first grievance was filed against respondent in June 2006. Similarly, for contested divorce cases without children, respondent\u2019s peers had, on average, between 4 percent and 11 percent of those cases pending beyond the guidelines from 1998 through 2007. Respondent reached a high of 43 percent in 2001, followed by 8 percent in 2002, 5 percent in 2003, 38 percent in 2004, 42 percent in 2005, 26 percent in 2006, and 6 percent in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 27} Although his conduct improved in 2006 and 2007, respondent has made a habit of keeping unacceptably high numbers of cases pending beyond this court\u2019s guidelines. This conduct plainly violated Canons 3, 3(B)(8), and 3(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>III. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">{\u00b6 28} In detennining the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct, we consider the duties violated, respondent\u2019s mental state, the injury caused, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and applicable precedent. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Evans </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 497, 501, 733 N.E.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\n<em>A. Duties Violated and Injury Caused</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b629} The timely resolution of cases is fundamental to the judicial system. \u201cTo none will we sell, to none will we deny, to none will we delay right or justice.\u201d Magna Carta, Clause 40, reprinted in Senate Document No. 232, 66th Cong., 2d Sess. 17. While courts inherently have the power to supervise and control their dockets (see <em>State ex rel. Buck v. McCabe </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 535, 537, 24 O.O. 552, 45 N.E.2d 763), this power is tempered by the responsibility to efficiently administer justice. Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges to perform their duties with impartiality and diligence, to give their judicial duties precedence over all other activities, to dispose of cases and other judicial matters \u201cpromptly, efficiently, and fairly,\u201d and to hold their staff, court officials, and others to these high standards. Canon 3, 3(A), 3(B)(8), and 3(C)(2). \u201cPrompt disposition of the court\u2019s business requires a judge to devote adequate time to judicial duties, to be punctual in attending court and expeditious in determining matters under submission, and to require that court officials, litigants and their lawyers cooperate with the judge to that end.\u201d Commentary to Canon 3(B)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 30} Lengthy, unjustified delays in the disposition of a court\u2019s docket compromise the interests of parties and diminish confidence in the judiciary and the legal system. By failing to efficiently resolve the cases before him, respondent left the parties referred to above and many others in a legal limbo, often for a period of years. Respondent\u2019s conduct was inherently injurious, as it prevented timely resolution of disputes that profoundly affected the lives of those, in particular children, whose interests were before his court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\n<em>B. Mental State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">{\u00b6 31} There has been no evidence presented regarding respondent\u2019s mental state, and thus we presume that he was healthy and unhindered in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">C. <em>Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">{\u00b6 32} We weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in order to impose a sanction that is appropriate for the circumstances presented. No aggravating factors were identified in the parties\u2019 stipulation. In mitigation, the parties stipulated that respondent has no prior disciplinary record, cooperated completely in the investigation of the grievances against him, and provided persuasive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>testimonials to his good character and reputation. BCGD Proe.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (d), and (e). The parties also stipulated that respondent has hired a law clerk to help him better manage his docket, including preparing monthly status reports on all pending cases and drafting opinions more expeditiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\n<em>D. Applicable precedent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 33} This case is unique. This court has not previously been presented with a recommendation that we sanction a judge solely for the judge\u2019s failure to manage his or her docket pursuant to the deadlines provided in the Rules of Superintendence. We have found violations of Canon 3(B)(8) of the Code of Judicial Conduct in particular in several disciplinary cases, but the sanctions have always been in response to those violations in combination with several other violations of the Code. See, e.g., <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Squire, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 110, 2007-Ohio-5588, 876 N.E.2d 933, \u00b6 112 (suspending a former judge for two years with 12 months stayed for numerous violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct, including Canon 3(B)(8), and the Code of Professional Responsibility); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Medley, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 251, 2004-Ohio-6402, 819 N.E.2d 273, \u00b6 43 (suspending a judge for 18 months with six months stayed for numerous violations); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Karto </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 109, 117, 760 N.E.2d 412 (suspending a judge for six months for numerous violations). However, the fact that there is no precedent for these particular circumstances does not diminish the problems caused by respondent\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>E. Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">{\u00b6 34} Parties rightfully expect to receive prompt, efficient, and fair resolutions of their cases. Judges must meet these expectations impartially and diligently. By failing to manage his docket, respondent injured the parties before him and the public\u2019s perception of the legal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">{\u00b6 35} Nevertheless, we recognize that this case is one of first impression, as it is the only disciplinary case we have encountered that involves only docket control. We also consider the following facts in determining an appropriate sanction: (1) respondent\u2019s term of office ends in December 2008, (2) in 2006 and 2007, respondent reduced the number of cases pending beyond this court\u2019s guidelines, (3) respondent hired a law clerk to assist him, (4) respondent has no prior disciplinary record, (5) respondent fully cooperated in the disciplinary proceedings, and (6) respondent presented evidence of his good character.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">{\u00b6 36} Given the strength of those mitigating factors that are unique to this case, we accept the recommended sanction and hereby publicly reprimand respondent for his violations of Canons 3, 3(B)(8), and 3(C)(2). Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"aoq-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Jonathan E.

Because I believe that the respondent, regardless of his status as a judge, engaged in a persistent pattern of neglect, I would remand the matter to the board for a hearing pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(8)(D). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
