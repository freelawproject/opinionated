(\u201cPolaris\u201d) owned the five parcels at issue in this case, and those parcels collectively constituted the Germain Amphitheater, which was a venue for popular music concerts located in the city of Columbus and the Olentangy Local School District. Polaris challenged the auditor\u2019s valuation of the parcels for tax year 2003. The primary focus of the challenge, both before the Delaware County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) and the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), lay in Polaris\u2019s contention that the structures on the parcels did not constitute real property, but personal property. If successful, this contention would have drastically reduced the assessed value of the property by eliminating that portion of the value associated with the improvements. Ultimately, however, both the BOR and the BTA rejected Polaris\u2019s attempt to recharacterize the improvements as personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal to this court, Polaris does not take issue with the inclusion of the improvements in the real property tax base. Instead, Polaris targets its appeal to the specific amount of value that the BTA allocated to the land as opposed to the improvements. Polaris asserts that both its own appraisal and that presented by the Board of Education of the Olentangy Local Schools (\u201cBOE\u201d) show that the land had a much lower value than what the BTA found. Because this appraisal evidence was the only evidence of land value in the record, Polaris argues that the BTA\u2019s finding of land value is not supported by probative evidence and should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 3} Polaris seeks to consider the land value in isolation from the value that the BTA allocated to the improvements. By seeking reduction of the land value, and by not challenging the value allocated to the improvements, Polaris asks for an overall reduction in total value. Indeed, Polaris\u2019s notice of appeal and its brief seek a reduction in total value equal to the amount by which the land value is allegedly overstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 4} The BOE opposes this request on two main grounds. First, the BOE asserts as a jurisdictional matter that the total value of the property, both land and improvements, is always at issue in a valuation case and that Polaris cannot prevail because it has not contested the finding of the total value for the property. Second, the BOE contends that in this particular case, any error in the value assigned to the land is merely an error in allocating value between land and improvements, not an error in determining the total value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 5} We reject the BOE\u2019s first argument. The BOE relies on R.C. 5715.19(A), which relates to the jurisdiction of the boards of revision and, derivatively, of the BTA. R.C. 5715.19(A) does not define the jurisdiction of this court once a BTA decision has been appealed. This court\u2019s jurisdiction is governed by R.C. 5717.04, which requires that a notice of appeal \u201cset forth * * * the errors therein complained of\u2019 in the BTA\u2019s decision. We have repeatedly held that the assignments of error set forth in the notice of appeal define the scope of our jurisdiction to grant relief to an appellant. See <em>Dayton-Montgomery Cty. Port Auth. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22 <em>(\u201cDayton\u201d), </em>\u00b632, citing <em>Cleveland Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 336, 337, 626 N.E.2d 933, citing <em>Columbus </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Bd. of Edn. v. J.C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 203, 204-205, 11 OBR 521, 465 N.E.2d 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 6} Our unanimous decision last year in <em>Dayton </em>illustrates the point. In that case, the Dayton-Montgomery County Port Authority appealed the BTA\u2019s determination of the value of its new office building in downtown Dayton. The Port Authority contended that the actual-cost figures it presented to the board of revision constituted a more accurate valuation of its building than the figures used by the auditor. Neither the Port Authority nor any other party had appealed the BTA\u2019s determination of the valuation of the underlying land.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 7} The BTA had found the value of the land to be $133,290, though the parties agreed that it should have been $316,620. \u201cThe reduction of this figure to $133,290 appeared] to be clear error on the part of both the board of revision and the BTA.\u201d <em>Dayton, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, \u00b6 31. Athough the port authority had expressed at oral argument its willingness to stipulate to the higher land value, we held that we had no jurisdiction to correct the error in the land valuation because it was not the subject of an assignment of error in a properly filed notice of appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIn spite of the agreement of the parties, however, we have no jurisdiction to effect a change of the land value from the value that the BTA found. Our revisory jurisdiction over BTA decisions depends upon compliance with the statute, R.C. 5717.04, which requires that the appellant set forth in the notice of appeal the errors complained of in the BTA decision. Failure to so specify deprives the court of jurisdiction to grant a party relief on that ground. See <em>Cleveland Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 336, 337, 626 N.E.2d 933, citing <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. J.C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 203, 204-205, 11 OBR 521, 465 N.E.2d 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c * * * To preserve the question properly, either party aggrieved by the BTA\u2019s land valuation \u2014 the auditor or the board of education \u2014 should have filed its own appeal and specified the error. * * * Since that did not occur, we have no jurisdiction to correct the land valuation, and it follows that on remand the BTA likewise has no authority to depart from its previous finding that the land should be valued at $133,290.\u201d <em>Dayton, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, \u00b6 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 10} Thus, <em>Dayton </em>makes clear that an appeal from the BTA\u2019s determination of the value of real property does not <em>necessarily </em>place both the land and the building values at issue. Consistent with <em>Dayton, </em>we hold that Polaris acted within its rights as a litigant to file a notice of appeal that challenged only the land valuation as a method of reducing the total valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">{\u00b6 11} The BOE\u2019s second argument invites the court to exceed its jurisdiction and must therefore be rejected as well. The BOE identifies as the \u201conly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>apparent issue\u201d the question of \u201chow certain values are to be allocated between the land value and the improvement value,\u201d with the result that \u201c[i]f a reduction in the value of [Polaris\u2019s] land is in order, then a corresponding increase in the value of the improvements would be proper.\u201d In other words, the BOE asserts a defense against the appeal by asserting that, <em>even if the allocation is wrong, </em>the total \u201ctrue value\u201d found by the BTA would still be correct, and the resulting taxes Polaris owes would not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 12} Polaris responds by relying on <em>Dayton, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, \u00b6 33. Polaris argues that the BOE may not defend this appeal by arguing that any error in valuing the land is offset by an error in valuing the improvements. To do so, Polaris contends, the BOE would have had to file a cross-appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 13} Our authority to review decisions issued by the BTA emanates from Section 2(B)(2)(d), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, which states that this court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction encompasses \u201c[s]uch revisory jurisdiction of the proceedings of administrative officers or agencies <em>as may be conferred by law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The General Assembly conferred such appellate. power on this court through R.C. 5717.04, and that statute strictly defines our authority to correct alleged errors committed by the BTA. As we have already observed, R.C. 5717.04 requires parties who seek review of a BTA decision to \u201cset forth * * * the errors therein complained of,\u201d and that mandate limits the scope of our appellate jurisdiction. If the BOE wanted to invoke our jurisdiction to consider whether the BTA erred by assigning too little value to the improvements, then it had to file a cross-appeal setting forth that error pursuant to R.C. 5717.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 14} The BOE suggests that it may advance its \u201cmere misallocation\u201d argument as an alternative ground for affirming the BTA\u2019s decision in this case. That suggestion is incorrect. Our cases do not permit us to rectify an alleged error of the BTA unless that error was set forth in a proper notice of appeal, even if the alleged error aggrieved the party only because of the success of another party\u2019s appeal. For example, in <em>Christian Church of Ohio v. Limbach </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 270, 560 N.E.2d 199, the BTA granted a tax exemption under R.C. 5709.07 and did not reach the property owner\u2019s additional claim of exemption under R.C. 5709.12. On appeal, we reversed the grant of exemption and further held that we had no jurisdiction to consider the additional claim of exemption because the owner had not filed a cross-appeal. Id. at 271, 560 N.E.2d 199, fn. 1. Similarly, in <em>Lenart v. Lindley </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 110, 15 O.O.3d 152, 399 N.E.2d 1222, the Tax Commissioner appealed a BTA decision that reversed an assessment that he had issued against a corporate officer. The corporate officer asserted \u201ca number of alternative grounds upon which this court could affirm the BTA in the event that appellant\u2019s challenge is well taken,\u201d but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the court found that it had no jurisdiction over such arguments. Id. at 115, 15 O.O.3d 152, 399 N.E.2d 1222, fn. 1. Indeed, R.C. 5717.04 expressly affords litigants in BTA cases the opportunity to preserve issues by filing a cross-appeal: when one party to a BTA ease files an appeal from the BTA\u2019s decision, the other parties have at least ten days to file a cross-appeal. R.C. 5717.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Dayton, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, \u00b6 33, we relied on both <em>Christian Church </em>and <em>Lenart </em>in support of our holding. Today, we again rely on those cases as we decline to exercise jurisdiction over the BOE\u2019s argument that the challenge raised by Polaris involves a mere misallocation of value between land and improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 16} We now turn to Polaris\u2019s central contention: that the land value found by the BTA is not supported by the record. We agree that it is not. The BTA found that the auditor\u2019s total valuation at $20,734,000 was supported by the BOE\u2019s appraisal, which had set a total value of $21,000,000. Next, the BTA adopted the auditor\u2019s determination that the land was worth $13,799,100. Both appraisals controvert that determination. Polaris\u2019s appraisal expert determined a land value of $7,200,000, but perhaps more important, the BOE\u2019s own appraisal expert had fixed the value of the land at $8,600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 17} Although the BTA\u2019s finding of total value was supported by the BOE\u2019s appraisal, its allocation of value to land was not. The allocation of value between land and improvements does not constitute an arbitrary exercise; it relates to the basic method by which county auditors determine value. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s administrative rules direct the county auditors to arrive at total value by separately valuing the land and improvements. See Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-07(B). The commissioner also prescribes two different rules for land valuation and the valuation of improvements. Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-07(C), 5703-25-11, and 5703-25-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 18} When we review BTA decisions, we determine whether the decision is \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>Shiloh Automotive, Inc. v. Levin, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 4, 2008-Ohio-68, 881 N.E.2d 227, \u00b6 15. Under this standard, we will affirm the BTA\u2019s determinations of fact if the record contains reliable and probative evidence to support the BTA\u2019s findings. Id. But we will reverse if the record does not support, or if it contradicts, the BTA\u2019s findings. <em>Dayton, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, \u00b6 14, 27-28. Because the record in this case contains no support for, and indeed contradicts, the BTA\u2019s finding of land value, we must reverse it. As in <em>Dayton, </em>we remand for additional factual determination based upon the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">{\u00b6 19} As we have already established, the BOE\u2019s failure to file a cross-appeal limits our jurisdiction on appeal. By the same token, the absence of a cross-appeal limits the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction on remand. On remand, the BTA has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>jurisdiction to redetermine the value of the land. In redetermining the land value, the BTA shall, among other things, address the parties\u2019 dispute concerning the value of one parcel that Polaris alleges was not zoned for commercial use and that had been the subject of a recent sale. However, the BTA on remand has no jurisdiction to disturb its previous determination of the value of the improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Decision reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-5\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b449-6\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQt\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 20} While I concur in the majority opinion because the statute and our case law dictate that result, I write to alert all unsuspecting parties that a cross-appeal will be necessary due to recent tax law changes in order to preserve the issue of the value of property as a whole. R.C. 5717.04 requires that a party seeking to appeal a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) to this court must \u201cset forth * * * the errors * * * complained of\u2019 in the BTA\u2019s decision. Ordinarily, this mandate is standard practice, but in this case, it leads to a decidedly odd consequence: as the majority describes, the statute permits the property owner to appeal from the determination of the value of the land while leaving the BTA\u2019s determination of the value of the improvements beyond the jurisdiction of the court. That is true even though the BTA determined the value of the land in close conjunction with determining the value of the improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 21} In most situations, a party that perceives an error in a lower court\u2019s decision but is not aggrieved by the outcome of that decision need not file a cross-appeal in order to preserve the right to raise the claimed error. Instead of appealing, that party raises the issue in the course of defending against the other party\u2019s appeal. But R.C. 5717.04 and the cases in which we have applied that statute do not permit that procedure here.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">{\u00b6 22} Although I agree with the majority\u2019s disposition of this issue, I write separately to note that this situation is likely to recur and that litigants who have prevailed before the BTA need to consider carefully whether they ought to file a protective cross-appeal when an opponent appeals the BTA\u2019s decision to this court. In this case, the property owner contended that the improvements constituted personal property pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Funtime, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 74, 2004-Ohio-6890, 822 N.E.2d 781. As a result, the improvements were not, under the owner\u2019s theory, subject to the real property tax at all. The BTA ruled against the owner\u2019s position on that issue and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>determined the value of the land and improvements based on the evidence presented. When the owner assigned error only as to the valuation of the land in its notice of appeal, and when neither the board of education nor the county auditor cross-appealed the value assigned to the improvements, the owner placed the land-value at issue while foreclosing a comprehensive valuation of the property. Such a procedural situation does not serve the ultimate interest in arriving at a proper total value for the property.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AkdW\">Sleggs, Danziger &amp; Gill Co., L.P.A., and Todd W. Sleggs, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AkJ\">Rich, Crites <em>&amp; </em>Dittmer, L.L.C., Jeffrey A. Rich, and Mark H. Gillis, for appellee Board of Education of Olentangy Local Schools.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AFP\">David Yost, Delaware County Prosecuting Attorney, and Christopher Betts, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellees Delaware County Board of Revision and County Auditor.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 23} The situation presented here is likely to recur because in 2005, the General Assembly enacted tax reform measures that phased out the ad valorem tax that Ohio had traditionally levied on personal property used in business. It is now obvious that owners will seek, where possible, to characterize property as personal property rather than as realty in order to avoid taxation of that property. Litigants in such cases need to be alerted to the need to file protective cross-appeals whenever the preservation of the result they desire calls for the correction of a BTA error. Doing so will ensure that property is properly valued, a result that serves all taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 24} I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
