Weeks later, White killed Kawczk\u2019s mother and Deborah Thorpe, who was the mother of Kawczk\u2019s new boyfriend, Michael Thorpe. During a subsequent confrontation at Kawczk\u2019s place of employment, White attempted to kill Michael Thorpe. See <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 433-434, 709 N.E.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 3} White was sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of Deborah Thorpe. On direct appeal, we affirmed his conviction and death sentence. Id. The trial court dismissed White\u2019s initial petition for postconviction relief in March 1998, and the court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. White </em>(June 16, 1999), Summit App. No. 19040, 1999 WL 394938.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">{\u00b6 4} On June 20, 2002, the United States Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits sentencing to death persons who are mentally retarded. <em>Atkins v. Virginia </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335. On July 22, 2002, White commenced the instant litigation by filing a successor petition for postconviction relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that petition, White asserted that he was mentally retarded and hence, under <em>Atkins, </em>could not be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">I. The Legal Definition of Mental Retardation</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">{\u00b6 5} In <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 308, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335, fn. 3, the United States Supreme Court quoted the definitions of mental retardation promulgated by the American Association on Mental Retardation (\u201cAAMR\u201d) and the American Psychiatric Association (\u201cAPA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">{\u00b6 6} The AAMR defines mental retardation as \u201c \u2018substantial limitations in present functioning. It is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>following applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work. Mental retardation manifests before age 18.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 308, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335, fn. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 7} The APA\u2019s definition is similar: \u201c \u2018The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning * * * that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety * * *. The onset must occur before age 18 years * * *.\u2019 \u2018Mild\u2019 mental retardation is typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 50 to 55 to approximately 70.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>State v. Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b6 12, we held: \u201cClinical definitions of mental retardation, cited with approval in <em>Atkins, </em>provide a standard for evaluating an individual\u2019s claim of mental retardation. * * * These definitions require (1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, (2) significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such as communication, self-care, and self-direction, and (3) onset before the age of 18.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">II. The Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"A-k\">A. White\u2019s Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">{\u00b6 9} At White\u2019s request, the trial court appointed Dr. David Hammer, a psychologist, as the petitioner\u2019s expert in mental retardation. The state retained as its expert Dr. John M. Fabian, a clinical and forensic psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">{\u00b6 10} Drs. Hammer and Fabian jointly conducted testing to determine whether White was mentally retarded. They administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (\u201cWAIS-III\u201d), a standard IQ test; the Wide Range Achievement Test, Third Edition (\u201cWRAT-III\u201d), which measures academic achievement; and the Scales of Independent Behavior \u2014 Revised (\u201cSIB-R\u201d), which measures adaptive skills. They also interviewed White to obtain information for the SIB-R. Finally, they reviewed White\u2019s educational, medical, correctional, and children-services records, along with earlier psychological evaluations performed in connection with White\u2019s aggravated-murder trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">1. Intellectual Functioning</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">{\u00b6 11} Drs. Fabian and Hammer administered the WAIS-III on July 28, 2003. White\u2019s IQ, as measured by that test, was 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">{\u00b6 12} Drs. Fabian and Hammer also administered the WRAT-III. WThite\u2019s WRAT-III scores \u201cindicate very poor academic abilities * * * equivalent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>about the second-grade level.\u201d This result was consistent with White\u2019s score on the WAIS-III.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">2. Adaptive Skills</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[C]linical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills * * * that became manifest before age 18.\u201d <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 318, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335. Adaptive skills are those skills that one applies to the everyday demands of independent living, such as taking care of oneself and interacting with others. Adaptive behavior tests are designed to assess how a person applies those skills in the tasks of everyday life.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 14} Drs. Hammer and Fabian used the SIB-R to assess whether White had significant limitations in adaptive skills. The SIB-R consists of 259 questions. Each question seeks to measure how well the subject can perform a particular task. The questions are divided among 14 \u201cscales\u201d or \u201cdomains.\u201d Each scale contains between 16 and 20 questions designed to evaluate the subject\u2019s skills in one of 14 categories: gross motor skills, fine motor skills, social interaction, language comprehension, language expression, eating and meal preparation, \u201ctoileting\u201d (i.e., using the toilet), dressing, \u201cpersonal self-care\u201d (i.e., health and hygiene), domestic skills, time and punctuality, money and value, work skills, and \u201chome/community orientation.\u201d The 14 scales are grouped into four \u201cclusters\u201d: motor skills, social/communication, personal living, and community living.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">{\u00b6 15} To administer the SIB-R, the examiner interviews \u201cinformants\u201d \u2014 for example, parents, other relatives, or teachers \u2014 who are well acquainted with the person being evaluated. The informants provide the examiner with information about the subject\u2019s abilities. The examiner then uses this information to score the SIB-R.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">{\u00b6 16} Each question on the SIB-R is scored on a scale of zero to three. According to Dr. Hammer, a zero means that the subject either cannot perform a particular task \u201cor has not really had a chance to do something like that.\u201d A \u201c1\u201d means the subject \u201ccan\u2019t do [the task] very well.\u201d A \u201c2\u201d means he can \u201cdo it fairly well most of the time, but they might have to be asked to do it; they don\u2019t necessarily initiate on their own.\u201d A \u201c3\u201d means that the subject can routinely perform the task \u201cvery well and do it independently without being asked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">{\u00b6 17} The examiner explains this rating system to the informants, then asks them to rate how well the subject can perform each task. If the informant has never seen the subject attempt a particular task, or if the subject has never had an opportunity to perform it, the informant is asked to estimate the subject\u2019s ability to perform it. If the informants cannot make an estimate, the examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>makes his own estimate, based on his observations of the subject and any other information he can obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 18} When all questions have been scored, the points on each scale are added, yielding a raw score. A computer program converts the raw score into a scaled score for each scale. These scaled scores are averaged to yield a score for each cluster, and the cluster scores in turn are averaged to yield an overall \u201cbroad independence\u201d score. The cluster scores can be used to cross-check the broad independence score for consistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 19} On July 28, 2002, after Dr. Fabian administered the WAIS-III to White, Drs. Hammer and Fabian together interviewed White for approximately one hour to evaluate his adaptive functioning. Dr. Hammer later used information from this interview in scoring White\u2019s SIB-R. However, he did not use White\u2019s information as his sole basis for scoring any question, and he estimated that \u201cprobably less than 10 percent\u201d of his information came from White.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 20} On October 20, 2003, Drs. Hammer and Fabian together interviewed White\u2019s mother, his sisters Keisha and Erica, and his brother Eric. White\u2019s mother and Erica provided most of the information for Dr. Hammer\u2019s scoring of the SIB-R. Dr. Hammer later scored each question on the SIB-R, based on the family\u2019s responses and other information, including information obtained from White and his own observations of White.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">{\u00b6 21} In Dr. Hammer\u2019s opinion, White had significant limitations in more than two of the ten adaptive-skill areas covered by the AAMR definition of retardation. In Dr. Fabian\u2019s opinion, White was deficient in 12 of the 14 areas measured by the SIB-R. Dr. Fabian considered White\u2019s overall adaptive skills comparable to those of an average person age 11 years, ten months.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">{\u00b6 22} White\u2019s \u201cbroad independence\u201d score on the SIB-R was 55. According to Dr. Hammer, a broad independence score below 70 indicates significantly subaverage functioning. White\u2019s overall score was consistent with the WAIS and WRAT results and was in the lowest percentile for White\u2019s age group.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">3. Onset before Age 18</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">{\u00b6 23} White had not taken either an IQ test or an adaptive-skills test before age 18. To determine whether White\u2019s subaverage functioning began before 18, Drs. Hammer and Fabian reviewed White\u2019s school records. These records show that White\u2019s academic performance was poor. He failed numerous courses, repeated seventh grade, and was in tenth grade for three years before leaving school. In eighth grade, White was reading at a fourth-grade level and was doing mathematics at about a sixth-grade level.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">{\u00b6 24} Although White\u2019s pre-18 adaptive skills had not been tested, Dr. Fabian testified that White\u2019s poor academic record supported a finding that his adaptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>deficits had their onset before age 18. According to Dr. Fabian, there is a correlation between intellectual and adaptive abilities. Moreover, White\u2019s records suggest a deficit in \u201cfunctional academics,\u201d which is itself one of the adaptive skills relevant to a diagnosis of retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 25} Additionally, the experts agreed that White\u2019s current adaptive deficits support their finding of onset of retardation before age 18. The experts testified that a person\u2019s developmental level is generally determined by approximately age ten. Thus, absent a severe brain injury or medical condition \u2014 of which there was no evidence in White\u2019s case \u2014 a person who has intellectual and adaptive deficits as an adult probably has had them since childhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">B. The Hearing on White\u2019s Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 26} On December 10, 2003, January 26 and 27, 2004, and April 19, 2004, the trial court held a three-part evidentiary hearing on White\u2019s postconviction <em>Atkins </em>claim. The state presented no expert testimony at the hearing, but did present the testimony of Heather Kawczk, who had been White\u2019s girlfriend from 1992 to 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">{\u00b6 27} Kawczk testified that White was popular in school and participated in activities with others. She testified that he worked, rented an apartment, bought a truck, and helped her when she bought a car. She also testified that White could cook, drive, and play games that required coordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">{\u00b6 28} White presented the testimony of Dr. Hammer and the state\u2019s expert, Dr. Fabian. Additionally, Dr. Hammer was deposed in February 2004, and his deposition was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">{\u00b6 29} Drs. Hammer and Fabian agreed that White meets the definition of mental retardation. Neither expert thought this conclusion was a \u201cclose call.\u201d Dr. Hammer testified that his opinion was confirmed by the \u201cconvergent validity\u201d of the test results. In other words, White\u2019s current WAIS, WRAT, and SIB-R scores are consistent with his scores on previous intelligence and achievement tests and with his academic record, and all point to a diagnosis of mild mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">{\u00b6 30} Finally, at the trial court\u2019s request, Bradley K. Hill, a co-author of the SIB-R, testified as an expert witness to explain how the SIB-R was developed and how it is used to diagnose mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">C. Decision and Findings of the Trial Court</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">{\u00b6 31} On February 28, 2005, the trial court denied White\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">{\u00b6 32} The trial court found that White had established, by a preponderance of the evidence, the first of Lott\u2019s three criteria: significantly subaverage intellectu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>al functioning. <em>Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b6 12. The trial court noted that White\u2019s IQ of 52 \u201ceasily satisfies\u201d the intellectual-functioning portion of the legal test for mental retardation. The trial court also found \u201cample corroborative evidence\u201d that White\u2019s IQ was below 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 33} However, the trial court found that White had failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of <em>Lott\u2019s </em>two other criteria: \u201csignificant limitations in two or more adaptive skills\u201d and \u201conset before the age of 18.\u201d <em>Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">1. Adaptive Skills</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 34} Even though White\u2019s SIB-R results indicated that he suffered from significant limitations in adaptive skills, the trial court found that \u201ca number of flaws * * * tend to dilute and compromise the probative value of the adaptive behavior test score.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 35} The trial court questioned the manner in which Drs. Hammer and Fabian administered the SIB-R. Dr. Fabian did not personally participate in scoring the SIB-R, and the trial court found that Dr. Fabian\u2019s diagnosis \u201crelied heavily on Dr. Hammer\u2019s judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">{\u00b6 36} The trial court also questioned the reliability of the information used in scoring the SIB-R. White\u2019s mother and sister were Dr. Hammer\u2019s principal informants. Thus, White\u2019s SIB-R scores were based largely on information provided by his family. The trial court found that White\u2019s relatives \u201chave reason to exaggerate in favor of a positive diagnosis of [mental retardation].\u201d The trial court also noted that White\u2019s mother had once told psychiatrists that her son\u2019s teachers described him as \u201cpretty smart if he put his mind to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">{\u00b6 37} The trial court was troubled as well by Dr. Hammer\u2019s use of information provided by White himself. Citing Dr. Fabian\u2019s testimony, the trial court observed that \u201cthe recommendation of the AAMR is to use \u2018somebody other than the person [being graded]\u2019 \u201d as an informant for the SIB-R.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">{\u00b6 38} The trial court also found that some of White\u2019s low scores on SIB-R tasks were based on conjecture. For example, in several instances, Dr. Hammer assigned zeroes \u201cfor tasks that [White] never had an opportunity either to learn, or to perform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">{\u00b6 39} Finally, the trial court found that the testimony of Heather Kawczk demonstrated that White possessed social, conceptual, and practical adaptive skills inconsistent with retardation. While recognizing Kawczk\u2019s possible bias, the trial court found her testimony credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">{\u00b6 40} Moreover, the trial court found, White was not perceived by those who knew him as having significant adaptive disorders. Kawczk\u2019s testimony provided \u201ccredible anecdotal evidence * * * to demonstrate a level of performance per-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>eeived by \u00a1White\u2019s] closest companion to be reasonably sophisticated, other than retarded, and fairly well mainstream. In fact, not a single anecdote has been supplied to the experts, and restated to this court by anyone, of any incongruent behavior \u2014 something bizarre, something out of the ordinary \u2014 anecdotes which demonstrate that his family and peers considered him significantly deficient in adaptive behavior skills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">2. Onset before Age 18</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 41} Finally, the trial court found that White had failed to prove that he had significant adaptive deficits before reaching age 18. No adaptive-skills test had ever been conducted on White before the 2003 SIB-R. Although Dr. Hammer opined that White would have shown deficits on such a test, the trial court found this opinion conjectural.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">D. Proceedings on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">{\u00b6 42} The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that White had failed to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Lott </em>standard by proving lack of adaptive skills. Having so held, the court of appeals declined to address the third prong, onset before age 18. <em>State v. White, </em>Summit App. No. 22591, 2005-Ohio-6990, 2005 WL 3556634, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">{\u00b6 43} White\u2019s discretionary appeal is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">III. The Merits of the Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">A. The Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">{\u00b6 44} In <em>Lott, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he procedures for postconviction relief outlined in R.C. 2953.21 et seq. provide a suitable statutory framework for reviewing\u201d an <em>Atkins </em>claim by a defendant sentenced to death before <em>Lott. </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">{\u00b6 45} Recently, in <em>State v. Gondor, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, we considered the standard for appellate review of postconviction proceedings. We held that abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard: \u201c[A] trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a postconviction petition filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 should be upheld absent an abuse of discretion; a reviewing court should not overrule the trial court\u2019s finding on a petition for postconviction relief that is supported by competent and credible evidence.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>{\u00b6 46} \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 * * * implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144, citing <em>Steiner v. Custer </em>(1940), 137 Ohio St. 448, 19 O.O. 148, 31 N.E.2d 855; see, also, <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">B. The Trial Court\u2019s Treatment of the Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 47} A capital defendant raising an <em>Atkins </em>claim \u201cbears the burden of establishing that he is mentally retarded by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b621. In <em>Lott, </em>we instructed trial courts to \u201crely on professional evaluations * * * and consider expert testimony * * * in deciding\u201d whether a capital defendant is mentally retarded. Id. at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">{\u00b6 48} In this appeal, White contends that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to find that he had established retardation by a preponderance of the evidence, despite the testimony of two expert witnesses that he is mentally retarded and the lack of any expert testimony to the contrary. For the reasons that follow, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">1. Adaptive Deficits</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">a. The Trial Court\u2019s Rejection of the SIB-R</p>\n<p id=\"ai-dedup-0\">{\u00b6 49} The expert opinions of Drs. Hammer and Fabian were based substantially on the SIB-R. Both experts considered the SIB-R to be a valid tool for measuring adaptive skills. In their testimony, Drs. Hammer and Fabian described the SIB-R as \u201cwell developed,\u201d \u201cmainstream,\u201d well standardized, useful, and reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">{\u00b6 50} Undisputed evidence at the hearing showed that the SIB-R was based on extensive empirical research. Hill testified that in deciding what skills to include on the test, the authors of the SIB-R used standard test-development procedures. The test developers interviewed a randomly selected, demographically representative group of 2,182 nonhandicapped persons. Their responses were used to determine which questions were most useful in distinguishing between persons who are mentally retarded and those who are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">{\u00b6 51} According to Hill, standard measures of reliability show that the SIB-R is a rehable test. Although an SIB-R evaluation is not completely free of subjectivity, Hill testified that the SIB-R is \u201cas objective as we could make it\u201d and \u201cone of the most objective ways to measure adaptive behavior that there is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ale\">{\u00b6 52} Nevertheless, the trial court rejected the results of the SIB-R. The trial court questioned the results in part because in scoring the test, Dr. Hammer had utilized information provided by White himself. However, Dr. Hammer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>estimated that \u201cprobably less than 10 percent\u201d of his information came from White. Moreover, he did not use information provided by White as his sole basis for scoring any of the items on the SIB-R.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 53} Furthermore, the record does not demonstrate that it is necessarily improper to use the person being evaluated as an informant on the SIB-R. Dr. Fabian, whose testimony on this issue was cited by the trial court, testified: \u201cI think that they <em>recommend </em>as a[n] SIB-R collateral [informant] individuals other than the person [being evaluated].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, Mr. Hill \u2014 a co-author of the SIB-R \u2014 testified only that \u201c[t]here\u2019s some caution in the manual\u201d about using the subject as an informant. \u201cI don\u2019t think it says you can\u2019t interview a person directly that you suspect is retarded, but it\u2019s unlikely that you would want to rely on them solely for the information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 54} More important, the trial court failed to consider why the SIB-R manual discourages using the subject as an informant. Dr. Hammer and Mr. Hill both explained that using the subject as an informant is discouraged because mentally retarded persons tend to <em>overestimate </em>their own abilities. As Mr. Hill testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cThere\u2019s some * * * research literature, that shows that if you interview a retarded person directly about themselves, that they often <em>overestimate </em>their abilities, that * * * they want to brag about the abilities they have or that they\u2019re not always a reliable respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cThere\u2019s never been any research to my knowledge cautioning people not to interview a retarded person directly because they underestimate their score.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">{\u00b6 57} Hence, the record lends no support to the trial court\u2019s apparent belief that using White as an informant for the SIB-R compromised the validity of the diagnosis of mental retardation reached by the experts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">b. The Trial Court\u2019s Reliance on Anecdotal Lay Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">{\u00b6 58} The trial court relied heavily on the testimony of White\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Heather Kawczk, in reaching its conclusion that White failed to prove significant adaptive limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">{\u00b6 59} Kawczk testified that she met White in the fall of 1992, when they attended high school together. She dated him until November 1995 and lived with White and his mother for over a year. In the fall of 1995, White and Kawczk shared an apartment for one and one-half to two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">{\u00b6 60} Kawczk testified that White was popular in school, \u201cgot along with a lot of people at school,\u201d and participated in activities with others. White and Kawczk went driving together. He took her to the homecoming dance, double-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>dating with another couple, and to a party afterward where they \u201chung out\u201d with other students. They attended high-school sporting events together.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 61} Kawczk testified that White purchased a used truck and helped her when she purchased a used car. When he drove, White obeyed traffic rules. When White decided to rent an apartment, he signed a lease and made a deposit. White also directed Kawczk to conceal from the landlord that she was living there with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 62} Kawczk testified that White had taught her to play spades, a card game, and a fast-moving card game called \u201cspeed.\u201d He also played basketball and \u201cMortal Kombat,\u201d a fast-paced video game, which he won about half the time. He could cook bacon and eggs and heat refrigerated chicken wings in the oven.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 63} Dr. Hammer was present in the courtroom during Kawczk\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Hammer testified that White\u2019s family had already told him, in the October 2003 interview, many of the facts Kawczk related in her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">{\u00b6 64} Nevertheless, after Kawczk testified, Dr. Hammer rescored the SIB-R to reflect information gleaned from her testimony. As a result, Dr. Hammer increased White\u2019s scores on five of the 259 items. This revision did not significantly improve White\u2019s overall score, which rose only two points, from 55 to 57. Hence, rescoring the test did not alter Dr. Hammer\u2019s opinion that White is mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">{\u00b6 65} According to the undisputed testimony of the expert witnesses in this case, the facts stated in Kawczk\u2019s testimony are in no way inconsistent with mild mental retardation. The mentally retarded are not necessarily devoid of all adaptive skills. Indeed, \u201cthey may look relatively normal in some areas and have certain significant limitations in other areas.\u201d Mildly retarded persons can play sports, write, hold jobs, and drive. Dr. Hammer testified that in determining whether a person is mentally retarded, one must focus on those adaptive skills the person lacks, not on those he possesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">{\u00b6 66} The trial court\u2019s analysis appears to disregard this testimony. For example, the trial court\u2019s opinion mentions twice that White was a licensed driver. However, Dr. Hammer testified that a mildly retarded individual can qualify for a driver\u2019s license and that licensed-driver status is not a good criterion for distinguishing between people who are and are not retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">{\u00b6 67} Similarly, the trial court found that White \u201cwas adept at video games, including * * <em>* </em>\u2018Mortal Kombat.\u2019 \u201d It is not clear, however, what relevance White\u2019s video-game skills have to mental retardation. Dr. Hammer testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Mortal Kombat \u201cdoesn\u2019t require a lot of planning [or] strategizing\u201d and can be played by children younger than ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">{\u00b6 68} The trial court\u2019s analysis was also misdirected in stressing that White\u2019s family and peers did not perceive White to be lacking in adaptive behavior skills. Both experts testified that laymen cannot easily recognize mild mental retardation. Likewise, the trial court erred in focusing on whether White had exhibited behavior that was \u201cbizarre\u201d or \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d There was no evidence that bizarre behavior is a necessary attribute of the mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">{\u00b6 69} Especially relevant here is Dr. Hammer\u2019s already cited observation that retarded individuals <em>\u201cmay look relatively normal in some areas </em>and have * * * significant limitations in other areas.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In light of that unrebutted testimony, the impressions of White\u2019s peers as relayed by Kawczk lend no support to the findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 70} We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that White had failed to prove the existence of significant adaptive-skills limitations. In this case, the trial court faded to set forth any rational basis grounded in the evidence for rejecting the uncontradicted testimony of two qualified expert witnesses in the field of psychology.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">{\u00b6 71} A trial court is not required to automatically accept expert opinions offered from the witness stand, whether on mental retardation or on any other subject. See <em>State v. Dickerson </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 206, 210, 543 N.E.2d 1250 (expert testimony is not necessarily conclusive); <em>Ex parte Briseno </em>(Tex.Crim. App.2004), 135 S.W.3d 1, 9 (although experts may offer insightful opinions, ultimate issue of mental retardation is for the trier of fact). Nevertheless, expert opinion \u201cmay not be <em>arbitrarily </em>ignored, and some reason must be objectively present for ignoring expert opinion testimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States v. Hall </em>(C.A.5, 1978), 583 F.2d 1288, 1294. See also <em>State v. Brown </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 133, 134-135, 5 OBR 266, 449 N.E.2d 449 (trial court erred by disregarding expert opinions that defendant was insane, in the absence of evidence to the contrary).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">{\u00b6 72} In this case, the anecdotal evidence on which the trial court focused its attention was largely irrelevant. Moreover, to the extent that the anecdotal evidence was relevant, Dr. Hammer took it into account in scoring the SIB-R. There was no evidence calling into doubt the reliability of the SIB-R.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">{\u00b6 73} Nor did the trial court make any finding that the expert witnesses before it lacked either credentials or credibility. On the contrary, the court described Dr. Hammer as \u201ca distinguished expert\u201d with \u201cimpressive\u201d credentials. And the trial court\u2019s rejection of the expert testimony was not based on any credibility determination. The trial court stated: <em>\u201cIt is not so much that Dr. Hammer\u2019s testimony lacks credibility, </em>as * * * that the ingredients for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>[SIB-R] test are patently at odds with the credible testimony of Ms. Kawczk.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">{\u00b6 74} While the trial court is the trier of fact, it may not disregard credible and uncontradicted expert testimony in favor of either the perceptions of lay witnesses or of the court\u2019s own expectations of how a mentally retarded person would behave. Doing so shows an arbitrary, unreasonable attitude toward the evidence before the court and constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">2. Onset before Age 18</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">{\u00b6 75} The trial court also determined that White had failed to prove that his adaptive-skills limitations began before age 18. Whether the trial court\u2019s determination of this issue was correct was necessarily raised by appellant\u2019s assignment of error in the court of appeals. However, it was not addressed in the appellate court\u2019s opinion. Apparently, the court of appeals believed that its review of the \u201cpre-age 18 onset\u201d issue was unnecessary because it was upholding the adaptive-skills finding of the trial court. Because we have determined that the trial court erred in making this finding, however, we must now address the \u201cpre-age 18 onset\u201d issue. In the interest of judicial economy, we will address that issue today, in order to make a complete and final resolution of this matter while the record is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">{\u00b6 76} A finding that White\u2019s adaptive-skills limitations began after age 18 would preclude a finding of mental retardation under <em>Lott. </em>However, White claims that the trial court\u2019s determination in this regard was also an abuse of discretion. Upon our review of the record, we must agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">{\u00b6 77} Although no adaptive-skills tests had ever been conducted on White before he reached the age of 18, Dr. Hammer believed that White would have attained a low score had such testing been conducted. The state introduced no evidence to the contrary. Yet the trial court found that Dr. Hammer\u2019s opinion, in the absence of any <em>actual </em>pre-18 adaptive-skills testing, was \u201cconjectural]\u201d and did not establish the existence of adaptive deficits before the age of 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">{\u00b6 78} In our view, the trial court\u2019s finding on this issue does not comport with the evidence in the record. Although White had taken neither an IQ test nor an adaptive-skills test before age 18, Drs. Hammer and Fabian were able to review White\u2019s academic records. These records strongly support the experts\u2019 conclusion that White\u2019s intellectual and adaptive deficits had their onset before age 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">{\u00b6 79} White\u2019s academic records attest to his poor performance in school. When White was in seventh grade, during the 1985-1986 school year, he failed seven of ten subjects. The next year, he repeated seventh grade and failed four of nine subjects. In eighth grade, White failed two of eight subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>{\u00b6 80} During his eighth-grade year, White took the California Achievement Test (\u201cCAT\u201d), described by Dr. Fabian as \u201can academic achievement test similar [to] or [the] same as the WRAT.\u201d White\u2019s CAT scores reflect a performance well below the eighth-grade level. CAT scores indicated that his reading abilities were at the fourth-grade level and his language abilities at the third-grade level. His best subject on the CAT was mathematics, but even there, he reached only a sixth-grade level.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">{\u00b6 81} In 1988, the 15-year-old White was placed in an alternative school, but continued to perform poorly. In ninth grade, his grade-point average was 1.625. In tenth grade, White failed six of the seven courses in which he was awarded a grade. At 17, he repeated tenth grade and failed every course in which he received a grade. At 18, he repeated tenth grade again, this time failing six of seven courses. At 19, he was placed in the tenth grade for a fourth time, but school authorities later removed him because he was too old.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">{\u00b6 82} Dr. Hammer\u2019s interviews with White\u2019s family corroborated the picture that emerges from White\u2019s records. The family told Dr. Hammer that White \u201cwas having trouble with schoolwork, that he oftentimes would not let people * * * help him, he would become easily frustrated when people would try to help him * * * with the academic things.\u201d White\u2019s childhood academic performance, as reflected in both school records and family interviews, \u201cwas basically consistent with mild mental retardation,\u201d according to Dr. Hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">{\u00b6 88} Finally, there was no evidence to suggest that White\u2019s current impairments could be explained by anything that happened after he turned 18, such as a brain injury. Dr. Hammer testified that White\u2019s records contained no evidence of any such event. Nor does anything in White\u2019s history indicate that he functioned at a higher level before age 18 than he does today.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">{\u00b6 84} As Dr. Hammer explained, the purpose of the \u201conset before age 18\u201d requirement is to distinguish true retardation from cognitive impairments acquired later in life and caused by brain injuries or mental conditions. Both expert witnesses testified that a person\u2019s mental-retardation status does not change over his lifetime. Hence, if an adult is found to have intellectual and adaptive deficits not caused by a brain injury or illness, it can be inferred that those deficits have existed since childhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">{\u00b6 85} We think that the trial court, by rejecting well-supported expert opinion regarding pre-18 onset without any evidence to the contrary, abused its discretion. The trial court gave too much weight to the fact that White\u2019s adaptive skills were never tested before age 18. As Dr. Hammer explained in his testimony, such testing will often not have taken place, particularly in cases of mild mental retardation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard S.
