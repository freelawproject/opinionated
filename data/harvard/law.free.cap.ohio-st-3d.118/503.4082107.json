On May 28, 1997, Kristopher Richardson negligently injured Edward Paterek in an automobile accident. Richardson had no personal assets or earning capacity with which to compensate Paterek for his injuries, but did carry $100,000 of auto liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 3} After the accident, Paterek and his wife, appellee Irene Paterek, retained an attorney, Jonathon Evans, of the law firm of Peterson &amp; Ibold, appellants, to represent them in a personal-injury action against Richardson. On May 11,1998, Evans filed a lawsuit against Richardson, but subsequently dismissed it on October 6, 2000, without prejudice. He then failed to refile the claim within one year of the dismissal, and the suit was dismissed for want of prosecution. Both Evans and Peterson <em>&amp; </em>Ibold admitted liability for the damages proximately caused by Evans\u2019s breach of the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">{\u00b6 4} On October 2, 2002, the Patereks filed this legal-malpractice suit. Edward Paterek died on February 2, 2003, and Irene was named executor of his estate on March 18, 2003; Irene also maintained a claim in her own right.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">{\u00b6 5} On September 17, 2003, appellants filed a motion for partial summary judgment. They argued that since the maximum recovery available to Irene from the tortfeasor was $100,000, the court should cap any damages against the appellants at that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court overruled appellants\u2019 motion on October 21, 2003, holding that the collectibility of a judgment against the underlying tortfeasor was not an element Irene would have to prove at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAlthough Plaintiffs will have to prove the \u2018case within the case\u2019, such proof does not have to go so far as to demonstrate that the tortfeasor in the underlying case was not judgment proof or, conversely stated, that the tortfeasor had assets from which a judgment could be collected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">{\u00b6 8} On May 5, 2004, Irene filed a second amended complaint, raising a claim for underinsured-motorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) coverage against One Beacon Insurance (\u201cOne Beacon\u201d). The Patereks owned a One Beacon policy with UIM coverage with limits of $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">{\u00b6 9} On November 22, 2004, Irene voluntarily dismissed One Beacon from the proceedings, without prejudice. The legal-malpractice claim against the firm and Evans proceeded to trial on December 13, 2004. The parties jointly submitted stipulations to the court. The appellants stipulated that Richardson was at fault in the underlying accident and that Edward Paterek was not comparatively negligent. The appellants also admitted that Evans missed a filing deadline, causing the Patereks to lose their cause of action. The parties stipulated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Richardson carried a $100,000 automobile liability insurance policy that would have been available to satisfy a judgment against him. The parties further stipulated that Richardson had no other assets:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cKristopher Richardson did not at the time of the accident, nor does he presently, have any personal assets or earning capacity sufficient to satisfy any judgment against him in excess of the $100,000 automobile liability coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">{\u00b6 11} The parties also stipulated that the Patereks held a valid UIM policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c[T]he Plaintiffs had underinsured motorist coverage with Beacon One [sic] in the amount of $250,000 at the time of the accident in question ($150,000 of which may be available to the plaintiffs to cover damages, if necessary, after set-off of the $100,000 available from the tortfeasor\u2019s policy).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">{\u00b6 13} Finally, the parties stipulated that \u201cthese stipulations will be entered into the record by the Court but the jury will only be told that a filing deadline was missed by Mr. Evans (and the firm) and that there is no issue of liability regarding the underlying accident. The jury will be asked to just return a verdict regarding the value of the Plaintiffs damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 14} The court thus advised the jury at the outset of the proceedings that they needed to consider only the amount of damages suffered by the Patereks.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">{\u00b6 15} At the close of the plaintiffs ease, the defense moved the court to limit the damages in the case to the amount of Richardson\u2019s insurance policy. Consistently with its summary-judgment ruling, the trial court again rejected the argument that damages should be capped at $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">{\u00b6 16} On December 15, 2004, the jury returned a verdict of $382,000 for Irene Paterek. In response to interrogatories, the jury stated that it had awarded the decedent\u2019s estate $282,000 for his medical bills, pain and suffering, and inability to perform usual activities, and $100,000 for loss of consortium to Irene.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">{\u00b6 17} On December 30, 2004, appellants filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Civ.R. 50(B). In its February 16, 2005 decision, the trial court granted that motion, holding that the Patereks\u2019 recovery was restricted to the $100,000 liability policy limits maintained by the original tortfeasor, Richardson.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">{\u00b6 18} The court based its decision on two factors. First, the court found that the jury\u2019s award was based only upon the injuries suffered by the Patereks in the automobile accident; the jury did not find any separate injuries related to the firm\u2019s breach: \u201cAlthough the instructions given to the jury permitted them to consider awarding damages beyond the amounts of Plaintiffs underlying personal injury and loss of consortium claims, the interrogatories establish that the jury chose not to do so. The jury limited its award to those sums it determined arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>from Mr. Paterek\u2019s personal injury and Mrs. Paterek\u2019s loss of consortium.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 19} Second, the court found that the Patereks had failed to submit any proof that Richardson would have been able to pay anything beyond the amount of his insurance: \u201cIt can be argued that the value of the opportunity to collect in this case was limited to the policy limits of $100,000. It is also conceivable that an expert witness could be found who would opine that statistically the value of a $382,000 judgment against a person of Mr. Richardson\u2019s age and financial status is of a particular worth. If that is so, no such expert testified in this trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 20} The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe determination that Plaintiff suffered damages in the amount of $382,000 as a result of Kristopher Richardson\u2019s negligence does not mean that Plaintiff suffered damages in that same amount as a result of the negligence of Jonathon Evans and Petersen <em>&amp; </em>Ibold. It is possible that Plaintiff could be entitled to damages from Defendants in addition to those resulting from the injuries caused by Mr. Richardson upon proper proof that additional damages existed. In the same vein, although Mr. Richardson caused injuries that were assigned a monetary value of $382,000, the damages actually caused by the negligence of these Defendants must be limited to the amount that Plaintiff could be reasonably certain of receiving had Defendant not been negligent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 22} The trial court did not address the issue of the Patereks\u2019 UIM policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 23} Irene appealed the trial court\u2019s decision, and on August 14, 2006, the Eleventh District Court of Appeals reversed the lower court\u2019s judgment and remanded for an order reinstating the jury verdict. <em>Paterek v. Petersen &amp; Ibold, </em>Geauga App. No. 2005-G-2624, 2006-Ohio-4179, 2006 WL 2337483. The appellate court held that the trial court had erred in making collectibility from Richardson an element of Irene\u2019s case:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cUnder Civ.R. 50(B) the trial court had no duty to examine the collectability of Richardson. * * * We accept that the jury limited its verdict of $382,000 to the personal injuries suffered by the Patereks, and did not enhance the award with any other damages that may have related to the malpractice committed by Evans and Petersen &amp; Ibold, but this fact by itself did not enable the trial court to step in and reduce the jury verdict due to considerations of collectability of the verdict. Its duty was to examine whether the verdict was supported by \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 not whether the verdict was collectible.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">{\u00b6 25} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 674 N.E.2d 1164, this court set forth the elements of a claim for legal malpractice:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cTo establish a cause of action for legal malpractice based on negligent representation, a plaintiff must show (1) that the attorney owed a duty or obligation to the plaintiff, (2) that there was a breach of that duty or obligation and that the attorney failed to conform to the standard required by law, and (3) that there is a causal connection between the conduct complained of and the resulting damage or loss.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 28} The only dispute in this case concerns the measure of the damages that resulted from the appellants\u2019 negligence. When an attorney commits malpractice in a civil case, the lion\u2019s share of the damages derives from the value of the lost claim. Here, Irene Paterek sought more. She attempted to introduce testimony regarding the emotional injuries she and her husband suffered as a result of the appellants\u2019 malpractice, but the court refused to allow that testimony. Irene did not appeal that ruling, and the issue is not before us. Still, \u201c[t]he vast majority of appellate decisions that have considered the issue have held that an attorney is not liable for emotional distress damages where the attorney\u2019s conduct has been merely negligent.\u201d Joseph J. Kelleher, An Attorney\u2019s Liability for the Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (1990), 58 Fordham L.Rev. 1309, 1319. This court has recognized that a plaintiff in a legal-malpractice case may seek other types of consequential damages, such as additional attorney fees incurred to correct the mistakes of the malpracticing attorney, <em>Krahn v. Kinney </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 103, 106, 538 N.E.2d 1058, but the jury below did not award any such damages. Thus, the focus of this case is the value of the lost cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 29} The dispute concerns whether the collectibility of any judgment that might have resulted from the lost claim is relevant to calculating the malpractice damages. This court has not specifically addressed this question, but the answer can be found within our holding in <em>Vahila </em>that there must be a causal connection between the conduct complained of and the resulting loss. 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 674 N.E.2d 1164, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 30} The jury in this case arrived at a figure for damages that was not necessarily reflective of the value of the Patereks\u2019 claim against their lawyers; the jury\u2019s damage award reflects what the Patereks suffered through the negligence of Richardson. But the appellant attorneys in this case are not responsible for Richardson\u2019s negligent conduct; they are responsible for their own. This case is not about what Irene Paterek suffered on account of Richardson\u2019s bad driving, but what she suffered on account of the appellants\u2019 bad lawyering. The proper inquiry, then, is this: Had the appellants not been negligent, how much could Irene have received from a settlement or a judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>{\u00b6 31} A judgment amount that is shown to be collectible provides a realistic picture of what a malpractice claimant actually lost. To find collectibility of the lost judgment irrelevant would \u201cgo beyond the usual purpose of tort law to compensate for loss sustained and would give the client a windfall opportunity to fare better as a result of the lawyer\u2019s negligence than he would have fared if the lawyer had exercised reasonable care.\u201d David A. Barry, Legal Malpractice in Massachusetts: Recent Developments (1993), 78 Mass.L.Rev. 74, 81-82. The finest attorneys in the world cannot coax blood from a stone.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe prevailing rule is that the client\u2019s recovery is limited to the amount that would have been collectible.\u201d 4 Ronald E. Mallen and Jeffrey M. Smith, Legal Malpractice (2008), Section 31:17. Indeed, among other jurisdictions, the only dispute regarding collectibility concerns which party must prove it. The majority of jurisdictions have held that the burden of proving collectibility of the lost judgment lies with the plaintiff; in those jurisdictions, the plaintiff must prove the realistic value of a judgment against the underlying defendant as an element of his or her case. <em>Lawson v. Sigfrid </em>(1927), 83 Colo. 116, 117, 262 P. 1018; <em>Whiteaker v. State </em>(Iowa 1986), 382 N.W.2d 112, 115; <em>Jernigan v. Giard </em>(1986), 398 Mass. 721, 723, 500 N.E.2d 806; <em>Christy v. Saliterman </em>(1970), 288 Minn. 144, 150, 179 N.W.2d 288; <em>Eno v. Watkins </em>(1988), 229 Neb. 855, 429 N.W.2d 371, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Rorrer v. Cooke </em>(1985), 313 N.C. 338, 361, 329 S.E.2d 355; <em>Taylor Oil Co. v. Weisensee </em>(S.D.1983), 334 N.W.2d 27, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">{\u00b6 33} A minority of jurisdictions consider lack of collectibility to be an affirmative defense to be pleaded and proven by the defendant attorneys. <em>Carbone v. Tierney </em>(2004), 151 N.H. 521, 533, 864 A.2d 308; <em>Kituskie v. Corbman </em>(1998), 552 Pa. 275, 285, 714 A.2d 1027; <em>Power Constructors, Inc. v. Taylor &amp; Hintze </em>(Alaska 1998), 960 P.2d 20, 31-32; <em>Jourdain v. Dineen </em>(Me.1987), 527 A.2d 1304, 1306. The court in <em>Kituskie </em>explains the minority view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThese courts have recognized that the plaintiff must prove a case within a case. These minority of courts, however, do not believe that it logically follows from the case within a case burden of proof that the plaintiff must also prove that the damages in the underlying case would have been collectible. Instead, these courts believe that the burden of proof in a legal malpractice action only requires the plaintiff to prove a loss of judgment on a valid claim. To require the plaintiff to also prove collectibility of damages would result in placing an unfair burden on the plaintiff where the plaintiffs legal malpractice action is often brought years after the initial accident causing his injuries solely because the defendantfiawyer failed to act in a timely and competent manner. Thus, the minority of courts believe that it is more logical and fair to treat collectibility as an affirmative defense which the defendant/attorney must plead and prove in order to avoid or mitigate the consequences of that attorney\u2019s negligent acts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>* * * Moreover, this minority has criticized the majority position because it ignores the possibility of settlement between the plaintiff and the underlying tortfeasor and also overlooks that the passage of time itself can be a militating factor either for or against collectibility of the underlying case.\u201d <em>Kituskie, </em>552 Pa. at 284-285, 714 A.2d 1027.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>Smith v. Haden </em>(D.D.C.1994), 868 F.Supp. 1, 2, the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cIn a normal civil lawsuit, * * * a plaintiff must prove each required element to make out a case against the defendant in order to obtain a judgment. It is not necessary to demonstrate that plaintiff will successfully be able to execute on the judgment or that the judgment is collectible. Normally, enforcement of the judgment remains for another day. In a legal malpractice action alleging that an attorney failed to timely file suit, a plaintiff is required only to prove the loss of a judgment on a valid claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 37} We disagree with the minority view. We hold that collectibility is logically and inextricably linked to the legal-malpractice plaintiffs damages, for which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. In proving what was lost, the plaintiff must show what would have been gained. The <em>Smith </em>court is correct that in other types of civil cases, the plaintiff is not required to prove collectibility. The malpractice plaintiff need not prove the collectibility of the attorney she is suing, but she must prove that the attorney she is suing has indeed injured her through neglecting to properly handle a lawsuit that would have generated recompense. And her injury is measured by what she actually would have collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">{\u00b6 38} Moreover, we disagree with the <em>Kituskie </em>court that the majority position ignores the possibility of settlement between the plaintiff and the underlying tortfeasor and overlooks the mitigating nature of the passage of time. To the contrary, courts need not \u2014 and should not \u2014 overlook the possibility of settlement or the passage of time in determining damages suffered by a malpractice plaintiff. However, those factors should be a part of the plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">{\u00b6 39} Given our requirement that plaintiffs in legal-malpractice cases must prove a causal connection between the attorney\u2019s malpractice and their damages, we adopt the majority view that collectibility is an element of the plaintiffs case that must be proved by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">{\u00b6 40} Thus, it was up to the Irene Paterek to prove what she lost because of the appellants\u2019 negligence. She stipulated that she would have received nothing toward a judgment from the tortfeasor himself. The stipulation stated that Richardson did not have sufficient assets to satisfy any judgment beyond his $100,000 automobile liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>{\u00b6 41} The stipulation does not speak to the future ability of Richardson to pay off a judgment. Richardson was 17 years old at the time of the accident. The trial court opined that Irene Paterek might have found an expert to testify as to the value of a judgment against a person of Richardson\u2019s age and financial status. But she offered no such evidence. Thus, the record does not show that she could have collected more than $100,000 from sources related to Richardson.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">{\u00b6 42} But in its consideration of the appellants\u2019 Civ.R. 50(B) motion, the trial court faded to take into account the value of the Patereks\u2019 UIM coverage. The parties had stipulated as to the existence of such coverage in the amount of $250,000, with $150,000 available to cover damages, if necessary, after set off of the $100,000 from the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 43} In determining the collectibility of an unrealized judgment, the factfinder should consider the amount of the plaintiffs UIM policy. <em>Sparks v. Craft </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 75 F.3d 257. The amount payable under the policy springs from the judgment against the underlying tortfeasor and that tortfeasor\u2019s collectibility. As part of the pot available to a successful plaintiff in a case properly handled by an attorney, UIM coverage is evidence of collectibility of the underlying claim in an attorney-malpractice case.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">{\u00b6 44} Appellants argue that Irene Paterek may still have a valid claim against One Beacon and that she should pursue that claim on her own. However, appellants\u2019 malpractice has tainted that claim. This court held in <em>Ferrando v. Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 186, 2002-Ohio-7217, 781 N.E.2d 927, paragraph two of the syllabus, that \u201c[w]hen an insurer\u2019s denial of underinsured motorist coverage is premised on the insured\u2019s breach of a * * * subrogationrelated provision in a policy of insurance, the insurer is relieved of the obligation to provide coverage if it is prejudiced by the failure to protect its subrogation rights. An insured\u2019s breach of such a provision is presumed prejudicial to the insurer absent evidence to the contrary.\u201d Because One Beacon could not pursue Richardson for subrogation because of appellants\u2019 negligent handling of the Patereks\u2019 case, One Beacon is presumed not to be obligated to provide coverage to Irene Paterek. To recover against One Beacon, Irene would be forced to prove that <em>appellants\u2019 </em>negligence did not prejudice One Beacon. Not only is that an unfair burden to place on a victim \u2014 rather than the perpetrator \u2014 of malpractice, it would be a burden a rational victim would be unmotivated to accept. If the victim loses his case against the UIM carrier, the loss of that coverage becomes a part of malpractice damages. The better approach, then, is to include UIM coverage as part of the plaintiffs evidence of collectibility and leave the malpracticing attorney to prove in his own subrogation claim against the UIM carrier that his negligence did not prejudice the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>{\u00b6 45} Here, the appellants stipulated to the existence of the UIM coverage and the amount that would be available to Irene Paterek from that policy. The trial court erred in failing to include the additional $150,000 available to Irene under the UIM policy in its calculation of damages. It should have entered judgment for her in the amount of $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">{\u00b6 46} Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, remand the cause to the trial court, and instruct the trial court to enter judgment in favor of the appellees in the amount of $250,000 plus applicable interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b625-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, Brogan, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b625-8\">O\u2019Connor and Cupp, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b625-9\">James A.

I also agree that Irene Paterek did not prove that she could have collected more than $100,000 from sources related to Richardson, the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">{\u00b6 48} However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision that the value of the Patereks\u2019 underinsured-motorist coverage with their own insurer should be included in the judgment against the attorneys in the malpractice case. The Patereks dismissed their claim against their underinsured-motorist coverage carrier without prejudice shortly before trial. The court of appeals did not resolve the issue of whether the value of that coverage could properly be included in the Patereks\u2019 judgment against the attorneys in the malpractice case. In fact, the appellate court stated: \u201cThe issue of whether [Irene Paterek] could collect from the Patereks\u2019 own carrier on their UM/UIM coverage <em>was not submitted to the jury, and this court declines to weigh in as to whether such proceeds would ever be received. That issue is certainly not before us in this appeal.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Paterek v. Petersen &amp; Ibold, </em>Geauga App. No. 2005-G-2624, 2006-Ohio-4179, 2006 WL 2337483, \u00b6 42. Under these circumstances, I would not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">{\u00b6 49} Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment below and remand the case to the trial court with directions to reinstate its judgment notwithstanding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>verdict in favor of Irene Paterek in the amount of $100,000.
