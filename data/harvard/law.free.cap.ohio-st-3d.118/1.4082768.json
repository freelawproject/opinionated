We adopt the board\u2019s findings that respondent violated the Code of Professional Responsibility and, over respondent\u2019s objections, accept the recommendation for an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with multiple violations of the Disciplinary Rules, including DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving fraud, deceit, dishonesty, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects upon a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), 5-101(A)(1) (prohibiting a lawyer, except with consent of a client after full disclosure, from accepting employment if the exercise of professional judgment on behalf of the client may be reasonably affected by the lawyer\u2019s financial and personal interests), 7-109(A) (prohibiting a lawyer from suppressing evidence that the lawyer has a legal obligation to reveal or produce), and 7-110(B) (prohibiting a lawyer from communicating ex parte on the merits of a case with the judge). Respondent answered relator\u2019s complaint, denying all wrongdoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>and asserting various legal defenses. A panel of the board heard the case, found the cited misconduct, and recommended a two-year suspension of respondent\u2019s license to practice. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct but modified the sanction, recommending an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\n<em>Respondent Violated DR 1-102(A)(6) and 5-101(A)(l) by Transferring His Client\u2019s Assets to Joint and Survivorship Accounts without the Client\u2019s Informed Consent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent befriended Katherine Rice, a 90-year-old nursing home resident, shortly after her admission in 1993. Rice suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease and, as early as July 1997, also showed signs of dementia or organic brain syndrome. Unmarried and childless, Rice possessed considerable wealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent began doing some legal work for Rice in 1997, when he handled a real estate closing for her and drafted a deed for the sale of a cabin. He then started helping Rice pay her bills, eventually having some mail directed to his home or office. In time, respondent also advocated on Rice\u2019s behalf, intermittently identifying himself as her legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent prepared a will that Rice executed in May 1998. The will named respondent as executor and his wife as the alternate executor. Rice made these bequests in the will: $20,000 to Rice\u2019s nephew, $2,000 to her niece, $2,500 to be divided between two acquaintances, $25,000 to be divided among three churches, $2,000 to be divided between two fraternal organizations, $1,000 to be used for the perpetual care of Rice\u2019s cemetery plot, $1,000 to an alumni association, and the remainder of the estate to be divided among specified hospitals and philanthropic organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">{\u00b6 7} In spring 1999, Rice apparently told respondent that she wanted to revise her will to leave him a monetary bequest. Respondent properly advised his client that he could not ethically prepare a will that named him as a beneficiary and that she would have to hire another attorney. Rice apparently did not want another lawyer and never revised her will. Respondent never discussed the subject of independent counsel with Rice again.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent then began transferring Rice\u2019s assets, purportedly at her direction, into joint and survivorship accounts that they shared. In the first of three conveyances, respondent arranged in June 1999 for Rice to endorse four $100,000 checks with which he obtained four certificates of deposit in both of their names. He bought one certificate at the Belmont Savings Bank, a second at Wheeling National Bank, a third at Belmont National Bank, and a fourth at WesBanco Bank. These transactions ensured that title to the certificates of deposit would pass to respondent on Rice\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>{\u00b6 9} In July 1999, Rice signed a healthcare power of attorney and a durable power of attorney. The first instrument named Rice\u2019s nephew as attorney-in-fact for healthcare decisions and respondent as first alternate attorney-in-fact. The durable power of attorney designated respondent as Rice\u2019s attorney-in-fact, conferring on him broad authority to buy and sell property, contract with financial institutions, buy and sell stocks and bonds, and transact business related to social security, pensions, IRAs, government benefits, insurance, credit cards, tax returns, and civil claims. Respondent used the durable power of attorney during Rice\u2019s lifetime to correspond with banks, creditors, and other entities about her legal affairs, and to open bank accounts, manage funds, and create and renew numerous certificates of deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent facilitated a second conveyance of Rice\u2019s assets in June 2000. He arranged at that time for Rice to sign papers transferring 28,800 shares in stock she owned individually to him and herself jointly. This transfer, valued at approximately $1,000,000, also ensured that title of the stock would pass to respondent on Rice\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">{\u00b6 11} In January 2002, Rice\u2019s treating physician recommended that Rice enter hospice care due to deteriorating health, and Rice\u2019s impaired decisionmaking capabilities prompted hospice staff to consult her healthcare fiduciary about admitting her. Respondent consented to Rice\u2019s admission to hospice care. To treat Rice\u2019s end-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease and other serious infirmities in the hospice facility, her doctor prescribed a variety of medications, including drugs for Parkinson\u2019s disease, dementia, and depression. A month after her admission to the hospice facility, respondent facilitated a third conveyance of Rice\u2019s property. He obtained a fifth certificate of deposit for $250,000 from Citizen\u2019s Bank with the proceeds from two of the previous certificates of deposit. After arranging for Rice to sign papers for the purchase, respondent placed the certificate of deposit jointly in his and Rice\u2019s name, again ensuring that title to the certificate would pass to him at Rice\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">{\u00b6 12} In advising lawyers to eschew gifts from clients, and thereby avoid suggestions of undue influence and overreaching, EC 5-5 recommends that before accepting a gift, lawyers insist that munificent clients obtain independent counsel. Respondent did not prevail upon Rice to seek another lawyer. He instead single-handedly facilitated the purchase of four $100,000 certificates of deposit and the transfer of over $1,000,000 in stock with assets previously held individually by his elderly and debilitated client and placed the assets in joint accounts that would pass to him upon her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent does not deny now that he failed to obtain his client\u2019s valid consent to these gifts, which required him to disclose attendant risks such as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tax consequences of the gifts and how the gifts might deplete her testamentary bequests. Respondent thereby violated DR 1-102(A)(6) and 5-101(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\n<em>Respondent Violated DR 1-102(A)(V) and 7-109(A) by Concealing the Estate Proceeds in His Possession after His Client\u2019s Death</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">{\u00b6 14} Rice died on December 25, 2002, at age 99. Respondent notified Rice\u2019s out-of-town niece of her death and arranged for the funeral. Though respondent had been appointed executor of Rice\u2019s estate and controlled all of Rice\u2019s primary assets by operation of the joint survivorship accounts, he took no action on behalf of her estate for over 16 months. During this time, respondent failed to (1) file Rice\u2019s will with the probate court, (2) file estate tax returns, (3) pay creditors, including the nursing and funeral homes, (4) terminate deductions for Rice\u2019s health-insurance premium from her checking account, and (5) deposit numerous interest and dividend checks as they became available.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">{\u00b6 15} In December 2003, the nursing home hired attorney Thomas Semple to collect Rice\u2019s outstanding bill of approximately $11,500. At the end of that month, Semple applied to the Belmont County Probate Court for authority to administer Rice\u2019s estate. In February 2004, Semple discussed Rice\u2019s estate and the pending administration application with respondent. Respondent advised that he had Rice\u2019s will. Respondent also reported to Semple that Rice had no living relatives, which was not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">{\u00b6 16} In March 2004, the probate court appointed Semple as administrator of Rice\u2019s estate. The day after his appointment, Semple sent respondent a letter requesting a list of Rice\u2019s assets, her will, and keys to her house. Respondent did not reply to this letter but did do something else. At the end of the month, respondent used $112,154.86 in proceeds from redeeming Rice\u2019s Belmont Savings Bank certificate of deposit to obtain a new certificate of deposit at WesBanco Bank in the name of his wife and himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">{\u00b6 17} In April 2004, Semple moved the probate court for an order requiring respondent to produce Rice\u2019s will. Semple also filed a concealment action in that court, alleging that respondent had assets belonging to Rice\u2019s estate in his possession. Respondent, in turn, moved the probate court to appoint him as executor and discharge Semple as administrator. In his application to administer the estate, respondent estimated the value of assets in Rice\u2019s estate at $190,000, an amount that he would eventually concede was at least $200,000 too low.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">{\u00b6 18} In June 2004, the probate court denied respondent\u2019s motion to discharge Semple as administrator of Rice\u2019s estate. The court also found that respondent was \u201cnot a suitable person to serve as executor\u201d because of his delay in administrating the estate and the resulting detriment to the beneficiaries. The court cited respondent\u2019s failure to properly manage assets, settle estate bills, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>respond to Semple\u2019s numerous communications requesting information and documentation. The order denying Semple\u2019s discharge and respondent\u2019s appointment was affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">{\u00b6 19} After the probate court\u2019s order, respondent continued to refuse to give Semple information concerning the Rice estate assets, ignoring Semple\u2019s further inquiries in July and August 2004. That August, respondent\u2019s wife applied for authority to administer the Rice estate and, notably, estimated the estate\u2019s value at $1,000,000. The probate court denied this application and, on its own motion, issued an order compelling respondent to produce all information and documentation pertaining to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">{\u00b6 20} In November 2004, Semple sent respondent a set of interrogatories, specifically asking him to identify all assets that he had acquired from Rice. In his response, an unsworn statement, respondent identified three of four nonpro-bate assets that he held with Rice at her death, the three for which he had not exercised survivorship rights: the $100,000 WesBanco certificate of deposit, the stock, and the $250,000 Citizens Bank certificate of deposit. He did not identify a $100,000 check made payable to Rice or him from the Belmont Savings Bank, which he received from cashing in the joint certificate of deposit that he had obtained in June 1999, and which he used in March 2004 to obtain a new certificate of deposit for his wife and himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">{\u00b6 21} In December 2004, Semple moved the probate court to enjoin respondent from accessing the nonprobate assets of the Rice estate. At a hearing on the motion in January 2005, respondent again disclosed just the three nonprobate assets previously identified. Though asked directly, respondent did not divulge in his testimony the check for the proceeds from the Belmont Savings Bank joint certificate of deposit. The probate court issued a preliminary injunction, restraining respondent as of February 1, 2005, from exercising any control over the three disclosed nonprobate assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">{\u00b6 22} Also in December 2004, Semple filed an action in the Belmont County Common Pleas Court, alleging respondent\u2019s undue influence, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and negligence in overseeing Rice\u2019s affairs. ' Respondent retained attorney Stuart G. Parsell for his defense. At a May 20, 2005 pretrial, Parsell disclosed for the first time the former $100,000 Belmont Savings Bank joint certificate of deposit. In May 2005, the probate court signed an agreed entry restraining respondent from exercising any control over the proceeds from the previously undisclosed Belmont Savings Bank joint certificate of deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">{\u00b6 23} In August 2006, Semple dismissed the common pleas suit pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement to settle the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent agreed in the settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>to return the stock, then valued at over $1.4 million, and the $250,000 Citizens Bank certificate of deposit, then valued at $276,951.41, to the Rice estate. The settlement terms allowed respondent to retain ownership of the Belmont Savings and WesBanco certificates of deposit and all interest accrued on those certificates, valued together at $222,944.75. The probate court found that the settlement agreement was in the best interest of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">{\u00b6 24} On August 20, 2006, Semple filed an amended inventory in the Rice estate that, including the over $1,600,000 in assets returned by respondent, valued the estate at $2,158,931.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">{\u00b6 25} Though asked in interrogatories to identify \u201cany and all assets\u201d that had once belonged to Rice and that presently belonged to him, respondent identified only three of the four under his control. He did not reveal the $100,000 Belmont Bank certificate of deposit that he conveyed, at a value of $112,154.86, to himself and his wife just eight months before Semple propounded the interrogatories. Several months later in probate court, respondent concealed the same evidence while testifying under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">{\u00b6 26} Respondent does not deny now that he failed to disclose evidence that he knew he had a duty to reveal. He thereby violated DR 1-102(A)(4) and 7-109(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\n<em>Respondent Violated DR 1-102(A)(5) and 1-102(A)(6) by Unduly Delaying the Performance of His Duties as Executor of His Client\u2019s Will</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">{\u00b6 27} Respondent delayed admitting the Rice estate to probate for 16 months. He did not deposit numerous dividend and interest checks accruing from the stock and certificates of deposit during that time, depriving the estate and beneficiaries of the use of and interest on these funds. He then impeded the probate process by ignoring the court-appointed administrator\u2019s efforts to open the estate, necessitating a legal action to obtain Rice\u2019s will and identify concealed assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">{\u00b6 28} Respondent\u2019s failure to turn over estate assets and pay creditors also led to the common pleas action, which in turn led to the recovery of assets held by respondent. By forcing Semple to sue, respondent substantially damaged his former client\u2019s estate by depleting the assets intended for residual beneficiaries. As a significant example, the contingent legal fee charged to obtain the disclosed and concealed assets cost the estate approximately $560,000 and reduced the residual estate by that amount. Respondent\u2019s delay also harmed beneficiaries and creditors of the estate simply by generating frustration and inconvenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">{\u00b6 29} Respondent does not now deny that he unduly delayed in performing his duties as executor of the Rice estate. He thereby violated DR 1-102(A)(5) and 1-102(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\n<em>Respondent Violated DR 7-110(B) by Engaging in Prohibited Ex Parte Communications with the Probate Judge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">{\u00b6 30} In mid-May 2004, Belmont County Probate Judge J. Mark Costine conducted a hearing on Semple\u2019s allegations of concealment. Shortly afterward, respondent spoke with Judge Costine as the judge was leaving the courthouse and asked the judge for his thoughts on the case. Respondent advised Judge Costine that he had been Rice\u2019s attorney and knew her personal affairs. Respondent also said that he hoped the judge would exercise his discretion to decide in respondent\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">{\u00b6 31} Respondent does not deny now that he spoke to Judge Costine about the merits of a pending adversarial proceeding without notice to opposing counsel and without legal justification. He thereby violated DR 7~110(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">{\u00b6 32} The board recommended that we indefinitely suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice, citing the scope of respondent\u2019s calculated misconduct and the actual harm suffered. Respondent objects and urges us to accept the panel\u2019s recommendation for a two-year suspension, arguing that neither self-dealing nor egregious injury exists in this case. We disagree and overrule the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">{\u00b6 33} In determining the appropriate sanction to impose for attorney misconduct, we consider the duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the sanctions imposed in similar cases, and the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Ake, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 266, 2006-Ohio-5704, 855 N.E.2d 1206, \u00b6 44. We weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors to determine whether circumstances warrant a more lenient or a more exacting disposition. See Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). Because each disciplinary case involves unique facts and circumstances, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(A), we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule and may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining which sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">A. Duties Violated, Mental State, and Injury Caused</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">{\u00b6 34} Respondent violated his duty to his client by (1) failing to insist that she obtain independent counsel, (2) facilitating transfers of her assets to himself by himself, and (3) saying virtually nothing of the ramifications to her estate. Respondent violated duties to the public and the judicial system by his undue delay in administering the Rice estate, concealment of estate assets in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>possession, and ex parte-communication with Judge Costine. Respondent accepts the findings that he breached these duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">{\u00b6 35} In his defense, however, respondent underscores that he was \u201clike family\u201d to Rice and genuinely believed that, given their long, close friendship and discussions about her affairs, the transfers to joint and survivorship accounts fulfilled her ambitions for her fortune. Though Rice experienced some intermittent diminished mental capacity, respondent also insists that she continued to function with purpose and decisiveness during her last years and, as a result, conveyed unblemished title when she signed all the papers necessary to complete the transfers. Respondent thus claims that he did not exercise undue influence or engage in overreaching, the evils that DR 5 \u2014 101(A)(1) exists to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cElements of undue influence include \u2018a susceptible testator, another\u2019s opportunity to exert it, the fact of improper influence exerted or attempted, and the result showing the effect of such influence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krischbaum v. Dillon </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 58, 65-66, 567 N.E.2d 1291, quoting <em>West v. Henry </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 498, 501, 20 O.O.2d 119, 184 N.E.2d 200. Because all these elements are present when a lawyer receives a testamentary gift from a client unrelated by blood or marriage through a will that the lawyer prepared, a presumption of undue influence arises. Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. The presumption, as well as the prohibition against a lawyer\u2019s receiving such gifts through a will or trust in DR 5-101(A)(2), serves to protect the high level of trust and confidence that the attorney-client relationship demands in fulfilling a client\u2019s testamentary wishes:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA chent\u2019s dependence upon, and trust in, his attorney\u2019s skill, disinterested advice, and ethical conduct exceeds the trust and confidence found in most fiduciary relationships. Seldom is the client\u2019s dependence upon, and trust in, his attorney greater than when, contemplating his own mortality, he seeks the attorney\u2019s advice, guidance, and drafting skill in the preparation of a will to dispose of his estate after death. These consultations are often among the most private to take place between an attorney and his client. The client is dealing with his innermost thoughts and feelings, which he may not wish to share with his spouse, children and other next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cBecause the decisions that go into the preparation of a will are so inherently private, and because, by definition, the testator will not be available after his death, when the will is offered for probate, to correct any errors that the attorney may have made, whether they are negligent errors or of a more sinister kind, a client is unusually dependent upon his attorney\u2019s professional advice and skill when he consults the attorney to have a will drawn. The client will have no opportunity to protect himself from the attorney\u2019s negligent or infamous misconduct.\u201d <em>Krischbaum, </em>58 Ohio St.3d at 62-63, 567 N.E.2d 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>{\u00b6 39} As the board observed, considerations underlying a presumption of undue influence equally apply to situations in which lawyers obtain an interest in client assets by preparing other instruments that transfer the interest in anticipation of the chent\u2019s death. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Galinas </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 87, 666 N.E.2d 1083, we suspended a lawyer from practice because he had prepared a will for an unrelated client that named the lawyer as a beneficiary and had also transferred client assets to himself through joint and survivorship accounts. Though we focused in that case mainly on the impropriety of giving such gifts through testamentary devise rather than through inter vivos transfers, we referred to the presumption of undue influence because the clients in both situations are contemplating their own mortality and thus are peculiarly susceptible to the influence of their counsel, citing <em>Krischbaum, </em>58 Ohio St.3d at 62-63, 567 N.E.2d 1291. Accord <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Kelleher, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 105, 2004-Ohio-1802, 807 N.E.2d 310 (lawyer violated DR 5-101(A)(2) by drafting an inter vivos trust for an unrelated client that provided for distributions to the lawyer\u2019s family when the client died).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">{\u00b6 40} Nursing staff corroborated that Rice and respondent had a longstanding relationship and that, for the most part, Rice remained strong-willed and lucid throughout. Strength of will and lucidity, however, are not characteristics on which we can rely to conclude that this 96-year-old nursing home patient with multiple debilitating infirmities, including signs of dementia or organic brain syndrome, was impervious to respondent\u2019s influence. To the contrary, with these obvious indicators of vulnerability, we doubt that Rice directed respondent\u2019s efforts, without any encouragement, to circumvent the numerous bequests to friends, family, and philanthropic groups that she had made in a will executed just one year before the transfer of assets to joint and survivorship accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 41} We share the board\u2019s skepticism and suspect that respondent used the joint and survivorship accounts to accomplish what he knew he could not ethically do through a will. He then did not insist upon independent counsel because the interference could derail the transfer of Rice\u2019s considerable assets to him. Moreover, we infer from respondent\u2019s delay in administering the Rice estate that he fully realized the threat that admitting the estate to probate might expose undue influence and overreaching. We thus do not accept respondent\u2019s assertion that his misconduct was a mere technical violation of DR 5-101(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">{\u00b6 42} Respondent also urges us to weigh in his favor that he regrets having failed to disclose the proceeds from the $100,000 Belmont Savings Bank certificate of deposit, that he did so unintentionally, and that he afterward rectified the mistake by accounting for and preserving the assets in which Rice had an interest when she died. The harm respondent avoided with his disclosure, however, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>little to offset the rest of the damage done in this case. The cost of respondent\u2019s misconduct to the Rice estate, its beneficiaries, and creditors is indefensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">B. Sanctions Imposed in Similar Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">{\u00b6 43} <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. Theofilos </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 43, 521 N.E.2d 797, signaled this court\u2019s growing impatience with lawyers profiting from client gifts given in anticipation of a client\u2019s demise. For preparing the offending will and joint and survivorship accounts from which he and his son received over $200,000, we suspended the lawyer in <em>Theofilos </em>from practice for one year. The lawyer in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Galinas </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 87, 666 N.E.2d 1083, took nearly $955,000 under the offending will and joint and survivorship accounts. Because he also attempted to collect $150,000 in excessive attorney fees for administering his client\u2019s uncomplicated estate, we suspended him indefinitely from the practice of law. Id. at 92, 666 N.E.2d 1083. We imposed this sanction, which requires the suspended lawyer to petition for reinstatement in and fulfill the standards in Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B), to ensure the public\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 44} As relator argues, the scope of respondent\u2019s misconduct is much like that in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Slavens </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 162, 586 N.E.2d 92, in which a lawyer wrote a will for a client suffering from senility and organic brain syndrome, devising 35 percent of the client\u2019s $1,500,000 estate to himself and naming his children as beneficiaries. With a power of attorney, the lawyer further gave himself \u201cgifts\u201d of over $160,000 without disclosing the transfers to the client\u2019s accountant or filing any gift tax returns. After the client\u2019s death, the lawyer lied about the existence of predecessor wills and, when asked about the assets of the estate, did not disclose the inter vivos transfers. 63 Ohio St.3d at 163, 586 N.E.2d 92. For his violations of DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(1) and (6) and 5-101(A), we ordered an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">{\u00b6 45} Respondent cites cases similar to <em>Slavens </em>in which we have imposed sanctions less stringent than indefinite suspension. In <em>Kelleher, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 105, 2004-Ohio-1802, 807 N.E.2d 310, for example, we suspended a lawyer from practice for one year, staying the last six months on conditions, because he drafted an inter vivos trust for an unrelated client and named the lawyer\u2019s spouse, children, and grandchildren as beneficiaries. In <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Cook, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 225, 2002-Ohio-5787, 778 N.E.2d 40, another lawyer received a one-year suspension with a conditional stay of the last six months because she prepared a will for an unrelated testator that named her siblings\u2019 corporation as a beneficiary. In <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, a lawyer failed to fully disclose to his clients his financial interest in the investment recommendations he made while acting as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>their lawyer and as their financial planner and received a six-month suspension from practice, all stayed on conditions. And in <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Clark </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 145, 642 N.E.2d 611, we found a violation of DR 5-101(A) and suspended the lawyer for two years, staying the last year on conditions, because he both gave and loaned his client\u2019s money to himself and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">{\u00b6 46} None of these cases, however, involved a lawyer who realized the impropriety of giving himself gifts of a client\u2019s property through one form of conveyance and then turned to another form to accomplish the same result. This self-dealing recalls the \u201ccosi/benefit analysis\u201d conducted by the lawyer in <em>Gali-nas, </em>who, when he chose to prepare the will in question, weighed the risks of violating DR 1-102(A)(6) and \u201cthe possibilities of being caught for the disciplinary infraction (and the range of possible sanctions) against the economic benefits to be derived\u201d from the misconduct. 76 Ohio St.3d at 91, 666 N.E.2d 1083. We imposed the indefinite suspension in that case, in part to send a strong message that we will not tolerate such machinations from the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">C. Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 47} Having found that an indefinite suspension of respondent\u2019s license is justified under the preceding tests, we examine the mitigating and aggravating factors to further tailor our disposition. Respondent has no prior disciplinary record and cooperated professionally in the disciplinary proceedings, which are mitigating factors under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (d). He has also presented persuasive testimonials as to his character and reputation apart from the events at bar. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">{\u00b6 48} These factors are outweighed, however, by the aggravating circumstances that respondent compromised his vulnerable client and her named beneficiaries to benefit his own financial interests and that he did so in a series of wrongful acts. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (d), and (h). Moreover, though the board found mitigating that respondent had resolved the underlying dispute to the satisfaction of the estate administrator and the probate court, we cannot ignore that respondent profited from his wrongdoing. Therefore, although we do not order restitution, we find the fact of respondent\u2019s windfall to be an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">{\u00b6 49} For violations of DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 5-101(A)(l), 7-109(A), and 7-110(B), we hereby indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b125-11\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Jonathan E.

Parsell; and Terry K. Sherman, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<judges id=\"b126-4\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent and would permanently disbar the respondent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\">.

However, I would additionally require him to disgorge the proceeds that he was permitted to retain in the settlement with Thomas Semple in the Belmont County Common Pleas Court and return those funds to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">{\u00b6 51} The majority acknowledges that respondent profited from his wrongdoing, yet it does not order restitution. As I stated in my dissenting opinion in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Galinas </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 87, 92, 666 N.E.2d 1083, I do not believe that a respondent should be permitted to \u201ckeep the fruits of his unethical conduct, particularly when he knowingly engaged in such unethical conduct.\u201d The settlement in this case was a windfall to the respondent. However, the settlement is not binding upon this court in a disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">{\u00b6 52} Because I do not believe that the respondent should be permitted to profit from his unethical behavior, I would require him to return to the estate all the funds he unethically obtained.</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
