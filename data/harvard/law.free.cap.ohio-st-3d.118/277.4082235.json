The term \u201cinsured\u201d is defined as including \u201c[a]ny other person occupying your covered auto who is not a named insured or insured family member for uninsured motorists coverage under another policy.\u201d We hold that this definition of \u201cinsured\u201d is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Case History</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">{\u00b6 2} This case arises out of a claim for uninsured/underinsured motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage for personal injuries resulting from an automobile accident. Appellee James Slattery and Linda Wohl were struck by a vehicle driven by Tyler Swinney. When the accident occurred, Slattery was driving Wohl\u2019s car, in which she was a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">{\u00b6 3} All parties involved were insured. Swinney was insured by Progressive Insurance Company, with a policy limit of $500,000 in liability coverage. Wohl had insurance with appellant Motorists Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cMotorists\u201d), with UM limits of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident. Slattery had automobile insurance through appellee American States Insurance Company, with UM limits of $12,500 per person and $25,000 per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">{\u00b6 4} Progressive, the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer, offered its policy limit of $500,000 to settle Wohl\u2019s and Slattery\u2019s claims. Wohl and Slattery agreed to allocate Progressive\u2019s payment so that Wohl received $499,999 and Slattery received $1. Because he received only $1 of the settlement, Slattery also instituted a claim against Motorists, the company insuring Wohl\u2019s vehicle, for UM coverage. Motorists denied Slattery\u2019s claim, arguing that he was not considered \u201can insured\u201d for UM coverage under Wohl\u2019s Motorists policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Motorists, American States, and Slattery filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted American States\u2019 and Slattery\u2019s motions, ruling that R.C. 3937.18 as amended by 2001 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 97, effective October 31, 2001, required Motorists to cover Slattery as an insured for UM coverage under Wohl\u2019s policy. Motorists appealed, and the Twelfth District Court of Appeals affirmed. The court of appeals did not rely on the trial court\u2019s reasoning, but instead held that for the purposes of UM coverage, the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d in Motorists policy was ambiguous and should be strictly construed against the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 6} The Twelfth District granted Motorists\u2019 motion to certify a conflict with the Eighth District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Illinois v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 86124, 2006-Ohio-2063, 2006 WL 1109770. The question certified is \u201cWhether the definition of \u2018insured\u2019 as \u2018any other person occupying your covered auto who is not a named insured or insured family member for uninsured motorist\u2019s coverage under another policy\u2019 is ambiguous and should be construed against the insurer to provide coverage for a permissive operator of a covered vehicle who is not a named insured or insured family member.\u201d We recognized the conflict but declined to accept jurisdiction over Motorists\u2019 separate appeal of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 7} At issue in this case is the UM endorsement included as part of Motorists\u2019 insurance policy, which, like the one in <em>Safeco, </em>defines \u201cinsured\u201d for the purposes of UM coverage to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c1. You or any family member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c2. Any other person occupying your covered auto who is not a named insured or an insured family member for uninsured motorists coverage under another policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">(\u00b6 10} The Twelfth District held that this definition was ambiguous, being reasonably subject to two different interpretations. The court stated that it was unclear what the phrase \u201cfor uninsured motorists coverage under another policy\u201d referred to. Relying in part on the dissent in <em>Safeco, </em>the court of appeals determined that this phrase could modify \u201can insured family member\u201d or \u201ca named insured.\u201d The court of appeals held: \u201c \u2018It is quite clear that the qualifying prepositional phrase at the end of the policy sentence above modifies what immediately precedes it. It is not clear, however, that the qualifying tail reaches over and modifies what is on the other side of the \u201cor.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Wohl v. Swinney, </em>12th District No. CA2006-05-123, 2007-Ohio-592, 2007 WL 438255, at \u00b6 20, quoting <em>Safeco </em>at \u00b6 31 (Karpinski, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Unlike the dissent upon which the Twelfth District relied, the majority in <em>Safeco </em>did not discover any ambiguity in the definition of insured in Motorists\u2019 UM endorsement. The <em>Safeco </em>majority had held that the interpretation advanced by the dissent was \u201cnot a reasonable construction of the contract and appears contrary to the intention of the parties.\u201d 2006-Ohio-2063, at \u00b6 19. The Eighth District therefore rejected any suggestion that the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d was ambiguous and held that phrase \u201cfor uninsured motorists coverage under another policy\u201d applied <em>both </em>to \u201can insured family member\u201d and \u201ca named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 12} Slattery and American States, appellees, urge us to adopt the reasoning of the Twelfth District and the dissent in <em>Safeco </em>and hold that the definition of insured found in Motorists\u2019 UM endorsement is ambiguous. Their argument rests in part on the \u201clast-antecedent rule.\u201d This rule of construction states, \u201c \u2018[RJeferential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent * * <em>Indep. Ins. Agents of Ohio v. Fabe </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 310, 314, 587 N.E.2d 814, quoting <em>Carter v. Youngstown </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 203, 209, 32 O.O. 184, 65 N.E.2d 63. Appellees contend that the phrase \u201cfor uninsured motorists coverage under another policy\u201d must be interpreted to modify only \u201can insured family member\u201d and not any other portion of the definition of an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 13} However, in relying on the last-antecedent rule, appellees overlook the fact that the rule applies only when no contrary intention otherwise appears. Thus, if there is contrary evidence that demonstrates that a qualifying phrase was intended to apply to more than the term immediately preceding it, we will not apply the last-antecedent rule so as to contravene that intent. Before applying the last-antecedent rule, we must therefore examine the contract as a whole to determine whether any contrary intent appears. See <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis </em>(2003), 100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, \u00b6 11 (\u201cWhen confronted with an issue of contractual interpretation, the role of a court is to give effect to the intent of the parties to the agreement. We examine the insurance contract as a whole and presume that the intent of the parties is reflected in the language used in the policy.\u201d [Citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 14} When the Motorists policy in this case is viewed as a whole, it becomes clear that the intention of the parties was to narrowly define \u201cinsured\u201d for UM coverage. The term \u201cinsured\u201d is defined three separate times in the Motorist policy: it is defined in the contested UM section; it is also defined in the policy\u2019s liability and medical payment sections. In both the liability and medical payment sections, the term \u201cinsured\u201d is given a broad meaning. In the liability section, \u201cinsured\u201d is defined to include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c1. You or any family member * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201c2. Any person using your covered auto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 17} The definition in the medical payment section is similar and states that \u201cinsured\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c1. You or any family member</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c2. Any other person while occupying your covered auto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 21} These two broad definitions stand in contrast to the more limited definition of \u201cinsured\u201d found in the UM section. The UM section is the only one that further restricts the category of persons occupying or using a covered auto. Interpreting the UM definition as appellees would have us do renders the language difference virtually meaningless. If the phrase \u201cfor uninsured motorists coverage under another policy\u201d does not apply to \u201ca named insured,\u201d then the definition would not substantially differ from the definitions in the policy sections covering liability and medical payments, which define \u201cinsured\u201d as including any other person either using or occupying a covered auto. Such an interpretation would also render superfluous the words \u201cwho is not a named insured,\u201d since the term \u201cother\u201d already indicates that this portion of the definition applies to someone else rather than the named insured or a family member.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 22} When interpreting a contract, we will presume that words are used for a specific purpose and will avoid interpretations that render portions meaningless or unnecessary. See <em>State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6 50, quoting <em>Farmers\u2019 Natl. Bank v. Delaware Ins. Co. </em>(1911), 83 Ohio St. 309, 94 N.E. 834, paragraph six of the syllabus. Appellees\u2019 interpretation would render meaningless portions of the contract and require an internally inconsistent interpretation. We decline to hold that the language is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">{\u00b6 23} When the insurance policy at issue here is viewed as a whole, it becomes clear that the definition of insured in the UM portion of the policy is intended to narrowly define who is considered an insured under that section. Because we find the definition of insured under the UM endorsement to be clear and unambiguous, we need not rely on the last-antecedent rule to aid in our interpretation. To rely on the rule would only confuse the issue by creating ambiguity where none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">{\u00b6 24} We therefore reverse the decision of the court of appeals and hold that the phrase \u201cfor uninsured motorists coverage under another policy\u201d is unambiguous and applies to \u201ca named insured\u201d as well as \u201can insured family member.\u201d As someone else who was occupying the covered auto but who was a named insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>for uninsured motorist coverage under another policy (his own), Slattery was not an insured for UM coverage under Wohl\u2019s Motorists policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b395-6\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b395-7\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b395-8\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AurZ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 25} The majority opinion ignores the boldface terms in the policy language at issue. Those boldface words have specific definitions within the policy. The policy\u2019s definition of \u201cfamily member\u201d turns the majority\u2019s interpretation of the policy on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 26} The policy language at issue includes as an \u201cinsured\u201d for underinsured motorist coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c1. You or any family member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c2. Any other person occupying your covered auto who is not a named insured or an insured family member for uninsured motorists coverage under another policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cFamily member,\u201d as a boldface term, has a specific definition for use within the policy. That definition reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u2018Family member\u2019 means a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household. This includes a ward or foster child who is a resident of your household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">{\u00b6 31} Pursuant to the majority\u2019s interpretation of the policy, Slattery would be insured under Wohl\u2019s policy as long as another UM policy did not include him as a named insured or as an insured family member. But that interpretation does not hold up under the definitional portion of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">{\u00b6 32} By definition, a \u201cfamily member\u201d is a member of <em>Wohl\u2019s </em>family. Thus, only <em>Wohl\u2019s </em>family members who are insured for UM coverage under another policy are excluded from UM coverage under Wohl\u2019s Motorists policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">{\u00b6 33} So, the provision effectively defines \u201cinsured\u201d as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-18\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cAny other person occupying your covered auto who is not a named insured or an insured member of the Wohl family for uninsured motorists coverage under another policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-19\">{\u00b6 35} Given the specificity of the definition of \u201cfamily member,\u201d the last-antecedent rule becomes even more powerful in this case. The last-antecedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>rule states that \u201c \u2018referential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Indep. Ins. Agents of Ohio v. Fabe </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 310, 314, 587 N.E.2d 814, quoting <em>Carter v. Youngstown </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 203, 209, 32 O.O. 184, 65 N.E.2d 63. A corollary to that rule is that \u201cthe presence of a comma before the qualifying phrase is evidence the qualifier is intended to apply to all antecedents instead of only the immediately preceding one.\u201d <em>In re Sehome Park Care Ctr., Inc. </em>(1995), 127 Wash.2d 774, 781-782, 903 P.2d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 36} The qualifying phrase at issue here is \u201cfor uninsured motorists coverage under another policy.\u201d The majority would have it modify not just \u201cfamily member,\u201d the last antecedent, but also \u201cnamed insured.\u201d First, there is no comma before the phrase \u201cfor uninsured motorists coverage under another policy\u201d to indicate that it applies to both \u201cnamed insured\u201d and \u201cfamily member.\u201d Second, the majority assumes that \u201cnamed insured\u201d and \u201cfamily member\u201d are of the same generalizing character. They are not. \u201cFamily member\u201d is a personalized, definitive set of people, members of the Wohl family, already recognized in other parts of the policy; \u201cnamed insured,\u201d under the majority\u2019s interpretation, covers a limitless number of unknown potential occupants of the vehicle. This is not an instance of like things being covered by the same qualifying phrase. The majority\u2019s interpretation of \u201cnamed insured\u201d and the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cfamily member\u201d are of dissimilar character. Thus, the sentence, in context, yields no reason not to apply the last-antecedent rule. There is no grammatical or logical reason to believe that \u201cfor uninsured motorists coverage under another policy\u201d modifies both \u201cnamed insured\u201d and \u201cfamily member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 37} We can also look to the rest of the policy for context. Elsewhere in the policy, the term \u201cfamily member\u201d operates as a limiter of coverage. For UM coverage, for instance, \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d does not include any vehicle owned or operated by a family member. Thus, an insured cannot recover under UM coverage if the accident involves an uninsured automobile driven by a family member. Motorists sees the familial relationship as a reason to draw distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 38} Also, the majority\u2019s interpretation leaves the holder of the policy without knowledge of who actually is covered by UM coverage when riding in the policy holder\u2019s vehicle. The extent of a passenger\u2019s UM coverage under the passenger\u2019s own policy is unknown to Motorists\u2019 insured. However, a Motorists insured <em>is </em>aware of any other coverage a member of his own family might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 39} Finally, the rest of the policy establishes that passengers are insured for liability coverage and for medical payment. The policy clearly indicates a breadth of coverage beyond the vehicle\u2019s owner, and the UM coverage does not clearly veer from that breadth of coverage.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AnX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>James J.

Slattery fits under neither exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">{\u00b6 41} Since Wohl and her family members are already included under the first paragraph defining an insured for purposes of UM coverage as \u201c[y]ou or any family member,\u201d the limiting language of the second paragraph is without practical effect. But there is no other way to interpret the policy without ignoring the contract term \u201cfamily member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 42} Our language has rules, and our courts have rules to interpret language. Motorists urges us to forget those rules and to remember their own first rule of insurance contract interpretation: coverage denied. The majority accepts that rule and applies it here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
