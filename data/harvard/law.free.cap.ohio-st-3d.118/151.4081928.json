Pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2743, a civil claim against the state that requests only equitable relief may be heard in the courts of common pleas, whereas all other civil claims against the state fall within the exclusive, original jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. R.C. 2743.03(A)(1) and (A)(2). We hold that the present claim against the state is not an equitable claim of restitution and that the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas therefore lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the action. We reverse the judgment of the Eighth District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b265-17\">{\u00b62} Appellee Pietro Cristino applied for and was granted permanent total disability benefits from appellant Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cbureau\u201d). The grant of permanent total disability benefits entitled Cristino to receive periodic payments until his death. R.C. 4123.58(A). He agreed to relinquish his right to the periodic payments in exchange for a lump-sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>payment from the bureau, which described the lump-sum payment as the \u201cpresent value\u201d of his permanent total disability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">{\u00b6 3} Following Cristino\u2019s settlement with the bureau, he filed a class-action lawsuit against the bureau and the state of Ohio in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County. Cristino alleged that the bureau had improperly calculated the present value of his permanent total disability claim. He also alleged that he had accepted the settlement without knowing that the bureau had used an improper calculation. Cristino requested several forms of relief, including the following: \u201cUnder principles of law and equity, Cristino and [the class members] are entitled to full restitution of the difference between the amounts represented by the Administrator to be the \u2018actual present value\u2019 of their PTD claims and the true \u2018actual present value\u2019 * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 4} The bureau and the state filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that the claim for restitution was a request for monetary relief and that the Court of Claims therefore had exclusive jurisdiction. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, and the Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Cristino v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81619, 2003-Ohio-766, 2003 WL 361283.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">{\u00b6 5} This court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the matter to the trial court on the authority of <em>Santos v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 74, 2004-Ohio-28, 801 N.E.2d 441. <em>Cristino v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 97, 2004-Ohio-201, 802 N.E.2d 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">{\u00b6 6} On remand, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss filed by the bureau and the state and granted Cristino\u2019s motion for class certification. The court of appeals affirmed. <em>Cristino v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 87567, 2006-Ohio-5921, 2006 WL 3234022. We accepted the discretionary appeal by the bureau and the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">{\u00b6 7} It is well established that restitution can be either a legal or an equitable remedy. <em>Santos, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 74, 2004-Ohio-28, 801 N.E.2d 441, at \u00b6 11. In order to determine whether a claim for restitution requests legal or equitable relief, we look to the basis for the plaintiffs claim and the nature of the underlying remedies sought. Id. at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson </em>(2002), 534 U.S. 204, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635, the Supreme Court noted that historically, the distinction between legal and equitable claims for restitution depended on whether the plaintiff could assert \u201ctitle or right to possession\u201d in particular funds or other property. Id. at 213, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635. In particular, the court found that historically, a legal restitution claim was a claim in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>plaintiff \u201c \u2018could not assert title or right to possession of particular property, but in which nevertheless he might be able to show just grounds for recovering money to pay for some benefit the defendant had received from him.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis deleted.) Id., quoting 1 Dobbs, Law of Remedies (2d Ed.1993) 571, Section 4.2(1). By contrast, an equitable restitution claim was one in which \u201cmoney or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant\u2019s possession.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">{\u00b6 9} The Supreme Court in <em>Great-West </em>recognized a distinction between a claim <em>for </em>hinds due under a contract and a claim for funds to which a party is statutorily entitled. In particular, the court noted that \u201c \u2018[a] claim for money due and owing under a contract is \u201cquintessentially an action at law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 534 U.S. at 210, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635, quoting <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Wells </em>(C.A.7, 2000), 213 F.3d 398, 401, quoting <em>Hudson View II Assoc. v. Gooden </em>(1996), 222 A.D.2d 163, 168, 644 N.Y.S.2d 512. The court held that the plaintiffs in <em>Great-West </em>sought to impose personal contractual liability on the opposing party and thus sought \u201cthe classic form of <em>legal </em>relief.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 214 and 210, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">{\u00b6 10} The court distinguished its decision in <em>Great-West </em>from <em>Bowen v. Massachusetts </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 879, 108 S.Ct. 2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749, in part on the basis of the distinction between statutory and contractual entitlement to past due funds. The court, which had allowed the plaintiffs claim for specific relief in <em>Boiuen, </em>held that the case was inapplicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in <em>Great-West: \u201cBowen, </em>unlike petitioners\u2019 claim, did not deal with specific performance of a <em>contractual </em>obligation to pay past due sums. Rather, [the plaintiff in <em>Bowen </em>] claimed * * * that the Federal Government failed to reimburse it for past expenses pursuant to a statutory obligation * * *.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 212, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635. We find the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of legal and equitable restitution in <em>Great-West </em>applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 11} This court has also distinguished between statutory and contractual entitlement to past-due funds. In <em>Ohio Hosp. Assn. v. Ohio Dept. of Human Servs. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 97, 579 N.E.2d 695, we held that a Medicaid provider with a statutory right to Medicaid reimbursement could bring an equitable claim for Medicaid funds that had been withheld pursuant to an invalid administrative rule. We distinguished the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for reimbursement from their related claims for contract damages: \u201cThe [plaintiffs\u2019] claims for violation of the provider agreements and an earlier settlement agreement are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to the extent that the [plaintiffs] allege that their contractual rights have been violated and seek monetary relief.\u201d Id. at 104, 579 N.E.2d 695. The rule applied in <em>Ohio Hosp. Assn, </em>is clear: A claim against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>state for money due under a contract is a not a claim of equitable restitution and must be brought in the Ohio Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 12} In the present case, Cristino\u2019s own argument reveals that the basis for his action is his agreement with the bureau: \u201cThe crux of the instant Complaint is that the Bureau <em>agreed </em>to provide hundreds of recipients of permanent total disability (PTD) benefits with a lump sum payment of the \u2018present value\u2019 of their claims.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the exact nature of the agreement is disputed, it is clear that Cristino seeks to enforce this agreement and provide class members with the \u201cactual present value\u201d of their claims. His recovery depends upon the interpretation of the term \u201cpresent value\u201d in his agreement with the bureau. Cristino thus claims entitlement to the funds pursuant to his agreement with the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 13} Cristino\u2019s argument that the present action is a claim to enforce his right to periodic permanent total disability benefits under R.C. 4123.58(A) is not well taken. By its terms, R.C. 4123.58(A) provides that an employee who is declared permanently and totally disabled will receive \u201can award to continue until the employee\u2019s death.\u201d Cristino describes the statute as one that entitles him and the class plaintiffs to \u201ccontinued PTD payments for the remainder of their lifetimes.\u201d In the present claim, Cristino is requesting a lump-sum payment in lieu of the payments provided in the statutory formula. There is no statutory right to a lump-sum payment. See R.C. 4123.64(A) (the administrator \u201cmay\u201d commute payments to a lump sum). The difference between the form of relief requested by Cristino and the form of the benefits described in R.C. 4123.58(A) indicates that the present claim does not seek to enforce any statutory right to permanent total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">(\u00b6 14} In Cristino\u2019s brief, after he describes his and the class members\u2019 \u201cstatutory entitlement to continued PTD payments for the remainder of their lifetimes,\u201d he admits that he and the class members relinquished these statutory rights: \u201cEach of [the plaintiffs] elected to relinquish these rights to the Bureau in exchange for what was supposed to be a single lump sum payment of the \u2018actual present value.\u2019 \u201d Cristino\u2019s restitution claim does not challenge the validity of his agreement with the Bureau; he does not seek a reinstatement of the benefits accorded to him by statute. On the contrary, Cristino requested the amount he believed was proper under the agreement. His claim for restitution is therefore not a claim to enforce his statutory right.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 15} Cristino argues that our decision in <em>Santos </em>provides support for his argument that his current action requests equitable restitution. In particular, Cristino cites the following language from Santos: \u201cA suit that seeks the return of specific funds wrongfully collected or held by the state is brought in equity. Thus, a court of common pleas may properly exercise jurisdiction over the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>as provided in R.C. 2743.03(A)(2).\u201d <em>Santos, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 74, 2004-Ohio-28, 801 N.E.2d 441, at syllabus. Our decision in <em>Santos </em>is inapplicable here. In <em>Santos, </em>the class of plaintiffs at issue \u201csought return of funds already, collected by the BWC under the subrogation statute.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 7. The plaintiffs thus sought the return of funds that had once been in their possession and so belonged to them \u201cin good conscience.\u201d <em>Great-West, </em>534 U.S. at 213, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635. See <em>Johnson v. Trumbull Corr. Inst., </em>Ct. of Cl. No. 2004-08375-AD, 2005-Ohio-1241, 2005 WL 638698. Although we remanded this matter to the trial court on the authority of <em>Santos, </em>upon further review, it is clear that <em>Santos </em>is factually distinguishable from the present matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 16} As described above, a claim against the state for money due under a contract is a not a claim of equitable restitution and must be brought in the Ohio Court of Claims. Cristino claims entitlement to the \u201cactual present value\u201d of his permanent total disability claim pursuant to his agreement with the Bureau. We hold that his claim for restitution is not an equitable claim of restitution and that the court of common pleas therefore lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 17} The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b269-9\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b269-10\">Pfeifer, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b269-11\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AD-\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">{\u00b6 18} I concur in the majority opinion. I write separately to emphasize that the issue involved in this case should be resolved outside the legal system. If the allegations against the bureau, that it used a 30 percent reduction and outdated mortality tables to calculate lump-sum payments for Cristino and other members of the class, are true, the bureau should stop contesting this case. It should properly calculate the lump-sum payments for the members of the class and make additional payments as required. Despite some high-profile misadventures investing in rare coins and other unusual assets, the bureau\u2019s balance sheet is sufficiently strong to enable it to pay Ohio\u2019s most seriously injured workers the full present value of their permanent total disability benefits.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AxM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Bashein <em>&amp; </em>Bashein Co., L.P.A., and W.
