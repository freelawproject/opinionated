Ross sustained a lumbar sprain on January 21, 2002. She missed minimal time from work, and treatment was brief. Nine days after her injury occurred, Ross reported that her pain was \u201c98% better\u201d and that she did not need further physical therapy or analgesics. There is no indication that she had any further treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">{\u00b6 2} In mid 2004, Ross applied to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation for a PPD award. She did not, however, submit any medical evidence in support of her application. The bureau had her examined by Dr. Lawrence A. Kale, who thought that Ross\u2019s condition had completely resolved and left her with no permanent impairment. The bureau, relying on Dr. Kale, found no impairment and made no award. Ross objected, and the matter was set for hearing before a district hearing officer of appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio. Ross again submitted no medical evidence, and the district hearing officer accordingly found no impairment. Ross apparently did not move for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">{\u00b6 3} Five months later, Ross moved for an increase in permanent partial disability. This time, she submitted the report of Dr. Brian W. Marshall. His report confirmed that Ross had had no treatment since that rendered in the first few days after the injury. He did not refer to any recent exacerbation of the injury or any increase in alleged symptoms since Dr. Kale examined her. Dr. Marshall concluded that she had an eight percent impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">{\u00b6 4} Dr. Waleed Mansour reviewed the medical file at the bureau\u2019s request. Based on the findings of Dr. Marshall, Dr. Mansour assessed a five percent permanent partial impairment. The bureau made a five percent award based on that report.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Ross again objected and submitted a second report from Dr. Marshall. Having the same date as his previous report, the report was a verbatim copy of the earlier one with one exception \u2014 his assessment of impairment was now 11 percent instead of eight percent. No reason was given for the increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">{\u00b6 6} A district hearing officer assessed five percent impairment based on Dr. Mansour\u2019s findings. Ross\u2019s former employer moved for reconsideration. A staff hearing officer vacated the award and found a zero percent impairment:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe Injured Worker previously filed a C-92 Application for Determination of Percentage of Permanent Partial Disability * * * and said Application was ruled upon by the Administrative Order of 10/14/2004. Based upon the 9/10/2004 medical examination by Lawrence A. Kale, M.D., the Administrator * * * found that there was <em>no </em>Percentage of a Permanent Partial Disability resulting from the allowed [condition], * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThen, on 5/23/2005, the Injured Worker filed a C-92-A Application for a subsequent determination (increase) of Percentage of Permanent Partial Disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cHowever, under Ohio Revised Code Section 4123.57(B), the Injured Worker bears the burden of proving that there are \u2018new and changed circumstances\u2019 which have developed since the time of the hearing on the last determination of Percentage of Permanent Partial Disability, in order to obtain an increase in the Permanent Partial Disability award.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe Injured Worker was previously examined, on 9/10/2004, by Edmund Wymyslo, M.D. Dr. Wymyslo reviewed the Injured Worker\u2019s medical records and noted that, \u2018At the time of last treatment on 1/30/2002, she was found to be \u201c98% better.\u201d \u2019 He also made note of the fact that, although she had been scheduled for physical therapy, she told the physical therapist that she was better and did not need physical therapy and was no longer taking pain medications. After further review of her medical records and the performance of a physical examination, Dr. Wymyslo stated his professional medical opinion that, \u2018The claimant\u2019s current complaints are, more probably than not, not related to the soft tissue injury resulting from the 2002 claim.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIt is the finding of this Staff Hearing Officer that the Injured Worker failed to meet her burden of proving \u2018new and changed circumstances\u2019 since the time of the prior hearing on the original C-92 Application * * *. Two reports have been submitted by the Injured Worker, both from Brian W. Marshall, D.O., one indicating an 8% and the other indicating an 11% Percentage of Permanent Partial Disability. However, both of those exams are word-for-word identical, <em>except </em>for the percentage stated. Therefore, this Staff Hearing Officer does <em>not </em>find the opinion of Dr. Marshall to be persuasive, in light of the prior well-reasoned opinion of Edmund Wymyslo, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIt is the further finding of this Staff Hearing Officer that the Injured Worker does <em>not </em>have <em>any </em>Permanent Partial Disability resulting from the residual of the allowed sprain * * (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 14} Ross\u2019s complaint for a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County was unsuccessful. The court upheld the commission\u2019s conclusion that no new and changed circumstances supported an increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 15} Ross now appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 4123.57(A) requires that an application for an increase in PPD be \u201csupported by substantial evidence of new and changed circumstances developing since the time of the hearing on the original or last determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">{\u00b6 17} Contrary to Ross\u2019s representation, the mere submission of new evidence is not automatically a new and changed circumstance. <em>State ex rel. Keith v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 139, 141-142, 580 N.E.2d 433; <em>State ex rel. Poneris v. Indus. Comm., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 264, 2006-Ohio-5702, 855 N.E.2d 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">{\u00b6 18} The only medical evidence before the commission on Ross\u2019s first application for PPD indicated that her condition had resolved. She thus was required to demonstrate, in her second application, that something had changed \u2014 e.g., an exacerbation of her condition or the allowance of a new condition. Ross did not do this. She simply submitted the reports of a doctor who disagreed with Dr. Kale\u2019s opinion. Dr. Marshall\u2019s reports do not indicate that Ross suffered a flare-up or even underwent renewed treatment, and Ross herself makes no such allegation. There is nothing to indicate that Ross\u2019s medical status is any different than it was eight months earlier when Kale saw her. Marshall simply thinks she has an impairment. The reports do no more than reflect disagreement between two examiners. They do not show a new and changed circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">{\u00b6 19} Ross assails any reliance to Kale\u2019s report, accusing the commission of reviving a stale report to deny her compensation. That is not what the commission did. Sometimes new and changed circumstances cannot be determined without knowing what the old circumstances were. That is why the commission necessarily referred to Kale\u2019s earlier report.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">{\u00b620} Ross cites Dr. Mansour\u2019s report as evidence of new and changed circumstances, but her reliance is misplaced. Mansour\u2019s evaluation was based not on an examination of Ross but on a review of Dr. Marshall\u2019s first report. Because Dr. Marshall listed no new and changed circumstances, Dr. Mansour was precluded from reaching a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">{\u00b6 21} Finally, Ross criticizes the staff hearing officer\u2019s repeated reference to a report from Dr. Edmund Wymyslo. All parties agree that no such report exists, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>but contrary to Ross\u2019s argument, this reference is not fatal. Information discussed in the order was taken verbatim from Dr. Kale\u2019s report. The hearing officer referred to him repeatedly by the wrong name, but there is no doubt to whom, and to which report, the staff hearing officer was referring.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4b\">Bevan &amp; Associates, L.P.A., Inc., Cindy Kobal, and Thomas W.
