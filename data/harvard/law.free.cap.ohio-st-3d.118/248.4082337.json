No. 267, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 11,380, and because the modification occurred after October 31, 2001, the effective date of 2001 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 97,149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 779, we hold that modification of UM coverage was a change permitted by law. Further, we find that the terms of the automobile insurance policy at issue were in fact modified within that period of time, and we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">{\u00b6 3} This action arises from an automobile accident on September 28, 2002. Valijean D. Advent died as a result of injuries sustained in the accident. Her husband, Jack Advent, is the executor of her estate. Mr. and Mrs. Advent were the named insureds on an automobile insurance policy issued by Allstate Insurance Company. The liability limits on the policy were $300,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence. The UM coverage limits were $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. The policy was originally purchased on March 12, 1989. The policy remained in effect throughout the two-year guarantee period of March 12, 2001, to March 12, 2003. Within the two-year guarantee periods, the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>was renewed every six months, including the six-month period of September 12, 2002, to March 12, 2003, which is the policy period when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">{\u00b6 4} As the executor, Advent settled the estate\u2019s claims against the tortfeasor and his automobile insurance company for the bodily-injury liability limit under the tortfeasor\u2019s policy, which was $100,000. In settling the claim, Advent reserved the right to pursue UM coverage under his own Allstate policy. Advent made a claim for $200,000 from Allstate on the theory that by operation of law, the amount of UM coverage was equivalent to his policy\u2019s liability limits of $300,000, subject to an offset of the $100,000 recovered from the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. Advent, as executor, filed his complaint against Allstate to recover that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court awarded summary judgment to Allstate. It determined that because of recent legislative enactments, Advent was not entitled to UM coverage in an amount equivalent to the Allstate policy\u2019s liability limits. The appellate court affirmed. <em>Advent v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>169 Ohio App.3d 318, 2006-Ohio-5522, 862 N.E.2d 871. We accepted Advent\u2019s discretionary appeal and certified a conflict. <em>Advent v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 1490, 2007-Ohio-724, 862 N.E.2d 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 6} The certified-eonflict question raised in this appeal is: \u201cCan the S.B. No. 97 amendments to R.C. 3937.18 be incorporated into an insurance policy during a two-year guarantee period that commenced subsequent to the S.B. No. 267 amendments to R.C. 3937.18 and R.C. 3937.31, but prior to the S.B. No. 97 amendments?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The propositions of law accepted under discretionary jurisdiction are essentially restatements of the certified-conflict question, which addresses the question of which version of R.C. 3937.18 applies in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">{\u00b6 7} By statute, all automobile insurance policies must be \u201cissued for a period of not less than two years or guaranteed renewable for successive policy periods totaling not less than two years.\u201d R.C. 3937.31(A). Recognizing that the laws pertaining to the provisions contained in automobile insurance policies change frequently, we previously interpreted R.C. 3937.31 to mean that insurers are permitted to incorporate statutory changes into an insurance policy only when a two-year guarantee period begins. <em>Wolfe v. Wolfe </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 246, 250-251, 725 N.E.2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>{\u00b6 8} After <em>Wolfe, </em>the General Assembly enacted S.B. 267, effective September 21, 2000, expressly permitting insurers to change policies at the beginning of any policy-renewal period <em>within </em>a two-year guarantee period. See R.C. 3937.31(E) (\u201cNothing in this section prohibits an insurer from incorporating into a policy any changes that are permitted or required by this section or other sections of the Revised Code at the beginning of any policy period within the two-year period set forth in division (A) of this section\u201d). Subsequently, we explored the ramifications of S.B. 267 on <em>Wolfe, </em>as applicable to R.C. 3937.31, in <em>Shay v. Shay, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 172, 2007-Ohio-1384, 863 N.E.2d 591. In <em>Shay, </em>we concluded that the provisions of S.B. 267 were permissive, and we left <em>Wolfe </em>intact. Id. at \u00b6 1. Therefore, we did not require an insurer to amend policy terms to incorporate recent legislative changes at a policy-renewal period within the two-year guarantee period. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">(\u00b6 9} Left unchanged by S.B. 267, however, was the general statutory requirement for insurers to offer UM coverage in an amount equal to the liability limits of the policy. See former R.C. 3937.18(A), 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 11,380 (effective September 21, 2000). An insurer\u2019s failure to offer UM coverage within a policy resulted in UM coverage arising by operation of law in an amount equal to the policy\u2019s liability limits. <em>Gyori v. Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, Inc. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 565, 567, 669 N.E.2d 824. UM coverage arose by operation of law if the insurer was unable to demonstrate that it had made a written offer of UM coverage and that its insured had (1) selected in writing UM coverage in a lesser amount or (2) expressly refused UM coverage in writing. Id.; <em>Mason v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am., </em>Stark App. No. 2003 CA 00029, 2003-Ohio-7047, 2003 WL 23009004, \u00b6 11, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 10} Thereafter, the UM coverage laws were further amended by S.B. 97, effective October 31, 2001. S.B. 97 rewrote R.C. 3937.18, with the express intention of superseding the holdings of this court in \u201ccases previously superseded by * * * S.B. 267\u201d and, among other named cases, <em>Gyori, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 565, 669 N.E.2d 824. Section 3(D) and (E), S.B. 97, 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 789-790. In addition to eliminating \u201cany requirement of a written offer, selection, or rejection form,\u201d this amendment was also intended to \u201c[eliminate the possibility of uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages being implied as a matter of law in any insurance policy.\u201d Id. at 788, Section 3(B)(4) and (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The cumulative effect of the General Assembly\u2019s amendments to R.C. 3937.18 in S.B. 267 and S.B. 97 leads us to conclude that insurers may incorporate any changes permitted or required by the Revised Code at the beginning of any policy-renewal period on or after October 31, 2001 (the effective date of S.B. 97) within the policy\u2019s two-year guarantee period that began on or after September 21, 2000 (the effective date of S.B. 267).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 12} Moreover, modification of the UM coverage terms of an automobile insurance policy is a change permitted or required by the Revised Code, after October 31, 2001 (the effective date of S.B. 97), at the beginning of any policy-renewal period within the two-year guarantee period that began after September 21, 2000 (the effective date of S.B. 267).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 13} In light of the foregoing, we resolve the certified-eonflict question in the affirmative and reject the two propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">{\u00b6 14} The policy that the Advents purchased from Allstate had a two-year guarantee period from March 12, 2001, through March 11, 2003. It is not disputed that the UM statute applicable to the Advent policy reflected the changes enacted by S.B. 267, effective September 21, 2000. As a result, if the insured consented, Allstate could incorporate changes permitted or required by the Revised Code into the existing policy at the beginning of any policy-renewal period within the two-year guarantee period. See R.C. 3937.31(E); <em>Shay, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 172, 2007-Ohio-1384, 863 N.E.2d 591, at \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">{\u00b6 15} Advent contends that notwithstanding the amendment by S.B. 267, UM coverage still arose by operation of law in the amount of the liability limits of the policy if a proper offer and selection or rejection of UM coverage in -writing could not be demonstrated by the insurer. Advent\u2019s argument, however, overlooks the application of S.B. 97, effective October 31, 2001. The provisions of S.B. 97, which include the rewriting of portions of R.C. 3937.18, are \u201cchanges that are permitted or required\u201d by the Revised Code to be incorporated into existing policies, by virtue of S.B. 267, at any renewal, including any renewal period within the two-year guarantee period if the insurer and insured agree to do so. R.C. 3937.31(E); <em>Shay, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 172, 2007-Ohio-1384, 863 N.E.2d 591, at \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">{\u00b6 16} At the renewal of the six-month policy period immediately prior to the six-month policy period during which the accident occurred (the policy-renewal period of March 12, 2002, to September 12, 2002), Allstate included an \u201cImportant Notice\u201d with its \u201cRenewal Auto Policy Declarations\u201d information indicating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the method of selecting UM coverage had changed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The same notice, under the heading of \u201cImportant Information and Coverage Information,\u201d stated, \u201cThe coverage limits you have chosen for Uninsured Motorists Insurance for Bodily Injury are less than your limits for Bodily Injury under Automobile Liability Insurance.\u201d The Advents were advised to contact their agent or Allstate if they wished to increase their UM limits. The Advents neither objected to this change nor acted to modify the UM limits specifically listed on the policy declarations page. Rather, the insurance coverage with Allstate was maintained at the stated policy amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">{\u00b6 17} When the Advents renewed their policy for the final six-month policy period of the two-year guarantee period, the Renewal Auto Policy Declarations again informed the Advents that their chosen UM limits were less than their liability limits and advised them to contact their agent or Allstate if they wished to increase their UM limits. Again, the Advents maintained their insurance coverage with Allstate at the stated policy amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 18} Admittedly, the notification of these changes in the Advents\u2019 policies contained minimal explanation. However, we believe that the notices contained sufficient information to put the Advents on notice that the provisions regarding UM coverage in the policy had changed, that the UM coverage was as stated on the policy declarations page, and that action on their part was necessary to modify the stated UM limits. By failing to take any action to modify the stated UM coverage limits, the Advents consented to the changes in their policy and to the express coverage limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">{\u00b6 19} In summary, S.B. 267 permits but does not require insurers to incorporate into automobile insurance policies changes permitted or required by the Revised Code during any policy-renewal period within the two-year guarantee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>period. S.B. 97 repealed the requirement to offer UM coverage and eliminated any requirement to prove offers, selections, or rejections in writing. The consequence of these two statutory changes is that the possibility of UM coverage \u201cbeing implied as a matter of law in any insurance policy\u201d is eliminated. Section 3(B)(2), S.B. 97,149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">{\u00b6 20} Further, Allstate\u2019s automobile insurance policy with the Advents was renewed every six months within their two-year guarantee period; the provisions of S.B. 97 governing UM coverage were incorporated into the Advent policy during one of the renewal periods prior to the accident; and the coverage available to the Advents at the time of the accident is determined by that policy with the incorporated terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 21} Because the UM coverage limits in effect on the date of the accident were $50,000 per person and $100,000 per occurrence, and not $300,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b367-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b367-8\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\">.

I would hold that a unilateral reduction in underinsured-motorist coverage constituted a cancellation of the policy within the two-year guarantee period, which is forbidden by R.C. 3937.31(A). Moreover, the notice given by Allstate in this case was deficient; it in no way informed the Advents that their UM coverage dropped from $300,000/$500,000 to $50,000/$100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">{\u00b6 23} At the time the two-year policy period started on March 12, 2001, the Advents were insured for UM coverage up to their $300,000/$500,000 liability limits by operation of law. There is no evidence in the record that the Advents refused UM coverage up to the amount of their liability limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">{\u00b6 24} For the six-month renewal period starting on September 12, 2002, Allstate purported to reduce the amount of the Advents\u2019 coverage. A reduction in coverage constitutes a cancellation pursuant to R.C. 3937.31(A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-13\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cWhere renewal is mandatory, \u2018cancellation,\u2019 as used in sections 3937.30 to 3937.39 of the Revised Code, includes refusal to renew a policy with at least the coverages, included insureds, and policy limits provided at the end of the next preceding policy period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Allstate did not renew the coverage with the same policy limits that had been in effect at the end of the preceding policy period. It therefore canceled the policy. An insurer may cancel a policy only under certain circumstances set forth in R.C 3937.31(A), including misrepresentation, loss of driving privileges, and nonpayment of the premium. None of those circumstances existed in this case. R.C. 3937.31(E) allows an insurer to incorporate into a policy \u201cany changes that' are permitted or required by this section or other sections of the Revised Code at the beginning of any policy period within the two-year period set forth in division (A) of this section.\u201d Cancellation, as defined by R.C. 3937.31(A), is not permitted or required by that statutory section.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>Shay v. Shay, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 172, 2007-Ohio-1384, 863 N.E.2d 591, this court held that statutory changes inuring to the benefit of the insured do not immediately take effect at the six-month renewal periods within the two-year guaranteed period. In <em>Shay, </em>this court held that a statute invalidating the exclusion of a named insured\u2019s vehicle from the definition of an uninsured motor vehicle was not incorporated into the policy at the six-month renewal. Instead, this court held that the changes brought about by statute were permissive, requiring an agreement between the parties for incorporation into the policy. This court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cWe thus hold that absent an agreement between the insurer and the insured to amend the policy terms at the six-month renewal point, R.C. 3937.31(A) and our decision in <em>Wolfe v. Wolfe </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 246, 725 N.E.2d 261, prevent an insurance company from amending the terms of its policy to increase the amount of coverage it provides, at the six-month point of renewal.\u201d <em>Shay, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 172, 2007-Ohio-1384, 863 N.E.2d 591, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 29} The majority seems to forget the <em>Shay </em>requirement of \u201can agreement between the insurer and the insured to amend the policy terms.\u201d From the <em>Shay </em>holding, one would conclude that an endorsement would be required to effectuate a change. But the majority determines that the Advents, by failing to take action to modify the stated UM coverage limits, consented to the changes in their policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">{\u00b6 30} This conclusion is based upon the \u201cImportant Notice\u201d Allstate sent to the Advents and its notification to the Advents at the renewal period that their UM limits were lower than their liability limits. The \u201cImportant Notice\u201d reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cWe\u2019d like to let you know that we\u2019ve changed the process for selecting and making changes to Uninsured Motorists Insurance for Bodily Injury and Uninsured Motorists Insurance \u2014 Property Damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cEffective immediately, you can add or remove Uninsured Motorists Insurance for Bodily Injury and Uninsured Motorists Insurance \u2014 Property Damage and increase or decrease your limits under Uninsured Motorists Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>for Bodily Injury by simply calling your Allstate representative.

It does not mention that Allstate is incorporating into the policy a recent legislative enactment. It does not notify the Advents of <em>changes </em>in the amount of their UM coverage. Instead, the \u201cImportant Notice\u201d reads more like the announcement of Allstate\u2019s self-created new system for easing the process for changing UM coverage. The notice does not state that any reduction in coverage amounts has occurred or will occur. The notice does not set forth what the law was before the passage of 2001 Am.Sub. S.B. No. 97 or how that enactment has shifted the law. There is no alerting of the insured that there has been any change in the policy itself. There is no notice that although the declarations page continues to state the UM coverage as $50,000/$100,000, the true value of that coverage has decreased from limits that had been $300,000/$500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 36} The same can be said of the notices included with the renewals that told the Advents that their UM limits were less than their liability limits. Those notices do not indicate any <em>change </em>in the amount of coverage available. None of Allstate\u2019s notices could have indicated to the Advents that they were agreeing to any changes in their policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">{\u00b6 37} For all of the above reasons, the law in effect at the beginning of the two-year guarantee period was in effect at the time of the accident. By operation of law under former R.C. 3937.18(A), the Advents\u2019 UM coverage limits matched those of their liability coverage.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQ_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Mark Segreti Jr.; and Paul W.
