Kim argues that Columbus City Code 2327.14 is unconstitutionally vague. We disagree and affirm the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">{\u00b6 2} Kim\u2019s neighbor, Joseph Berardi, testified that on May 13, 2004, Kim\u2019s dog barked constantly from approximately 4:30 p.m. until approximately 6:00 p.m. Berardi stated that the dog barked so loudly that it could be heard over the sound of his lawn mower and from inside his house with the windows closed and the air conditioning running. Dr. George H. Urham Jr., a veterinarian, testified that on May 13, 2004, he made a house call at the Berardi residence to vaccinate Berardi\u2019s dogs and that from just before 5:00 p.m., when he arrived, until just before 6:00 p.m., when he departed, the dog in Kim\u2019s yard had barked incessantly-</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">{\u00b6 3} Kim was charged with violating Columbus City Code 2327.14 by harboring an unreasonably loud or disturbing animal. The trial court concluded that the duration and intensity of the dog\u2019s barking were sufficient to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>violation of Columbus City Code 2327.14 and convicted Kim and imposed a f\u00edne of $100 plus costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">{\u00b6 4} Kim appealed, alleging that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague. The court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court, concluding that Columbus City Code 2327.14 contained sufficient standards to place a person of ordinary intelligence on notice of what conduct the ordinance prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">{\u00b6 5} The court of appeals found its judgment in this case to be in conflict with the judgment of the Eleventh District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Ferraiolo </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 585, 748 N.E.2d 584, and certified the record to this court for review and final determination. We determined that a conflict exists on the following issue: \u201cWhether an ordinance that prohibits a person from keeping or harboring an animal which \u2018howls, barks, or emits audible sounds that are unreasonably loud or disturbing which are of such character, intensity, and duration as to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood or to be detrimental to the life and health of any individual\u2019 is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied.\u201d <em>Columbus v. Kim, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 1464, 2007-Ohio-1722, 864 N.E.2d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">{\u00b6 6} Columbus City Code 2327.14(A) states that \u201c[n]o person shall keep or harbor any animal which howls, barks, or emits audible sounds that are unreasonably loud or disturbing and which are of such character, intensity and duration as to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood or to be detrimental to life. and health of any individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">{\u00b6 7} Kim asserts that Columbus City Code 2327.14 is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied. In <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 168, 171, 566 N.E.2d 1224, quoting <em>Coates v. Cincinnati </em>(1971), 402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214, we stated that \u201c[i]n order to prove such an assertion, the challenging party must show that the statute is vague \u2018not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all.\u2019 \u201d In other words, the challenger \u201cmust show that upon examining the statute, an individual of ordinary intelligence would not understand what he is required to do\u201d and \u201cmust prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statute was so unclear that he could not reasonably understand that it prohibited the acts in which he engaged.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 171, 566 N.E.2d 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">{\u00b6 8} Kim asks us to adopt the reasoning of <em>Ferraiolo, </em>140 Ohio App.3d 585, 748 N.E.2d 584, in which the owner\u2019s conviction for violating an ordinance virtually identical to Columbus City Code 2327.14 was reversed by the court of appeals because it concluded that the ordinance was impermissibly vague. The court of appeals stated that \u201call dogs will bark or emit audible sounds at one time or another\u201d and that the reasonableness of the noise is a subjective matter that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>could vary from person to person given their different sensitivities. Id. at 587, 748 N.E.2d 584. The court of appeals questioned how anyone can be expected to know whether his dog\u2019s barks are of such an intensity and duration as to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood and concluded that the ordinance offered no standard that could be used to determine what constituted a violation. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">{\u00b6 9} But <em>Ferraiolo </em>is not before us, and it does not control our decision. We conclude that Columbus City Code 2327.14 is not unconstitutionally vague, because it sets forth sufficient standards to place a person of ordinary intelligence on notice of what conduct the ordinance prohibits. The ordinance incorporates an objective standard by prohibiting only those noises that are \u201cunreasonably loud or disturbing.\u201d The ordinance provides specific factors to be considered to gauge the level of the disturbance, namely, the \u201ccharacter, intensity and duration\u201d of the disturbance. Further, we recognize that \u201cthere are limitations in the English language with respect to being both specific and manageably brief, and it seems to us that although the prohibitions may not satisfy those intent on finding fault at any cost, they are set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with.\u201d <em>United States Civ. Serv. Comm. v. Natl. Assn. of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 548, 578-579, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 37 L.Ed.2d 796. We conclude that Kim has not proven that Columbus City Code 2327.14 provides \u201cno standard of conduct * * * at all.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 171, 566 N.E.2d 1224. Accordingly, we hold that Columbus City Code 2327.14 is not unconstitutionally vague on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">{\u00b6 10} Nothing in the record suggests that the constant barking of Kim\u2019s dog for over one hour was not \u201cunreasonably loud or disturbing\u201d or not \u201cof such a character, intensity and duration as to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood.\u201d We are convinced that a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that Columbus City Code 2327.14 prohibits her from allowing her dog to bark nonstop for over an hour at a level that can be heard while using a lawnmower. Kim had not proven, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt, that the statute [is] so unclear that [she] could not reasonably understand that it prohibited the acts in which [she] engaged.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 171, 566 N.E.2d 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">{\u00b6 11} Accordingly, we conclude that Columbus City Code 2327.14 is not unconstitutionally vague as applied. We answer the certified question in the negative and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b209-11\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Alt\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">{\u00b6 12} Pursuant to our constitutional authority, this court accepted the certified conflict between appellate jurisdictions on the following question: \u201cWhether an ordinance that prohibits a person from keeping or harboring an animal which \u2018howls, barks, or emits audible sounds that are unreasonably loud or disturbing which are of such character, intensity, and duration as to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood or to be detrimental to the life and health of any individual\u2019 is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">{\u00b6 13} The Tenth District Court of Appeals rejected the argument endorsed by Kim that Columbus City Code 2327.14(A) is unconstitutionally vague. It held that the ordinance withstood constitutional scrutiny because it gives \u201ca person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that contemplated conduct is forbidden by the ordinance.\u201d <em>Columbus v. Kim, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1334, 2006-Ohio-6985, 2006 WL 3825260, \u00b6 10. Relying on precedent, it upheld the ordinance after determining that it contains \u201cidentifiable standards defining the geographical application of the ordinance (the neighborhood where the noise occurs), an objective standard of prohibited conduct (unreasonably loud or disturbing noises), and * * * factors to measure the level of disturbance.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">{\u00b6 14} The Tenth District, on motion by Kim, certified its decision as being in conflict with the Eleventh District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>State v. Ferraiolo </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 585, 748 N.E.2d 584. In <em>Ferraiolo, </em>the court struck down a nearly identical Howland Township resolution after holding that it was unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">{\u00b6 15} We accepted the certified conflict to resolve these diverging opinions. 113 Ohio St.3d 1464, 2007-Ohio-1722, 864 N.E.2d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">{\u00b6 16} The issue in this case is whether Columbus City Code 2327.14(A) sufficiently defines the prohibited conduct so as to withstand a vagueness challenge. Kim argues that the term \u201cunreasonable\u201d \u201cdoes not provide enough explanation to allow the average person to know what behavior is permissible.\u201d She also contends that the ordinance contains an improper subjective standard, which also renders it vague. The city of Columbus maintains that the ordinance incorporates an objective standard and is therefore not arbitrary or vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">{\u00b6 17} Columbus City Code 2327.14(A) provides, \u201cNo person shall keep or harbor any animal which howls, barks, or emits audible sounds that are unreasonably loud or disturbing and which are of such character, intensity and duration as to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood or to be detrimental to life and health of any individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">{\u00b6 18} First, this enactment, like all others, enjoys a presumption of constitutionality. <em>N. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Parma </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>375, 377, 15 O.O.3d 450, 402 N.E.2d 519. Moreover, this court must apply all rules of statutory construction in favor of constitutionality if possible. <em>State v. Sinito </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 98, 101, 72 O.O.2d 54, 330 N.E.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">{\u00b6 19} The court faced a similar question in <em>State v. Dorso </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 60, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449, a ease involving a Cincinnati noise ordinance. Cincinnati Municipal Code 910-9 prohibits any person from engaging \u201cin the playing or rendition of music * * * in such manner as to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, having due regard for the proximity of places of residence, hospitals or other residential institutions and to any other conditions affected by such noises.\u201d The city charged Michael Dorso, manager of a local roller rink, with violating the ordinance. Dorso moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the ordinance was impermissibly vague, but the trial court denied his motion and convicted him. The appellate court reversed, holding the ordinance unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">{\u00b6 20} On discretionary review, this court reversed the court of appeals\u2019 decision and held the ordinance constitutional. We construed the ordinance to prohibit those noises \u201cwhich could be anticipated to offend <em>the reasonable person, i.e., </em>the individual of common sensibilities.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 64, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449. The ordinance, therefore, did not regulate conduct that \u201cdisturbs only the hypersensitive.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">{\u00b6 21} The same reasoning applies in this instance with respect to Columbus City Code 2327.14(A). The allegedly vague terms \u201cunreasonably loud or disturbing,\u201d \u201cdisturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood,\u201d and \u201cdetrimental to life and health of any individual\u201d are cured of any ambiguity if the court applies a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard, as in <em>Dorso. </em>The phrases are imprecise, to be sure, but the Constitution \u201cdoes not mandate a burdensome specificity,\u201d and noise regulation \u201cby necessity involves the reasonable circumscription of the rights of individuals for the greater benefit of the commonwealth.\u201d Id. at 62 and 64, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">{\u00b6 22} The Eleventh District, faced with an identical ordinance, reached the opposite conclusion in <em>Ferraiolo. </em>Its reasoning began with a rhetorical question: \u2018Who is to say what constitutes an \u2018unreasonably loud\u2019 sound?\u201d <em>Ferraiolo, </em>140 Ohio App.3d at 587, 748 N.E.2d 584. In its analysis, the court stated, \u201cEveryone has different sensitivities. Reasonableness is a subjective term that offers virtually no guidance to the dog owner who must comply with this legislation.\u201d Id. The final sentence in this quote illustrates that decision\u2019s shortcomings.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">{\u00b6 23} Despite the Eleventh District\u2019s assertion, reasonableness is an <em>objective </em>standard. Be it tort law or criminal law, the reasonable-person standard is considered an objective standard. 2 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 13, Section 283, Comment c; Baldwin\u2019s Ohio Practice Criminal Law (2007), Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>19.2. Thus, this ordinance should be read so as to prohibit barking and other animal noises that would offend the person of normal sensibilities.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AEc\">Richard C. Pfeiffer Jr., Columbus City Attorney, Lara N. Baker, City Prosecutor, and Matthew A. Kanai, Deputy Legal Counsel, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Acy\">Mark J. Miller, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">{\u00b6 24} I concur in the affirmance of the Tenth District\u2019s decision. The court employed a correct standard in upholding the constitutionality of the ordinance. The Eleventh District\u2019s decision is simply wrong; reasonableness is an objective standard.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
