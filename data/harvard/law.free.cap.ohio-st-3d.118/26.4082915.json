Shugars, </em>165 Ohio App.3d 379, 2006-Ohio-718, 846 N.E.2d 592, and the Third District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Daniels, </em>Putnam App. No. 12-03-12, 2004-Ohio-2063, 2004 WL 877695, on the following issue: \u201cWhere an indictment fails to charge the mens rea element of the crime, and the defendant fails to raise that issue in the trial court, has the defendant waived the defect in the indictment?\u201d The answer to this question is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">{\u00b6 2} Defendant-appellant, Vincent Colon, was convicted by a jury of the offense of robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). Prior to the trial, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury had returned a single-count indictment against the defendant, charging: \u201c[I]n attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in Section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense upon [the victim, the defendant did] inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on [the victim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">{\u00b6 3} At the defendant\u2019s trial, the court instructed the jury on the elements of robbery pursuant to R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) and summarized the elements as (1) \u201cin attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense,\u201d (2) the defendant inflicted, or attempted to \u201cinflict, or threatened to inflict physical harm upon [the victim].\u201d The jury found the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, the defendant argued that his \u201cstate constitutional right to a grand jury indictment and state and federal constitutional rights to due process were violated when his indictment omitted an element of the offense.\u201d The indictment did not expressly charge the mens rea element of the crime of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">{\u00b6 5} The court of appeals did not address the defect in the indictment; instead, the court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction pursuant to Crim.R. 12(C)(2). Crim.R. 12(C)(2) states that defects in an indictment are waived if not raised before trial, except that failure to show jurisdiction in the court or failure to charge an offense may be raised at any time during the pendency of the proceeding. The court of appeals held that because defendant did not raise the issue before his trial, he waived the argument that his indictment was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Defendant was convicted of the offense of robbery, pursuant to R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). That statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(2) Inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">{\u00b6 10} There is no dispute that the defendant\u2019s indictment was defective. The indictment purportedly charged the defendant with robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), but the indictment omitted a mens rea element for the actus reus element stated in subsection (2): \u201cInflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">{\u00b6 11} While the robbery statute does not expressly state the degree of culpability required for subsection (2), the mental state of the offender is a part of every criminal offense in Ohio, except those that plainly impose strict liability. See <em>State v. Lozier, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 161, 2004-Ohio-732, 803 N.E.2d 770, \u00b6 18. Under R.C. 2901.21(A)(2), in order to be found guilty of a criminal offense, a person must have \u201cthe requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2901.21(B) addresses both strict-liability statutes and those statutes, like the robbery statute (R.C. 2911.02), that do not expressly state a culpable mental state. <em>State v. Lozier, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 161, 2004-Ohio-732, 803 N.E.2d 770, at \u00b6 19. R.C. 2901.21(B) states that \u201c[w]hen the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">{\u00b6 13} Thus, \u201crecklessness is the catchall culpable mental state for criminal statutes that fail to mention any degree of culpability, except for strict liability statutes, where the accused\u2019s mental state is irrelevant. However, for strict liability to be the mental standard, the statute must plainly indicate a purpose to impose it.\u201d <em>State v. Lozier, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 161, 2004-Ohio-732, 803 N.E.2d 770, at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) does not specify a particular degree of culpability for the act of \u201c[i]nflict[ing], attempting] to inflict, or threatening] to inflict physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>harm,\u201d nor does the statute plainly indicate that strict liability is the mental standard. As a result, the state was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant recklessly inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">{\u00b6 15} In this case, the indictment failed to charge that the physical harm was recklessly inflicted. The state agrees that the omission in the indictment of one of the essential elements of the crime of robbery rendered the defendant\u2019s indictment defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 16} This court has consistently protected defendants\u2019 rights to a proper indictment. As early as 1855, Chief Justice Ranney stated the importance of including all the essential elements in an indictment: \u201c \u2018The nature and cause of the accusation\u2019 are not sufficiently stated to enable the accused to know what he might expect to meet upon the trial; and it is neither consistent with general principles nor constitutional safeguards, to allow a man to be thus put to trial upon a criminal charge in the dark.\u201d <em>Dillingham v. State </em>(1855), 5 Ohio St. 280, 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 17} Our case law follows the Ohio Constitution, which provides that \u201cno person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous, crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\u201d Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution. \u201cThe material and essential facts constituting an offense are found by the presentment of the grand jury; and if one of the vital and material elements identifying and characterizing the crime has been omitted from the indictment such defective indictment is insufficient to charge an offense, and cannot be cured by the court, as such a procedure would not only violate the constitutional rights of the accused, but would allow the court to convict him on an indictment essentially different from that found by the grand jury.\u201d <em>Harris v. State </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 257, 264, 181 N.E. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">{\u00b6 18} The Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure reflect the principle that an indictment that fails to include all the essential elements of an offense is a defective indictment. Crim.R. 7(B) provides that an indictment must include a statement that \u201cthe defendant has committed a public offense specified in the indictment. * * * The statement may be made in ordinary and concise language without technical averments or allegations not essential to be proved. The statement may be in the words of the applicable section of the statute, provided the words of that statute charge an offense, or in words sufficient to give the defendant notice of <em>all the elements of the offense </em>with which the defendant is charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 19} Having concluded that the indictment in this case was defective because it failed to charge an essential element of the offense, we next determine whether an indictment that fails to include the mens rea of the offense charged may be challenged for the first time on appeal. In this case, the defective indictment resulted in structural error, and the court of appeals erred when it held that the error could not be raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 20} Structural errors are \u201cconstitutional defects that \u2018 \u201cdefy analysis by \u2018harmless error\u2019 standards\u201d because they \u201caffect[ ] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply [being] an error in the trial process itself.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Brackets added in <em>Fisher.) State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, at \u00b6 17, quoting <em>State v. Fisher, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, at \u00b6 9, quoting <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 309, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302. \u201cSuch errors permeate \u2018[t]he entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end\u2019 so that the trial cannot \u2018 \u201creliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Arizona </em>at 309-310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302, quoting <em>Rose v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 577-578, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460. \u201c[A] structural error <em>mandates </em>a finding of \u2018per se prejudice.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Fisher, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cIn determining whether an alleged error is \u2018structural,\u2019 our threshold inquiry is whether such error \u2018involves the deprivation of a constitutional right.\u2019 \u201d Id., citing <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 74, 752 N.E.2d 904 (Cook, J., concurring). If an error in the trial court is not a constitutional error, then the error is not structural error. See <em>State v. Issa </em>at 74, 752 N.E.2d 904 (Cook, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">{\u00b6 22} We have previously cautioned against applying a structural-error analysis in cases that would otherwise be governed by Crim.R. 52(B) because the defendant did not raise the error in the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, at \u00b6 23. \u201cThis caution is born of sound policy. For to hold that an error is structural even when the defendant does not bring the error to the attention of the trial court would be to encourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>defendants to remain silent at trial only later to raise the error on appeal where the conviction would be automatically reversed.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 23} The instant case could be decided by applying plain-error analysis pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), because the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were prejudiced by the errors in the indictment, and the defendant failed to object to the indictment at the trial court. However, here, the defects in the indictment led to significant errors throughout the defendant\u2019s trial, and therefore, structural-error analysis is appropriate. As stated previously, structural errors permeate the trial from beginning to end and put into question the reliability of the trial court in serving its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence. <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 24} Our holding in the instant case that the defect in the indictment resulted in structural error is supported by the Ohio Constitution, which states that \u201cno person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous, crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\u201d Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution. In order to establish structural error, the defendant must first establish that a constitutional error has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">{\u00b6 25} As we explained in <em>State v. Wozniak </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 517, 520, 18 O.O.2d 58, 178 N.E.2d 800, \u201c[t]o require defendants to answer for the crime sought to be charged in [the indictment] after amendment of the indictment by addition thereto of a missing charge of an essential element of that crime would be to require defendants to answer for a crime other than on \u2018presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\u2019 \u201d In <em>State v. Wozniak, </em>the indictment did not include the element of intent specified in former R.C. 2907.10, now R.C. 2911.13, breaking and entering. Id. at 519, 18 O.O.2d 58, 178 N.E.2d 800. This court held that the prosecutor was not permitted to perfect the defective indictment by amendment, because \u201cthe grand jury and not the prosecutor, even with the approval of the court, must charge the defendant with each essential element of that crime.\u201d Id. at 520, 18 O.O.2d 58, 178 N.E.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">{\u00b6 26} Crim.R. 7, first adopted in 1973, affected the rule with respect to the amendment of indictments. Crim.R. 7(D) states: \u201cThe court may at any time before, during, or after a trial amend the indictment, information, complaint, or bill of particulars, in respect to any defect, imperfection, or omission in form or substance, or of any variance with the evidence, provided no change is made in the name or identity of the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">{\u00b6 27} Despite the language of Crim.R. 7(D) permitting amendment, an indictment must still meet constitutional requirements, and its failure to do so may violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. In order to be constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>sufficient, an indictment must, first, contain \u201c \u2018the elements of the offense charged and fairly inform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second, enable[] him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Childs </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 558, 565, 728 N.E.2d 379, quoting <em>Hamling v. United States </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 87, 117-118, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">{\u00b6 28} In the instant case, the indictment did not meet constitutional requirements, as it did not include all the essential elements of the offense charged against the defendant. Thus, the defendant was not properly informed of the charge so that he could put forth his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">{\u00b6 29} The defective indictment in this case resulted in several violations of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. First, the indictment against the defendant did not include all the elements of the offense charged, as the indictment omitted the required mens rea for the crime of robbery. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s indictment was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 30} Second, there is no evidence in the record that the defendant had notice that the state was required to prove that he had been reckless in order to convict him of the offense of robbery, and thus the defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated. Further, the state did not argue that the defendant\u2019s conduct in inflicting physical harm on the victim constituted reckless conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">{\u00b6 31} In addition to the defendant being unaware of the elements of the crime with which he was charged, and the prosecutor failing to argue that the defendant\u2019s conduct in this case was reckless, when the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of robbery necessary to find the defendant guilty, the court failed to include the required mens rea for the offense. The defendant\u2019s counsel did not object to the incomplete instruction. There is no evidence in the record that the jury considered whether the defendant was reckless in inflicting, attempting to inflict, or threatening to inflict physical harm, as is required to convict under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). Finally, during closing argument, the prosecuting attorney treated robbery as a strict-liability offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">{\u00b6 32} In summary, the defective indictment in this case failed to charge all the essential elements of the offense of robbery and resulted in a lack of notice to the defendant of the mens rea required to commit the offense. This defect clearly permeated the defendant\u2019s entire criminal proceeding. The defendant did not receive a constitutional indictment or trial, and therefore the defective indictment in this case resulted in structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">{\u00b6 33} The state agrees that the indictment charging the defendant is defective, but argues that the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure require that any objection based on defects in the indictment must be raised before trial. Crim.R. 12(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cPrior to trial, any party may raise by motion any defense, objection, evidentiary issue, or request that is capable of determination without the trial of the general issue. The following must be raised before trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">{\u00b636} \u201c(2) Defenses and objections based on defects in the indictment, information, or complaint (other than failure to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense, which objections shall be noticed by the court at any time during the pendency of the proceeding).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">{\u00b6 37} As stated in Crim.R. 12(C)(2), there are two specific exceptions to the general rule. Defects in an indictment that fail either \u201cto show jurisdiction in the court\u201d or \u201cto charge an offense\u201d do not need to be raised prior to trial and can be raised any time during the pendency of the proceeding. An indictment that omits the mens rea element of recklessness fails to charge the offense of robbery and is therefore an exception to the general rule stated in Crim.R. 12(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">{\u00b6 38} Our conclusion that an indictment that omits an essential element fails to charge an offense is supported by case law. In <em>State v. Wozniak, </em>172 Ohio St. 517, 18 O.O.2d 58, 178 N.E.2d 800, paragraph one of the syllabus, we held that the intent element of an offense is an essential element of the crime and an indictment that does not charge a defendant with intent does not charge a defendant with the crime. Also, in <em>State v. Childs, </em>we concluded that the defendant did not waive his challenge to an indictment that omitted a material element identifying the crime by not raising it prior to trial. Id., 88 Ohio St.3d 194, 724 N.E.2d 781. \u201c \u2018 \u201c[I]f one of the vital and material elements identifying and characterizing the crime has been omitted from the indictment such defective indictment is insufficient to charge an offense, and cannot be cured by the court, as such a procedure would not only violate the constitutional rights of the accused, but would allow the court to convict him on an indictment essentially different from that found by the grand jury.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at 198, 724 N.E.2d 781, quoting <em>Wozniak </em>at 521, 18 O.O.2d 58, 178 N.E.2d 800, quoting <em>Harris v. State </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 257, 264, 181 N.E. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">{\u00b6 39} Our holding today, that a defendant can challenge for the first time on appeal an indictment that omits an essential element of the crime, protects defendants\u2019 right to a grand jury indictment. The grand jury is an important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>part of American citizens\u2019 constitutional rights. Our grand jury system is derived from its English counterpart, and the concept was brought to this country by early colonists and incorporated into the federal Constitution. <em>Costello v. United States </em>(1956), 350 U.S. 359, 362, 76 S.Ct. 406, 100 L.Ed. 397. \u201cThe basic purpose of the English grand jury was to provide a fair method for instituting criminal proceedings against persons believed to have committed crimes. * * * Despite its broad power to institute criminal proceedings the grand jury grew in popular favor with the years. It acquired an independence in England free from control by the Crown or judges.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">{\u00b6 40} In discussing the grand jury provision of the federal Constitution, which is very similar to the grand jury provision of the Ohio Constitution, the Supreme Court of the United States has stated that the grand jury is a \u201c \u2018 \u201cconstitutional fixture in its own right.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 36, 47, 112 S.Ct. 1735, 118 L.Ed.2d 352, quoting <em>United States v. Chanen </em>(C.A.9, 1977), 549 F.2d 1306, 1312, quoting <em>Nixon v. Sirica </em>(C.A.D.C.1973), 487 F.2d 700, 712, fn. 54. \u201cIn this country the Founders thought the grand jury so essential to basic liberties that they provided in the Fifth Amendment that federal prosecution for serious crimes can only be instituted by \u2018a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.\u2019 The grand jury\u2019s historic functions survive to this day. Its responsibilities continue to include both the determination whether there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and the protection of citizens against unfounded criminal prosecutions.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>United States v. Calandra </em>(1974), 414 U.S. 338, 343, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">{\u00b6 41} The state argues that despite the constitutional significance of the grand jury, permitting defendants to challenge a defective indictment for the first time on appeal will encourage defendants to withhold their challenges until after trial, resulting in inefficient proceedings. Our answer to this argument is simple: the state can thwart a defendant\u2019s ability to harbor his challenge until after judgment by securing an indictment from the grand jury that properly charges all the essential elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 42} Crim.R. 7(B) plainly states that an \u201cindictment shall * * * contain a statement that the defendant has committed a public offense specified in the indictment.\u201d Further, Crim.R. 7(B) states, \u201cThe statement may be in the words of the applicable section of the statute, provided the words of that statute charge an offense, or in words sufficient to give the defendant notice of <em>all the elements of the offense </em>with which the defendant is charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201c[A]n indictment charging an offense solely in the language of a statute is insufficient when a specific intent element has been judicially interpreted for that offense.\u201d <em>State v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 122, 124, 30 OBR 436, 508 N.E.2d 144, citing <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>{\u00b6 43} Applying Crim.R. 7(B) to this case, since the language of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) does not include the mental element required to commit the offense, the indictment was required to be in \u201cwords sufficient to give the defendant notice of all the elements.\u201d Further, pursuant to <em>State v. O\u2019Brien, </em>the defendant\u2019s indictment was required to include the term \u201crecklessly\u201d in order to properly charge the offense. It is not an unreasonable burden to require counsel for the state to ensure that the defendant receives the benefit of his fundamental constitutional protections, nor is it unreasonable to expect a trial judge to properly instruct the jury regarding all the elements of the crime with which the defendant is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">{\u00b6 44} A defendant has a constitutional right to grand jury indictment and to notice of all the essential elements of an offense with which he is charged. The state must meet its duty to properly indict a defendant, and we will not excuse the state\u2019s error at the cost of a defendant\u2019s longstanding constitutional right to a proper indictment. When a defective indictment so permeates a defendant\u2019s trial such that the trial court cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence, the defective indictment will be held to be structural error. See <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">{\u00b6 45} In conclusion, we hold that when an indictment fails to charge a mens rea element of a crime and the defendant fails to raise that defect in the trial court, the defendant has not waived the defect in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-7\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b149-8\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b149-9\">William H.

Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302. Moreover, the court explained in <em>Neder v. United States </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35, that \u201c[s]uch errors \u2018infect the entire trial process,\u2019 * * * and \u2018necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 8, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35, quoting <em>Brecht v.

Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799; a biased trial judge, <em>Tumey v.

Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, that \u201c[although all structural errors are by nature constitutional errors, not all constitutional errors are structural.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 18, citing <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 22-23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. And as this court stated in <em>Stacy v.

Thus, unless it is structural, even a constitutional error may be forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\n<em>A Defective Indictment Does Not Constitute Structural Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 50} The majority correctly concludes that Colon\u2019s indictment was constitutionally defective because it omitted a necessary element of the charged offense. See <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350; <em>State v. Childs </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 194, 724 N.E.2d 781; <em>State v. Wozniak </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 517, 521, 18 O.O.2d 58, 178 N.E.2d 800. I disagree, however, with its conclusion that this \u201cdefect clearly permeated the defendant\u2019s entire criminal proceeding\u201d and thus constituted structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 51} The majority asserts that the defect in Colon\u2019s indictment led to the following constitutional violations during his trial: (1) \u201cthe indictment * * * did not include all the elements of the offense charged,\u201d (2) \u201cthe defendant [was] unaware of the elements of the crime with which he was charged,\u201d (3) \u201cthe [trial] court failed to include the required mens rea for the offense\u201d in the jury instructions, and (4) the prosecutor implied during closing argument that there is no mens rea element. The first and second of these, however, are not <em>additional </em>errors; rather, they merely repeat the reasons for concluding that Colon\u2019s indictment was constitutionally defective, an issue that is not disputed here. Moreover, the last two are confined to parts of the proceedings that occurred after the presentation of evidence. In short, the majority fails to explain how the defective indictment \u201cinfect[ed] the <em>entire </em>trial process\u201d (emphasis added), <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 630, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353, \u201cnecessarily rendered the] trial <em>fundamentally </em>unfair\u201d (emphasis added), <em>Rose, </em>478 U.S. at 577, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460, or otherwise prevented the trial from \u201creliably serving] its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence,\u201d id. at 577-578, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 52} In <em>Neder, </em>527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35, the court reviewed an issue that is analogous to the one before us here. There, the trial court had given an instruction to the jury that omitted a necessary element of the offense, and the defendant asserted that this constituted structural error. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, however, stating, \u201cUnlike such defects as the complete deprivation of counsel or trial before a biased judge, an instruction that omits an element of the offense does not <em>necessarily </em>render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 9, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35. This conclusion is instructive, because if it is not structural error when a jury returns a guilty verdict based on an instruction that omitted a necessary element of the offense, then neither should it be structural error when an indictment omits a necessary element.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>{\u00b6 53} In my view, the instant matter does not fall into the \u201cvery limited class of cases\u201d in which structural errors have been found, <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718, nor does the defect in Colon\u2019s indictment resemble the errors that the United States Supreme Court has previously deemed to be structural in nature, such as the total denial of counsel in <em>Gideon, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, the biased trial judge in <em>Tumey, </em>273 U.S. 510, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749, the grand jury selected on the basis of race in <em>Vasquez, </em>474 U.S. 254, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598, or the denial of self-representation at trial in <em>Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">{\u00b6 54} Moreover, the majority\u2019s holding in this case contradicts our decisions in numerous other cases in which we applied the plain-error doctrine when a defendant failed to object in the trial court to a defective indictment. For example, in <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 734 N.E.2d 345, the defendant challenged his indictment on the basis that it omitted an essential element for the offense of rape. We stated that \u201cCarter never challenged the sufficiency of the indictment at any time before or during his trial. An appellate court need not consider an error that was not called to the attention of the trial court at a time when such error could have been avoided or corrected by the trial court.\u201d Id. at 598, 734 N.E.2d 345, citing <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 117, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364. \u201cAs a result,\u201d we concluded, \u201csuch error is waived absent plain error.\u201d Id., citing <em>State v.

Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 23, \u201c[w]e emphasize[d] that both this court and the United States Supreme Court have cautioned against applying a structural-error analysis where, as here, the case would be otherwise governed by Crim.R. 52(B) because the defendant did not raise the error in the trial court. * * * This caution is born of sound policy. For to hold that an error is structural even when the defendant does not bring the error to the attention of the trial court would be to encourage defendants to remain silent at trial only later to raise the error on appeal where the conviction would be automatically reversed. We believe that our holdings should foster rather than thwart judicial economy by providing incentives (and not disincentives) for the defendant to raise all errors in the trial court \u2014 where, in many cases, such errors can be easily corrected.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">{\u00b6 56} In concluding that a structural error occurs when an indictment omits an element of the offense charged, the majority authorizes defendants to treat the defect as a trump card in that, upon the jury\u2019s returning a guilty verdict, it can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>played for the first time on appeal to secure a reversal. This should not be the law in Ohio, where defendants have not only the opportunity to correct a defective indictment pursuant to Crim.R. 7(D), but also the obligation to do so under Crim.R. 12(C) and R.C. 2941.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">{\u00b6 57} For these reasons, it is my view that the defect in Colon\u2019s indictment is not structural in nature, and by failing to object at a time when it could have been corrected, Colon forfeited all but plain error related to that defect. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and answer the certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-6\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aij\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">{\u00b6 58} Although I agree that in charging appellant with robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) the indictment failed to allege a mens rea element, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion for three reasons: first, appellant waived this defect by failing to raise the issue before the trial court; second, a plain-error standard of review applies; and third, the omission from the indictment does not constitute a structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">{\u00b6 59} The majority concludes that appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated in this case. Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides that \u201cno person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous, crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\u201d Recently, we explained that \u201c[t]he purposes of an indictment are to give an accused adequate notice of the charge, and enable an accused to protect himself or herself from any future prosecutions for the same incident.\u201d <em>State v. Buehner, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 403, 2006-Ohio-4707, 853 N.E.2d 1162, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 60} The form that the indictment is to take is explained in Crim.R. 7(B): \u201cThe statement may be made in ordinary and concise language without technical averments or allegations not essential to be proved. The statement <em>may be in the words of the applicable section of the statute, provided the words of that statute charge an offense, or in words sufficient to give the defendant notice of all the elements of the offense with which the defendant is charged.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">{\u00b6 61} In <em>Buehner, </em>we held that an indictment that tracked the language of the charged offense but did not include each element of the predicate offense still provided the defendant with adequate notice of the charges against him. 110 Ohio St.3d 403, 2006-Ohio-4707, 853 N.E.2d 1162, syllabus. Here, appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>indictment tracked the statute. The indictment reads: \u201c[I]n attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in Section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense upon [the victim,] [the defendant did] inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on [the victim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">{\u00b6 62} Adding the word \u201crecklessly\u201d to the indictment simply would have notified appellant that the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the default level of mens rea. R.C. 2901.21(B) states, \u201cWhen the section [defining an offense] neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.\u201d Moreover, R.C. 2901.22(E) provides, \u201cWhen recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element.\u201d Thus, in tracking the robbery statute, R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), the indictment did not mislead the defense, for any one of the three criminal mental states suffice to complete the element of inflicting, threatening to inflict, or attempting to inflict physical harm on another.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 63} In <em>State v. Wharf </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 375, 715 N.E.2d 172, we examined R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) and held that it is not necessary to prove a specific mental state regarding the deadly weapon element of robbery. With respect to establishing a violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), we had never, before today, held that the state is required to prove that the defendant <em>recklessly </em>inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict physical harm. Thus, in this case the majority\u2019s conclusion is misplaced that \u201c\u2018[a]n indictment charging an offense solely in the language of a statute is insufficient <em>when a specific intent element has been judicially interpreted for that offense </em>\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added), majority opinion at \u00b6 42, quoting <em>State v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 122, 124, 30 OBR 436, 508 N.E.2d 144. In fact, an argument could have been made that the element of inflicting physical harm or threatening or attempting to inflict physical harm requires a mere proof of fact, which equates to strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 64} Nevertheless, in spite of arguments that might have been made, the state accepts the proposition that appellant\u2019s indictment is defective for lack of a mens rea element. Since the state does not dispute that there is a defect in the indictment, the issue remaining is whether appellant\u2019s failure to raise the issue in the trial court results in a waiver. I accept the state\u2019s view that our criminal rules and precedent require this court to hold that if a defendant fails to raise the issue at the trial level, a defendant may succeed on appeal only by establishing plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Waiver Applies Pursuant to Crim.R. 12(C) and (H)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 65} The court of appeals relied on Crim.R. 12(C) and (H), which state that defects in an indictment are waived if not raised before trial. The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>determines that one of the Crim.R. 12(C) exceptions to the waiver rule exists in this case because appellant\u2019s indictment failed to charge an offense. In stating that \u201c[a]n indictment that omits the mens rea element of recklessness fails to charge the offense of robbery,\u201d the majority first cites <em>State v. Wozniak </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 517, 18 O.O.2d 58, 178 N.E.2d 800, a case concerning an indictment that failed to allege intent, which was statutorily included as an element of the offense. In <em>Wozniak, </em>the indictment failed to charge an offense because it did not include language that followed the statute. The second case cited by the majority, <em>State v. Childs </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 194, 724 N.E.2d 781, concerns the omission from an indictment of an allegation that the defendant or an alleged co-conspirator of the defendant committed a substantial overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy, as required by R.C. 2923.01(B), the conspiracy statute. Appellant\u2019s case is hardly the same, for his indictment set forth the crime of robbery as defined in R.C. 2911.02(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">{\u00b6 66} We have consistently found that failure to timely object to a defect in an indictment constitutes a waiver of the issues involved. This is true even in capital cases. In <em>State v. Joseph </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 653 N.E.2d 285, we held that the error in Joseph\u2019s capital indictment did not render the indictment invalid, since the record clearly demonstrated that the defendant \u201chad sufficient notice that he was being tried as a principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder of [the victim] while committing kidnapping.\u201d Id. at 455-456, 653 N.E.2d 285. Furthermore, the court held that Joseph\u2019s failure to timely object to the allegedly defective indictment constituted a waiver of the issue. Id. at 455, 653 N.E.2d 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">{\u00b6 67} In <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 734 N.E.2d 345, the capital indictment omitted the words \u201cengage in sexual conduct\u201d that are used in the rape statute. However, Carter had not shown that he was prejudiced in the defense of his case by this error or that he would have proceeded differently had this error been corrected. See also <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 436, 678 N.E.2d 891; <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 363, 582 N.E.2d 972 (\u201cUnder Crim.R. 12(B) and 12(G) [now 12(H) ], alleged defects in an indictment must be asserted before trial or they are waived\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 68} Furthermore, R.C. 2941.29 sets forth the time for objecting to defects in an indictment. It states: \u201cNo indictment or information shall be quashed, set aside, or dismissed, or motion to quash be sustained, or any motion for delay of sentence for the purpose of review be granted, nor shall any conviction be set aside or reversed on account of any defect in form or substance of the indictment or information, unless the objection to such indictment or information, specifically stating the defect claimed, is made prior to the commencement of the trial, or at such time thereafter as the court permits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>{\u00b6 69} A court of appeals need not consider an error that was not called to the attention of the trial court at a time when the error could have been corrected by the trial court. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 117, 5 0.0.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, death sentence vacated on other grounds, <em>Williams v. Ohio </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3137, 57 L.Ed.2d 1156. As a result, such an error is waived absent plain error. <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 62, 552 N.E.2d 894. Plain error does not exist unless, but for the error, the outcome at trial clearly would have been different. Id. Thus, an appellate court\u2019s discretionary review of the alleged error must proceed, if at all, under the plain-error analysis of Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Plain Error Applies</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 70} The test for plain error is stringent. A party claiming plain error must show that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was obvious, and (3) the error affected the outcome of the trial. See <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240; <em>United States v. Olano </em>(1993), 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508; Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 71} The burden of demonstrating plain error is on the party asserting it. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jester </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 147, 150, 512 N.E.2d 962 (\u201cappellant cannot claim that the trial court\u2019s instruction was plain error, inasmuch as he cannot demonstrate that but for the error, the outcome of the trial would have been different\u201d). Additionally, \u201c[n]otice of plain error * * * is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">{\u00b6 72} When a manifest miscarriage of justice occurs, it may be corrected through the trial court\u2019s granting of a new trial. The majority does not, however, mention the statute that prevents the granting of new trials and the setting aside of verdicts for certain errors. R.C. 2945.83 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cNo motion for a new trial shall be granted or verdict set aside, nor shall any judgment of conviction be reversed in any court because of:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">{\u00b6 74} \u201c(A) An inaccuracy or imperfection in the indictment, * :|! * provided that the charge is sufficient to fairly and reasonably inform the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">{\u00b6 75} Subsection (E) provides that a new trial should not be granted for \u201c[a]ny other cause unless it appears affirmatively from the record that the accused was prejudiced thereby or was prevented from having a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">{\u00b6 76} Appellant has not shown that he was prejudiced in the defense of his case or that he would have proceeded differently had this error been corrected. Indeed, had the error been discovered, it would have been properly subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>amendment. Crim.R. 7(D); <em>State v. O\u2019Brien, </em>30 Ohio St.3d 122, 30 OBR 436, 508 N.E.2d 144, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The Error in the Indictment Is Not Structural</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 77} Although appellant did not challenge his indictment until his appeal, the majority, after first concluding that appellant was never properly charged with a crime, decides that the missing element of recklessness made the indictment unconstitutional and caused structural error. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">{\u00b6 78} The majority cites <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 17, to support its statement that \u201c[w]hen a defective indictment so permeates a defendant\u2019s trial that the trial court cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence, the defective indictment will be held to be structural error.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 44. But the cited paragraph does not mention defective indictments. In fact, the <em>Perry </em>court meant something entirely different. After repeating that structural error arises from \u201cconstitutional defects that \u2018 \u201cdefy analysis by \u2018harmless error\u2019 standards\u201d because they \u201caffectf ] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply [being] an error in the trial process itself,\u201d \u2019 \u201d id. at \u00b6 17, quoting <em>State v. Fisher, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 9, quoting <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 309 and 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302, the <em>Perry </em>court, in concluding the paragraph, stated, \u201cWe have thus recognized that if \u2018 \u201cthe defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other constitutional errors that may have occurred are subject to harmless-error analysis,\u201d \u2019 \u201d id., quoting <em>State v. Hill </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 191, 197, 749 N.E.2d 274, quoting <em>Rose v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 579, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460. Thus, far from supporting it, <em>Perry </em>undercuts the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">{\u00b6 79} In <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, we analyzed structural error, remarking, \u201cThere also exist those classes of errors that need not be analyzed using the above \u2018limits\u2019 and are \u2018[s]ubject to automatic reversal, \u201conly in a very limited class of cases.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 18, quoting <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 18, quoting <em>Johnson v. United States </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718. Although all structural errors are by nature constitutional errors, not all constitutional errors are structural. <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 22-23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. As a result, some constitutional errors can be deemed nonprejudicial, so long as the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">{\u00b6 80} What are the significant errors in this jury trial, according to the majority? First, appellant has been called to answer for a charge on which the grand jury did not indict him. Second, even though the indictment tracked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>language of the statute defining robbery, the indictment is constitutionally deficient because it did not inform appellant of the charge so that he could defend against it. Third, due process is implicated because appellant did not know that \u201cthe state was required to prove that he had been reckless in order to convict him of the offense of robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">{\u00b6 81} These conclusions are incorrect, for although the indictment failed to add the word \u201crecklessly\u201d to the element \u201cinflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on [the victim],\u201d the grand jury considered the essential elements of robbery because the indictment tracks the language of the robbery statute. As we noted in <em>Harris v. State </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 257, 264, 181 N.E. 104, it is <em>\u201cif one of the vital and material elements </em>identifying and characterizing the crime <em>has been omitted </em>from the indictment\u201d that the indictment is insufficient to charge an offense and would later allow a jury to convict on \u201can indictment <em>essentially different </em>from that found by the grand jury.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">{\u00b6 82} This is also not a case where a defendant was indicted on one crime and convicted of another. Appellant does not show how he would have defended against the charge differently had he known that the state had to prove that he had <em>recklessly </em>inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">{\u00b6 83} Finally, the majority is not accurate in saying that the state was required to prove that appellant \u201chad been reckless in order to convict him of the offense of robbery.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 30. The state was required to show for this element that he <em>recklessly inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict </em>physical harm on the victim. It was unnecessary for the state to indict or prove the higher mental states of purpose or knowledge. As the majority itself notes, recklessness, the \u201ccatchall culpable mental state,\u201d is sufficient. The indictment states that he <em>\u201cdid </em>* * * inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm\u201d (emphasis added), clearly informing appellant what the state would have had to prove to convict him of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">{\u00b6 84} The jury heard evidence on every element of the offense of robbery. As the court of appeals noted, \u201c[a] reasonable jury could find that, by throwing Mr. Woodie to the ground and struggling with him, appellant perversely disregarded a known risk that the septuagenarian victim would be injured.\u201d <em>State v. Colon, </em>8th Dist. No. 87499, 2006-Ohio-5335, 2006 WL 2899957, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">{\u00b6 85} Moreover, in similar circumstances, the United States Supreme Court has refused to perform a structural-error analysis. In <em>Neder v. United States </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 1, 19-20, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35, the court held that a trial court\u2019s failure to submit an element of an offense for the jury\u2019s determination did not render the trial fundamentally unfair. And in <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Cotton </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860, the court held that a defendant\u2019s failure to object to an indictment that omitted a material element resulted in a waiver, making the issue subject to a plain-error review on appeal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Azh\">William Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Jon W. Oebker, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Azk\">Robert L. Tobik, Cuyahoga County Public Defender, and Cullen Sweeney, Assistant Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AMG\">Jason A. Macke, urging reversal for amicus curiae, Ohio Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">{\u00b6 86} In my view, the circumstances of this case do not rise to the level of structural error or require an automatic reversal of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">{\u00b6 87} Because appellant failed to raise the defect in his indictment as an issue before the trial court, he waived the defect pursuant to Crim.R. 12. The issue of the defect in the indictment, having not been raised until the appeal, is subject to an analysis under plain error, which means that the court of appeals should have determined whether this error in the indictment should be noticed to correct a manifest injustice, and if so, whether appellant has met his burden to show prejudice in that but for the error the outcome would have been different. <em>Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">{\u00b6 88} I would hold that in failing to raise a mens rea defect in his indictment during his proceedings in the trial court, appellant waived his objections pursuant to Crim.R. 12. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment and remand the case to the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b159-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
