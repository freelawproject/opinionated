Broschak of Hilliard, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0019547, to the practice of law in Ohio in 1980. From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>September 28, 2004, to October 5, 2004, respondent\u2019s license to practice law was suspended based upon his default under a child-support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we now suspend respondent indefinitely, based on findings that he engaged in a pattern of misconduct by intentionally failing to pursue client cases, thereby causing multiple criminal appeals to be dismissed due to his failure to act on behalf of his clients, and by repeatedly failing to cooperate with the disciplinary process. On review, we agree that respondent violated the Code of Professional Responsibility as found by the board, and we suspend respondent indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with violations of the Disciplinary Rules in an eight-count complaint. Respondent failed to respond or otherwise participate in the proceedings, other than by appearing for a deposition early in the proceedings and by sending a couple of letters before the complaint was filed; therefore relator filed a motion for a default judgment. A master commissioner recommended indefinite suspension of respondent\u2019s license. The board adopted the master commissioner\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation of indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\"><em>Count I </em>\u2014 Shawn <em>Burton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent agreed to represent Shawn Burton in the appeal of his felony convictions in Gallia County and at a trial on additional felony criminal charges. Respondent appeared as counsel in both matters and ordered the transcript of the first criminal case for the appeal. Burton paid a total of $13,430 to respondent, $6,430 for the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">{\u00b6 5} On March 28, 2005, the record and transcript from the trial court were filed with the court of appeals. After granting three extensions of time to file the brief, the Fourth District Court of Appeals issued an order to respondent to show cause for an additional extension or face possible dismissal of the appeal. Respondent claimed that health problems and the loss of a draft in an electrical storm had prevented him from filing the brief. The Fourth District granted a fourth extension of the date for filing the appellate brief, to September 1, 2005. Respondent did not meet that deadline. On September 15, 2005, the Fourth District issued an entry ordering respondent to file the brief within ten days or face dismissal of the appeal. Respondent failed to file the brief, and the Fourth District granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss based on a failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">{\u00b6 6} Burton filed a pro se request in the Gallia County criminal proceeding, asking that respondent be removed for failure to communicate with him and for failure to file a brief in the appellate case. Respondent failed to attend a pretrial hearing on November 4, 2005, because he was appearing on behalf of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>client in Ross County. The judge in the Gallia County proceeding issued a show-cause order for respondent to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court and be removed from the case. The entry stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cTo date, counsel for the defendant Thomas Broschak, has not provided his client any apparent form of a defense. Although he has been retained by the defendant to handle his second trial and his appeal from his first trial, he has not prepared for trial, not sent any subpoenas to defense witnesses, not communicated with his client; in spite of repeated attempts by [the] defendant to contact him, and the appeal has been dismissed by the court of appeals because of Mr. Broschak\u2019s failure to timely file his appellate brief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 8} The court removed respondent as Burton\u2019s attorney and appointed a state public defender to represent Burton. Respondent informed the court that he no longer had the $7,000 that Burton had paid as attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent did not respond in writing to Burton\u2019s grievance, which was forwarded to him by relator. Relator, however, was able to depose respondent. At the deposition, respondent agreed to provide a written response to the grievance, refund $5,000 to Burton, and provide written proof that he had complied with the requirement of DR 1-104 to advise his clients that he did not maintain professional-liability insurance. However, respondent did not provide a complete written response to the grievance and failed to provide a refund or proof of compliance with DR 1-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">{\u00b6 10} As to Count I, the board found violations of DR 1-102(A)(4) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(5) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), 1-102(A)(6) (engaging in conduct adversely reflecting on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), 1-104(A) and (B) (failing to disclose to clients that lawyer does not maintain professional-liability insurance), 6-101(A)(3) (neglecting an entrusted legal matter), 7-101(A)(l) (failing to seek the lawful objectives of a client), 7-101(A)(2) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally failing to carry out a contract for professional employment), 7-101(A)(3) (prejudicing a client during the course of professional relationship), and 9-102(B)(3) (requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the lawyer\u2019s possession and render appropriate accounts to his client regarding them).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\"><em>Count II </em>\u2014 Micah <em>Cox</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">{\u00b6 11} Respondent represented Micah Cox in a felony case in the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas from 2004 to 2005. Cox was sentenced to four years\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Respondent failed to provide Cox or his representatives a copy of Cox\u2019s file upon request. On August 4, 2005, Cox\u2019s wife, Jennifer, requested a copy of Cox\u2019s file. Respondent did not reply to the request. On October 11 and 12, 2005, attorney Charles A. McKinney requested copies of Cox\u2019s file. Again, respondent did not respond to the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 13} Jennifer Cox filed a grievance with the Columbus Bar Association in December 2005, citing respondent\u2019s failure to provide the file. The bar association dismissed the grievance when respondent agreed to immediately forward a copy of Cox\u2019s file. Despite further representations that he would do so, respondent had not provided a copy of the file to Cox as of September 8, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">{\u00b6 14} As to Count II, the board found violations of DR 1-102(A)(6) and 9-102(B)(4) (requiring a lawyer to promptly deliver property in his possession that the client is entitled to receive).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\"><em>Count III </em>\u2014 Rick <em>Roar</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 15} Julie Robertson paid respondent a flat fee of $2,500 to represent Rick Roar in the appeal of his gross-sexual-imposition conviction. Respondent discussed with Roar the possibility of filing a motion for judicial release. Respondent then failed to respond to inquiries from Roar and his family for at least two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">{\u00b6 16} Respondent failed to file Roar\u2019s appellate brief, even after an order from the Fourth District Court of Appeals to file the brief with a motion showing good cause for his failure to timely file. The Fourth District dismissed Roar\u2019s appeal after respondent failed to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">{\u00b6 17} In February 2006, respondent told Roar and his sister that he purposely allowed the appeal to be dismissed to pursue the judicial-release motion. Respondent stated that he would file for judicial release within the week. Respondent did not file the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">{\u00b6 18} Relator sent a copy of the grievance and two letters of inquiry to respondent by certified mail and requested a written response to Roar\u2019s allegations. Respondent did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">{\u00b6 19} As to Count III, the board found violations of DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), and 7-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\"><em>Count IV </em>\u2014 Robert <em>Cunningham</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">{\u00b6 20} In March 2006, Barbara Cunningham paid respondent $2,500 to represent her son, Robert Cunningham, in the appeal of his gross-sexual-imposition conviction in Franklin County. Respondent filed the notice of appeal but failed to file an appellate brief. Respondent requested and received two extensions to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the brief but still did not file the brief. The Tenth District Court of Appeals finally dismissed Cunningham\u2019s appeal because respondent failed to file the brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 21} Barbara Cunningham did not discover that the appeal had been dismissed until she called the court to check on the status of the case. Ms. Cunningham called respondent and left approximately 25 voicemail messages from August to November 2006 but never received a return call. Likewise, respondent did not refund the $2,500 given to him by Barbara Cunningham. Ms. Cunningham stated that she was unable to hire another attorney to reopen the appeal without a refund of her money.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 22} Relator sent respondent a copy of Barbara Cunningham\u2019s grievance and two letters of inquiry by certified mail. Respondent did not respond to either inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 23} As to Count IV, the board found violations of DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), 7-101(A)(2), and 7-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\"><em>Count V </em>\u2014 Matthew <em>McCullough</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">{\u00b6 24} Matthew McCullough\u2019s mother paid respondent $5,000 to represent McCullough in a criminal appeal. McCullough was convicted of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, kidnapping, and attempted rape in Fayette County, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">{\u00b6 25} Respondent filed the appeal in the Twelfth District Court of Appeals on November 12, 2003. Respondent initially failed to request the trial transcript but eventually was able to have the state file the transcript at its expense. The court ordered that McCullough\u2019s appellate brief be filed by November 13, 2005. Although respondent requested three extensions, he failed to file the brief. Respondent did not respond to a February 23, 2006 show-cause order from the Twelfth District, resulting in the appeal\u2019s dismissal with prejudice for failure to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">{\u00b6 26} Respondent failed to inform McCullough about the dismissal of the appeal. McCullough discovered that his appeal had been dismissed only after writing a letter to the appellate court in January 2007. After learning of the dismissal, McCullough contacted respondent. McCullough stated, \u201cBroschak falsely told me that he was unaware of the dismissal and that he would investigate it. [Respondent] has not contacted me since this conversation.\u201d Respondent did not refund any of the $5,000 paid for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">{\u00b6 27} Relator sent respondent a copy of McCullough\u2019s grievance and two letters of inquiry by certified mail. Respondent did not respond to the inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">{\u00b6 28} As to Count V, the board found violations of DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), 7-101(A)(2), and 7-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Count VI </em>\u2014 Joshua <em>Smith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">{\u00b6 29} Joshua Smith\u2019s family paid respondent approximately $15,000 to represent Smith during his trial in Fayette County and in the appeal of his murder conviction and sentence to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 30} Respondent filed Smith\u2019s appeal in the Twelfth District Court of Appeals on August 11, 2006. Respondent requested and was granted additional time to file the trial transcript. However, respondent did not file the trial transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 31} The Twelfth District ordered Smith to show cause why his trial transcript was not filed by the due date. Respondent did not file a response to the show-cause order. On January 19, 2007, the appellate court dismissed the appeal for respondent\u2019s failure to file the trial transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 32} Smith wrote ten letters to respondent inquiring about the progress of the appeal and requesting copies of the transcript. Smith\u2019s mother and wife also repeatedly attempted to reach respondent from July 2006 to April 2007. Respondent did not respond to any of the communications and has not refunded any of the attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 33} Relator sent respondent a copy of Smith\u2019s grievance and two letters of inquiry by certified mail. Respondent did not respond to the inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">{\u00b6 34} As to Count VI, the board found violations of DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), 7-101(A)(2), and 7-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\"><em>Count VII </em>\u2014 Jerell <em>Smith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">{\u00b6 35} Jerell Smith paid respondent $5,000 to represent him in the appeal of his conviction of drug possession and sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">{\u00b6 36} Respondent filed Smith\u2019s appeal in the Twelfth District Court of Appeals on December 22, 2004. Respondent did not file the trial transcript. On June 6, 2005, the Twelfth District ordered Smith to show cause by June 10, 2005, why the appeal should not be dismissed for failure to file the transcript. Respondent failed to respond to the show-cause order, and the appeal was dismissed with prejudice on June 28, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">{\u00b6 37} Respondent also failed to communicate with Smith. In the spring of 2005, Smith sent respondent several letters requesting the return of his file. Smith asked Natasha Belcher to contact respondent on his behalf. Respondent did not respond to Smith or Belcher. Belcher left several messages for respondent, requesting the return of Smith\u2019s $5,000 fee. Respondent did not respond and did not refund any part of the fee. Smith\u2019s sentence expired on July 24, 2007, leaving no reason to reopen the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Relator sent letters of inquiry to the respondent by certified mail on two separate occasions. Respondent did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 39} As to Count VII, the board found violations of DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 1-1Q2(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), 7-101(A)(2), and 7-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\"><em>Count VIII </em>\u2014 Kandy <em>Raypole and Edward Welton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 40} Kandy Raypole was convicted of aggravated drug trafficking and hired respondent to pursue the criminal appeal. Respondent filed a notice of appeal in the Twelfth District Court of Appeals. On May 20, 2005, the Twelfth District dismissed Raypole\u2019s appeal because a brief was not timely filed on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 41} Edward Welton\u2019s family paid respondent $2,500 to pursue an appeal of Welton\u2019s rape conviction and ten-years-to-life prison sentence. On July 6, 2006, respondent filed Welton\u2019s appeal with the Twelfth District.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">{\u00b6 42} Respondent received an extension to file the appellate brief from the court but still failed to file the brief on the new date. Respondent did reply to the appellate court\u2019s show-cause order, in which the court indicated that it would consider dismissal of the case. The appellate court again granted respondent additional time to file. Again, respondent failed to file the brief. The Twelfth District dismissed Welton\u2019s appeal with prejudice for failure to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">{\u00b6 43} Respondent failed to respond to Welton\u2019s requests for information. Welton twice wrote letters to respondent asking for copies of his file. The only response Welton received was a visit from respondent, during which respondent stated that he would not return the documents because he was too busy and Welton did not need them. The family\u2019s attempts to recover the $2,500 fee were also ignored by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">{\u00b6 44} Relator sent letters of inquiry to the respondent by certified mail on two separate occasions. Respondent did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">{\u00b6 45} As to Count VIII, the board found violations of DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), 7-101(A)(2), and 7-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">{\u00b6 46} On August 8, 2007, respondent replied to relator expressing an interest in participating in the disciplinary proceeding. Respondent informed relator that mental-health issues had prevented him from responding to the previous letters and pleading in the proceeding. Respondent also informed relator that he was involved with the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">{\u00b6 47} Relator had discussed with respondent the help available from OLAP in a deposition taken in March 2005, before many of the occurrences leading to Counts II through IV and VI. Relator had pointed out the benefits of OLAP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>when questioning respondent about the Burton and Cox grievances. In that deposition, respondent assured relator that his emotional issues were in his past. Relator asked if respondent\u2019s emotional state had harmed any other clients or if relator could expect any more grievances. Respondent replied that he did not believe that any other clients were adversely affected and he hoped there would not be any more grievances. Yet six additional grievances were filed against respondent, all involving missed filing deadlines and failing to communicate with clients. Respondent also failed to cooperate with the disciplinary process for the additional grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">{\u00b6 48} In light of the evidence, we adopt all of the board\u2019s findings of misconduct. Specifically, we find that respondent violated DR-1-102(A)(4) with respect to Counts I, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII; 1-102(A)(5) with respect to Counts I, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII; 1-102(A)(6) with respect to Counts I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII; 1-104(A) and (B) with respect to Count I; 6-101(A)(3) with respect to Counts I, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII; 7-101(A)(l) with respect to Counts I, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII; 7-101(A)(2) with respect to Counts I, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII; 7-101(A)(3) with respect to Counts I, III, IV, V,'VI, VII, and VIII; 9-102(B)(S) with respect to Count I; and 9-102(B)(4) with respect to Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 49} In determining the appropriate sanction to impose for attorney misconduct, \u201cwe consider the duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases.\u201d <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Ake, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 266, 2006-Ohio-5704, 855 N.E.2d 1206, \u00b6 44. We weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors to decide whether extenuating circumstances justify lenience in our disposition. See Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). We are not limited to the factors specified in the rule and may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining which sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 50} Respondent neglected his duty to represent his clients and failed to return unearned fees. Respondent\u2019s clients were denied a full opportunity to appeal criminal convictions because he failed to file necessary court documents. Likewise, respondent failed to adequately communicate with his clients when he withheld documents and failed to provide his clients necessary information concerning their appeals. Respondent failed to participate in the disciplinary proceeding, routinely ignoring notices and requests sent by relator. Respondent also failed to file any objections before this court. Finally, respondent\u2019s license to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>practice law had previously been suspended for failure to comply with a child-support order.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"akh-dedup-0\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Philip A. King, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 51} We agree that indefinite suspension of respondent\u2019s license to practice law is the appropriate sanction. Attorneys must comply with the ethical requirements imposed by the former Code of Professional Responsibility and the current Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent has demonstrated a pattern of misconduct that resulted in harm to his clients. For these breaches of his duty to his clients, the public, and the legal profession, coupled with the aggravating effect of his disciplinary record, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a), indefinite suspension is appropriate. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Mathewson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 365, 2007-Ohio-2076, 865 N.E.2d 891, \u00b6 19. In <em>Mathewson, </em>counsel also failed to file appellate briefs for several of his clients and did not respond to show-cause orders. Mathewson also failed to return a client\u2019s file and did not cooperate in the disciplinary process.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 52} Respondent is hereby suspended indefinitely from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
