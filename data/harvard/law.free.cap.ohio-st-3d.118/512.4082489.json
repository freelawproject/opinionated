Because the speedy-trial claim is not cognizable in an extraordinary-writ case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 2} In July 2003, appellant, Bruce A. Jackim, was indicted on one count of felonious assault of a police officer, one count of assault on a police officer, and one count of resisting arrest. Jackim subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the case based on a claimed violation of his right to a speedy trial. Following a jury trial, Jackim was convicted of assault of a police officer and resisting arrest and was sentenced to a six-month suspended jail sentence and one year of community control.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 3} On appeal, the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County reversed the judgment because the common pleas court had erred in granting a motion in limine excluding a surveillance videotape as well as reference to it at trial. <em>State v. Jackim, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 87012 and 87400, 2006-Ohio-4756, 2006 WL 2639444. The court of appeals remanded the case for a new trial and ruled that Jackim\u2019s other claims were rendered moot because of the court\u2019s ruling. Id. at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 4} On remand, Jackim again filed a motion to dismiss the case based upon a claimed violation of his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">{\u00b6 5} In December 2007, Jackim filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County for a writ of prohibition to prevent appellee, Judge Richard J. Ambrose of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, from proceeding with Jackim\u2019s retrial because of the claimed speedy-trial violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">{\u00b6 6} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. The claim that Jackim was denied his right to a speedy trial is not cognizable in an extraordinary-writ proceeding. <em>State ex rel. Pesci v. Lucci, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 218, 2007-Ohio-4795, 874 N.E.2d 774, \u00b6 6 (prohibition); <em>State ex rel. Hamilton v.

He has an adequate remedy by way of appeal to raise this claim. <em>Pesci, </em>at \u00b6 6. Appeal following final judgment is not rendered inadequate due to the potential time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>expense involved. <em>State ex rel. Abner v.
