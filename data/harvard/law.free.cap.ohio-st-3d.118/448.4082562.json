During the riot, inmates killed corrections officer Robert Yallandingham. In 1995, James Were, the defendant-appellant, was convicted of aggravated murder for his participation in Vallandingham\u2019s killing and sentenced to death. On appeal, this court reversed, holding that Were had been deprived of a fair trial because the trial court did not hold a competency hearing. <em>State v. Were </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 173, 176-177, 761 N.E.2d 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In 2003, a new jury convicted Were of aggravated murder and sentenced him to death. The court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Were, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030485, 2005-Ohio-376, 2005 WL 267671. This cause is now before the court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">{\u00b6 3} On Sunday afternoon, April 11, 1993, a group of inmates seized control of the L-complex (\u201cL-Block\u201d) at SOCF. The L-Block contained eight cellblocks, and each cellblock contained 80 cells. During the riot, groups of inmates overpowered prison guards and held authorities at bay for several days. Before control was regained at the prison, several inmates and Vallandingham were killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">{\u00b6 4} The riot was planned and started by a group of Muslim gang members imprisoned at SOCF. Once the riot began, two other prison gangs, the Aryan Brotherhood and the Black Gangster Disciples, joined in. Carlos Sanders, Stanley Cummings, and Were \u2014 who was also known as \u201cNamir\u201d \u2014 were leaders of the Muslim gang during the riot. The Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist gang, was led by Jason Robb and George Skatzes. The Black Gangster Disciples was headed by Anthony Lavelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">{\u00b6 5} After the riot started, each of the three gangs staked out separate territory within L-Block. The Muslims controlled the L-6 cellblock and stayed there for the duration of the riot. During the riot, Were wore a striped referee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>shirt, signifying that he was allowed access to any area controlled by the prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 6} As the takeover began, a group of masked inmates entered the L-l cellblock where Vallandingham was stationed. Vallandingham had locked himself into the officer\u2019s bathroom near the front of the L-l cellblock. Several inmates turned over a metal desk and started banging that desk against the bathroom door. Inmate Steve Macko identified Were as one of the inmates near the bathroom at this time. Eventually, Vallandingham was removed from the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 7} Were, Sanders, and Reggie Williams, another Muslim gang member, then took Vallandingham down the corridor to the L-6 cellblock. Vallandingham was put into the L-6 shower where his hands were cuffed behind his back and a sheet was placed over his head. Vallandingham was later moved to a cell in the L-6 cellblock.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 8} Organized negotiations between the authorities and the inmates began on the second day of the riot. Additionally, on the second day, the Ohio State Highway Patrol (\u201cOSP\u201d) installed listening devices in the large tunnels underneath L-Block. Shortly thereafter, the FBI supplied more sophisticated listening devices, which were placed in crevices at ten locations underneath L-Block. Authorities then listened and recorded inmate conversations, referred to as the \u201ctunnel tapes,\u201d during the duration of the riot. A total of 591 \u201ctunnel tapes\u201d were created. Also, on the second day of the riot, the water and power were turned off inside L-Block.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 9} On April 14, the public information officer for the Department of Corrections responded to media questions about inmate threats. She stated that there had been threats and that they were a standard part of the negotiations. The inmates, who were following the news on battery-operated televisions and radios, were upset by these comments and felt that the authorities were not taking them seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 10} During a meeting on April 15 that was recorded on tunnel tape 61, Were and other inmate leaders discussed killing one of the hostages to show the authorities that they meant business. Were, who described himself as a hardliner, urged others to take a firmer stand during the negotiations. Were said that the water and power must be turned back on. He continued, \u201cWe give [the authorities] a certain time * * *. If it\u2019s not on in a certain time, that\u2019s when a body goes out.\u201d Were also said, \u201c[F]rom this point on we\u2019re turning it over to the hardliners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">{\u00b6 11} Before the April 15 meeting concluded, Were and the other inmate leaders voted to kill a corrections officer if their demands were not met. The Muslim inmates decided that Vallandingham would be killed because he had seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>them kill another inmate at the beginning of the riot. After the meeting, Were stated, \u201cI\u2019ll do it, I\u2019ll do it, I\u2019ll take care of it. The hardliners is taking over. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 12} Around 9:00 a.m. on April 15, Skatzes had a telephone conversation with state negotiators. Skatzes said, \u201cI cannot stress to you * * *. If you don\u2019t turn it on, it\u2019s a guaranteed murder. * * * That\u2019s the end of it. Do your thing at 10:30 or a dead man\u2019s out there.\u201d The inmates\u2019 demands were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 13} During the riot, inmate Thomas Taylor was locked in a cell in the L-6 cellblock. On the morning of April 15, Taylor saw Were and another inmate remove Vallandingham from his cell and take him to the end of the L-6 cellblock. Around the same time, inmate Sherman Sims walked past the L-6 shower area. Were was standing at the shower door and looking into the shower. Were noticed Sims and asked what he was doing there. While this exchange took place, Sims looked into the shower and saw a man with something over his head being strangled with a rope by two people. He also saw one of them \u201cputting a bar to [the man\u2019s] throat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 14} Were told Sims that he would have to help carry the body out of the prison. Were directed the inmates to wrap the body in sheets. At 11:10 a.m. on April 15, Sims and three other masked inmates carried Vallandingham\u2019s body from the prison and into the recreation yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 15} After the body was taken into the yard, Reginald Williams, a Muslim inmate, saw Were talking to Cummings while Cummings was on the phone with the state\u2019s negotiator. Were said, \u201cYou can come get your boy * * * he\u2019s out there, and you didn\u2019t take us serious. And from this point on, * * * you\u2019ll take us serious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">{\u00b6 16} At 12:10 p.m. on April 15, a SWAT team recovered Vallandingham\u2019s body from the recreation yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 17} On April 17, Were and other inmate leaders had a meeting to discuss the progress of negotiations. This meeting was recorded on tunnel tape 32. Were argued that the hardliners should control the negotiations. During the meeting, Were said, \u201cIf everybody can recall when we first started to see improvement in here, when we sent an officer out there, that is when we started to get to see some improvement. * * * When that officer went out there, that body went out there, that is when they began to see that we is serious, because all along they said that we are not serious * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">{\u00b6 18} Were continued, \u201cI am putting it just like this * * * if we have to throw another body, it will let people know the hardliners will put their foot down * * *. I don\u2019t give a damn you understand if some of the hostages die slow, or die at all, if I have to die, or we have to die, so I feel then if I cut off a man\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>fingers, I will cut the man\u2019s hand off and go out there and say now, I am going to let you know we ain\u2019t interested in killing your hostages, they\u2019ll die slow, since you all want to play games. We is for real about what we is about, man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9YC\">{\u00b6 19} A short time later, Were said, \u201c[T]hey only respect firmness. * * * I don\u2019t give a damn if it has to be on national TV, for them to see me personally, cut one of them dudes hands off and give it to them and spit it out of my mouth for them to know how serious I am about what we believe in. I don\u2019t care nothing about no electric chair, I don\u2019t care nothing about no other case * * * we got what they want and they got what we want.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 20} The riot ended on April 21, 2003, when the remaining hostages were released. Investigators then began interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence from inside the prison. No useful physical evidence linking any person to Vallandingham\u2019s murder was ever recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 21} Dr. Patrick Fardal, Franklin County Deputy Coroner, conducted the autopsy on Vallandingham. Vallandingham suffered an injury to his neck that was about eight inches in length, and another abrasion about two and one-half inches long was above the primary one. Fardal testified that petechial hemorrhages on the victim\u2019s face and eyes showed that considerable force was exerted upon Vallandingham\u2019s neck. An internal exam showed that the hyoid bone and the cornu of the thyroid cartilage had been fractured by the force exerted upon the victim\u2019s neck. Vallandingham had also suffered a small chip fracture in his anterior cervical spine. Fardal concluded that Vallandingham died from ligature strangulation. Fardal did not see anything across the victim\u2019s neck that indicated a weight bar had been used to kill him though he could not rule out the possibility that such a weapon had been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 22} At trial, Williams testified that after the riot, he was transferred to a prison in Mansfield, Ohio. On June 23, 1993, Were and Williams were transported on a bus from Mansfield to Lucasville. As they approached Lucasville, Were looked very concerned, and Williams asked what was bothering him. Were responded, \u201cI think they know I killed that guard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 23} Charles Austin testified that he met Were in 2001 when they were both in prison in Youngstown, Ohio. During a conversation, Were said that he was Sanders\u2019s lieutenant during the Lucasville riot. Were then said that \u201che was the one who kidnapped, robbed and killed Officer Vallandingham\u201d by strangling him. Were said that after killing him, Sanders told him to carry Vallandingham\u2019s body into the yard and leave it.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 24} On September 4, 1995, Were testified as a defense witness at the trial of Derrick Cannon, one of the Lucasville rioters. According to Mark Piepmeier, the lead special prosecutor for the Lucasville prison riot cases, Were testified that he moved from cellblock L-l to cellblock L-6 after the riot started and remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>there for the duration of the riot. Were also indicated that he was present in cellblock L-6 when Vallandingham was murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 25} During the defense case-in-chief, Thomas Blackmon, a Muslim inmate at SOCF during the riot, testified that Were had not been a leader during the riot. Blackmon said, \u201cNobody paid that much attention to [Were]. * * * [W]e respected him as a Muslim * * * but as far as listening to him * * * no. * * * [H]e is a good brother, but he can\u2019t read or write. * * * So he wasn\u2019t taken as serious as [Sanders], who was a bookworm and was real intelligent * *</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 26} After the riot, Blackmon was moved from Lucasville to a succession of correctional facilities. At one correctional facility, Blackmon talked to Sherman Sims. Sims said that the OSP wanted him to say that Were was involved in Vallandingham\u2019s death. Sims said that if he did not \u201cflip\u201d on Were, the OSP \u201cwas going to give it to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 27} Blackmon also talked to Reginald Williams at Lucasville after the riot. Williams said that the OSP was messing with their food, making death threats, and he would do anything to get out of Lucasville. Williams said that the OSP told him to say that Were was involved in Vallandingham\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 28} Gregory Durkin, a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, testified that he sat next to Skatzes during the April 15 meeting of inmate leaders. During the meeting, Lavelle handed Skatzes a note that said the hardliners were taking over. Lavelle told Skatzes to read that message to the negotiators, and Skatzes did so. Shortly thereafter, Durkin saw Lavelle enter the L-6 cellblock with four men wearing masks and dressed in white food-service uniforms. Durkin never saw Lavelle or the other men exit the L-6 cellblock and did not know what they had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 29} Brian Eskridge, an inmate at SOCF during the riot, testified that he talked to Lavelle following the April 14 media comments about inmate threats. Lavelle said, \u201cWe got to kill this [corrections officer]. We got to show them that we serious about * * * our problem, we have to get this 187\u201d (a slang term for murder). Later, Eskridge learned that Vallandingham had been killed. The next day, Lavelle had members of his security force beat Eskridge for not helping him \u201ccommit this 187.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">{\u00b6 30} Aaron Jefferson, a member of the Black Gangster Disciples, testified that he attended meetings with Lavelle during the riot. On April 13 or 14, Jefferson had a \u201cfalling out\u201d with Lavelle because Jefferson refused to follow Lavelle\u2019s orders about killing a corrections officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">{\u00b6 31} Finally, the defense played the tape and provided the transcript of tunnel tape 60, a recording of an inmate meeting on the morning of April 16. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the tape, the inmates discussed their grievances with the prison administration and their goals for the negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 32} During the meeting, Lavelle stated, \u201cYou must understand now where George, Robb and I, we have to concern ourselves now, with we\u2019re going to wind this thing up with our own safety, and especially with us keeping off that death row over there about that guard getting offed[.] I don\u2019t care about the inmates, cause they are going to say we did it, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>Trial Result</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 33} Were was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder. Count 1 charged Were with the aggravated murder of Vallandingham with prior calculation and design. Count 2 charged Were with the aggravated murder of Valland-ingham while committing kidnapping. Both counts contained death-penalty specifications for murder committed purposely and with prior calculation and design while a prisoner in a detention facility, R.C. 2929.04(A)(4), and murder committed purposely and with prior calculation and design while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 34} Were had been acquitted of two additional counts at his first trial; those charges were not part of his second trial. Count 5 charged Were with the separate offense of kidnapping with a specification of a prior conviction of an offense substantially equivalent to an aggravated felony of the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 35} Were pleaded not guilty to all charges. The jury found Were guilty of all charges, and he was sentenced to death. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">{\u00b6 36} <em>Competency to stand trial. </em>In propositions of law IX and X, Were argues that he was incompetent to stand trial and that the trial court\u2019s ruling that he was competent is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">{\u00b6 37} The trial court conducted two competency hearings. Before each of these hearings, Were refused to cooperate with psychologists sent to evaluate him. During the first competency hearing, Alan Barr, a correctional-program specialist at Lebanon Correctional Institution, testified as a state witness. Barr had numerous contacts with Were in prison. He testified that Were was always responsive and that Were understood the rules and regulations of prison life. Marva Allen, the manager of the isolation unit at Lebanon, testified that Were presented lucid arguments when talking about his rights and privileges and that he had never exhibited any bizarre thought patterns or behavior during their discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">{\u00b6 38} During the first hearing, the defense presented the testimony of three inmates: Daniel Coleman, Danny Grant, and John William Harris. Coleman assisted Were with adult education courses he was taking in prison. All three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>witnesses helped Were with his legal paperwork. They testified that Were had difficulty comprehending information and that explanations had to be repeated to him. Grant and Harris testified that they prepared legal motions for Were, and he would then copy them in his own handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 39} The defense also introduced the transcript of the hearing on Were\u2019s motion to dismiss counsel at his first trial. During that hearing, Were asserted a breakdown in communications, accused his counsel of trickery, and claimed that his counsel would not do what he asked. According to John Mackey, one of Were\u2019s attorneys at his first trial, Were believed that his counsel were in league with the state, and he would not talk to them. Mackey opined that Were suffers from paranoia. The defense also presented a collection of motions, pro se motions, and journal entries pertaining to Were\u2019s problems in cooperating with his attorneys during his first and second trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 40} The trial court ruled that Were was competent to stand trial. The trial court found that Were understood the nature and character of the charges against him and that he was capable of assisting counsel in his defense \u201cif he wishes to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 41} Less than two months later, the defense filed a new suggestion of incompetency. During the second competency hearing, Jacalyn McCullough, a teacher with the Ohio State Penitentiary, testified for the defense. Were had attended classes taught by McCullough for over a year while he was an inmate at the Ohio State Penitentiary in Youngstown. She testified that Were\u2019s reading was at a fourth- or fifth-grade level and that his math skills were at a third-grade level. Were was unsuccessful in moving to a pre-General Educational Development (\u201cGED\u201d) curriculum because he could not perform at a sixth-grade level. McCullough believes that if Were were in a normal school setting, he would be considered developmentally handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 42} Dr. David Hammer, a clinical psychologist, also testified for the defense. Hammer believed that Were was mildly mentally retarded and was not competent to stand trial. Hammer believed that Were\u2019s intellectual limitations would \u201cmake it very difficult for him to * * * confer with his counsel for the defense.\u201d Hammer\u2019s competency opinion was based on Were\u2019s cognitive limitations and his demonstrated pattern of paranoid thinking. Hammer\u2019s findings on Were\u2019s cognitive limitations were based on Were\u2019s IQ test scores of 69 when he was seven and 12 years old and McCullough\u2019s testimony that Were\u2019s reading comprehension was at the third-grade level. Hammer did not personally evaluate Were because Were refused to meet with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 43} The defense also presented Were\u2019s school records. These records show that Were did poorly in school and had an IQ of 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>{\u00b6 44} After the second hearing, the trial court again ruled that Were was competent to stand trial. In reviewing the evidence, the trial court stated that McCullough\u2019s testimony dealt with his intelligence level, not his competency. The trial court found that Hammer was not believable based on observing his testimony, his background (noting that Hammer failed his test for licensing in Ohio the first time), and how he arrived at his conclusions. The trial court also noted that Hammer did not interview Were.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 45} The test for determining whether a defendant is competent to stand trial is \u201c \u2018whether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 359, 650 N.E.2d 433, quoting <em>Dusky v. United States </em>(1960), 362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824. A defendant is presumed to be competent to stand trial, and the burden is on the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he is not competent. R.C. 2945.37(G); <em>State v. Jordan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 46} A trial court\u2019s finding that a defendant is competent to stand trial will not be disturbed when there is some reliable and credible evidence supporting those findings. <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 33; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 16, 19, 23 OBR 13, 490 N.E.2d 906. Deference on these issues should be given \u201cto those who see and hear what goes on in the courtroom.\u201d <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">{\u00b6 47} Were contends that the trial court\u2019s findings are flawed because testimony established that he could not understand and cooperate with his lawyers because of his paranoid distrust of them. But Were\u2019s paranoid behavior does not undermine the trial court\u2019s findings of his competence to stand trial. See <em>Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, at \u00b6 25-29. As noted in <em>State v. Bock </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 108, 110, 28 OBR 207, 502 N.E.2d 1016, \u201c[i]ncompetency must not be equated with mere mental or emotional instability or even outright insanity. A defendant may be emotionally disturbed or even psychotic and still be capable of understanding the charges against him and of assisting his counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6'48} Were argues that his paranoia was exacerbated because he is also mentally retarded. The trial court, however, made findings during a later portion of the trial that Were was not mentally retarded. Even assuming that these findings are incorrect, \u201c[mjentally retarded persons frequently * * * are competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Atkins v. Virginia </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 304, 318, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335. Thus, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>{\u00b6 49} Finally, Were argues that the trial court erred by disregarding Hammer\u2019s unrebutted expert testimony that Were was incompetent. <em>State v. Brown </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 133, 5 OBR 266, 449 N.E.2d 449. In <em>Brown, </em>three expert witnesses testified that the defendant met the criteria for legal insanity and three lay witnesses recounted the defendant\u2019s bizarre behavior during the relevant time period. Id. at 133-134, 5 OBR 266, 449 N.E.2d 449. The trial court found the defendant sane even though the state offered no rebuttal testimony indicating that the defendant was sane. Id. at 134, 5 OBR 266, 449 N.E.2d 449. We disagreed, holding that the trial court arbitrarily ignored expert testimony that the defendant was insane. Id. at 135, 5 OBR 266, 449 N.E.2d 449. Unlike <em>Brown, </em>the state in this case presented two witnesses testifying to Were\u2019s competency. Further, the trial court specifically concluded that Hammer\u2019s conclusions were not \u201cbelievable.\u201d <em>Brown </em>does not control our conclusion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 50} We also consider our recent decision in <em>State v. White, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 12, 2008-Ohio-1623, 885 N.E.2d 905, in resolving this issue. In <em>White, </em>both the state\u2019s and the defense\u2019s experts concluded that White was mentally retarded. Id. at \u00b629. The state also presented testimony from White\u2019s girlfriend, who testified that he worked and rented an apartment, and could cook, drive, and play games that required coordination. Id. at \u00b6 27. After considering the evidence, the trial court found that White had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he had significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills or \u201conset before the age of 18.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 33. Based on these findings, the trial court ruled that White had failed to establish that he was mentally retarded. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 51} The trial court in <em>White </em>rejected the experts\u2019 conclusion because it questioned the manner in which the experts administered and scored the Scales of Independent Behavior \u2014 Revised (\u201cSIB-R\u201d), which measures adaptive skills. Id. at \u00b6 35. The trial court also found that the testimony of White\u2019s girlfriend was inconsistent with retardation. Id. at \u00b6 39. We held that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that White had failed to prove the existence of significant adaptive-skills limitations. Id. at \u00b6 48. We concluded that the trial court had improperly disregarded expert opinion in reaching its findings and had overly relied on the girlfriend\u2019s observations. Id. at \u00b6 71-72. We also noted that the trial court made no findings that the experts lacked either credentials or credibility. Id. at \u00b6 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 52} The trial court in this case found that Dr. Hammer\u2019s expert opinion on competency was not credible based on \u201chis education, his experience, and * * * how he arrived at his opinions.\u201d The trial court\u2019s own observations of the defendant supported its conclusion that Were was competent to stand trial. Dr. Hammer testified that Were was incompetent because of his inability to cooper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ate with his counsel. That conclusion is undermined by several in-court statements made by Were and by the pro se motions filed by Were before the second competency hearing was completed. We conclude that the trial court could properly find that Were was capable of communicating with his lawyers when he wanted to do so. See <em>State v. Filiaggi </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 230, 237, 714 N.E.2d 867 (trial court\u2019s own observations of defendant and testimony of correctional officers showed that competency determination was not arbitrary).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 53} We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Were was competent to stand trial. The trial court\u2019s findings were based on the state\u2019s two witnesses, consideration of the defense evidence, and its own observations of the defendant. Thus, reliable and credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s decision. We reject propositions of law IX and X.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 54} <em>Disquali\u00f1cation of the trial judge. </em>In proposition of law XXV, Were contends that he was deprived of a fair and impartial judge because the judge also presided at the trial of a codefendant, Carlos Sanders. Because of the likelihood of bias, Were argues that the trial judge should have recused himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 55} During pretrial proceedings, Were addressed the court and asserted that the trial judge was prejudiced because he had been the judge at Sanders\u2019s trial. Were said he asked his counsel to file a motion to remove the sitting judge from his case. Trial counsel did not request the judge to recuse himself or file an affidavit of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">{\u00b6 56} Under R.C. 2701.03(A), when a party believes that the trial judge is biased, the proper avenue for redress is the filing of an affidavit of disqualification. See Section 5(C), Article TV, Ohio Constitution. \u201cAn affidavit of disqualification must be filed as soon as possible after the incident giving rise to the claim of bias and prejudice occurred or affiant becomes aware of circumstances that support disqualification. A party may be considered to have waived its objection to the judge when the objection is not raised in a timely fashion and the facts underlying the objection have been known to the party for some time.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Grady </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 1240, 1241, 674 N.E.2d 353. Because Were failed to file an affidavit of disqualification against the trial judge, he waived his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">{\u00b6 57} Were\u2019s allegations also lack merit. Were presents no evidence of judicial bias other than the trial court\u2019s previous participation as the judge at a codefendant\u2019s trial. A trial judge is not disqualified simply because he acquired knowledge of the facts during a prior proceeding. See <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 188, 616 N.E.2d 909. We reject proposition XXV.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">{\u00b6 58} <em>Batson challenges. </em>In proposition of law XXVIII, Were asserts that the prosecutor peremptorily challenged two African-American prospective jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>because of their race, in violation of his equal-protection rights under <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">{\u00b6 59} Initially, the state argues that this issue is moot because the two African-American jurors who were peremptorily challenged were alternate jurors who were never called upon to deliberate on the case. This same argument was rejected in <em>United States v. Harris </em>(C.A.6, 1999), 192 F.3d 580, 587-588. <em>Harris </em>held that alternate status is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to a <em>Batson </em>analysis because \u201cthe harm inherent in a discriminatorily chosen jury inures not only to the defendant, but also to the jurors not selected because of their race, and to the integrity of the judicial system as a whole.\u201d Id. Thus, this argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 60} Moreover, Were did not raise his <em>Batson </em>claim in the court of appeals. He has therefore waived the issue absent a showing of plain error. <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 80, 656 N.E.2d 643; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus; see Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c \u2018A court adjudicates a <em>Batson </em>claim in three steps.\u2019 <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 528, 747 N.E.2d 765. First, the opponent of the peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case of racial discrimination. Second, if the trial court finds this requirement fulfilled, the proponent of the challenge must provide a racially neutral explanation for the challenge. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96-98, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69. * * * Finally, the trial court must decide based on all the circumstances, whether the opponent has proved purposeful racial discrimination. Id. at 98, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69. See also <em>Purkett v. Elem </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 765, 767-768, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834. A trial court\u2019s finding of no discriminatory intent will not be reversed on appeal unless clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Hernandez </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 577, 583, 589 N.E.2d 1310, following <em>Hernandez v. New York </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 352, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395.\u201d <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 62} During the selection of alternate jurors, the prosecutor peremptorily challenged two African-American prospective jurors, West and Mitchell. Were\u2019s counsel objected to the state\u2019s peremptory challenge of both jurors as a <em>Batson </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 63} During voir dire, West had stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I could\u201d join a death verdict. West continued, \u201cI would feel funny about it. I just, it is just me. * * * I don\u2019t want to sentence anybody like that.\u201d After further questioning, West stated, \u201cIf I have to do it, I would do it.\u201d West\u2019s equivocal answers conveyed uncertainty about her ability to vote for the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 64} The prosecutor stated that he peremptorily challenged West because she said she had no opinion on the death penalty on her questionnaire. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>stated, \u2018When she was [questioned] by the Judge, it became very apparent that, in fact, she opposed the death penalty. Initially, it was almost like she couldn\u2019t even pass the <em>Witherspoon [v. Illinois </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776] test, but the Judge asked her and got her qualified. But it was obvious that she had serious problems with the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 65} Uncertainty about how a prospective juror perceives the death penalty is a \u201crace-neutral reason\u201d for exercising a peremptory challenge against her. See <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 437, 709 N.E.2d 140. The trial court concluded that the prosecutor had \u201casserted a race-neutral reason for [the] exercise of the peremptory\u201d challenge and rejected the <em>Batson </em>challenge. We find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 66} The prosecutor provided the following race-neutral explanation for peremptorily challenging prospective juror Mitchell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cFirst of all, Judge, just to make this short, I\u2019ll adopt everything that I said with regard to [West] because the same facts apply here. There is no opinion on the questionnaire, but when questioned by the Judge, it was obvious that she had some death penalty feelings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 68} \u2018We think that we\u2019re entitled to a jury that will fairly consider the death penalty. We don\u2019t believe that she\u2019s one. That\u2019s our reason for excusing her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjE5\">{\u00b6 69} Trial counsel challenged the state\u2019s explanation and asserted, \u201c[T]his is now the third African-American woman being excused from this jury. We think that it is a systematic exclusion of African-Americans * * In reply, the prosecutor stated, \u201cThis jury contains two black females and one black male. We have exercised our peremptories to excuse * * * three white people and three black people. We have done it because we felt that the people couldn\u2019t give us a fair jury.\u201d The trial court rejected the <em>Batson </em>challenge and found that the \u201cprosecutor has laid out a race-neutral reason for the excuse of Ms. Mitchell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A06\">{\u00b6 70} We conclude that no plain error was committed. Mitchell\u2019s answers about the death penalty in her questionnaire and during voir dire conveyed some uncertainty about her position on the death penalty. Mitchell\u2019s juror questionnaire shows that when asked, \u201cWhat is your opinion concerning Capital Punishment}?]\u201d Mitchell checked the block stating \u201cno opinion.\u201d During voir dire, Mitchell was asked for her views about capital punishment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cQ (trial court): [I]f the facts * * * would call for [the death penalty] and the law that would be given to you would permit it, could you join in a verdict with your other jurors knowing that your decision could result in the death of Mr. Were, the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cA: Yes, I think I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-12\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cQ: You think you could?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>{\u00b6 74} \u201cA: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 75} Other facts also point away from a racial motivation. The jury included two female and one male African-American jurors. Moreover, the state did not use two peremptory challenges that were available before the jury was selected. The presence of African-Americans on a jury certainly does not preclude a finding of discrimination, but \u201c \u2018the fact may be taken into account * * * as one that suggests that the government did not seek to rid the jury of persons [of a particular] race.\u2019 \u201d <em>White, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 438, 709 N.E.2d 140, quoting <em>United States v. Young-Bey </em>(C.A.8, 1990), 893 F.2d 178, 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 76} We conclude that Were has failed to demonstrate that the trial court committed plain error by overruling his <em>Batson </em>claim. We therefore overrule proposition of law XXVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 77} <em>Restrictions on voir dire. </em>In proposition of law XXXI, Were argues that the trial court improperly restricted defense questioning during voir dire examination. Were did not raise this claim in the court of appeals and therefore waived all but plain error. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cThe manner in which voir dire is to be conducted lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 418, 613 N.E.2d 212. \u201cAbsent a clear abuse of discretion, prejudicial error cannot be assigned to the examination of the venire.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">{\u00b6 79} Were asserts that the trial court unduly limited his counsel\u2019s efforts to identify prospective jurors who could not reasonably follow the law and consider the evidence during both phases of the proceedings. Were\u2019s claim is not supported by the record. Voir dire took four days and encompasses nearly 800 pages of transcript. Trial counsel were given extensive leeway in examining jurors about their willingness to consider the evidence, follow the court\u2019s instructions, and impose a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">{\u00b6 80} Were claims that the trial court precluded the defense from asking excused juror Lingo and seated juror Copeland about mental retardation. The trial court did not permit Lingo to be questioned about his willingness to consider mental retardation as a mitigating factor. Parties in a capital case are not entitled to ask about specific mitigating factors during voir dire. <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 338, 744 N.E.2d 1163. The trial court precluded Copeland from answering a question about the minimum age for imposing the death penalty. This question is not relevant to mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">{\u00b6 81} Were also argues that the trial court improperly precluded questioning about the burden of proof in the sentencing phase. During voir dire of Lingo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>trial counsel stated, \u201c[I]f he was convicted * * * they\u2019re still going to have to prove * * * that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating.\u201d The trial court interrupted counsel and said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know what an aggravating circumstance is, what is going to outweigh a mitigating factor. * * * You can\u2019t have him answer it.\u201d The trial court exercised appropriate discretion. Indeed, \u201cweighing aggravating circumstances against mitigating factors is a complex process. * * * Realistically, jurors cannot be asked to weigh specific factors until they have heard all the evidence and been fully instructed on the applicable law.\u201d <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 481, 653 N.E.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 82} Next, Were claims that the trial court erred by not permitting trial counsel to mention that the defense could not offer plea bargains to inmate witnesses, as the prosecution could. During voir dire of seated juror Erndt, the trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection to trial counsel\u2019s statement, \u201cI can tell you, by the same token, that the witnesses for the defense are basically going to be convicted felons who were inmates at Lucasville at the time of the riot. * * * I can also promise you that the defense witnesses didn\u2019t get any plea bargains in return for their testimony.\u201d Trial counsel was not asking a question but making a statement about witness credibility. Also, there was no prejudice because counsel later asked Erndt if she could judge credibility based upon the witnesses\u2019 bias and motive to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 83} Were also contends that the trial court erred by not allowing trial counsel to ask excused juror Garrett and excused alternate Smith whether they would vote for death if Were were found guilty of intentional murder. During Garrett\u2019s voir dire, the trial court did not allow trial counsel to ask, \u201cSo what we want to know is if you have made that determination, * * * that there was an intentional killing * * * in a prison facility, I don\u2019t need to hear any more \u2014 death penalty?\u201d Garrett had previously expressed her willingness to consider the facts, follow the judge\u2019s instructions, and consider all sentence options. Thus, the trial court could limit repetition of the same type of questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 84} The trial court curtailed questioning of Smith about imposing the death penalty for an intentional killing because \u201che doesn\u2019t know what an intentional killing is. * * * That\u2019s a legal definition.\u201d No possible prejudice resulted because the trial court rephrased the question, and Smith stated that he would not automatically vote for the death penalty and would consider life-sentence options if Were were found guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 85} Finally, Were complains that the trial court improperly precluded the defense from asking seated jurors Birri and Nie about procedural issues. The trial court did not allow counsel to discuss the differences between grand jury and trial procedures with Birri, who had previously served on a grand jury. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>trial court also did not allow counsel to inform Nie that the jury would be conducting a jury view of the Lucasville prison. The trial court acted properly in each instance because the subject matter of such questioning was outside the scope of voir dire. See <em>State v. Durr </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 89, 568 N.E.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 86} We find that the trial court committed no plain error in restricting trial counsel\u2019s questioning during voir dire. Thus, we overrule proposition of law XXXI.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 87} <em>Jury view. </em>In proposition of law XXXII, Were argues that the trial court violated his due-process rights by not allowing him to be present at the jury view of the crime scene. Were did not raise this claim in the court of appeals and has therefore waived all but plain error. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 0.0.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus; see Crim.R. 52(B). In a pretrial motion, the defense requested that the court grant a jury view of the crime scene at the prison. In ruling on the motion, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cThe court: Would your client waive his presence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cThe defendant: Well, I\u2019d like to be present so I can share a thought with my attorneys about the situation down there. They might like\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cThe court: I won\u2019t grant that view of the scene if you want to be present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cMs. Agar (defense counsel): My understanding is if you \u2014 if that\u2019s the only way we can have the view of the scene, you\u2019re willing to waive your presence, is that correct, in order for the jury to be able to see the scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cThe defendant: Yeah, if that\u2019s the only way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cThe court: That\u2019s the only way, if you waive your presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-13\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cAll right. The record will show the defendant has waived his presence at the view of the scene.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">{\u00b6 95} R.C. 2945.16 provides: \u201cWhen it is proper for the jurors to have a view of the place at which a material fact occurred, the trial court may order them to be conducted in a body * * * to such place, which shall be shown to them by a person designated by the court. * * * The accused has the right to attend such view by the jury, but may waive such right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">{\u00b6 96} Were challenges the validity of his waiver because the trial court compelled the waiver as a condition of holding the jury view. He argues that such waiver is improper because his presence was a constitutionally protected right. Although Were has a statutory right to be present at the jury view, he does not have a constitutional right to be there. In <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts </em>(1934), 291 U.S. 97, 122, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674, the Supreme Court held that denial of a defendant\u2019s presence at a jury view did not violate due process. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>Snyder </em>court recognized that \u201cthe presence of a defendant [in a felony prosecution] is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only.\u201d Id. at 107-108, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 97} We conclude that the trial court did not commit plain error in granting the defense request for a jury view conditioned on Were\u2019s agreement to waive his presence. Were waived his right to attend the jury view in open court and in the presence of counsel. Moreover, trial counsel did not object to Were\u2019s waiver of his presence as a condition to the jury view.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 98} In addition, Were cannot show that he was materially prejudiced by his absence from the jury view. His counsel were present, and there is no indication in the record that anything improper occurred at the jury view. Were told the trial court that he wanted to attend the jury view to tell his attorneys \u201cabout the situation down there,\u201d but he did not explain how his presence at the scene would have provided his attorneys with information that they could not have gained by consulting Were before or after the visit. See <em>State v. Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, \u00b6 70 (holding that a trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the defendant to attend the jury view was not prejudicial). Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition of law XXXII.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 99} In proposition of law XXIX, Were argues that he was denied a fair trial because the trial judge went on the bus with the jury when they visited the prison. Were did not object at trial to the judge\u2019s decision to ride on the bus and thereby waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus. Were also did not raise this argument in the court of appeals and waived this claim but for plain error. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 100} No plain error occurred. On the day before the jury view, the trial court discussed the arrangements with the jurors for the two and one-half hour bus ride to Lucasville. Outside the presence of the jury, the judge later stated, \u201cI am going to go on the bus and I\u2019ll bring reading material.\u201d No further mention about the bus ride appears in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">{\u00b6 101} Were asserts that he was denied a fair trial because of the likelihood of unauthorized communications between the judge and the jurors during the long bus ride. There is no evidence, however, of any improper communications between the judge and jury during the bus ride or the jury view. Accordingly, we reject proposition of law XXIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">{\u00b6 102} <em>Stun belt. </em>In proposition of law XXVI, Were contends that the trial court erred by requiring him to wear a stun belt without first conducting a hearing to justify the use of this restraint. In a pretrial motion, Were requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>to appear at all proceedings without restraints. The trial court granted the motion to appear without restraints but allowed the use of a stun belt. The record does not show that the court heard evidence to justify the use of the stun belt, and the court did not state its reasons for allowing its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 103} A trial court can require the use of stun belts when the prosecution justifies their use on the record. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 210, 2006-Ohio-6404, 858 N.E.2d 1144, \u00b6 242. The defense did not object to the trial court\u2019s ruling permitting a stun belt and did not request a hearing on the matter. Failure to object waived the error, requiring the defendant to show that he was prejudiced by wearing the belt. Id. at \u00b6 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 104} In pro se filings, Were complains that he was required to wear a stun belt throughout the trial. Were does not claim that the device caused him any physical discomfort or interfered with his ability to communicate with counsel. Moreover, the record contains no indication that the jury knew or could see that Were was wearing a stun belt. Accordingly, we find that defendant was not prejudiced, and overrule proposition of law XXVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 105} <em>Admissibility of tunnel tapes. </em>In proposition of law XVIII, Were argues that the trial court erred by overruling the defense motion to suppress the tape recordings of inmate conversations (\u201ctunnel tapes\u201d) that the FBI recorded during the riot. On April 13, 1993, FBI Agent Marc Hopper installed small microphones in the tunnels underneath L-Block to monitor and record inmate conversations. Were\u2019s discussions with inmate leaders were recorded on April 15 and April 17. No warrant was ever issued for the interception of these conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 106} Were argues that the state was not allowed to intercept the inmates\u2019 conversations without obtaining advance consent from some party to the interception or obtaining a warrant as required by former R.C. 2933.51 et seq., Am.Sub. S.B. No. 222,141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 457. We rejected the same claim in <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 65-66, 723 N.E.2d 1019, another case stemming from the Lucasville riot.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 107} <em>Robb </em>held that federal, not state, law controlled the legality of the intercepts. Id. at 66, 723 N.E.2d 1019. FBI agents, acting under the authority of federal law, installed and monitored the electronic interception and recording devices that were used inside the prison. We explained that \u201c[fjederal law explicitly defines 'oral communications\u2019 as only those 'exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 66-67, 723 N.E.2d 1019, quoting Section 2510(2), Title 18, U.S.Code. We explained that the rioting inmates had no expectation of privacy in their cells. Id. at 67, 723 N.E.2d 1019. Based on <em>Robb, </em>we conclude that the conversations of the rioting inmates introduced during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Were\u2019s trial were not \u201coral communications\u201d entitled to protection under federal law. Accordingly, proposition of law XVIII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 108} <em>Admissibility of inaudible tapes, transcripts, and hearsay. </em>In proposition of law XIX, Were argues that the trial court erred by admitting inaudible tapes of discussions between Were and inmate leaders and by permitting the jury to receive transcripts of those tapes. He also claims that the tapes and transcripts contained inadmissible hearsay. Were argues that the trial court should not have admitted the audiotapes because they were inaudible and could not be understood without the transcripts. Highway Patrol Sergeant Howard Hudson described tunnel tape 61, which recorded the April 15 meeting, as being of poor quality: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of clanging and banging in the background. But as far as the voices, most of what is on there can be intelligible.\u201d Hudson testified that tunnel tape 32 is \u201ca little clearer * * * [but] these tapes contain a lot of background noise that requires a lot of intense listening to make out what\u2019s being said.\u201d Over defense objection, the trial court admitted the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 109} To be admissible, a tape recording must be authentic, accurate, and trustworthy. <em>State v. Rogan </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 140, 148, 640 N.E.2d 535. The decision to admit tape recordings that are partly inaudible is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 129, 141, 707 N.E.2d 476. Snodgrass, who was present at the April 15 meeting, authenticated tunnel tape 61 and interpreted its contents. Williams authenticated tunnel tape 32. Were had full opportunity to cross-examine Snodgrass and Williams about the conversations on the tapes. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the tapes despite the background noises and disjointed and multiple conversations. Moreover, we held that the same audiotapes were admissible in <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 72-73, 723 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 110} Were also argues that the trial court erred by allowing the jury to use transcripts as an aid in listening to the tunnel tapes. Hudson testified that state\u2019s exhibits 6-A and 8-A are \u201cfair, true and accurate copies of what is being said on the tape.\u201d Hudson testified that investigators and prosecutors listened to the tapes and prepared the transcripts. Inmates Snodgrass, Williams, and David Lomache identified the voices on the tapes when the transcripts were prepared. The preparation of the transcripts was an ongoing, lengthy process that occurred throughout the investigation and the other hearings and trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 111} Trial counsel objected to the transcripts, state\u2019s exhibits 6-A and 8-A, and argued that the transcripts did not accurately reflect what was said on the tapes. After the defense objection, the trial court had the court reporter listen to the tapes and prepare another transcript of them. The court reporter spent the weekend transcribing the tapes. On the following Monday, the court reporter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>stated that due to time constraints and equipment problems, she was unable to complete an accurate transcription of the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">{\u00b6 112} Following his discussion with the court reporter, the trial judge ruled that state\u2019s exhibits 6-A and 8-A could be used as listening aids. The trial court also stated that the jury would be instructed that the \u201cevidence consists of the tapes themselves. The transcripts are provided to you only for the purpose of helping you understand the tapes, if you find they do help you. If you find there is a difference or discrepancy between the transcript and the tapes, you are to rely only on the tapes.\u201d Such instructions were provided to the jury when they were presented with the tapes and transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cWhere there are no \u2018material differences\u2019 between a tape admitted into evidence and a transcript given to the jury as a listening aid, there is no prejudicial error.\u201d <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 445, 588 N.E.2d 819, quoting <em>State v. Holmes </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 44, 50, 521 N.E.2d 479. Moreover, providing a jury with a transcript as a listening aid is permissible when the trial court instructs the jury, as it did in this case, that the transcript is not evidence. <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 159, 694 N.E.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 114} Hudson\u2019s testimony established that the transcripts are fair and accurate renditions of the conversations on the tapes. The trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that the tapes were evidence and the transcripts were not. Were\u2019s claim that there are material differences between the tapes and transcripts is not substantiated. He contends that there are differences because the transcripts have been constantly changed over a ten-year period of time, but he fails to identify any of those differences. We conclude that this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 115} Finally, Were argues that the trial court erred in admitting the two tunnel tapes, state\u2019s exhibits 6 and 8, and a negotiation tape, state\u2019s exhibit 7, because the inmate discussion on the tapes was hearsay. Were did not raise this issue in the court of appeals, and therefore waived all but plain error. <em>Williams, 51 </em>Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 116} Under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e), hearsay does not include a statement offered against a party that is made \u201cby a co-conspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy upon independent proof of the conspiracy.\u201d \u201cThe statement of a co-conspirator is not admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e) until the proponent of the statement has made a prima facie showing of the existence of the conspiracy by independent proof.\u201d <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 651 N.E.2d 965, paragraph three of the syllabus. Evid.R. 802(D)(2)(e) does not require that explicit findings of the conspiracy be made on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 117} The prosecution established that the Lucasville takeover involved a major conspiracy by inmate gang leaders. Williams testified about the takeover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>of L-Block, the kidnapping of Vallandingham, the inmate gangs involved in the riot, and the identities of the gang\u2019s leaders, including Were. Hudson provided an in-depth overview of the riot and described how the leaders of three gangs were jointly involved during the negotiations. Thus, Hudson\u2019s and Williams\u2019s testimony provided the required preliminary prima facie showing of the conspiracy. Moreover, we held that similar testimony established such a conspiracy in <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 69, 723 N.E.2d 1019, and in <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 102-103. We reject proposition of law XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 118} <em>Defense\u2019s excluded evidence. </em>In proposition of law XX, Were argues that the trial court erred by excluding Aaron Jefferson\u2019s testimony that Lavelle attempted to recruit Jefferson to kill Vallandingham. Were also argues that the trial court erred by excluding a negotiation tape that contained police discussions about Lavelle\u2019s role in the riot.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 119} 1. Lavelle\u2019s statements. During the defense case, Jefferson, a member of the Black Gangster Disciples, testified that Lavelle approached him about killing a corrections officer during the riot. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection when trial counsel asked Jefferson to explain what Lavelle had said to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 120} At the conclusion of the defense case, trial counsel proffered the excluded testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">{\u00b6 121} \u201cMr. Wenke (defense counsel): Judge, I have one other proffer that I wanted to make * * * and that was in regard to the witness, Aaron Jefferson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 122} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">{\u00b6 123} \u201cThe statement would have been from Lavelle, that he approached Aaron Jefferson and asked him about killing a CO [corrections officer] because of the spokesperson. He wanted him to be the BGD killer, which is Black Gangster Disciple. He refused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">{\u00b6 124} \u201cA few hours later, he heard the announcement of the death. Lavelle would have been in charge of getting rid of the bloody clothes and weapons and giving fresh clothes and that he was going to burn the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">{\u00b6 125} The prosecutor informed the trial court that \u201cLavelle is up at Warren right now. I could have him down here at 1 o\u2019clock.\u201d The defense did not respond to the prosecutor\u2019s offer, and Lavelle was not called as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">{\u00b6 126} Were argues that Jefferson\u2019s excluded testimony was admissible as statement against penal interest under Evid.R. 804(B)(3). In order for a declarant\u2019s statement to qualify as an Evid.R. 804(B) exception to the hearsay rule, it must first be shown that the declarant is unavailable as a witness. See <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 58, 752 N.E.2d 904; <em>State v. Burke </em>(1995), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>73 Ohio St.3d 399, 403, 653 N.E.2d 242. Were does not claim, and nothing in the record indicates, that Lavelle was unavailable as a witness. Indeed, the prosecutor informed the court that Lavelle could be brought to court that afternoon. Accordingly, Jefferson\u2019s testimony about what Lavelle said to him was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 127} Were also argues that the exclusion of Lavelle\u2019s statement denied him the due-process right to present a defense. This argument has no merit. At most, the excluded testimony showed that Lavelle wanted Jefferson to murder Vallandingham, but Jefferson refused to follow Lavelle\u2019s orders. Thus, the excluded testimony provides no evidence that another person might have killed Vallandingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 128} 2. Negotiators\u2019 audiotaped discussions. Were argues that the trial court erred by excluding police discussions about Lavelle\u2019s role that were recorded on a negotiation tape. This issue was not raised in the court of appeals; therefore, this claim is waived absent plain error. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 129} Inmate Skatzes\u2019s April 15 telephone conversation with police negotiators on negotiation tape 6 was presented during the state\u2019s case. During Hudson\u2019s cross-examination, trial counsel sought to play negotiation tape 6 in its entirety, including internal discussions among the police about the Muslims and Lavelle. Trial counsel stated that the police comments show that Lavelle was the person referred to as the hardliner on the tunnel tapes. The excluded comments include \u201cwonder if that\u2019s just a bunch a blow about the Muslim stuff,\u201d \u201ctry to put it off on the Muslims,\u201d and \u201cit comes right back to Lavelle again; it sounds just like him.\u201d The state objected to the introduction of taped segments of the police negotiators\u2019 internal discussions. The trial court ruled that the entire version of negotiation tape 6 could be played except for the police negotiators\u2019 internal discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 130} We find that no plain error occurred. Were has failed to establish the relevance of the negotiators\u2019 fragmented and speculative comments about Lavelle. Thus, we reject proposition of law XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 131} <em>Sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence. </em>In proposition of law XVII, Were argues that his convictions for the aggravated murder and kidnapping of Vallandingham were based on insufficient evidence and were against the weight of the evidence. Pursuant to R.C. 2953.02, we can overturn a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence in a capital case only when the crime was committed after January 1, 1995. <em>Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 134. Because the crimes in this case occurred before 1995, we will not address Were\u2019s weight-of-the-evidence argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ments. Rather, we will consider these arguments in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 132} In reviewing a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. \u201c[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 133} The state presented extensive evidence showing that Were kidnapped Vallandingham. Macko testified that he observed Were and other inmates break down the bathroom door and seize Vallandingham at the start of the riot. Macko and Williams then watched Were and other inmates take Vallandingham in handcuffs from the L-l bathroom to the L-6 block. There was also ample evidence that Were murdered Vallandingham. During a recorded meeting of inmate leaders on April 15, Were described himself as a \u201chardliner.\u201d He told the other inmate leaders, \u201cWe give [the authorities] a certain time * * *. If [the water and power are] not on in a certain time, that\u2019s when a body goes out.\u201d Snodgrass testified that before the meeting concluded, Were voted to kill a corrections officer if inmate demands were not met. Williams testified that after the meeting, Were said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it, I will take care of it. The hardliners is taking over. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 134} Later on April 15, Taylor saw Were and another inmate remove Vallandingham from his cell and walk him to the end of the L-6 block. Sims testified that as he walked past the L-6 shower, he saw Were looking into the shower while two other inmates were strangling Vallandingham inside the shower. Were then ordered Sims and other inmates to carry Vallandingham\u2019s body into the recreation yard. Williams testified that several months after the murder, Were told him, \u201cI think they know I killed that guard.\u201d Austin also testified that in 2001, Were confided in him that he \u201ckidnapped, robbed and killed Officer Vallandingham.\u201d Finally, Piepmeier testified that during the trial of another inmate, Were \u201cindicated that he was present in L-6 when Officer Vallandingham was murdered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 135} Were argues that the testimony is unreliable because all the eyewitnesses were inmates who received favorable treatment in exchange for their testimony. He also argues that many of the witnesses lack credibility because they were also guilty of aggravated murder. This contention calls for an evaluation of the witnesses\u2019 credibility, which is not proper on review of evidentia-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ry sufficiency. <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 200; <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 136} Were also argues that his \u201cmere presence\u201d in the company of others who killed Vallandingham does not establish his guilt. Were was not an innocent bystander when Vallandingham was killed. He advocated killing a corrections officer and voted to do so. Subsequently, Were orchestrated Vallandingham\u2019s murder by removing Vallandingham from his cell, taking him to the shower area, and overseeing the inmates who killed him. Were\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 137} Finally, Were argues that the evidence showed the likelihood that Lavelle killed Vallandingham. Were points out that Eskridge and Jefferson testified that Lavelle wanted them to kill Vallandingham. He also emphasizes that Durkin saw Lavelle and four inmates wearing masks and dressed in white food-service uniforms enter the L-6 cellblock before Vallandingham was killed. Nevertheless, Eskridge and Jefferson refused to murder Vallandingham, and there is no evidence that Lavelle and the other inmates entered the L-6 cellblock to kill Vallandingham. Thus, we find that Were\u2019s claim that Lavelle was the killer is unsupported by the evidence. Based on the foregoing, proposition of law XVII is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 138} <em>Instructions. </em>In proposition of law XXII, Were argues that the trial court\u2019s instructions on accomplice testimony were deficient. Were contends that the instructions omitted language that more than silence, presence, or acquiescence is necessary to make one an aider or abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 139} The trial court\u2019s instructions on aiding and abetting include the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 140} \u201cAn individual is an accomplice if he aids, if he supports, if he assists, if he encourages, if he cooperates with, if he advises, or if he incites, urges, the principal offender in the commission of the crime; and also, if he shares the criminal intent of the principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">{\u00b6 141} \u201cHowever, mere association with the principal or presence at the scene of the crime, that is not enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">{\u00b6 142} \u201cRather, the State must establish that this defendant took some affirmative action to assist, encourage, or participate in the crime by some act of his, by some word of his, or by some gesture of his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">{\u00b6 143} \u201cParticipation with a criminal intent may be inferred by you from the defendant\u2019s action, by the defendant\u2019s presence, by the defendant\u2019s companionship and conduct, either before or after the commission of the particular offense involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>{\u00b6 144} These instructions make it clear that mere association or presence is not enough to make one an aider or abettor. Because these instructions were proper, proposition of law XXII is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 145} In proposition of law XXVII, Were argues that the trial court erred by failing to properly instruct the jury on venue. During guilt-phase jury instructions, the trial court stated to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 146} \u201cBefore we go into the crimes themselves, there are certain things that should be established in the case. One is that whatever happened happened between April 11th and April 21st of 1993, and also that the Southern Ohio Correctional Institution is located in Sciot[o] County, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 147} \u201cFor the purposes of this trial, you and I are in Sciotfo] County, Ohio. This ease has been transferred from that community to this community because, obviously, they could not handle it. It is a very small county, and also that\u2019s where the prison is located and a lot of people work there in the prison who live in Sciot[o] County. So that\u2019s why it was legally transferred from Scioto County to here in Hamilton County, but we are to assume that we are in the footsteps of Scioto County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 148} Were argues that this flawed instruction relieved the state of its burden of proof as to venue. Were never objected at trial to these instructions and thereby waived all but plain error. <em>Childs, </em>14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus. Were also did not raise this issue in the court of appeals and waived this claim. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 149} \u201cAlthough it is not a material element of the offense charged, venue is a fact which must be proved in criminal prosecutions unless it is waived by the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Headley </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 475, 477, 6 OBR 526, 453 N.E.2d 716. \u201cThe standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt, although venue need not be proved in express terms so long as it is established by all the facts and circumstances in the case.\u201d Id., citing <em>State v. Dickerson </em>(1907), 77 Ohio St. 34, 82 N.E. 969, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">{\u00b6 150} We find no plain error. The evidence established that Were\u2019s offenses occurred at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility at Lucasville, and Hudson testified that the Lucasville prison was located in Scioto County. Thus, venue was proven by the testimony, facts, and circumstances of this case. Accordingly, proposition of law XXVII is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">{\u00b6 151} <em>Jury question. </em>In proposition of law XXI, Were argues that during deliberations, the trial court incorrectly answered a jury question about inferences. During guilt-phase deliberations, the jury wrote the following note to the trial court:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>{\u00b6 152} \u201cInference was discussed under the \u2018aggravated murder of Vallanding-ham during the kidnapping of Vallandingham,\u2019 under the section that explains and discusses purpose. (It was only under \u2018purpose\u2019 that inference was discussed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 153} \u201cCan we infer/use inference for all of the charges and apply inference to any charge, or to any definition? And use inference at any time to come to a decision or verdict?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 154} After consulting both parties, the trial court provided the jury with the following explanation:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 155} \u201cYou have my instructions in writing, and if you want to look at them, at the beginning of the instructions, I told you that evidence may be of two kinds; direct or circumstantial or a combination of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 156} \u201cDirect evidence is the testimony of a witness who has actually seen or heard those things that he or she tells you about and includes the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">{\u00b6 157} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">{\u00b6 158} \u201cCircumstantial evidence is the proof of facts by direct evidence and from which you may infer or deduce other reasonable or logical conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">{\u00b6 159} \u201cSo you may reasonably infer, if you care to do so, all of the evidence in this trial * * *. But if you do make that inference, the inference that you end up with must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. But, yes, the answer to your question is, can we infer/use inference for all of the charges and apply inference to any charge and any definition and use inference at any time to come to a decision or verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">{\u00b6 160} \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">{\u00b6 161} Were claims that these instructions permitted the jury to infer that he had a purpose to kill because the actual killers had such a purpose and thus they attributed to him an intent and purpose harbored by someone else. We conclude that these instructions do not convey that meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">{\u00b6 162} The trial court\u2019s answer explained the use of inferences in considering circumstantial evidence. The trial court\u2019s further explanation (e.g., \u201cyou may reasonably infer, if you care to do so, all the evidence in this trial\u201d) referred to the jury\u2019s consideration of inferences as to all the charges. The trial court then properly cautioned the jurors that proof beyond a reasonable doubt was necessary if they relied on such inferences. The trial court committed no error in answering the jury\u2019s question. Thus, proposition of law XXI is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-15\">\n<em>Penalty-Phase Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-16\">{\u00b6 163} <em>Mental retardation. </em>In propositions of law IV and V, Were argues that the trial court\u2019s finding that he is not mentally retarded is unsupported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the evidence. After the jury found Were guilty of kidnapping and murder, the trial court held a hearing to address defense claims that Were was mentally retarded and, therefore, not subject to a death sentence. See <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 164} During the mental-retardation hearing, Were presented the transcript from Were\u2019s competency hearings of the previous testimony of inmates Coleman, Grant, and Harris. All three witnesses were in prison with Were at various times and locations. Coleman helped Were with courses he was taking, and they all helped Were with his legal paperwork. All three testified that Were had trouble comprehending and remembering information. Grant and Harris drafted legal motions that Were would then copy in his own handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 165} The defense also presented the testimony from the competency proceeding of Jacalyn McCullough, a teacher with the Ohio State Penitentiary. McCullough had taught Were adult basic education courses while he was a prisoner. Were was described as a hard-working student who had trouble comprehending and retaining abstract concepts. McCullough believed that Were would be considered developmentally handicapped in a normal school setting and would test below a 70 IQ. McCullough\u2019s testimony indicates that Were had trouble dealing with money and was unable to make change in his head. In McCullough\u2019s opinion, Were was capable of working at a \u201cvery low functioning\u201d job.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 166} In addition, the defense presented Were\u2019s school records, which showed that he was a very poor student. -The records show that Were took the Stanford-Binet IQ test when he was seven (in 1964) and 12 years old (in 1969)' and received a score of 69 each time. The school report that accompanied the 1964 IQ results described Were as \u201cfunctioning in the slow learner range of mental ability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">{\u00b6 167} Dr. Hammer, a clinical psychologist and mental-retardation expert, testified for the defense. Hammer\u2019s evaluation was based on his review of witness testimony and Were\u2019s records because Were refused to meet with him. Hammer stated that Were\u2019s IQ score of 69 was within the range of mild mental retardation. Hammer testified that based on McCullough\u2019s testimony, he thought that Were had subaverage ability in several adaptive behaviors. Hammer pointed to Were\u2019s deficiencies in functional academic skills, his employment history of closely supervised menial jobs, and money-management difficulties as shown by Were\u2019s inability to make change for a dollar in his head. Hammer concluded that Were was at the \u201chigh end of mild mental retardation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">{\u00b6 168} Dr. Timothy Rheinscheld, a clinical psychologist, testified that Were \u201cmeets the diagnostic criteria for mental retardation.\u201d Rheinscheld did not personally evaluate Were but reviewed Were\u2019s records and McCullough\u2019s testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ny. Rheinscheld testified that Were \u201creceived an IQ score of 69, which is below the cut off of 70 for mental retardation.\u201d Rheinscheld found significant limitations in Were\u2019s learning ability resulting from his failure at \u201cdifferent opportunities to try to learn and read.\u201d He also found significant limitations in Were\u2019s social skills because \u201con several occasions he assaulted other people while he was in prison.\u201d Rheinscheld also noted deficiencies in Were\u2019s money-management skills based on his inability \u201cto really add and subtract very well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">{\u00b6 169} During cross-examination, Hammer and Rheinscheld testified that the cutoff score for mental retardation on the widely used Wechsler IQ test was 70. They also testified that the cutoff score for mental retardation was 68 on the Stanford-Binet IQ test. Both experts acknowledged that claims of cultural bias had been made against the Stanford-Binet test, which Were took as a child. These charges led to the adoption of the adaptive-behavior aspect of the mental-retardation definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 170} Dr. W. Michael Nelson, a clinical psychologist, testified as the state\u2019s expert. Were refused to meet with Nelson. Nelson concluded that Were was not mentally retarded after reviewing Were\u2019s records and testimony from his competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 171} Nelson testified that Were\u2019s score of 69 on the Stanford-Binet tests does not show that he is mentally retarded. Nelson stated that a score of 68 on the Stanford-Binet IQ test equates to a 70 on the Wechsler IQ test. He explained that mental retardation is shown by IQ scores that are two standard deviations below the mean. While the Wechsler and Stanford-Binet tests utilize a mean IQ score of 100, the Wechsler scale uses a standard deviation of 15 and the Stanford-Binet uses a standard deviation of 16. Thus, a person reported as being two standard deviations below the mean would have different scores on the Wechsler and the Stanford-Binet scales.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 172} Nelson did not find that Were had significant limitations in adaptive functioning. Nelson testified that evaluations of Were\u2019s employment skills needed to consider Were\u2019s prison jobs as well as any jobs he held prior to going into prison. Nelson stated that Were\u2019s employment history before prison showed a \u201csomewhat stable work functioning over three years, the longest being about a year where he was hauling trash.\u201d Nelson also testified that Were\u2019s membership in the Muslim prison gang provided evidence of his ability to \u201cfunction within groups * * * that would demonstrate * * * some skill in terms of * * * daily living skills.\u201d Further, Nelson testified that notwithstanding the help Were received from other inmates, Were \u201cseems to be able to write, to comprehend the impact of some of these statements, and to use this as a way of trying to influence or explain * * * his present position.\u201d Nelson also testified that Were\u2019s difficulty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>in making change was an insufficient basis for concluding that he had a serious deficiency in family-living skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 173} At the completion of the hearing, the trial court found that Were had not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he is mentally retarded. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court found that Nelson was \u201cthe most reliable of the three psychologists that were appointed.\u201d The trial court noted that Were \u201chas been uncooperative throughout this entire proceedings. He\u2019s refused to have himself tested [or] examined.\u201d The trial court stated that there is no way to determine Were\u2019s true IQ score because his IQ test was deemed culturally biased in the 1960s, and the bias would tend to lower the score. In his written findings, the trial court concluded, \u201cThe IQ tests taken by defendant at ages seven (1964) and twelve (1969) resulted in a true score of 70, with a five point margin of error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 174} The trial court also found that Were did not have significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court noted that Were \u201crose to leadership positions in prison\u201d and was \u201carticulate in court and wrote and presented numerous motions.\u201d The trial court also found that Were\u2019s \u201c \u2018maladaptive behavior\u2019 could [have] easily resulted from a sociopathic personality as from an intellectual limitation,\u201d and \u201c[s]ince defendant has spent most of his life in prisons his employment history is limited.\u201d The trial court concluded that Were has \u201cno significant limitations in communication, daily living skills and socialization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">{\u00b6 175} In <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335, the United States Supreme Court held that executing a mentally retarded person violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Atkins </em>did not establish procedures for determining whether an individual is mentally retarded. Rather, the Supreme Court left it to the states to develop \u201c \u2018appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon [their] execution of sentences.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 317, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335, quoting <em>Ford v. Wainwright </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 399, 416-417, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">{\u00b6 176} In <em>State v. Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, we set forth the \u201csubstantive standards and procedural guidelines\u201d for determining mental retardation in Ohio. Id. at \u00b6 11. <em>Lott </em>adopted clinical definitions of mental retardation, cited with approval in <em>Atkins </em>for evaluating an individual\u2019s claim of mental retardation. Id. at \u00b6 12. <em>Lott </em>holds that the defendant must raise and prove mental retardation by presenting evidence that he or she (1) suffers from \u201csignificantly subaverage intellectual functioning,\u201d (2) experienced \u201csignificant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such as communication, self-care, and self-direction,\u201d and (3) manifested \u201conset before the age of 18.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">{\u00b6 177} Nelson\u2019s testimony and Were\u2019s school records support the trial court\u2019s findings that Were is not mentally retarded. Nelson testified that Were\u2019s score <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>of 69 on the Stanford-Binet IQ test was not indicative of mental retardation. Moreover, Were\u2019s school records, completed at the time of his first IQ test, stated that Were was functioning in the \u201cslow learner\u201d range of mental ability, not that he was mentally retarded. Nelson\u2019s testimony showed that Were failed to prove that he suffered significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills. Nelson noted that Were was an active member of the Muslim prison gang, was able to comprehend the impact of his statements, and was involved in writing motions to the court. In contrast, defense experts relied primarily on McCullough\u2019s anecdotal testimony about Were\u2019s money-management skills and failed to take into account all the evidence about Were\u2019s employment history.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">{\u00b6 178} Were argues that the trial court erred by ignoring defense experts. He also asserts that Nelson\u2019s opinion was discredited during defense cross-examination. The weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the expert witnesses are primarily for the trier of the fact. <em>State v. Nemeth </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 202, 211, 694 N.E.2d 1332. Thus, the trial court could rely on Nelson\u2019s testimony and other evidence in finding that Were failed to meet his burden of proving that he is mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">{\u00b6 179} Were also claims that the trial court\u2019s finding that he is not mentally retarded must be reversed because his IQ scores were below 70. <em>Lott </em>states that there is a rebuttable presumption that a person is not mentally retarded if his or her IQ is above 70. <em>Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, at \u00b6 12. Nothing in <em>Lott, </em>however, states that a capital defendant must be found mentally retarded if his IQ score is below 70, regardless of the testing method used to determine that score.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">{\u00b6 180} Were argues that <em>Lott </em>makes no distinction between the Wechsler and Stanford-Binet IQ tests in setting 70 as the cutoff level for mental retardation. In <em>Lott, </em>we did not direct that a particular test or testing method must be used in determining IQ. On both the Wechsler scale and the Stanford-Binet, the diagnosis for mental retardation is approximately two standard deviations below the mean, which is an IQ of 70 on the Wechsler scale and an IQ of 68 on the Stanford-Binet. See <em>Bowling v. Commonwealth </em>(Ky.2005), 163 S.W.3d 361, 374; <em>State v. Williams </em>(La.2002), 831 So.2d 835, 853, fn. 26. In this case, expert testimony established that Were\u2019s IQ score of 69 on the Stanford-Binet test was above the cutoff level for mental retardation. We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Were\u2019s IQ scores on the Stanford-Binet test did not indicate that he was mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 181} Were also claims that the trial court\u2019s findings that his IQ tests were culturally biased and more likely than not resulted in lower scoring is erroneous. This claim lacks merit. During cross-examination, Hammer stated that the Stanford-Binet test that Were took in the 1960s was considered to be culturally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>biased. Nelson later explained that the test administered to Were was considered culturally biased because there were \u201cno minorities in the standardization sample. It was an all-white sample.\u201d Nelson also testified that cultural bias would have the effect of lowering test scores for minorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 182} Finally, Were argues that the trial court\u2019s findings are flawed because the trial court found that Were\u2019s IQ tests \u201cresulted in a true score of 70\u201d when he actually scored a 69 on both tests. It is not clear how the trial court arrived at this finding. Even assuming error, the trial court\u2019s finding makes no difference because Were\u2019s IQ score of 69 did not establish that he was mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">{\u00b6 183} Based on the foregoing, we overrule propositions of law TV and V.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">{\u00b6 184} In propositions of law I, II, and III, Were argues that the jury, and not the judge, should have determined whether he is mentally retarded. <em>Lott </em>holds that the decision whether or not a defendant is mentally retarded \u201cshould be decided by the court and do[es] not represent a jury question. In this regard, a trial court\u2019s ruling on mental retardation should be conducted in a manner comparable to a ruling on competency (i.e., the judge, not the jury, decides the issue).\u201d <em>Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, at \u00b6 18. Were invokes <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435; <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556; <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403; and <em>United States v. Booker </em>(2005), 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, in arguing that a jury must determine whether a capital defendant is mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">{\u00b6 185} In <em>Apprendi, </em>a noncapital case, the Supreme Court of the United States held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435. In <em>Ring, </em>a capital case, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a trial judge may not make findings of fact on the aggravating circumstances necessary to impose the death penalty because such a determination is within the province of the jury. <em>Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556. <em>Blakely, </em>a noncapital case, held that the Sixth Amendment prohibits a judge from making a finding on a fact that allowed him to impose a sentence greater than that allowed by a jury verdict or by the defendant\u2019s admissions at a plea hearing. <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 306, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. In <em>Booker, </em>the court applied <em>Blakely </em>to make the Federal Sentencing Guidelines advisory, rather than mandatory. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 243, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">{\u00b6 186} Based on the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases, Were claims that the determination of whether a capital defendant is mentally retarded was a factor that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>eliminated the possibility of a death sentence, and thus must be decided by the jury. The fact that a capital defendant is not mentally retarded, however, is not an aggravating circumstance that increases a defendant\u2019s punishment. Rather, the failure to find mental retardation simply means that the capital defendant remains eligible to be sentenced to death. Such a finding can affect a sentence only by mitigating it. Other jurisdictions that have considered this argument have reached similar conclusions. See <em>State v. Grell </em>(2006), 212 Ariz. 516, 526, 135 P.3d 696 <em>(\u201cRing </em>does not require that a jury find the absence of mental retardation\u201d); <em>State v. Laney </em>(2006), 367 S.C. 639, 647-649, 627 S.E.2d 726 (same); <em>Pruitt v. State </em>(Ind.2005), 834 N.E.2d 90, 112-113 (same); <em>Howell v. State </em>(Tenn.2004), 151 S.W.3d 450, 466-467 (mental retardation not required to be proven by the state nor found by a jury); <em>Head v. Hill </em>(2003), 277 Ga. 255, 258, 587 S.E.2d 613 <em>(Ring </em>and <em>Atkins </em>do not require a jury trial on the issue of mental retardation); <em>Russell v. State </em>(Miss.2003), 849 So.2d 95, 148 <em>(Ring </em>has no application to <em>Atkins </em>determination). We conclude that the trial court, not the jury, determines whether a capital defendant is mentally retarded. Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases requires otherwise. We overrule propositions of law I, II, and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">{\u00b6 187} In proposition of law VI, Were contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that the death penalty was not an option if it found that Were was mentally retarded. We conclude that such instructions are not appropriate because the jury does not determine whether a capital defendant is mentally retarded. Thus, proposition of law VI is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">{\u00b6 188} In proposition of law VIII, Were invokes <em>Ring </em>and <em>Blakely </em>in arguing that the jury should have been instructed that the state must prove that he was not mentally retarded by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Were argues that the state has this burden of proof because nonretardation is, and should be, treated as an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">{\u00b6 189} <em>Lott </em>provides that a capital defendant bears the burden of establishing that he is mentally retarded by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, at \u00b6 21. Placing the burden of proof on Were to establish that he is mentally retarded is constitutional. Cf. <em>Medina v. California </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 437, 450-451, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (state can assign to defendant the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is mentally incompetent to stand trial). Moreover, the fact that Were is not mentally retarded does not constitute an aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">{\u00b6 190} Several jurisdictions that have considered this issue agree that the defendant has the burden to prove entitlement to the <em>Atkins </em>exemption. <em>Bowling, </em>163 S.W.3d at 382; <em>Williams, </em>831 So.2d at 860; <em>Russell, </em>849 So.2d at 148; <em>Murphy v. State </em>(Okla.Crim.App.2002), 54 P.3d 556, 568; <em>Commonwealth v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Mitchell </em>(2003), 576 Pa. 258, 273, 839 A.2d 202, fn. 8. Thus, we reject proposition of law VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">{\u00b6 191} In proposition of law VII, Were argues that the jury was required to return a life sentence because the defense presented unrebutted expert testimony during mitigation that he is mentally retarded. In mitigation, Were presented evidence of his mental retardation from Drs. Hammer and Rheinscheld, McCullough\u2019s videotaped deposition, and Grant. At the mental-retardation hearing, which did not take place in front of the jury, these witnesses echoed their previous testimony. The state called no expert witnesses concerning Were\u2019s mental retardation, but cross-examined each of the defense witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 192} Defense expert testimony about Were\u2019s mental retardation was presented to the jury only as a mitigating factor. The state was not required to rebut such testimony because the trial court had previously determined that Were was not mentally retarded. Thus, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 193} Were also argues that the death penalty must be vacated because the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors. He claims that he did not personally kill Vallandingham, that his conviction was based on inmate testimony, and that he demonstrated that he is mentally retarded during the penalty phase. We shall consider this argument during our independent sentence evaluation. Based on the foregoing, proposition of law VII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">{\u00b6 194} <em>Reintroduction of guilt-phase evidence. </em>In proposition of law XII, Were argues that the trial court erred by introducing irrelevant guilt-phase evidence during the penalty phase. Trial counsel objected to the reintroduction of tunnel tape 32 and the autopsy photographs during the penalty phase. In overruling this objection, the trial court admitted tunnel tape 32 and one upper-body photograph of Vallandingham that showed he had been strangled.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">{\u00b6 195} R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) provides that the prosecutor at the penalty stage of a capital proceeding may introduce \u201cany evidence raised at trial that is relevant to the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing.\u201d See <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 528 N.E.2d 542, paragraph one of the syllabus. We find that the trial court did not err by admitting tunnel tape 32 and the autopsy photograph during the penalty phase because such evidence was relevant in showing prior calculation and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">{\u00b6 196} Were also argues that the trial court erred by instructing the jury to \u201cconsider all of the testimony in the first trial, which is relevant to this issue.\u201d Were did not object to this instruction and thus waived all but plain error. <em>Childs, </em>14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>{\u00b6 197} To the extent that the jury may have interpreted the instructions as allowing them to determine relevancy, the trial court erred. It is \u201cthe trial court\u2019s responsibility to determine the admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 201, 702 N.E.2d 866. Nevertheless, much of the guilt-phase evidence was relevant to the aggravating circumstances. Further, properly admitted evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors. We find that the trial court\u2019s misstatement did not result in plain error. Accordingly, we overrule proposition of law XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 198} <em>Prosecutorial misconduct. </em>In proposition of law XI, Were argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during his penalty-phase closing argument. The test for prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 199} Were contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he mentioned Were\u2019s gang involvement during his argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 200} \u201cBut you heard him speak and he wasn\u2019t a scared fourth or fifth grader out there in the hallway trying to hide and protect himself and save his life. He was one of the leaders of this entire thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 201} \u201cBut for the Muslims, the Black Gangster Disciples, the Aryans, Officer Vallandingham would be alive to this day. They sat and plotted his murder and put it into effect. Nothing in James Were\u2019s background, his past, his character, diminished or affected that. The defense psychologist even told you that he knew what he was doing was wrong, that he would have known, that his degree of mental state, his degree of learning, that to participate in the death of a fellow human being was wrong, and he knew it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">{\u00b6 202} This statement by the prosecutor is a response to defense counsel\u2019s comparing Were to a \u201cfourth grader\u201d and suggesting that Were \u201cdidn\u2019t know what [he was] doing, [and] didn\u2019t realize the consequences.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s argument pointed out that Were knew what he was doing and that he was one of the gang leaders responsible for Vallandingham\u2019s murder. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s argument represented fair comment and was not improper. See <em>Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, at \u00b6189 (no misconduct in arguing that defendant \u201cwas one of the leaders * * * who controlled and ran the riot\u201d and remarking on his membership in the Aryan Brotherhood).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">{\u00b6 203} Were also argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by mis-characterizing clinical psychologist Rheinscheld\u2019s testimony during his rebuttal argument. The prosecutor stated that Rheinscheld \u201cdidn\u2019t review the two tapes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>that you\u2019ve had to listen to.\u201d Defense counsel objected and stated, \u201cDr. Rhein-scheld heard the tape.\u201d The prosecutor explained that \u201c[h]e heard part of it in the car on the way down here from Columbus yesterday. He was already coming here to testify. His opinion was already set.\u201d Defense counsel objected again. The court overruled the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">{\u00b6 204} The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal did not mischaracterize Rheinscheld\u2019s testimony. During mitigation, Rheinscheld testified that he concluded that Were was mentally retarded after reviewing \u201ca lot of the records,\u201d McCullough\u2019s testimony, and listening to a couple of tapes. During cross-examination, Rheinscheld acknowledged, \u201cI only reviewed one tape and it was one of those tunnel tapes that they made.\u201d He did not recall what Were said on the tape because \u201c[tjhere were a lot of voices on there. I was listening to them on my way down here this morning. It was hard for me to discriminate that and negotiate traffic at the same time.\u201d Rheinscheld said he had also listened to a \u201clittle bit\u201d of the tape before a previous hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 205} The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument represented fair comment. Moreover, \u201c[p]rosecutors are entitled to latitude as to what the evidence has shown and what inferences can reasonably be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 111, 684 N.E.2d 668. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 206} Were argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by playing one of the tunnel tapes for the jury during his penalty-phase rebuttal. The defense did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s action and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 604, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">{\u00b6 207} During his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated, \u201cI am going to play * * * just part of that tape again, because I think it is important that we all hear James Were speak one more time. Something that his two experts never heard. They never heard James Were speak. They want to come and tell you and convince you of certain things, * * * yet * * * when the experts came to see him, to test him, to interview him, * * * he got up and walked out of the room and wouldn\u2019t talk to them.\u201d The prosecutor then played a portion of tunnel tape 32, which involved discussions of Were and other inmate leaders after Vallanding-ham was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">{\u00b6 208} The tape helped rebut defense arguments that Were was mentally retarded and had only a minor role in Vallandingham\u2019s death. Were\u2019s discussions on the tape were also relevant because defense experts did not personally evaluate Were before testifying that he was mentally retarded. The prosecutor did not commit plain error in playing the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">{\u00b6 209} Nevertheless, Were contends that by playing the tape, the prosecutor violated <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 662 N.E.2d 311, by focusing the jury\u2019s attention on the nature and circumstances of the offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>Wogenstahl </em>holds that \u201c[it] is improper for prosecutors in the penalty phase of a capital trial to make any comment before a jury that the nature and circumstances of the offense are \u2018aggravating circumstances.\u2019 \u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 210} The prosecutor did not characterize any of the facts of the offense as aggravating circumstances. Furthermore, the prosecutor and the trial court correctly identified the statutory aggravating circumstances. Thus, the prosecutor did not violate <em>Wogenstahl </em>by playing the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 211} Finally, Were argues that the cumulative effects of the prosecutor\u2019s improper arguments prejudiced him. It is clear from the record, however, that prosecutorial misconduct did not permeate the trial or affect its fundamental fairness. See <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 113, 559 N.E.2d 710. Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition of law XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 212} <em>Instructions. </em>In proposition of law XXX, Were argues that the trial court erred by failing to instruct that a lone juror may prevent a death-penalty recommendation. Trial courts are required to instruct juries that a single juror \u201cmay prevent a death penalty recommendation by finding that the aggravating circumstances in the case do not outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 162, 661 N.E.2d 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">{\u00b6 213} The record reveals that the trial court did not provide this instruction to the jury. Were did not object or request a lone-juror instruction at trial and thus waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, \u00b6 82. Were also did not raise this issue to the court of appeals and therefore waived this issue. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">{\u00b6 214} The instructions were consistent with R.C. 2929.03(D)(2), and the trial court\u2019s failure to give a lone-juror instruction is not plain error. See <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 292, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Accordingly, we reject proposition of law XXX.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">{\u00b6 215} In proposition of law XXIII, Were argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel during both phases of his trial. Were did not raise these claims in the court of appeals and therefore waived them, absent a showing of plain error. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Were must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant so as to deprive him of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>paragraph two of the syllabus. We conclude that defense counsel were not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">{\u00b6 216} <em>Adequacy of cross-examination. </em>Were argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to cross-examine several of the state\u2019s witnesses in his first trial. Were complains that his counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Macko was ineffective because counsel failed to elicit an alleged inconsistency in Macko\u2019s testimony from Were\u2019s first trial. Were claims that at his first trial, Macko testified that in his initial statement to the OSP, he did not identify Were as an inmate involved in Vallandingham\u2019s kidnapping. Were mischaracterizes Macko\u2019s testimony. During Were\u2019s first trial, Macko identified the inmates involved in the kidnapping and acknowledged that he had previously stated that \u201cWere was in there somewhere too.\u201d Thus, trial counsel had no basis for pursuing this proposed line of cross-examination. Further, \u201c[tjrial counsel need not cross-examine every witness * * *. The strategic decision not to cross-examine witnesses is firmly committed to trial counsel\u2019s judgment * * <em>State v. Otte </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 555, 565, 660 N.E.2d 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">{\u00b6 217} Were argues that trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Williams was ineffective because it did not establish that Williams did not testify that Were had confessed to killing Vallandingham at Were\u2019s first trial. During the first trial, Williams testified that Were had stated, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that they are taking me back down to Lucasville * * *. * * * [M]an, they must know. Somebody told. I believe they think I killed that guard.\u201d During the second trial, Williams testified that Were had stated, \u201cI think they know I killed that guard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">{\u00b6 218} Williams\u2019s testimony at the first trial about Were\u2019s statement, which arguably fell short of a confession, established Were\u2019s consciousness of guilt and was potentially damaging to the defense case. Counsel\u2019s decision to forgo cross-examination of Williams as to his earlier testimony was a tactical decision and did not constitute ineffective assistance. See <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 219} Were claims that his counsel were ineffective by failing to cross-examine inmate Sims about his active participation in the riot. Sims indicated that he was not a perpetrator or active participant during the riot. At Were\u2019s first trial, inmates Thomas Taylor and Kenneth Law testified that Sims had actively participated in the riot. Whether questioning Sims about Taylor\u2019s and Law\u2019s testimony would have been productive is speculative. Thus, counsel were not ineffective for failing to cross-examine Sims about Taylor\u2019s and Law\u2019s testimony. Moreover, Were\u2019s counsel effectively impeached Sims by eliciting an admission from Sims that he had withheld information from the prosecutors and that he had once retracted his testimony from three previous trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>{\u00b6220} Finally, Were claims that his counsel failed to develop that inmate Austin\u2019s testimony did not match any of the state\u2019s theories of his guilt. Austin testified that, while they were in prison together in 2000 or 2001, Were told him that \u201che was the one who kidnapped, robbed and killed Officer Vallandingham.\u201d When Austin asked Were how he did it, Were said that he strangled him.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">{\u00b6 221} Austin\u2019s testimony that Were admitted killing Vallandingham conflicted with other evidence showing that Were was an aider and abettor. During closing arguments, trial counsel pointed out that the state\u2019s witnesses provided conflicting testimony. Counsel emphasized that \u201ctheir stories do not coincide. The prosecutor told you that everything has been corroborated * * * but it hasn\u2019t.\u201d Trial counsel used closing arguments, rather than cross-examination, to point out inconsistencies in the state\u2019s evidence. Counsel made a tactical decision and were not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">{\u00b6 222} <em>Failure to call defense witnesses. </em>Were argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to call for his second trial several inmates who had testified during his first trial. \u201cGenerally, counsel\u2019s decision whether to call a witness falls within the rubric of trial strategy and will not be second-guessed by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 490, 739 N.E.2d 749. Moreover, \u201c \u2018[attorneys need not pursue every conceivable avenue; they are entitled to be selective.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 542, 747 N.E.2d 765, quoting <em>United States v. Davenport </em>(C.A.7, 1993), 986 F.2d 1047, 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">{\u00b6 223} During Were\u2019s first trial, Eddie Moss testified that he saw Lavelle and two masked men enter L-6 on the morning Vallandingham was killed, Tyree Parker testified that he saw Lavelle and two masked men exiting L-6 on the morning of the murder, and Sterling Barnes testified that he saw Lavelle and two masked men enter and exit L-6 that morning. During the second trial, defense witness Gregory Durkin testified that he saw Lavelle and four masked men wearing food service uniforms enter the L-6 block on the morning of Vallandingham\u2019s murder. Counsel\u2019s decision not to call the witnesses from the first trial was a tactical decision. By not calling Moss, Parker, and Barnes, the defense avoided presenting testimony that conflicted with Durkin\u2019s testimony. See <em>State v. Hand, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, \u00b6 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">{\u00b6 224} During Were\u2019s first trial, Sean Davis and Willie Johnson testified that they heard Lavelle discuss killing a correctional officer before Vallandingham was murdered. Their testimony was similar to that of defense witness Brian Esk-ridge. At the second trial, Eskridge testified that before Vallandingham\u2019s murder, Lavelle said, \u201cWe got to kill this C.O. We got to show them that we [are] serious * * *, we have to get this 187\u201d (slang for murder). Counsel may have decided to forgo calling Davis and Johnson during Were\u2019s second trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>because their testimony was cumulative. We conclude that counsel made a legitimate tactical decision and were not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">{\u00b6 225} During Were\u2019s first trial, Anthony Byrd testified that on the morning of April 15, he saw Were escort three other inmates to the cell in which corrections officer Hensley was being held. Byrd heard Hensley crying and begging for his life. Were told Byrd that \u201ctwo dudes\u201d wanted Hensley to kill another guard. Byrd then saw Vallandingham taken from his cell and moved to a cell with Hensley. Byrd saw a masked inmate give Hensley a cord. He also saw Were standing in front of the cell. Shortly thereafter, two inmates removed Vallandingham\u2019s body from his cell. Byrd then saw a \u201cshort guy\u201d put a pole on Vallandingham\u2019s neck, stand on the pole, and rock back and forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 226} Were fails to explain how Byrd\u2019s testimony would have helped the defense in the second trial. Byrd\u2019s testimony placed Were at the murder scene when Vallandingham was strangled. Moreover, contrary to Were\u2019s claims, Byrd did not identify Lavelle as the person standing on the bar on Vallandingham\u2019s neck. Counsel were not ineffective by failing to call Byrd.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 227} Were mentions three other witnesses who should have been called during his second trial. David Houseman testified during the first trial that he did not see Were in the dayroom during negotiations on April 15. Prentice Jackson testified during the first trial that Vallandingham and other hostages were brought into the L-3 dayroom on the first day of the prison riot, but he did not see Were bring in any of the hostages. Finally, at Were\u2019s first trial, defense counsel proffered testimony by Leroy Elmore that Lavelle said Were had \u201cdisrespected [him] in front of [his] brothers by hitting [him] for calling the shots.\u201d Elmore\u2019s testimony was not admitted during the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">{\u00b6 228} Were fails to explain the relevance of these three witnesses\u2019 testimony. In view of their questionable relevance, we conclude that counsel made a legitimate \u201ctactical decision\u201d not to call these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">{\u00b6 229} Based on the record of their testimony at the first trial, we conclude that the testimony of these witnesses was not crucial to Were\u2019s defense in the second trial. The decision of counsel not to call these witnesses for the second trial was not ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">{\u00b6 230} <em>Failure to request a defense expert on tape altering. </em>Were claims that his counsel were ineffective by failing to request a defense expert to determine whether the tunnel tapes had been doctored. There is no evidence in the record indicating that the tapes were altered. Because no such evidence exists, trial counsel were not ineffective by failing to request an expert to examine the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>{\u00b6 231} <em>Failure to make timely objections. </em>Were also argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to object to all objectionable guilt-phase testimony and exhibits. Were has not pointed to any specific evidence that was improperly admitted because of counsel\u2019s failure to object. Thus, Were fails to establish that his counsel were ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 232} <em>Failure to call lay witnesses at the mental-retardation hearing. </em>Were argues that his counsel were ineffective during the mental-retardation hearing. Were claims that trial counsel should have called Grant to testify about Were\u2019s mental limitations. The record at the mental-retardation hearing shows that the defense presented a transcript from the competency hearing of the lay testimony of Grant, Coleman, and Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6233} Were also claims that his counsel were ineffective by failing to call Blackmon to testify that Were was not respected in the Muslim community. During the guilt phase, Blackmon testified that Muslim inmates paid little attention to Were because he was \u201cilliterate.\u201d Were contends that Blackmon\u2019s testimony shows that the trial court\u2019s mental-retardation findings, including the finding that Were \u201crose to leadership positions in prison,\u201d are incorrect. Blackmon\u2019s testimony would have made no difference: Were\u2019s leadership role during the riot was established by the tunnel tapes and Williams\u2019s testimony. Thus, counsel were not ineffective by not calling Blackmon. See <em>Hand, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, at \u00b6 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 234} <em>Failure to challenge Nelson\u2019s expert qualifications. </em>Were argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to challenge the expert qualifications of Dr. Nelson, who testified during the mental-retardation hearing. Were does not, however, explain how Nelson\u2019s qualifications were deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">{\u00b6 235} Evid.R. 702(B) provides that a witness may qualify as an expert by reason of his or her \u201cspecialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[t]he individual offered as an expert need not have complete knowledge of the field in question, as long as the knowledge he or she possesses will aid the trier of fact in performing its fact-finding function.\u201d <em>Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 285, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Nelson has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and is a professor of psychology at Xavier University. He was a past president of the Cincinnati Psychological Association and during the trial was the current president of the American Board of Clinical Psychology. Nelson has also published numerous articles in professional journals and made numerous presentations at conventions and other professional gatherings.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">{\u00b6 236} In attacking Nelson\u2019s qualifications, Were asserts that Nelson reached his conclusions by assessing the manner in which Were functioned in prison rather than his peer group in the general population. Were fails, however, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>explain how Nelson\u2019s method for reaching his findings disqualified Nelson as an expert witness. Moreover, Nelson assessed Were\u2019s functioning in prison because Were had spent much of his life there. Accordingly, we hold that counsel were not ineffective by failing to challenge Nelson\u2019s expert qualifications. See <em>Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, at \u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">{\u00b6 237} <em>Failure to adequately present mitigating evidence. </em>Were argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to call more than one lay mitigation witness and failing to retain various experts to testify during mitigation. \u201cThe decision to forgo the presentation of additional mitigating evidence does not itself constitute proof of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 536, 684 N.E.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">{\u00b6 238} Were argues that lay testimony would have established that he relied upon Carlos Sanders, a person of much higher intellect and the leader of the Muslims, to make decisions during the riot. Counsel\u2019s decision not to present lay testimony about Were\u2019s subservient role was a legitimate tactical decision because other evidence (e.g., the tunnel tapes) showed that Were was a leader during the riot.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">{\u00b6 239} Were also argues that lay testimony should have been presented to show that Were protected some inmates from substantial harm during the riot. During Were\u2019s first trial, inmate Mike Trocadero had provided such testimony. Were fails to indicate how such testimony would have affected the outcome of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">{\u00b6 240} Were also claims that lay testimony should have been presented to show that he effectively performed his prison jobs. During Were\u2019s first trial, Mary Tanner, a case manager at SOCF, testified that Were did a very good job as a clerk in the prison infirmary. During Were\u2019s second trial, Hammer testified that Were\u2019s employment record showed that he was always working with someone else. Counsel\u2019s decision to forgo further testimony about Were\u2019s employment history constituted a tactical decision because such testimony might have undercut other defense arguments that Were was mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">{\u00b6 241} Were contends that his counsel should have retained a prison expert, a cultural expert, and a clinical psychologist. \u201c[T]he presentation of mitigating evidence is a matter of trial strategy.\u201d <em>Keith, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 530, 684 N.E.2d 47. Moreover, \u201c \u2018strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable * * \u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith </em>(2003), 539 U.S. 510, 521, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471, quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">{\u00b6 242} Were argues that his counsel should have called a prison expert who could have explained how overcrowding and lack of other facilities at the prison led to the riot. During the guilt phase, the defense played a tunnel tape during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>which inmate leaders discussed their list of grievances at the prison. During penalty-phase opening statements, trial counsel reminded the jurors that they had heard \u201cabout the conditions, the circumstances, [and] what it was like at Lucasville * * * prior to and during the course of this riot.\u201d Thus, the defense presented \u201calternative devices that * * * fulfilled] the same functions as the expert assistance sought.\u201d <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">{\u00b6 243} Were argues that his counsel should have called a cultural expert to explain his offenses in terms of prison culture, but he does not explain what such a witness would have said on his behalf. Finally, Were argues that counsel should have retained a clinical psychologist to explain his social history and development. Drs. Hammer and Rheinscheld, however, were hired by the defense and testified during mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">{\u00b6 244} The record does not show that defense counsel failed to investigate the possibility of presenting additional mitigating testimony. Moreover, we cannot infer a defense failure to investigate from a silent record; the burden of demonstrating ineffective assistance is on Were. See <em>Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 542, 747 N.E.2d 765. Based on the foregoing, proposition of law XXIII is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">{\u00b6 245} In proposition of law XXIV, Were makes several pro se claims that his trial and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance. We conclude that each of these claims is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">{\u00b6 246} First, Were alleges that trial counsel paid his appellate counsel to cover up his counsel\u2019s and the state\u2019s wrongdoing. There is nothing in the record to support these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">{\u00b6 247} Second, Were argues that his counsel failed to challenge his indictment. During pretrial proceedings, Were addressed the court and alleged that his indictment was defective because he was being retried with a case number that differed from the case number on his indictment. Defense counsel sent Were a letter dated December 17, 2002, that provided an explanation for the renumbering of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">{\u00b6 248} Third, Were claims that his counsel refused to challenge the court\u2019s ruling that he wear a stun belt. Trial counsel did not raise this issue at trial. As discussed in proposition of law XXVI, the record contains no indication that the jury could see or knew that Were was wearing a stun belt. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">{\u00b6 249} Fourth, Were claims that his counsel refused to raise the issue that he was sent to Oakwood Correctional Facility for a competency evaluation but was not examined there. He also states that when he was sent back to the Lebanon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Correctional Institute, he was placed on suicide watch and left in an unclean room because he would not talk to the doctors. During the competency hearing, trial counsel raised Were\u2019s treatment at Oakwood and Lebanon to explain his reasons for refusing to be evaluated by other psychologists. Were fails to explain any additional issues regarding these events that his counsel should have raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">{\u00b6 250} Fifth, Were argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to call Mackey, his former attorney, and McCullough at the competency hearing. The record shows that at the competency hearing, his counsel presented McCullough\u2019s testimony as well as statements made by Mackey to the court prior to Were\u2019s first trial. Were also argues that his counsel were deficient by failing to call his brother Stanley Nesbitt, his brother-in-law Robert Arrington, and Dorian Hall at the competency hearing. Were fails to explain the substance of their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">{\u00b6 251} Finally, Were claims that his counsel should have recalled Marva Allen, a state witness, to show that she had been untruthful when she testified and to question her about the log of Were\u2019s activities while at Lebanon Correctional Institute. He also states that Alice Lynd should have been called to establish that fact. Even assuming that Allen did not testify truthfully, Were has not established that her testimony was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">{\u00b6 252} Based on the foregoing, proposition of law XXIV is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">\n<em>Sentencing Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">{\u00b6 253} In proposition of law XIV, Were argues that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion is defective. Were contends that the sentencing opinion fails to explain why the trial court found that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors. But the sentencing opinion did discuss the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors presented during the penalty phase:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">{\u00b6 254} \u201cThe Court, after receiving the trial jury\u2019s recommendation that the sentence of death be imposed, finds, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravating circumstances the defendant was found guilty of committing outweigh any mitigating factor or factors which may be present. Even though defendant was not the principal offender and has some limited intellectual abilities, these factors are outweighed by the aggravating circumstances of the kidnapping and murder of a prison guard. The sentence of death is appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">{\u00b6 255} The trial court explained why the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors, as required by R.C. 2929.03(F). No further analysis was required. See <em>Filiaggi, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 245, 714 N.E.2d 867. We conclude that this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">{\u00b6 256} Second, Were argues that the opinion improperly treated the nature and circumstances of the offense as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The trial court accurately identified the two aggravating circumstances. When a court does so correctly, that court is presumed to rely only on those circumstances and not on nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. <em>State v. Hill </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 433, 441, 653 N.E.2d 271. The trial court must also examine the nature and circumstances of the offense to determine whether they are mitigating. <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 157. Thus, we overrule proposition of law XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\n<em>Independent Review by the Court of Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">{\u00b6 257} Following a remand from this court, the court of appeals conducted its independent review of the death sentence as required by R.C. 2929.05(A). See <em>State v. Were, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030485, 2006-Ohio-3511, 2006 WL 1867840, at \u00b6 22-34. In proposition of law XV, Were argues that the court\u2019s independent review of his death sentence was deficient because the court\u2019s conclusion that he is not mentally retarded is unsupported by the evidence. The court, however, fully discussed mitigation evidence that Were was mentally retarded. The court then concluded that although \u201cWere\u2019s limited intellectual abilities are entitled to some weight in mitigation, the evidence produced in the trial did not establish that Were was mentally retarded.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">{\u00b6 258} Were makes the same arguments that he made in propositions IV and V in challenging the conclusion that he is not mentally retarded. The conclusion reached by the court of appeals in its independent review, however, is supported by evidence presented during the mental-retardation hearing. Moreover, our independent sentence assessment will cure any deficiency in the court of appeals\u2019 opinion. <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 211, 661 N.E.2d 1068; <em>State v. Simko </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 483, 493, 644 N.E.2d 345. Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition of law XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">\n<em>Settled Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">{\u00b6 259} <em>Proportionality. </em>In proposition of law XIII, Were disputes the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty proportionality review. We summarily reject these arguments. <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 23; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">{\u00b6 260} <em>Constitutionality. </em>In proposition of law XVI, Were attacks the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. We have previously rejected similar claims. <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\n<em>Cumulative Errors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">{\u00b6 261} In proposition of law XXXIII, Were argues that cumulative errors deprived him of a fair trial and require reversal of his convictions and death sentence. We conclude that Were received a fair trial. Moreover, \u201cerrors cannot become prejudicial by sheer weight of numbers.\u201d <em>Hill, 75 </em>Ohio St.3d at 212, 661 N.E.2d 1068. Thus, we reject proposition of law XXXIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">{\u00b6 262} We are required by R.C. 2929.05(A) to independently review Were\u2019s death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality. The evidence at trial established beyond a reasonable doubt that Were murdered corrections officer Robert Vallandingham purposely and with prior calculation and design while Were was a prisoner in a detention facility, R.C. 2929.04(A)(4), and purposely and with prior calculation and design while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Against these aggravating circumstances, we must weigh the mitigating factors contained in R.C. 2929.04(B). Were called four mitigation witnesses. Were did not present a sworn or unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">{\u00b6 263} Jacalyn McCullough\u2019s videotaped testimony, which was presented during Were\u2019s competency and mental retardation hearings, was played for the jury. McCullough, a prison teacher, taught Were adult basic education courses for over a year while he was in prison. She testified that Were\u2019s reading level was at the fourth- or fifth-grade level, and his math skills were at the third-grade level. Were also did poorly in social studies and did not understand any kind of science terminology. McCullough believed that Were would be considered developmentally handicapped in a normal school setting. Despite his intellectual limitations, Were wanted to learn and worked very hard in school.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">{\u00b6 264} Dr. David Hammer testified that in his opinion, Were is mildly mentally retarded. Hammer testified that Were scored a 69 on the Stanford-Binet IQ test in 1964 and 1969. He testified that Were\u2019s employment history, his academic deficits, and his poor money-management skills provided evidence of limitations in his adaptive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">{\u00b6 265} Dr. Timothy Rheinscheld testified that in his opinion, Were is mentally retarded. Rheinscheld\u2019s opinion was based on Were\u2019s two IQ scores of 69, and his finding of significant defects in Were\u2019s adaptive behavior, as shown by Were\u2019s school and prison records and McCullough\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">{\u00b6 266} Danny Grant\u2019s testimony was presented to bolster the defense claim that Were is mentally retarded. Were and Grant were fellow inmates at the Lebanon Correctional Institute from 1999 to 2002. Grant assisted Were with his legal paperwork because \u201chis comprehension level wasn\u2019t up to par of understanding what was going on.\u201d He helped Were spell, pronounce words, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>comprehend the meaning of legal documents. Grant had to repeat his explanations because Were had trouble remembering what he was told. On one occasion, Grant drafted a motion for Were that Were copied in his own handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 267} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offense to be mitigating. Were was one of the leaders during the Lucasville prison riot. He helped remove Officer Vallandingham from the bathroom where he was hiding and took him to the L-6 cellblock where he was locked up. On April 15, 1993, Were advocated that a prison guard be killed to demonstrate that the inmates\u2019 demands should be taken seriously. Were then supervised the group of inmates who strangled Vallandingham in the L-6 shower. These facts establish a horrific crime without any mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">{\u00b6 268} Although Were\u2019s character offers nothing in mitigation, we give some weight to his history and background. Were did poorly in school and never finished high school. Nevertheless, McCullough testified that Were wanted to learn and tried to do well in taking adult basic education courses in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">{\u00b6 269} The statutory mitigating factors are generally inapplicable here, including R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement), (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation), (B)(4) (youth of the offender), and (B)(5) (lack of a significant criminal record). Were\u2019s mental deficiencies do not qualify as an R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) factor because there was no testimony that Were, by reason of a mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Nevertheless, Were\u2019s limited intellectual abilities are entitled to some weight in mitigation under the catchall provision of R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). See <em>State v. Frazier, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, 873 N.E.2d 1263, \u00b6267. Dr. Hammer and Dr. Rheinscheld testified that Were has a low IQ and significant defects in his adaptive behavior. Evidence of Were\u2019s leadership and decision-making during the riot, however, undercut his claim of limited intellectual functioning. Moreover, the evidence did not establish that Were is mentally retarded. Thus, Were\u2019s execution is not barred by <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335. The mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(6) is directly applicable because Were acted as an accomplice and not as the principal offender. Although Were was not the actual killer of Vallandingham, he was one of the leaders who decided upon, planned, and supervised the murder. Thus, this mitigating factor is entitled to very little weight. The evidence does not suggest any other mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">{\u00b6 270} We find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Were murdered Vallandingham while he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>a hostage during the Lucasville prison riot. Compared with these serious aggravating circumstances, Were\u2019s mitigating evidence has little significance.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"aip-dedup-0\">Mark E. Piepmeier, Special Prosecuting Attorney, and William E. Breyer, Assistant Special Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AJ9f\">H. Fred Hoefle and Chris McEvilley, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 271} Finally, we hold that the death penalty is both appropriate and proportionate to death sentences approved in other Lucasville cases. See <em>Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 246; <em>LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 198; <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 281, 750 N.E.2d 90; and <em>Robb, 88 </em>Ohio St.3d at 91, 723 N.E.2d 1019. It is also proportionate to death sentences approved for other aggravated murders in a detention facility. See <em>State v. Stojetz </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 472, 705 N.E.2d 329; <em>State v. Zuern </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 56, 66, 512 N.E.2d 585. Further, it is proportionate to death sentences approved for other aggravated murders during kidnappings. See <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 334; <em>State v.
