Zipperstein </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 74, 512 N.E.2d 636, which establishes that an attorney is not liable to third persons arising from his good-faith performance of acts on behalf of a client. For the reasons that follow, we decline the invitation to overrule <em>Zipperstein </em>and instead hold that a beneficiary of a decedent\u2019s will may not maintain a negligence action against an attorney for the preparation of a deed that results in increased tax for the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">I. Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">{\u00b6 2} Margaret Schlegel, the decedent, was a client of attorney Thomas Gindlesberger, the appellee. In 1986, Gindlesberger prepared a will for her, and he later drafted two codicils. Her three children, Roy Schlegel, Robert Schlegel, and Anna Mae Shoemaker, were beneficiaries under the will. In 1990, Margaret, who owned two tracts of land, the \u201cHanna farm\u201d and the \u201chome place,\u201d contacted Gindlesberger for assistance with the transfer of some property. Her son Roy was interested in expanding his dairy farm; to assist him, his mother wanted to convey most of the Hanna farm while retaining a life interest in the land. Gindlesberger drafted a general warranty deed that retained a life estate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Margaret and transferred a joint life estate to Roy and his wife, with a remainder over in fee simple to the survivor.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 3} Margaret Schlegel died in 2003. When her will was admitted to probate, the Schlegel children learned that estate assets would have to be sold to pay state and federal estate taxes owed on the transfer of the Hanna farm. The appellants, Robert Schlegel, as executor and as a beneficiary, and Anna Mae Shoemaker, as a beneficiary, argued that Gindlesberger was negligent in preparing the document for the transfer of the Hanna farm and in failing to advise their mother of the tax consequences of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 4} The appellants filed a complaint against Gindlesberger alleging that he was negligent because his preparation of the document transferring the Hanna farm to their brother, Roy Schlegel, increased the estate\u2019s tax liability. They also sued Roy for unjust enrichment, claiming that he had received the Hanna farm while the estate received the tax liability, which had depleted their inheritance. Because Roy received property and Robert and Anna Mae did not, the appellants complained that their mother\u2019s intent to divide her assets evenly had been frustrated by Gindlesberger\u2019s faulty advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 5} Roy Schlegel filed a cross-claim for negligence against Gindlesberger, asserting that Robert and Anna Mae\u2019s lawsuit claiming depletion of their inheritance was caused by Gindlesberger\u2019s lack of knowledge of tax law. Gindlesber-ger responded that because there was never an attorney-client relationship between the Schlegel children and himself, none of the children had standing to bring a claim of negligence. The trial court denied Roy Schlegel\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the unjust-enrichment claim filed by the appellants, finding a genuine issue of material fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted Gindlesberger\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissing the negligence claims filed by the Schlegel children. In granting Gindlesberger\u2019s motion, the court, citing <em>Simon v. Zipperstein, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 74, 512 N.E.2d 636, held that there was \u201cno evidence that an attorney-client relationship or sufficient privity with an attorney-client relationship, existed between Defendant Gindlesberger and the Plaintiffs Robert and Anna Mae Shoemaker, or Defendant Roy Schlegel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">{\u00b6 6} On appeal, the appellants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claimed that the trial court erred in granting Gindlesberger\u2019s motion for summary judgment, arguing that the general rule of privity applied by the trial court should be abandoned in favor of a rule that allows beneficiaries to sue an attorney who is negligent in creating an estate plan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The appellate court disagreed, holding that the only person having an attorney-client relationship with Gindlesberger was their deceased mother, Margaret.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 7} We accepted this case as a discretionary appeal. The appellants propose that a beneficiary of a decedent\u2019s will may maintain an action against an attorney who is negligent in the creation of the estate plan even though the beneficiary is not in privity with the attorney\u2019s client. Gindlesberger responds that the limited exception to the strict rule of privity, which imposes liability only if a lawyer acts fraudulently or maliciously, should not be expanded. We agree with Gindlesber-ger.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 8} To establish a cause of action for legal malpractice based on negligence, the following elements must be proved: (1) an attorney-client relationship, (2) professional duty arising from that relationship, (3) breach of that duty, (4) proximate cause, (5) and damages. <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 427, 674 N.E.2d 1164; <em>Krahn v. Kinney </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 103, 105, 538 N.E.2d 1058. If a plaintiff fails to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to any of the elements, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment on a legal-malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b6 9} The appellants assert that because Gindlesberger improperly drafted the will and a deed that allowed Margaret Schlegel to retain an interest in the Hanna farm, they have suffered damages in the form of increased estate tax liabilities. But attorneys in Ohio are not liable to a third party for the good-faith representation of a client, unless the third party is in privity with the client for whom the legal services were performed. <em>Scholler v. Scholler </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 98, 10 OBR 426, 462 N.E.2d 158, paragraph one of the syllabus. This rule is rooted in the attorney\u2019s obligation to direct attention to the needs of the client, not to the needs of a third party not in privity with the client. <em>Simon v. Zipperstein, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 76, 512 N.E.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">{\u00b6 10} The Schlegel children all concede they had no attorney-client relationship with Gindlesberger and that they must, therefore, demonstrate privity with his client, Margaret Schlegel, or malice on the part of Gindlesberger. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines privity as \u201c[t]he connection or relationship between two parties, each having a legally recognized interest in the same subject matter.\u201d (8th Ed.2004) 1237. In <em>Zipperstein, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 74, 512 N.E.2d 636, this court addressed privity in a similar context. An attorney prepared a will for a client who had a son, and upon the father\u2019s death, the son\u2019s guardian filed suit against the attorney for legal malpractice in the drafting of the will. Id. at 74-75, 512 N.E.2d 636. The court held that the son\u2019s guardian could not sue the attorney because the son did not have a vested interest in the estate and thus was not in privity with the client. Id. at 77, 512 N.E.2d 636. The same applies here \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>appellants were not in privity with their mother, the client, because they were only potential beneficiaries to her will and their rights as beneficiaries did not vest until her death. Margaret Schlegel retained the right to revoke or amend her will during her lifetime. For these reasons, the appellants do not have standing to file their negligence suit against Gindlesberger.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 11} The necessity for privity may be overridden if special circumstances such as \u201cfraud, bad faith, collusion or other malicious conduct\u201d are present. <em>Zipperstein, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 76, 512 N.E.2d 636. The appellants, however, did not plead fraud, bad faith, collusion, or malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 12} The appellants\u2019 argument rests on two public-policy grounds. They advocate for a change in what some refer to as Ohio\u2019s antiquated rule on privity, arguing that Ohio law should grant beneficiaries standing to sue an attorney who allegedly was negligent in providing services to a decedent. In support of their position, they present a survey of several jurisdictions that allow beneficiaries to bring malpractice claims. It is true that Ohio is in the minority of states retaining a strict privity rule, but Ohio was also in the minority of states when <em>Zipperstein </em>was decided over 20 years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 13} Appellants\u2019 second reason for asking for an exception to the privity rule is the need to have attorney accountability in the area of estate planning and wealth transfer. Because any mistakes that an attorney makes in drafting a will or giving advice about an estate plan generally do not arise until after the death of the client, the harm from an attorney\u2019s errors will most likely befall the intended beneficiaries. The appellants argue that an attorney who drafts a will for a client is aware that his or her professional competence affects not only the client but also those whom the client intends to benefit from the will. They argue, consequently, that they should be permitted to maintain a suit against an attorney who negligently drafts or supervises the preparation of a will, to hold the attorney accountable for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">{\u00b6 14} Public policy justifies adherence to the privity rule, as stated by courts in jurisdictions that apply the strict privity requirement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Primarily, the rule is used to protect the attorney\u2019s duty of loyalty and the attorney\u2019s effective advocacy for the client. <em>Lewis v. Star Bank, N.A., Butler Cty. </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 709, 712-713, 630 N.E.2d 418. The strict privity rule ensures that attorneys may represent their clients without the threat of suit from third parties who may compromise that representation. <em>Barcelo v. Elliott </em>(Tex.1996), 923 S.W.2d 575, 578-579. Otherwise, an attorney\u2019s preoccupation or concern with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>potential negligence claims by third parties might diminish the quality of legal services provided to the client if the attorney were to weigh the client\u2019s interests against the possibility of third-party lawsuits. See <em>Zipperstein, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 76, 512 N.E.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 15} Second, without the strict privity rule, the attorney could have conflicting duties and divided loyalties during the estate planning process. Third, there would be unlimited potential liability for the lawyer. See generally <em>Sav. Bank v. Ward </em>(1879), 100 U.S. 195, 203, 25 L.Ed. 621 (without privity of contract, \u201cabsurd consequences to which no limit can be seen\u201d will ensue). In <em>Ward, </em>the United States Supreme Court, in its seminal case discussing privity, noted that \u201c[t]he only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract; if we go one step beyond that, there is no reason why we should not go fifty.\u201d Id. Rather than expose the lawyer to the 50, we conclude that lawyers should know in advance whom they are representing and what risks they are accepting.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 16} The comment to Ohio\u2019s conflict-of-interest rule, Prof.Cond.R. 1.7, states: \u201cThe principles of loyalty and independent judgment are fundamental to the attorney-client relationship and underlie the conflict-of-interest provisions of these rules. Neither the lawyer\u2019s personal interest, the interests of other clients, nor the desires of third persons should be permitted to dilute the lawyer\u2019s loyalty to the client.\u201d The rules of professional responsibility, therefore, also underscore the need to ensure that a lawyer is not liable to parties who are not in privity with the lawyer\u2019s client.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 17} We decline the appellants\u2019 invitation to relax our strict privity rule. Although the court of appeals commented that this rule does not allow a remedy for the wrong, that is not necessarily so. Other courts have suggested that a testator\u2019s estate or a personal representative of the estate might stand in the shoes of the testator in an action for legal malpractice in order to meet the strict privity requirement. See <em>Noble v. Bruce </em>(1998), 349 Md. 730, 758-759, 709 A.2d 1264; <em>Belt v. Oppenheimer, Blend, Harrison &amp; Tate, Inc. </em>(Tex.2006), 192 S.W.3d 780, 784. These cases have suggested that the claims should be brought in the name of the estate. See <em>Nevin v. Union Trust Co. </em>(Me.1999), 726 A.2d 694, 701 (holding that the better rule is to allow only personal representatives, not beneficiaries, to sue for estate planning malpractice, because what may be good for one beneficiary is not necessarily good for the estate as a whole). This may well be a solution to the problem, but it is a question for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">{\u00b6 18} While recognizing that public-policy reasons exist on both sides of the issue, we conclude that the bright-line rule of privity remains beneficial. The rule provides for certainty in estate planning and preserves an attorney\u2019s loyalty to the client. In this case, for example, Gindlesberger maintains that he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>exactly what Margaret Schlegel wished. She wished to transfer the Hanna farm but also wanted to retain a life estate. The deed Gindlesberger prepared accomplished just that. Moreover, appellants\u2019 claim is that the deed and the will drafted by Gindlesberger created a tax liability for the estate that depleted its assets. It is conceivable that a testator may not wish to optimize tax liability, instead seeking to further a different goal. In those instances, what is good for one beneficiary may not be good for another beneficiary, or for the estate as a whole. In this case, the basis for extending liability is even more tenuous because the increased tax liability to the estate arose from the transfer of the Hanna farm, not from the decedent\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">{\u00b6 19} A holding that attorneys have a duty to beneficiaries of a will separate from their duty to the decedent who executed the will could lead to significant difficulty and uncertainty, a breach in confidentiality, and divided loyalties. See <em>Nevin, </em>726 A.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 20} To overrule <em>Zipperstein </em>and develop a new rule relaxing the well-established privity requirement would require an overruling of a precedent based solely on public policy. We decline to change the rule of law in this state that bars an action for negligence against a lawyer by a plaintiff who is not in privity with the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b621} We therefore hold that a beneficiary of a decedent\u2019s will may not maintain a negligence action against an attorney for the preparation of a deed that results in increased tax liability for the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">{\u00b6 22} Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Holmes County.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b345-10\">O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b345-11\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\">. That claim is stayed pending the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\">. In the years since the trial court action, Robert Schlegel has died, and the appellants, who have been substituted as parties, are Anna Mae Shoemaker, as executor of the estate and in her own right, and \u00d1ola M.

Under the proposed exception, an attorney could be liable to his client\u2019s beneficiaries for negligence in connection with a large and loosely defined group of transactions; the appellants do not present compelling reasons for creating such a broad exception to the privity rule. Nevertheless, I write separately to distinguish the exception proposed by the appellants in this case and the one considered in <em>Simon v. Zipperstein </em>(1987), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>32 Ohio St.3d 74, 512 N.E.2d 636, and to acknowledge that, in a case with different facts, there would be compelling reasons for adopting the exception we rejected in <em>Zipperstein.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 24} In the present case, the beneficiaries seek to hold the decedent\u2019s attorney liable for negligence <em>in a financial transaction independent of the will. </em>In particular, the beneficiaries alleged negligence in the attorney\u2019s preparation of a deed that transferred the decedent\u2019s property to her son and reserved a life estate for the decedent. In <em>Zipperstein, </em>the beneficiary sought to hold the decedent\u2019s attorney liable for negligence <em>in the preparation of the will. </em>Among other things, the beneficiary sought damages for the attorney\u2019s failure to include a provision in the will renouncing an existing antenuptial agreement. <em>Zipperstein, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 75, 512 N.E.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 25} The appellants cite no case in which a court in any jurisdiction allows beneficiaries to sue the decedent\u2019s attorney for negligence in a financial transaction independent of the will. Instead, the appellants cite cases in which courts in other jurisdictions recognized a cause of action that is almost identical to the one considered in <em>Zipperstein: </em>in each case, the court allowed either a beneficiary or an intended beneficiary to sue the decedent\u2019s attorney for errors in the preparation of a will or codicil. See <em>Lucas v. Hamm </em>(1961), 56 Cal.2d 583, 15 Cal.Rptr. 821, 364 P.2d 685; <em>Guy v. Liederbach </em>(1983), 501 Pa. 47, 51, 459 A.2d 744; <em>Succession of Killingsworth </em>(La.1973), 292 So.2d 536; <em>Ogle v. Fuiten </em>(1984) 102 Ill.2d 356, 80 Ill.Dec. 772, 466 N.E.2d 224; <em>McAbee v. Edwards </em>(Fla.App.1976), 340 So.2d 1167; and <em>Licata v. Spector </em>(1966), 26 Conn.Supp. 378, 225 A.2d 28. The appellants assert, without significant explanation, that if we approve of the result in any of these cases, we should find a cause of action here: \u201cThe only difference * * * is that here the error was not in the drafting of a will but in not understanding the import of another type of document prepared in furtherance of the attorney\u2019s client\u2019s dispositive scheme. This * * * is a difference without distinction.\u201d I disagree with the appellants\u2019 assertion. The cause of action proposed by the appellants is readily distinguishable from those recognized in the aforementioned cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 26} First, the appellants\u2019 broad description of the error in this case demonstrates that a cause of action based on the present facts would have a far greater scope than the cause of action recognized in any of the above cases. In the appellants\u2019 description of the error as a failure to \u201cunderstand[ ] the import of another type of document prepared in furtherance of the attorney\u2019s client\u2019s dispositive scheme,\u201d the phrase \u201canother type of document\u201d provides no threshold limitation. The phrase \u201cin furtherance of the attorney\u2019s client\u2019s dispositive scheme\u201d would also be difficult to define or limit and would almost certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>include transactions in which attorney errors and the resultant damage were readily discoverable before the death of the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">{\u00b6 27} Second, damage to beneficiaries is more readily foreseeable in a will-drafting case than in the present case. The Supreme Court of California has held that because one of the main purposes of a will is to transfer property to the named beneficiaries, damage to those beneficiaries in the event of attorney negligence in drafting the will is \u201cclearly foreseeable.\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>56 Cal.2d at 589, 15 Cal.Rptr. 821, 364 P.2d 685. Here, the main purpose of the transfer of land was to benefit the decedent and her son \u2014 not the other beneficiaries. The damage to the beneficiaries described in the present ease is therefore far less foreseeable than the damage to the beneficiaries in a case where an attorney was negligent in preparation of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 28} Despite these objections to the cause of action proposed by appellants, I believe that there would be compelling reasons to recognize a cause of action by an intended beneficiary against the decedent\u2019s attorney for negligence in preparation of a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 29} Courts in many states have recognized a cause of action for beneficiaries alleging attorney error in the preparation of a will or codicil. The Supreme Court of California, when it held that a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries have a cause of action against the decedent\u2019s attorney for negligently preparing testamentary instruments, noted that such a cause of action does not impose a new or unexpected burden on the decedent\u2019s attorney. <em>Lucas, </em>56 Cal.2d at 589, 15 Cal.Rptr. 821, 364 P.2d 685. See also <em>Licata, </em>26 Conn.Supp. 378, 225 A.2d 28 (holding that a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries can sue the decedent\u2019s attorney for negligently preparing a will).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">{\u00b6 30} The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, holding that a named beneficiary may, as an intended third-party beneficiary, sue the decedent\u2019s attorney, rejected the idea that its holding would impose a costly and undesirable burden on attorneys: \u201cOverarching all of appellants\u2019 arguments is the basic policy argument that allowing suits such as appellee\u2019s would perhaps lower the quality of legal services rendered to clients because of attorneys\u2019 increased concern over liability to third persons, and certainly make them much more expensive. We cannot accept the proposition that insuring the quality of legal services requires allowing as limited a number of persons as possible to bring suit for malpractice.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Guy, </em>501 Pa. at 62-63, 459 A.2d 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 31} In the dissent to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Zipperstein, </em>Justice Brown argued that, in an action by an intended beneficiary alleging negligence in the preparation of a testamentary instrument, no real conflict of interest exists: \u2018Where the attorney\u2019s job is to draft a will, * * * the needs of the client simply require the attorney to competently construct an instrument that will carry out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the client\u2019s intentions as to the distribution of his or her property upon death. If the attorney negligently fails to fulfill those needs, with the result that an intended beneficiary receives less than the client desired, surely the client, if he or she were still alive, would <em>want </em>the intended beneficiary to bring an action against the attorney.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) 32 Ohio St.3d at 78, 512 N.E.2d 636.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AUA\">Ronald L. Rosenfield Co., L.P.A., and Ronald L. Rosenfield, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ack-dedup-0\">John C. Nemeth &amp; Associates, John C. Nemeth, and Michael J. Collins, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AFi\">Frederick M. Morgan Jr.; and Volkema Thomas, L.P.A., and Michael S. Miller, urging reversal on behalf of amicus curiae, Ohio Association for Justice.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 32} Justice Brown also recognized that there were significant policy reasons to recognize an intended beneficiary\u2019s cause of action for negligence. In particular, he argued that without such a cause of action, attorneys who commit malpractice in preparing a will are immune from liability. 32 Ohio St.3d at 77, 512 N.E.2d 636. He also noted that we have recognized causes of action by third parties against physicians, architects, and accountants, despite a lack of privity: \u201cIn the law of torts, the use of privity as a tool to bar recovery has been riddled (and rightly so) to the extent that we are left with legal malpractice as, perhaps, the only surviving relic.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 33} I am persuaded that, as Justice Brown argued, the issue of an attorney\u2019s conflict of interest does not arise if an intended beneficiary has a cause of action in negligence for an attorney\u2019s preparation of a will. I am also persuaded that there is a strong need for attorney accountability in preparing wills. It serves no purpose to continue to invoke a strict rule of privity to protect the malpractice of a lawyer when we have abrogated that rule with respect to the liability of other professionals, such as accountants and architects. For this reason, if presented with a different set of facts, I would be in favor of revisiting our decision in <em>Zipperstein </em>in the context of the holding of <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256.</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-7\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
