Because the council member who was the subject of the recall petition is no longer in office, we dismiss the appeal as moot. In addition, in the cross-appeal, we affirm the denial of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">{\u00b6 2} In November 2003, Bruno Razov was elected to represent Ward 2 on the Eastlake City Council for a four-year term commencing January 1, 2004. In July 2005, appellee, Arlene S. Sawyer, a taxpayer residing in Ward 2 of Eastlake, submitted to appellant, Eastlake Clerk of Council Deborah Cendroski, a petition for an election to recall Razov from his office of Ward 2 council member. Cendroski subsequently notified Sawyer that the petition contained insufficient signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">{\u00b6 3} In October 2005, Sawyer filed an action in the Court of Appeals for Lake County for a writ of mandamus to compel Cendroski to certify the recall petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>to the Eastlake City Council and to Razov. Sawyer alleged that she was bringing her mandamus claim as a taxpayer action, and she requested an award of attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 733.61. Cendroski submitted an answer stating that Sawyer\u2019s mandamus claim was barred because she had failed to post bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">{\u00b6 4} The court of appeals granted Sawyer a writ of mandamus on August 13, 2007, to compel Cendroski to certify the recall petition to the Eastlake City Council. In so holding, the court adopted Sawyer\u2019s interpretation of a charter signature requirement for recall petitions and rejected Cendroski\u2019s claim that the court had improperly admitted hearsay evidence. The court also denied Sawyer\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 5} Cendroski appealed the granting of the writ of mandamus, and Sawyer cross-appealed the denial of her request for attorney fees. The parties subsequently stipulated that \u201cany certification and recall election shall be stayed\u201d because Razov\u2019s term would end on December 31, 2007, and he was not a candidate for council member at the November 6, 2007 election. The parties thus asked us to stay \u201cany certification and recall election\u201d and to consider the merits of this appeal and cross-appeal following the conclusion of briefing. We granted the parties\u2019 motion and stayed the judgment of the court of appeals. 115 Ohio St.3d 1429, 2007-Ohio-5530, 874 N.E.2d 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">{\u00b6 6} This cause is now before the court upon Cendroski\u2019s appeal and Sawyer\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Appeal from Grant of Writ of Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">{\u00b6 7} In her appeal, Cendroski asserts that the court of appeals erred in granting the writ of mandamus because the court misinterpreted the charter\u2019s signature requirement for recall petitions and erred in admitting hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">{\u00b6 8} We dismiss this appeal as moot because, as the parties conceded in their joint stipulation, the council member who was the subject of Sawyer\u2019s recall petition and the court of appeals\u2019 judgment granting the writ of mandamus is now out of office. In effect, the objective of Sawyer\u2019s mandamus claim has now been achieved with the council member\u2019s departure from office. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Law Office of Montgomery Cty. Pub. Defender v. Rosencrans, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 338, 2006-Ohio-5793, 856 N.E.2d 250, \u00b6 15; <em>State ex rel. Chapnick v. E. Cleveland City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 449, 451, 755 N.E.2d 883 (appeal from grant of writ of mandamus dismissed as moot when board of education afforded relator the relief requested).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">{\u00b6 9} This is not a case in which the issues raised in Cendroski\u2019s appeal are capable of repetition yet evading review. \u201cThis exception [to the mootness doctrine] applies when the challenged action is too short in duration to be fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>litigated before its cessation or expiration, and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Louden </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 61, 64, 741 N.E.2d 517. The issues that Cendroski raises, which are related to election provisions, will not always be rendered moot before there is a final judicial resolution. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Todd v. Felger, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 207, 2007-Ohio-6053, 877 N.E.2d 673, \u00b6 12 (\u201cElection cases are often fully litigated before the pertinent election\u201d). Both parties could have sought a more expeditious resolution by the court of appeals or requested an accelerated briefing and evidence schedule on appeal here, but neither did.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 10} Based on the foregoing, we dismiss Cendroski\u2019s appeal as moot. \u201cThis is consistent with our general rule that we will not issue advisory opinions, which we have applied to election cases.\u201d <em>Todd, </em>at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Cross-Appeal from Denial of Request for Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 11} In her cross-appeal, Sawyer asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying her request for attorney fees that she sought pursuant to R.C. 733.61 by a statutory taxpayer action. \u201cThe decision to award attorney fees to successful relators in an R.C. Chapter 733 taxpayer suit is within the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. DeBrosse v. Cool </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 1, 7, 716 N.E.2d 1114. An abuse of discretion reflects an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable attitude. <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Portage Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 405, 2007-Ohio-5346, 875 N.E.2d 578, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">{\u00b6 12} The court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in determining that Sawyer\u2019s mandamus action is not a statutory taxpayer action, because she did not give security for the cost of the proceeding. R.C. 733.59 (\u201cNo such suit or proceeding shall be entertained by any court until the taxpayer gives security for the cost of the proceeding\u201d). Relators are not entitled to attorney fees under R.C. 733.61 unless they have given security. <em>State ex rel. Citizens for a Better Portsmouth v. Sydnor </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 49, 54, 572 N.E.2d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">{\u00b6 13} Although we have recognized that a trial court has the discretion under certain circumstances to waive the security requirement, see <em>State ex rel. Fisher v. Cleveland, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 33, 2006-Ohio-1827, 845 N.E.2d 500, \u00b6 42-45, the court of appeals did not waive this requirement here. In fact, unlike the respondents in <em>Fisher, </em>at \u00b6 44, who failed to timely claim that the lack of security precluded the statutory taxpayer action, Cendroski raised this issue in her answer, her response to Sawyer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, her posttrial brief and proposed conclusions of law, and her response to Sawyer\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Bernard Mandel, for appellee and cross-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ao-dedup-0\">Joseph R. Klammer, Eastlake Law Director, for appellant and cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">{\u00b6 14} Therefore, the court of appeals did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably by denying Sawyer\u2019s request for attorney fees. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Appeal dismissed in part, and judgment affirmed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-5\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
