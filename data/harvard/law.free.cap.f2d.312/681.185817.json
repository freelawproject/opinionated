We hold that Judge Levet properly determined that $72,727.27 paid by the American Cyanamid Company to appellant as the widow of Raymond C. Gaugler, who was, at the time of his death, President of the Company, was not excludable from gross income as a gift under Section 22(b) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Findings of fact, conclusions of law and opinion are reported at 204 F.Supp. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-20\">Raymond C. Gaugler died suddenly on January 11, 1952 at the age of 60 after 30 years of service with the American Cyanamid Company, having become President in 1951. On January 16, 1952 the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors passed a Resolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>providing that \u201cvoluntary payments\u201d be made to Mrs. Gaugler, the widow, \u201cat the times and equal to the salary which would have been payable to Mr. Gaug-ler\u201d had he survived and continued employed during the period from January 11, 1952 to December 31, 1952. The minutes of the meeting recite that Mr. Towe, a Committee member, stated that \u201cit had been the practice in the event of the death of valued employees and officers with long service with the Company to pay, for varying lengths of time, their widows amounts equal to their salaries.\u201d Although no written plan existed, payments of $36,000, the exact amount of the salary of the decedents, had previously been made to the widows of Messrs. Landis and O\u2019Daniel, who had died while serving as Vice Presidents in 1944 and 1943 respectively; and payments of $64,837 had been made to the widow of Mr. Bell, who died while serving as President in 1950, this amount equalling his 1951 salary of $63,000 with a pro rata adjustment for part of 1950. Payments of $8,044 were also made to the widow of Mr. Murray, who died while serving as Assistant Treasurer in 1958 at a salary of $13,500, and payments to lesser officials and other employees were also made in varying amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Semi-monthly installments were subsequently paid to Mrs. Gaugler in her individual capacity at the times and equal in amount to the salary her husband would have received had he survived and continued employed through the balance of 1952. These payments were recorded as \u201cExecutive\u2019s Salaries\u201d on the Company\u2019s books, and a federal income tax deduction was taken therefor. Decedent had no legally enforceable right to any compensation other than the salary and bonus he had received in his lifetime, and Mrs. Gaugler had rendered no services to the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Mr. Martin, another Committee member, testified that he was a good friend of the Gauglers; that he had been shocked by decedent\u2019s sudden death and discussed with other Committee members the fact that decedent had increased his standard of living shortly before his death upon his assumption of the office of President, and that Mrs. Gaugler \u201cwould probably have a hard time adjusting to her new life\u201d; that although \u201cno obligation\u201d was felt, it was deemed advisable that a contribution be made to her to get her over the period of adjustment, and that a \u201creasonable amount\u201d as a \u201crule of thumb\u201d would be an amount equal to decedent\u2019s fixed salary for the balance of 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Mr. Martin also testified that past policy in the case of Mr. Bell had been discussed. Mr. Bell had remarried shortly before his death and his new wife, who had been a trained nurse, was suddenly elevated to a high standard of living;- and it was thought that she \u201cwould need some time for readjustment to her living standard.\u201d Mr. Martin also stated that he knew other officer and employee payments had been made, but that each case was \u201cconsidered on its own situation,\u201d and there was no previous understanding among the Committee members that such payments would be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">In addition and \u201cancillary to\u201d the \u201chumanitarian matter of giving her some money for a period of adjustment,\u201d Mr.' Martin testified, the Committee discussed the fact that it would be \u201cgood public relations in a negative way\u201d to make the payments, since the reputation of the Company would be hurt if it became known that no payments were made when the widow was \u201cstrapped and in difficulties.\u201d The \u201cmost direct\u201d harm, it was stated, would occur \u201cif it spreads around among the employees that the company doesn\u2019t consider in a humanitarian manner widows of employees and officers\u201d; the \u201cmost remote\u201d harm would be \u201cto the employment of future executives.\u201d However, no actual investigation of Mrs. Gaugler\u2019s financial circumstances or needs was ever undertaken. Finally, Mr.Martin testified that it was probably discussed and he'felt that the payments were deductible by the Company but not taxable to the widow; but that he knew nothing about the accounting or tax treatment of the payments since direc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>tions for payment had been given to the Treasurer or Vice President in charge of finances.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Mr. Towe testified by deposition that Mr. Martin had \u201cfairly stated the actuating considerations\u201d in making the payments; that he specifically remembered the discussion of the previous case of Mr. Bell; that \u201cmost emphatically\u201d failure to make the payments would have been \u201cmost adverse\u201d to the Company had such become general knowledge, and that it was a \u201cdecided benefit\u201d and the payments constituted a \u201cvery economical expenditure\u201d in insuring that the Company retain \u201cits excellent reputation as treating its employees fairly\u201d both in regard to the \u201cinvesting public\u201d on Wall Street and as affecting the Company\u2019s \u201cability to attract and retain people.\u201d Mr. Towe stated, however, that \u201cthe principal thing\u201d in his mind was the \u201chumanitarian consideration\u201d in helping Mrs. Gaug-ler adjust to her changed situation and considering also the great expenses of the Gauglers in assisting the families of four of their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Clearly the payments here constituted gross income within Section 22 (a) of the 1939 Code, and plaintiff bears the burden of proving that they fall within the gift exclusion of Section 22 (b) (3) and that the Commissioner\u2019s determination of deficiency is incorrect. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Jacobson, 1949, 336 U.S. 28, 48-49, 69 S.Ct. 358, 93 L.Ed. 477; Simpson v. United States, 7 Cir., 1958, 261 F.2d 497, 500, cert. denied, 1959, 359 U.S. 944, 79 S.Ct. 724, 3 L.Ed.2d 677; Stanton v. United States, 2 Cir., 1959, 268 F.2d 727, 729, reversed on other grounds, 1960, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218. In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, 1960, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (joint appeal with Stanton v. United States, supra), the Supreme Court set the guides to be considered in determining whether a payment is a gift, and explained also the scope of review of an appellate court in reviewing such a determination. It is quite clear from Judge Levet\u2019s opinion that he understood and applied these guides, and under the narrow scope of review which this Court exercises in these cases we cannot find any basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">In reaching his decision Judge Levet considered a number of clearly relevant factors: (1) the inconsistent accounting and tax treatment by the Company;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) the existence of a previous practice of making similar payments to widows of high officials of the Company;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) the computation of the payments in terms of the salary which would have been paid had decedent survived and continued his employment;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (4) the fact that the payments were made by a business corporation and that sound business reasons were considered in making them; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (5) the \u201cmoral duty\u201d implicit,in the special circumstances of the widow\u2019s need to readjust to a lower standard of living;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (6) the Company\u2019s failure to investigate the actual financial circumstances and needs of the widow.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-16\">Appellant, however, argues: that the inconsistent accounting and tax treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>ment was not specifically authorized, but only \u201cministerial\u201d in nature; that the use of decedent\u2019s salary as a measure was a \u201cmere rule of thumb\u201d without significance; that the previous payments on this record are far from establishing a \u201cplan\u201d or \u201cpractice\u201d; that it was specifically stated \u201cno obligation\u201d was felt in making the payments; and that there is no rule that corporate gifts can only be made to the impecunious and needy. In addition, affirmatively, appellant notes: (1) that the payments did not constitute compensation to which decedent or appellant was legally entitled; (2) that the Resolution recited that the payments were \u201cvoluntary\u201d; (3) that the Committee members thought the payments would be nontaxable to the widow; (4) that the payments were made to the widow directly rather than to the estate of decedent; (5) that the \u201chumanitarian aspects\u201d were considered and one member stated this was the \u201cprincipal thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AbZ\">We might address ourselves specifically to many of these points. For example, as to the contention respecting lack of authority of the subordinate officials responsible for the accounting and tax treatment, we may note that \u201cthe burden of proving their lack of authority, if such was the fact, was upon the taxpayer.\u201d Fisher v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1932, 59 F.2d 192, 193. So too, the donor\u2019s characterizations, while relevant, are not controlling or determinative. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, supra, 363 U.S. at 286, 80 S.Ct. at 1197. However, for the reasons set forth below, we find this exereise to be entirely unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Doubtless there is room for a reasonable difference of opinion. But that is no more than to say that, had the case been tried to a judge and jury, the question was one of fact for the jury to decide, as reasonable men might differ both as to the weight to be given to the various factors, depending perhaps on the credibility of one or more witnesses, and as to the inferences to be drawn from the facts as the jury found them to be. That Judge .Levet decided the factual questions thus presented would seem to dispose of the matter, unless he committed some error of law in the manner in which he approached or carried out the task of fact finding. Consequently, what is decisive to us, is the circumstance that he approached the task of fact finding and carried it to a conclusion in precisely the manner described as proper in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, supra, 363 U.S. at 285-289, 80 S.Ct. at 1196-1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">In reaching the conclusion that the impetus for the payments was \u201canticipated economic benefits as well as the impelling force of a moral duty,\u201d Judge Levet considered all the relevant factors, recognizing that each one is \u201cmerely a part of the overall factual determination.\u201d As the significance and evaluation of these factors depend \u201con the application of the fact-finding tribunal\u2019s experience with the main springs of human conduct,\u201d we must give \u201cprimary weight\u201d to the conclusions thus arrived at. Our power of review is \u201cquite restricted\u201d and we can only reverse if the findings are clearly erroneous. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, supra, 363 U.S. at 289-291, 80 S.Ct. 1198-1199; United States v. Stanton, 2 Cir., 1961, 287 F.2d 876, affirming, S.D.N.Y., 1960, 186 F.Supp. 393, on remand from Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, supra; Smith v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 778, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 904, 83 S.Ct. 208, 9 L.Ed.2d 165; Martin v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 290, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 904, 83 S.Ct. 209, 9 L.Ed.2d 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Appellant cites a number of cases where payments to a widow under analogous circumstances were held to constitute a gift. In some of these, however, the findings below were affirmed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Perhaps the others may be distinguished.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not think it would be profitable to discuss these other cases at length. We are content to follow and repeat what our brothers of the Third Circuit have said: \u201cWe cannot exceed the narrow function assigned to us, regardless of what others have done.\u201d Smith v.
