The defendant is a Rhode Island corporation engaged in the business of publishing a daily newspaper in the City of Providence. During the plaintiff\u2019s tenure in office the defendant published an editorial in its newspaper entitled \u201cFederal Agents Jumped the Gun in the Woo Case,\u201d in which it charged \u201cfederal agents\u201d with \u201cover-zealous enforcement of the immigration laws.\u201d The editorial starts with the concession that Mr. Woo was \u201cin trouble with the U. S. Immigration Service,\u201d that he had \u201cresorted to devious means\u201d in an \u201cattempt to thwart this country\u2019s Oriental exclusion policies\u201d and to \u201crealize his desire to live and work in this country\u201d and that \u201cmost recently, he has been the object of lengthy legal proceedings which have stalled off deportation.\u201d Following these concessions the editorial continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">\u201cThe point is that under existing law, Mr. Woo had every right to pursue these legal recourses. But all indications are that federal government agents were unwilling to allow his case to be heard to its conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-14\">\u201cThe record shows that Mr. Woo\u2019s attorneys filed an appeal from an adverse decision in federal court on February 27, four days before Mr. Woo was whisked out of Rhode Island aboard a plane bound for Hong Kong. It is true that his attorneys neglected to secure a stay order which would specifically prohibit Mr. Woo\u2019s removal. But a notice of the appeal was filed in the office of Joseph Mainelli, U. S. district attorney for Rhode Island.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-15\">\u201cThe district attorney now claims that the appeal unaccompanied by a stay order, was insufficient grounds for further delay of Mr. Woo\u2019s deportation. Technically, the district attorney is correct, as Judge Edward W. Day has affirmed. But it seems to us that this is a narrow view which overlooks a wider moral obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-16\">\u201cThe right of appeal, is, after all, a prime guarantee of fair treatment in the courts because it protects a defendant against an unfair judgment. Once having been set in motion it should be heard through to its conclusion. If this is so, then did not the district attorney, knowing that an appeal had been entered, have an obligation to intervene in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>case of Mr. Woo to make certain that this right was honored?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF\">Characterizing this editorial as a \u201cfalse, scandalous and defamatory libel\u201d the plaintiff brought the present action in the court below alleging damages in excess of $10,000. He drafted his complaint in five counts. In the first count he charges the defendant with \u201cmaliciously and corruptly\u201d endeavoring to \u201cobstruct, impede, influence and intimidate the plaintiff in the performance of his official duties.\u201d In Count 2 he charges a conspiracy with others unknown to accomplish the same end by the same means. In Count 3 he charges the defendant with unlawfully interfering with his contractual employment relationship with the United States Department of Justice by pointing out his unfitness for office wherefor he says he might be removed. In Count 4 he charges a conspiracy similar to that charged in Count 2 to accomplish his removal from office and in Count 5 he charges common law libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">In the absence of diversity of citizenship of the parties he seeks to invoke federal jurisdiction under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by alleging that his action arises under the laws of the United States, to wit, \u00a7 507 of Title 28 U.S.C. and \u00a7 1503 of Title 18 U.S.C. He says in his brief that his jurisdictional theory is that \u00a7 507 of Title 28 confers certain duties upon him as United States Attornejr and that \u00a7 1503 of Title 18 protects him in the discharge of those duties. The District Court did not agree and neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The court below in response to a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, dismissed the fifth count for lack of jurisdiction and, taking jurisdiction of the first four counts, primarily on the authority of Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946), dismissed them for failure to state a claim for relief. We agree that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint should be dismissed <em>in toto </em>but think the ground as to all counts should be lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Section 1503, supra, insofar as here material, imposes criminal penalties of fine or imprisonment upon \u201cWhoever corruptly, or by threats * * * or by any threatening * * * communication, endeavors to influence, intimidate, or impede any * * * officer in or of any court of the United States * * * in the discharge of his duty * * * [or by the same means] endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice * * It is clearly a criminal statute.- But even if we assume in disagreement with the District Court, which we by no means imply, that the statute indirectly and by inference gives a civil remedy to one harmed by its violation, it is clear from the complaint, which by reference includes the editorial, that the defendant has not violated the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">It is true that the plaintiff alleges in his complaint that the defendant acted \u201ccorruptly.\u201d But that word in a pleading, like the word \u201cfraudulently,\u201d is but a conclusory allegation of the pleader and as such is entitled to no weight without allegations of supporting facts, which are wholly lacking here. Aside from by means of corruption, undertakings \u201cto influence, intimidate, or impede\u201d must be by means of \u201cthreats or * * * threatening * * * communication,\u201d and the editorial contains no threats. It cannot by any stretch be called a threatening communication. It is merely rather temporate criticism which the statute does not forbid if it constitutionally could.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">On the face of the complaint itself it is evident that the claim of federal jurisdiction is wholly insubstantial and frivolous and could have been made only for jurisdictional purposes. In this situation under the exceptions to the general rule noted in Bell v. Hood, supra, at the bottom of page 682 and top of page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>683 of 327 U.S., at 776 of 66 S.Ct., the proper course is to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction without reaching the question whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted. There being no federal jurisdiction over the first four counts, there can, of course, be no pendent jurisdiction over the fifth count for common law libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court dismissing count five and vacating the judgment of that Court in the first four counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and remanding the ease to that Court for entry of a judgment dismissing those four counts for lack of federal jurisdiction. The ap-pellee recovers costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\">. \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
