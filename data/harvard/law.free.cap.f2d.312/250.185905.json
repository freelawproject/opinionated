The trial court sustained defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount establish jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">The facts are fully and accurately stated in the opinion filed by the late Judge Weber, E.D.Mo., 202 F.Supp. 190 (1961), and need not be restated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">Basically, plaintiff\u2019s position is that when the bonus awards were made to him he acquired a vested right therein, and regardless of subsequent events, such as his voluntary termination of employment and his later employment with a competitor of defendant, he was entitled to receive the full amount of the awards. The contention is also advanced that paragraph 8(a) of defendant\u2019s bonus plan is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Having analyzed the bonus plan under which the awards were made, having examined the record and briefs of the parties and the authorities upon which they rely, and having carefully reviewed other pertinent authorities, we are satisfied that paragraph 8(a) of the bonus plan is valid and, for the reasons stated in Judge Weber\u2019s opinion with which we are in full accord, we affirm. See and compare: Neuffer v. Bakery and Confectionery Workers Int. U., 113 U.S.App.D.C. 334, 307 F.2d 671 (1962); James D. Mooney, 9 T.C. 713 (1947); Parrish v. General Motors Corporation, Fla.
