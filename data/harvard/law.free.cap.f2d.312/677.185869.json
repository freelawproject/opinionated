In 1958 plaintiff reported a real estate commission of $8,800, precipitating a review of his social security status and resulting in a suspension by the Bureau of further payments and a direction of restitution of amounts previously paid to him in the years 1954 through 1957, totalling $4,620. Upon plaintiff\u2019s request a hearing was held on February 17, 1959. The Referee\u2019s Decision of April 15, 1959 affirmed the decision of the Board and held that plaintiff had received and was receiving wages in excess of $2,080 per annum, the amount at which benefits were to be totally suspended under Sections 203(b) and 203 (e) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 403(b) and 403(e). Upon denial of review by the Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration this decision became final and plaintiff then sought review in the District Court which dismissed his complaint, and he appeals. Opinion below reported at 205 F.Supp. 683. We hold this dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The evidence showed that when plaintiff filed his retirement claim, he was president, general manager, principal stockholder and the only paid employee of the Dondero Holding Company, Inc., a real estate corporation formed in 1930, whose principal assets were a parcel of improved real estate yielding an annual rental of $10,000 and bank accounts and securities yielding annual interest and dividends of $1,000. Plaintiff\u2019s salary of $4,200 and business expenses consumed most of the earnings. Plaintiff\u2019s apartment served as office, with light secretarial work performed without compensation by his wife. After his \u201cretirement\u201d in 1954, plaintiff\u2019s salary was reduced to $900 per annum and for the first time the wife was put on the payroll at $60 a week, although the somewhat minimal duties and services performed by each did not materially change and the plaintiff at all times remained the \u201cmoving force\u201d of the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">The Referee thought that plaintiff\u2019s testimony was discredited by the circumstances above outlined, and that the record established a \u201cscheme of shifting wages\u201d whereby plaintiff indirectly received \u201cremuneration which is, in effect, wages to him.\u201d We hold that these determinations were permissible and supported by substantial evidence as required under Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Newman v. Celebrezze, 2 Cir., 1962, 310 F.2d 780; Poss v. Ribicoff, 2 Cir., 1961, 289 F.2d 10, cert. denied, 368 U.S. 902, 82 S.Ct. 178, 7 L.Ed.2d 96, rehearing denied, 1962, 368 U.S. 963, 82 S.Ct. 393, 7 L.Ed.2d 393; Walker v. Altmeyer, 2 Cir., 1943, 137 F.2d 531, 533-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">In so holding, we reaffirm our prior statement in Newman v. Celebrezze, supra, that a claimant has the right to receive old-age benefits \u201cirrespective of any dividend or other non-wage payments he might receive.\u201d This principle, however, is inapplicable to the instant case since the joint income and corporation tax forms and the other relevant evidence established that the moneys, potentially payable as rents, dividends, and interest, with the attendant disadvantages involved in this form of distribution, were actually paid out and consistently treated as wages earned. Nor do we find in the decision below any attempt to penalize plaintiff for corporate or individual income tax procedures which may or may not be questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">The proceedings hitherto had, of course, constitute only an adjudication as of the time through which evidence was submitted, and are without prejudice to a new application by plaintiff based on a new set of facts. Newman v. Celebrezze, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
