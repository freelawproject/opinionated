During this same period,, applicant extensively promoted and advertised \u2018LIME CREST CALCITE CRYSTALS\u2019 feed supplement in farm, garden, and other trade journals and by the distribution of booklets, pamphlets, and the like, at a cost in excess of eight hundred thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-17\">\u201cThe poultry feed ingredient in connection with which applicant uses the notation \u2018CALCITE CRYSTALS\u2019 is crushed limestone in crystalline form. Limestone is a well-known mineral identified as and referred to in chemical textbooks as calcium carbonate. According to Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition (1947), \u2018Calcite\u2019 is defined as calcium carbonate crystallized in hexagonal form. \u2018Calcite\u2019 is described in The Condensed Chemical Dictionary, Fifth Edition, as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-18\">\u201c \u2018The most common form of natural calcium carbonate. Dog-tooth spar, Iceland spar, nailhead spar, and satin spar are varieties of <em>calcite crystal. </em>It is the essential ingredient of limestone, marble and chalk.\u2019 (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-19\">\u201cIt is apparent from the foregoing and excerpts from the Industrial Arts Index for the years 1931, 1939, and 1954 such as \u2018Variations in the grating constant of calcite crystals,\u2019 \u2018Quantitative measurement of the natural rate of growth of calcite crystals in geodes,\u2019 and \u2018Experimental deformation of calcite crystals,\u2019 respectively, that the notation \u2018CALCITE CRYSTALS\u2019 is not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>unusual or merely suggestive term as urged by applicant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">The board also pointed out that the appellant\u2019s containers for the goods bear the notation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-5\">\u201c100 Lbs. Net Shell-Producer Calcite Crystals\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">and that in advertising appellant refers to itself as the \u201cWorld\u2019s Largest Producer of Crystalline Calcite Crystals\u201d from which \u201cLime Crest Calcite Crystals\u201d and \u201cLime Crest Bam Calcite\u201d are its \u201ctwo Lime Crest quality products.\u201d These facts indicated to the board that \u201cCALCITE CRYSTALS\u201d is used merely as a name for the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">The appellant contends that the name of the goods is \u201climestone\u201d or \u201ccalcium carbonate\u201d and that \u201cCALCITE CRYSTALS\u201d may be exclusively appropriated as a trademark for a poultry feed ingredient since the mark is not descriptive of a poultry feed ingredient. To show that the mark has acquired a secondary meaning, twenty-five affidavits were submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">In considering the affidavits, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-9\">\u201cApplicant has made of record twenty-five substantially identical' affidavits from dealers in and users of applicant\u2019s poultry feed supplement, wherein each affiant sets forth how long he has been buying crushed limestone for use as a poultry feed; that during all this time, applicant has marketed a poultry feed ingredient made of limestone in bags bearing the words \u2018CALCITE CRYSTALS\u2019 ; that no other company selling crushed limestone, within his knowledge, has used these words, on its bags; and concludes that because of this long use he associates the words \u2018CALCITE CRYSTALS,\u2019 when used in connection with a poultry feed ingredient, only with applicant. While these affiants have asserted that they associate \u2018CALCITE CRYSTALS\u2019 with applicant, this cannot overcome the fact that \u2018CALCITE CRYSTALS\u2019 is a name for applicant\u2019s goods, and that such a name cannot be a trademark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">The board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-12\">\u201cThe record conclusively establishes that \u2018calcite crystals\u2019 is calcium carbonate or limestone in crystal form and that this notation is a common descriptive name for ground limestone used as a poultry feed ingredient and is so used by applicant. As such, it falls within the category of words, symbols, and devices which are not subject to exclusive appropriation as trademarks, and hence cannot acquire a secondary meaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">The record supports these findings of the board and we agree with the conclusions stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">In addition to the evidence pointed out by the board in support of its finding \u201cthat Calcite Crystals is calcium carbonate or limestone in crystal form and that this notation is a common descriptive name for ground limestone used as a poultry feed ingredient and is so used\u201d by appellant, the record abounds with other proof of similar purport and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">Reference to Addition to Record discloses that appellant describes and refers to the goods under consideration as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-16\">\u201cLime Crest Calcite Crystals are made from Franklin limestone, * * -x-_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-18\">\u201cFranklin limestone in the Lime Crest deposit is a coarsely <em>crystalline </em>rock and consists chiefly of calcite, or <em>crystalline </em>calcium carbonate. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-19\">* * * calcite from which the Lime Crest Calcite Crystals are made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-20\">The above is but illustrative of repeated references indicative that \u201cCalcite Crystals\u201d is not only descriptive of appellant\u2019s products but also is used by appellant as the name for the product itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-21\">The decisions of this court in In re Deister Concentrator Company, Inc., 289 F.2d 496, 48 CCPA 952, and Weiss Noodle Co. v. Golden Cracknel &amp; Special<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>ty Co., 290 F.2d 845, 48 COPA 1004, are apposite and controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
