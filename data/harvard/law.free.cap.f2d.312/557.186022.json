The Commissioner assessed the deficiencies after finding that a series of eleven unsecured cash advances totalling $1,022,-772.54 made from 1950 to 1953 by Elbe-co, at the time a wholly-owned subsidiary of Baumann, to Eastern Supply Company of New Jersey, Inc., also a subsidiary of Baumann, did not create a bona fide debt- or-creditor relationship. He accordingly disallowed Baumann\u2019s claim, based upon these advances, that Elbeco was entitled to a bad debt deduction for 1953, and to a net operating loss for 1953 which might be carried back to 1952, under Section 23 (k) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\"> The burden was on the taxpayer to establish his right to the deduction. Gilbert v. Commissioner, 262 F.2d 512 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 1002, 79 S.Ct. 1139, 3 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1959) ; Matthiessen v. Commissioner, 194 F.2d 659 (2 Cir., 1952). In a thorough opinion, the Tax Court determined that the taxpayer had failed to establish that right because it had failed to prove the creation of a bona fide indebtedness owing from Eastern to Elbeco. See Clark v. Commissioner, 205 F.2d 353 (2 Cir. 1953). It based that determination upon findings, <em>inter alia, </em>that no definite date was agreed upon for repayment of the advances; that although demand notes were given to Elbeco, no demand for repayment was ever made; that although other creditors of Eastern were repaid, none of the advances made by Elbeco to Eastern was repaid; that no interest was provided for and none was paid; and that no security to insure repayment was furnished Elbeco by Eastern.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">These findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record. They provide adequate basis for the conclusion that the parties \u2014 both subsidiaries of the parent Baumann \u2014 were not dealing at arm\u2019s length. Cf. Gilbert v. Commissioner, 248 F.2d 399 (2 Cir., 1957). The decision of the Tax Court accords with the analysis of the principles and decisions governing this area'which we recently made in Nassau Lens Co. v. Commissioner, 308 F.2d 39 (2 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>1962). No useful purpose would be served by duplicating that analysis here. The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
