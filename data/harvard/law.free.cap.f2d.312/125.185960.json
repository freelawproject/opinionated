Patou appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissing its complaint in which it charged defendant, Jacqueline Cochran, Inc., with trademark infringement and unfair competition. The complaint is based upon defendant\u2019s use, since 1959, of the legend \u201cJoy of Bathing\u201d in connection with the sale of a bath oil preparation. Federal jurisdiction rests upon 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114, 1121 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1338(a), 1338(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">On August 22, 1950, Joy was registered by Patou as a trade-mark for perfume and toilet water under the Lanham Act, 60 Stat. 427, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1127. The validity of that registration is not in dispute. Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s exclusive right to use the trade-mark for perfume and toilet water had become incontestable, pursuant to the provisions of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1065, 1115(b) prior to defendant\u2019s alleged infringement thereof. The primary issue between the parties, therefore, is whether Cochran\u2019s use of the legend \u201cJoy of Bathing\u201d is \u201clikely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin\u201d of its bath oil preparations. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1) (a); Avon Shoe Co., Inc. v. David Crystal, Inc., 279 F.2d 607, 614 (2 Cir. 1960). Based upon the facts hereinafter set forth, the trial court found that there was no significant likelihood of such confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Plaintiff and defendant are both national distributors of cosmetics and toilet preparations, but Patou does not market a bath oil in competition with defendant\u2019s product. Defendant\u2019s products, which include \u201cRadiant Masque,\u201d Eye Cream, Lipstick, Pressed Powder, Bath Oil and Make-Up, are normally marketed under the trademark designation \u201cFlowing Velvet.\u201d These products are normally offered for sale in similarly decorated pale blue packages prominently featuring the words Flowing Velvet and Jacqueline Cochran. On the boxes containing the bottles of defendant\u2019s bath oil these prominently featured customary marks appear, Flowing Velvet at the top, and Jacqueline Cochran at the bottom, but the additional words</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">Joy of Bathing bathe in fragrance as you bathe away dry skin</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">appear between these two legends. On the bottles the language \u201cbathe in fragrance as you bathe away dry skin\u201d is omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">Plaintiff does not contend that the over-all appearance of the bath oil bottle or the package containing it, or the overall appearance of any other packaged Cochran product, is at all similar to the dress or appearance of plaintiff\u2019s line. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Plaintiff offered no evidence of actual customer confusion between its products and defendant\u2019s bath preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We cannot say that the trial court was clearly in error in finding, upon these facts, that there was no significant likelihood of confusion as to the sources of plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s products. It is unnecessary for us to consider or to review the propriety of, or the weight to be given to, other findings of the trial judge. We do point out, however, that the finding of lack of likelihood of confusion is strengthened by the court\u2019s additional findings that the defendant did not intend to pass off its product as that of the plaintiff, and that it used the word \u201cJoy\u201d on its bath oil containers in a partially descriptive sense when it incorporated the word within the full legend \u201cJoy of Bathing\u201d \u201cbathe in fragrance as you bathe away dry skin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The judgment order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Subsequent to the entry of the judgment below, plaintiff made a timely motion under Rules 59 and 60(b), Fed.R. Civ.P. to amend the judgment, or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The motion was based on plaintiff\u2019s discovery that shortly prior to the date of the trial below, defendant had marketed a limited quantity of its bath oil in a bottle other than the one before the trial court. The bottle was similar to the one in evidence at trial save that the words \u201cFlowing Velvet\u201d had been omitted from the language on it, leaving only the words \u201cJacqueline Cochran\u201d and \u201cJoy of Bathing\u201d in prominent display, and it was being sold without being encased in the distinctive blue box characteristic of the Cochran line. The newly discovered evidence of these facts conflicted with defendant\u2019s testimony at trial that its bath oil was sold only under the trade-mark Flowing Velvet. After a rehearing and consideration of the newly-discovered evidence, the trial court adhered to its original decision and denied the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Although the alternative dress of defendant\u2019s bath oil raised a closer question of possible confusion than does its customary package, we cannot say that the trial court was clearly in error in failing to find that possibility a substantial one. The denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
