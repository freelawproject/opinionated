Appellant took no testimony, relying only upon its registration No. 557,946 granted April 22, 1952, to its predecessor Truscon Steel Company for the trademark \u201cTRUSCON.\u201d Appellee took testimony. In this connection we point out, however, that appellant-opposer seeks to rely on certain documentary material attached to the notice of opposition. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, invoking Rule 2.126 which provides that \u201c * * * exhibits attached to pleadings * * * [are not] considered as evidence * * * unless identified and introduced in evidence as other exhibits,\u201d declined to consider the documentary material. Accordingly, we will not consider these exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">The record discloses that appellee\u2019s mark \u201cTRUSS-SKIN\u201d is applied to elongated metal members which are deep-troughed and arched longitudinally. The elements may be joined together to form an arch to provide a building or roof system of any desired length. The arches are self-supporting and their use displaces the function of internal braces, trusses, or posts. These members are the only items to which the mark is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">Appellant\u2019s trademark \u201cTRUSCON,\u201d registered April 22, 1952, is applied to products made of steel and other materials, described by the board.as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-14\">\u201c * * * plain deformed and sheared steel bars as reinforcing elements for concrete; sheet steel forms of longitudinally arched formation to be laid side by side to provide continuous long span construction and individual units of both longitudinally and transversely arched formation to be used as elements of concrete floor construction; column-hooping for reinforcing concrete columns; pressed-steel beams, joists, studs, plates, and channels for use in walls, ceilings, or floors of all types of building; windows and parts thereof; doors, panels, and partitions; joist and wall hangers; trusses; columns, and girders; steel roofing and steel flooring; panels of insulation externally covered by steel sheets for use in walls, ceilings and roofs; and stairs and treads.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-16\">There is no issue of prior use. Appellant\u2019s use of \u201cTRUSCON\u201d antedates appellee's use of \u201cTRUSS-SKIN\" by many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-17\">The basic issue is: Whether the concurrent use by appellee of its mark on the goods described, would be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers in view of the use by appellant of its mark on the products listed in its registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>In dismissing the opposition, the board found and held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-4\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s \u2018TRUSS - SKIN\u2019 arched metal panels and the various steel products identified in opposer\u2019s registration ordinarily would be promoted and advertised to architects, builders, contractors, and other members of the construction industry; applicant\u2019s panels and many of op-poser\u2019s \u2018TRUSCON\u2019 steel products are competitive in character to the extent that the use of applicant\u2019s product would eliminate the need for such products as steel trusses; columns and girders; steel roofing; steel joists and wall hangers; and panels of insulation externally covered by steel sheets for use in walls, ceilings, and roofs; and applicant\u2019s panels and opposer\u2019s \u2018TRUSCON\u2019 windows, doors, partitions, reinforcing rods, and like goods could be used in the same structure. Under these circumstances, applicant\u2019s panels and opposer\u2019s steel products are likely to be attributed to a common source if they were to be sold under the same or similar marks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-5\">\u201c \u2018TRUSS-SKIN\u2019 and \u2018TRUS-CON\u2019, however, do not look alike, and while they are somewhat similar in sound, they are readily distinguishable in this respect. Moreover, if any suggested meaning could be attributed to each of these marks, it is apparent that one would not suggest the other. Considering, therefore, the differences between the marks \u2018TRUSS-SKIN\u2019 and \u2018TRUS-CON\u2019 and that goods of the type marketed thereunder usually are purchased with care and by technically trained and/or informed persons, it is concluded that confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers is not reasonably likely to occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Appellant contends that the marks \u201cTRUSCON\u201d and \u201cTRUSS-SKIN\u201d are confusingly similar in sound, appeai-ance, and meaning. Both marks have in common \u201cTRUS\u201d and \u201cTRUSS,\u201d but we cannot conclude that this resemblance is determinative of the issue here. Looking at the marks in their entirety, as we must do, they are strikingly dissimilar in appearance. They simply do not look alike. \u201cTRUSCON\u201d is one word, while \u201cTRUSS-SKIN\u201d consists of two hyphenated words conveying an impressionable distinction in appearance. \u201cTRUSS\u201d and \u201cSKIN\u201d are commonly used words of the English language with definite meanings. \u201cTRUSCON\u201d is not identified with.the English language and is devoid of meaning. It would strain credulity to endeavor to merge the two marks together in sound. It appears to us that normal or casual pronunciation would distinctly emphasize a difference in sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Appellant urges that when the two marks are applied to competitive goods in the field of construction materials, they convey similar mental and commercial impressions of a trussed construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">It is our view that \u201cTRUSCON\u201d of itself carries no connotation so as to stimulate any image or suggestion when looked upon by the average viewer. Appellee\u2019s goods are advertised as being \u201ctrussless\u201d since they are self-supporting arched structural members. Appellee produced testimony of record that \u201cthe actual derivation of the expression originally came from the field, exactly where I don\u2019t know, but it was around the time of one of our first roof systems and in the expression itself, \u2018TRUSS-SKIN,\u2019 we connote a skin with a truss built in.\u201d It would be difficult, indeed, to conclude that a member advertised as trussiess would convey an impression, even to the most unwary, of a trussed construction. If, as appellant contends, \u201cTRUSCON\u201d conveys an impression of a trussed construction, both the record and logic negates such an attribute to \u201cTRUSS-SKIN.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">The decision of this court in Goodall-Sanford, Inc. v. Tropical Garment Manufacturing Co., 275 F.2d 736, 47 CCPA 821, carries much persuasion. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-11\">\u201c * * * \u2018Royal Palm\u2019 does not look or sound like \u2018Palm Beach\u2019; and the two marks do not stimulate similar associations. These facts lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>to a conclusion that there is no likelihood of confusion or mistake of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The use of the mark on appellee\u2019s goods began in January 1957. Appellee\u2019s trade in goods bearing the mark hab been nationwide with considerable foreign distribution aggregating a value in excess of a million dollars annually. Advertising costs have exceeded two-hundred thousand dollars. The record discloses that no instance of actual confusion among purchasers as to the sources of the goods bearing their respective marks has ever come to the attention of the appellee. In addition to this circumstance, the goods are of a character usually purchased with care and discernment by technically trained persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Appellant urges that all doubts should be resolved in its favor on the theory of prior use and the good will which attaches to \u201cTRUSCON,\u201d citing the case of Skelly Oil Co. v. Powerine Co., 86 F.2d 752, 24 CCPA 790. As we have pointed out, we perceive no doubt that the two marks are distinctively different in spelling and appearance as well as in sound of pronunciation. Dissimilarity is again punctuated in consideration of the origin and connotation of appellee\u2019s mark when compared with the absence of connotation of appellant's mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">Appellant cites Bordo Products Co. v. B. A. Railton Co., 173 F.2d 981, 36 CCPA 1059, and Wincharger Corp. v. Rinco, Inc., 297 F.2d 261, 49 CCPA 849. An examination of these cases discloses that they are not in point when measured in the light of the facts and circumstances of the instant ease. Bordo presents an obvious distinction as to the class of purchasers. In the Wineharger Corp. case the marks \u201cWINCO\" and \u201cRINCO\u201d are so similar in appearance, spelling and sound as to smother distinction when pronounced. When two marks are so nearly identical, they might well produce confusion even among a discriminating group of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">We agree with the board that the goods of the type to which the marks \u201cTRUSS-SKIN\u201d and \u201cTRUSCON\u201d attach are usually purchased with care by technically trained and/or informed persons; even though they are competitive in character to the extent that the use of appel-lee\u2019s product would eliminate the need for some of the products of the appellant and appellee\u2019s panels and some of appellant\u2019s goods could be used in the same structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">In our opinion the marks \u201cTRUSS-SKIN\u201d and \u201cTRUSCON\u201d are readily distinguishable by reason of their dissimilarity in appearance, sound, meaning and connotation. It is our judgment that the concurrent use of the marks on the products with which they are identified would not be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source or origin of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">We therefore affirm the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
