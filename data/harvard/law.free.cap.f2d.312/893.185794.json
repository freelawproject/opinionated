Usually we enter an order which merely notes those judges dissenting, in this ease Judges CLARK, SMITH and MARSHALL. Judge CLARK has set out his dissenting views at some length. As his characterization of our record in granting or denying in banc review seems to me inaccurate and incomplete, I think it desirable to add a statement of my own. What follows represents my own views.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-23\">Since an in banc hearing was first granted in this Circuit in 1956 in In re Lake Tankers, Corp., 2 Cir., 235 F.2d 783, aff\u2019d 354 U.S. 147, 77 S.Ct. 1269, 1 L.Ed.2d 1246 (1957), the members of this court have been alert to those issues and cases which might require in banc consideration. We have become sensitive to the added problems created by the increase in the number of active judges to nine, which has greatly increased the possibility that the decision of a panel may reflect the view of only a minority of the members of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-24\">A summary of the 30 cases which this court has heard in banc (see appendix to this opinion) demonstrates that Judge CLARK\u2019s generalization that \u201cprosecutors and prison officials have traditionally had first call, and important property issues are given careful consideration,\u201d while \u201cseamen\u2019s claims have practically no chance at all of <em>in banc </em>hearing\u201d distorts the actual record.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-25\">More than one-third of our 30 in banc cases have been in the field of criminal law \u2014 5 involved federal criminal law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 6 involved review of or possible interference with state criminal prosecutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Approximately another one-third, or 9 cases, have involved the construction of federal statutes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and an additional 3 have involved questions of federal procedure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Of the remaining 6 cases, 3 have involved seamen,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the others were concerned with the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, art. 4, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the conduct of civil trials,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> labor arbitration,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and admiralty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-26\">With a recent average of about 380 arguments each year, it is apparent that the court must strictly limit the number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>of those cases which engage the attention of all nine judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The most important criterion for granting an in banc hearing is whether the case involves an issue likely to affect many other cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Mere disagreement, or likelihood of disagreement, with the panel decision, has not generally been regarded as sufficient reason for a further hearing, although that is naturally one factor which is given some weight in our votes. In many cases the dissenting judge has opposed an in banc hearing because of the feeling that the question did not warrant the time of all the judges. Conversely, judges have voted to refer to the whole court their own majority opinions or those of other judges with which they agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The overwhelming majority of cases considered in banc do not lend themselves to being categorized as giving \u201cfirst call\u201d to \u201cprosecutors and prison officials\u201d or as involving \u201cimportant property issues.\u201d Labelling of this kind is scarcely appropriate for the vast majority of cases before us, which involve an amalgam of public and private litigants\u2019 interests, general questions of law, and issues of particular fact. Judges, no more than anyone else, see all cases in the same light; what to one of us seems to merit full court consideration for one reason, will present to another an entirely different demand on the full court\u2019s attention, and to a third will appear unworthy of being carried beyond the decision of a panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">I do not understand Judge CLARK\u2019s statement that clarification of our in banc procedure is not provided by a consideration of \u201cthe nature of the issue\u201d involved in these cases. As I understand the purpose of in banc review, the precise question which controls our decision whether or not to adopt this extraordinary procedure is whether a case presents an issue of sufficient concern to enough litigants who are or may become involved in similar situations so that the even-handed administration of justice will be benefited by a decision by the entire court. The \u201chuman element\u201d on which Judge CLARK focuses is, of course, present in every case, whether considered in banc or not. But it is not the basis on which in banc review has been, or should be, granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">The simple fact is that most seamen\u2019s cases present no issue of legal principle; the controlling questions usually involve the application of accepted principles to the facts. Here, the vote of six judges to deny the petition means only that in the light of all the pertinent considerations they feel that the questions presented are not important enough to warrant further consideration. While we all must, and do, respect and consider the views of our brethren as to the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>which are of such compelling importance as to justify a departure from the regular panel procedure, none of us can abdicate his responsibility to determine this question for himself in each case which arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">1.

Thus Schaefer (Case No. 2), was heard in banc because it raised \u201can important question of practice and procedure going beyond the fortunes of this particular case.\u201d In McWeeney (Case No. 14), the three panel members joined in referring for in banc \u201csince similar issues arise frequently in trials in this circuit. * * *\u201d in Apuzzo (Case No. 3), we said that the operative factor was the \u201cpotential importance in the administration of the criminal law,\u201d 2 Cir., 245 F.2d 416. In Goi'i (Case No. 13), it was our belief that \u201cthe case presented a general problem important to the administration of justice in this circuit.\u201d In Santore (Case No. 15), it was the importance of the questions raised in the .administration of the narcotic laws. In United States v. Jones (Case No. 24), it was \u201cto clear up any confusion that might exist as to our previous interpretations\u201d of the narcotic statutes. In Brown v. Bullock (Case No. 16), the issue was considered to be \u201cnovel and of public as well as private importance.\u201d In Winston v. United States (Case No. 20), the reason for granting in banc was stated to be the importance of the issue and the fact that the panel decision was in conflict with decisions of two other courts of appeals and several district courts. In Foti (Case No. 25), the important consequences of the decision were noted. In Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co. (Case No. 22), a conflict with a recent dictum and the constantly recurring nature of the problem in the district courts were the reasons for granting in banc. 2 Cir., 300 F.2d at 463.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b960-20\">CLARK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AeA\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-21\">I dissent from the order denying the petition for a rehearing <em>in banc. </em>In view of the anomalies of our <em>in banc </em>procedure, illustrated in an increasing number of cases of which this is a crowning example, it seems desirable, if not necessary, to point out where we seem to have arrived or to be tending. And I believe our cases show a clear trend toward a denial of <em>in banc </em>for, and of prejudicial discrimination against, <em>inter alios, </em>Jones Act plaintiffs which is increasing as our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>cases multiply. The situation assumes more urgency when we note that here a minimum of four judges has shown discontent with the decision and that the number so feeling may well be more, since only two judges are on record as approving it. Thus a minority decision, of doubtful character as pointed out below, becomes frozen in as the law of the Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">In theory, proceedings <em>in banc </em>should be a handy means whereby a multi-judge court resolves differences of theory to present a united front to the bar and lower courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In our practice it just does not work out that way. In view of the load of business we have, it is entirely impracticable to hear every case <em>in banc </em>where anyone desires that course. Hence there comes an inevitable question of choice. It is here that on the record our increasingly discriminatory attitude appears. To generalize, it is clear that prosecutors and prison officials have traditionally had first call,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and important property issues are given careful consideration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the other hand, seamen\u2019s claims have practically no chance at all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>of <em>in banc </em>hearing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> though these cases are now the most debated of all issues within the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The area of Jones Act litigation is one where for a number of reasons we ought to be particularly responsive to requests for full court review. First, these are cases of great importance, often involving serious limitations on the right of trial by jury, and of course of serious moment to the parties, including usually a seriously injured plaintiff and his dependents. In point of fact, further review of these cases by the Supreme Court is unusual, and certiorari for the most part is not even sought.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is well known that there is a widely held professional view, apparently shared by a minority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>the Court, that it ought not to spend time to hear personal injury cases. But this should make us even more assiduous in seeing that full review is had in our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Second, <em>in banc </em>procedure is particularly desirable here because in the cases which the Supreme Court has reviewed and reversed, my brothers are showing a surprising reluctance to accept the meaning of the decisions as applied to any case except the single one in which it is rendered. An unusual example flows from the reversal in Salem v. U. S. Lines Co., 370 U.S. 31, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 8 L.Ed.2d 313, of our reversal of a jury award in Salem v. U. S. Lines Co., 2 Cir., 293 F.2d 121, a holding that the plaintiff was not required to produce expert evidence as to the need for certain rigging of the ship. We accepted this result and restored the verdict in Salem v. U. S. Lines Co., 2 Cir., 304 F.2d 672. But even though I asked for an <em>in banc </em>hearing at least to consider the bearing of this Supreme Court decision, such rehearing of our just rendered decision upsetting findings of fact and an award below was denied in Nuzzo v. Rederi, A/S Wallenco, Stockholm, Sweden, 2 Cir., 304 F.2d 506, 511. I am at a loss to understand why the Supreme Court decision was not controlling in the Nuzzo case or what the grounds of distinction could possibly be. This seems an extreme example of our practice to consider each case as an isolated happening, so that reversals of our reversals below are held without significance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> So as a matter of cold statistics it follows that no matter how erroneous a ruling of ours on the debated issue of seaworthiness may be, its chances of review and reversal are slight, probably well under 5 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">A final powerful reason for full review \u2014 a reason which each one of my colleagues has found adequate justification from time to time for <em>in banc </em>in cases of special interest to him \u2014 is that the panel decision seems to me clearly in error. This is but another instance where this court has shown itself unwilling to adjust to the modern conception of unseaworthiness as defined by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It should always be borne in mind that we are not now dealing with the plaintiff\u2019s recovery; instead we are concerned with the right of trial by jury and how far an issue of fact can be taken from the jury. Here the asserted limitation surely presents a jury issue. If an assault by one seaman on another with a knife or brandy bottle presents a jury issue, I am at a loss to see how an equally deadly attack accomplished by the skillful use of the bare hand or hands <em>as a matter of law </em>cannot show the ship unseaworthy. I am in hearty accord with Judge Friendly\u2019s persuasive dissent, 2 Cir., 309 F.2d 191, 195, 197 \u2014 except for his gratuitous urging of a Congressional \u201crevision of the law in this area that is so long overdue,\u201d an issue outside our province where we ought not to be taking sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">1 am glad that Chief Judge LOMBARD has now taken occasion to examine this situation with care in his accompanying opinion; the more light we may have upon it, the higher probability that we shall arrive at a correct or at least an operable procedure. But the classification selected by the Chief Judge is uninformative, if not misleading. He concentrates entirely upon the nature of the issue in each case, overlooking the human element, the actual litigants affected by the result. Classification according to the nature of the issue gets us nowhere, since we have reached no agreement as to which issues are important; note, for example, my brothers\u2019 reaction to my view that the problem of unseaworthiness in Jones Act cases is presently the most important one before this court. It seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>to me that we must regard as important every issue so viewed by one or more of the active judges. (Throughout I am omitting as not in point all reference to those numerous cases where counsel have sought <em>in banc </em>proceedings without obtaining the affirmative vote of a single active judge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>) But in viewing the impact of our practice it is of great importance to observe \u2014 as the Chief Judge does not \u2014 (a) who is able to secure <em>in banc </em>hearings and (b) who is not. Thus it seems informative to learn that a public prosecutor has an excellent chance of securing this form of review, while a seaman has almost none. This information appears in my footnotes 2, 3, and 4 supra. In fact denial of <em>in banc </em>tells more than its grant in these cases, for it shows that even where the issue is controversial and important (as it surely is where the court so sharply divides, notwithstanding the Chief Judge\u2019s implication to the contrary) nonetheless <em>in banc </em>will be denied to disfavored applicants. Thus upon what basis can we support denial of a state prisoner\u2019s application seeking full-court review of the <em>overturning </em>of a careful and reasoned district court finding of trial unfairness, as in the Brown case, while it is quickly granted to reverse such a finding by an experienced trial judge, now our colleague, in the Reid case, or to overturn a panel\u2019s reversal of a conviction as based on an improper admission of a confession in the Coppola case \u2014 all set forth in my note 2 supra ? These and other diverse rulings hardly grant the litigants before us the benefit of that \u201cevenhanded administration of justice\u201d to which the Chief Judge alludes and which we all wish to afford.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">The present case on the debated issue of unseaworthiness presents the problem acutely. Although it appears to satisfy all the criteria even hinted at by the Chief Judge, such as number and importance of the cases coming to us, our distinguished colleague evinces an intent to veto all <em>in banc </em>hearings in seamen\u2019s cases, since \u201cThe simple fact is that most seamen\u2019s cases present no issue of legal principle; the controlling questions usually involve the application of accepted principles to the facts.\u201d Surely this is quite in error. The question is one of <em>law </em>\u2014 and indeed quite important law\u2014 where there has been a refusal to follow \u201caccepted principles\u201d as to trial by jury or the respect to be accorded a trial judge\u2019s findings. If the case were actually one involving only the resolution of facts in a single case I should not be trying so desperately to secure full court review of our handling of this issue. But the cases appearing in my notes 4, 5, and 7 supra show a denial of trial rights accorded by Supreme Court precedents, even a refusal to consider or discuss pertinent decisions, as in the Nuzzo case stated above, Nuzzo v. Rederi, A/S Walletico, Stockholm, Sweden, 2 Cir., 304 F.2d 506, 511. Naturally I do not enjoy dissenting, but I do not see any other way to bring to the surface these cases actually making the law of the Circuit contrary to what seemingly a majority of the court really believes. I could contemplate with some equanimity a return to our old practice of never granting <em>in banc </em>procedure if such a course can be held legal under the statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(c). But I do feel a responsibility to oppose as I can the present discriminatory selection of cases for favored treatment which results in such a distortion of the law of this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">I would grant the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-6\">.
