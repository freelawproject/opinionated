On June 13, 1962, and after the expiration of the period for timely appeal had run, appellant filed a motion requesting that he be furnished, at the expense of the United States, \u201ca transcript and certified copy of the records and trial minutes filed * * * \u201d and asserting \u201cthat each and all of the said records are necessary and material to his defense in instituting an action in the United States Courts.\u201d The motion was supported by an affidavit of im-pecuniosity and affiant\u2019s statement that he believed himself entitled to the redress sought. The trial court denied the motion without a hearing and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">The trial court was manifestly correct in denying appellant\u2019s motion without a hearing. The statutory authority of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915 grants the power to the courts of the United States to furnish transcripts and other documents of record in actions proceeding in forma pauperis only as direct and necessary aids to the particular action. There is no statutory authority under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 753, or elsewhere, allowing the expenditure of government funds as an aid to impecunious persons exploring the possibility of post conviction remedies. In the case at bar there is no pending appeal and the period for timely appeal has expired; nor is there any judicial action or order to which the authority of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915 could attach.
