The District Court held that the contract sued on was not under seal, and that therefore this action was barred because the three-year period of limitation had run. Simonson insists the contract was under seal and so was subject to the twelve-year period of limitation which has not expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-21\">The corporate seal of the International Bank was affixed but there was no other seal, and no recital or other indication that the execution of a sealed instrument was intended by the bank. In these circumstances, we hold the contract is not a sealed instrument. Sigler v. Mt. Vernon Bottling Co., 104 U.S.App.D.C. 260, 261 F.2d 378 (1958); Brown v. Commercial Fire Insurance Co., 21 App.D.C. 325, 336 (1903).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
