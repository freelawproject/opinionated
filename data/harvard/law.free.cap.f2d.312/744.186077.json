This appears to be conceded by the United States by the first footnote in its original brief, in which it states that the Government \u201cis prosecuting its appeal only as to one of the issues decided below, and, therefore, the amount of taxes involved in this appeal is somewhat less than the amount of the judgment below.\u201d The prior judgment of this Court, 310 F.2d 111, providing that the case was remanded for entry of judgment for the appellant, is therefore modified to the extent that it shall read: \u201cThe judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-28\">In all other respects this petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b808-29\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
