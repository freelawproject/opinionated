Y. Tookes, deceased, for income taxes of the decedent by a transferee assessment of something over $100,000 against the appellant, the widow of the deceased. In a suit brought by the holder of a mortgage given by the appellant, the District Director of Internal Revenue intervened. Upon foreclosure sale there was a realization of $2,-788.47 in excess of the amount payable to the holder of the mortgage. This amount was paid to the District Director and applied by him upon the transferee assessment. The appellant filed a claim for refund to contest the validity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>transferee assessment. The claim was rejected and suit was brought in the district court. The district court held that the suit could not be maintained for the refund of a partial payment of a tax assessment. The suit was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">It is here urged by the appellant that the facts here present take the case out of the rule announced in the Flora opinions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are in agreement with the district court that the Flora rule is applicable and controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-15\">.
