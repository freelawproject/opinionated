It is settled law that \u201cThe granting or denying of a preliminary injunction rests in the sound judicial discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed upon appeal \u2018unless contrary to some rule of equity, or the result of an improvident exercise of judicial discretion\u2019.\u201d Joseph Bancroft &amp; Sons Co. v.
