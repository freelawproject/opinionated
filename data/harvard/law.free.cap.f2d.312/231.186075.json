Jones </em>at Gowanus Creek, New York Harbor, where the <em>Jones </em>was undergoing extensive overhaul. On February 25, 1958, appellee\u2019s tugboats shifted the <em>Jones </em>out of drydock and towed her to a nearby pier. Appellant claims that in the course of this maneuver, appellee negligently towed the <em>Jones </em>over and against a rocky bottom, resulting in damage to her hull and propeller.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-24\">The burden of proof that damage to the <em>Jones </em>was sustained on February 25, 1958 was, of course, on the libelant. There was persuasive evidence that there was no rock or stony material under water in the area of the alleged accident against which the <em>Jones </em>could have scraped. The testimony of witnesses at the scene where the accident was supposed to have occurred was conflicting. Neither the pilot nor disinterested Naval personnel aboard the <em>Jones </em>felt any bumping or scraping. Of course, the trial judge could disbelieve the contrary assertions of appellant\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-25\">The conclusion of the trial court that the appellant had failed to show that the damage was sustained as alleged was not clearly erroneous, and must, accordingly, be affirmed. McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, 20, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20 (1954); see Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
