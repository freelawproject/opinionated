The contact between the jurors and the State\u2019s witness raised questions about the jurors\u2019 ability to reach an impartial verdict, and the trial judge failed to resolve the factual questions raised by the contact. Accordingly, we shall hold that, in failing to conduct an inquiry, the trial judge abused his discretion in denying Dillard\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Contacts between jurors and witnesses during the course of a trial about the content of a witness\u2019s testimony create an appearance of impropriety that undermines the integrity of the trial system, and thus factual questions about the jurors\u2019 ability to reach an impartial verdict that are raised by such contacts must be resolved by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The underlying facts of the present case, as established at trial, are not at issue before this Court. We adopt the facts as presented by the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">[0]n the evening of November 30, 2006, officers from the Charles County Sheriffs Office executed a search and seizure warrant for 3125 Lewis Place. The warrant was issued based on police surveillance of the residence and their observation of what appeared to be several drug transactions. The residents of the house included Dillard\u2019s cousin, Bertha Newman, who owned the house; her sons, Taras and Brian Gray; and Taras\u2019s girlfriend and daughter. Dillard was not listed on the warrant, but he was present at the house when the police conducted their surveillance, and he was arrested when the police executed the warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">Corporal Haven Smith, Jr., of the Charles County Sheriffs Office Narcotics Enforcement Section, was the State\u2019s primary witness [at Dillard\u2019s trial]---- [Smith testified that], at around 5:00 p.m. Dillard pulled up to the house in a Pontiac Bonneville, spoke to the three men on the porch, and then went inside, without knocking.... [After some time], Dillard emerged from the house and approached the men in the Taurus [which had pulled into the driveway while he was inside]. From a distance of about twenty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>twenty-five feet, Smith saw [one of the vehicle\u2019s occupants] hand something to Dillard, which Dillard put in his \u201cfront right ... pants pocket.\u201d In exchange, Dillard placed a small object in Stapleton\u2019s hand. From his vantage point, Smith could not identify the object. But, based on his training, Smith concluded that Dillard and [the vehicle\u2019s occupant] had engaged in a drug transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asd\">After observing what he believed to be several drug transactions over the course of a few hours, Smith decided to execute the warrant.... After the Team secured the house, Smith and other officers entered and saw Dillard \u201con the ground in the kitchen in handcuffs.\u201d Smith recovered from [Dillard\u2019s] \u201cleft sock\u201d a \u201cbag of marijuana,\u201d valued at $20, as well as $154 in cash from his right front pants pocket.... In the rear middle bedroom [where Smith had seen a light go on and off prior to Dillard\u2019s transactions], Smith observed \u201ca shot gun\u2014rested up against the wall.\u201d With regard to the search of that bedroom, Smith testified: \u201cFrom the closet area [Captain Daniel Gimler and I] recovered\u2014a quantity [1.3 grams] of crack cocaine, two digital scales with [cocaine] residue on them, numerous new and unused small glassine baggies. Two razor blades with\u2014 what appeared to be [cocaine] residue on them and\u2014a small quantity of marijuana____And some rubber gloves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\"><em>Dillard v. State, </em>No. 1578, slip. op. at 2-6 (Md.Ct.Spec.App. Feb. 11, 2009) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Dillard was charged with possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, possession of marijuana, conspiracy to distribute cocaine, possession of paraphernalia, and possession of a firearm in relation to drug trafficking. Detective Smith, the State\u2019s primary witness, testified to the facts described above at Dillard\u2019s trial. The day after Smith testified, the State called Sergeant Robert Kiesel as an expert in the distribution and use of crack cocaine. Kiesel, the State\u2019s final witness, testified to the \u201cstreet value\u201d of the drugs and his opinion that the drugs recovered in the raid were intended for distribution. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the parties completed their questioning of Sergeant Kiesel, the court recessed for lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The incident underlying the controversy before us occurred during the lunch recess. Upon returning from the recess, the State informed the trial judge about the incident and the following occurred outside of the jury\u2019s presence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">The Court: Okay. You ladies met with me and said there was an issue that probably needs addressing\u2014before we bring the jury back in here. Who wants to go first? Ms. Piper [State\u2019s Attorney] you were the reporter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">[The State]: Yes, Your Honor. Your Honor\u2014Detective Smith and Sergeant Kiesel\u2014reported to me that\u2014when we broke for lunch that\u2014two jurors walked by\u2014as the jurors were walking by two of them\u2014patted\u2014Detective Smith on the back and said, \u201cGood job.\u201d In response Detective Smith did nothing. He didn\u2019t comment on it. He didn\u2019t look at them. He looked\u2014he kept\u2014they were walking by. He kept walking his direction, they\u2019re walking opposite directions. He didn\u2019t acknowledge it. He didn\u2019t comment on it. He didn\u2019t say anything\u2014and\u2014that\u2019s what we have. The Court: Should any kind of inference be drawn from that kind of remark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">[The State]: I don\u2019t think so Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">The Court: Ms.\u2014Cawood [defense counsel], what\u2019s your reaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">[Defense]: Your honor, I think that it\u2014these two particular jurors obviously are not\u2014inclined to follow the proper court protocol and I\u2019m concerned that the jurors may poison the rest of the jury with their type of behavior and tactics and as such I[ ] ... request a mistrial because there\u2019s only one alternate juror and there were two jurors who were apparently engaged in this kind of\u2014jury misconduct. Though I would acknowledge that there is no inappropriate State action, the action of the jurors themselves would be the basis for my Motion for a Mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">In the alternative, what I would request and I would request this while still maintaining my Motion for a Mistri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>al,\u2014that one of the jurors\u2014perhaps whichever one initiated it, be replaced with the alternate as there is one alternate. That may at least break up the\u2014seeming monopoly of these two jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The State responded, arguing that there was no misconduct because the jurors had not violated any instruction from the court. Further, the State asserted that there was no taint because the jurors had not made a specific comment about their opinions of Dillard\u2019s guilt, and even if the comments demonstrated prejudice, a curative instruction would correct the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">At Dillard\u2019s request, the trial judge brought the jurors into the courtroom so Detectives Smith and Kiesel could identify, for the court, the jurors that contacted him. Dillard\u2019s attorney then questioned the officers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">[Defense]: Which [juror said \u201cGood job\u201d] first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">Detective Kiesel: 194.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">Detective Smith: The elderly gentleman said it to me first. The other juror wasn\u2019t in view when he said it. The other juror was around the corner. It was in passing. Everybody was walking by.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Dillard then renewed the Motion for a Mistrial, arguing that the juror\u2019s contact demonstrated that the jurors might be \u201cinfluenced\u201d by each other, or that they had discussed the merits of the case prematurely.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">The trial judge denied Dillard\u2019s request for a mistrial, and declined Dillard\u2019s request to replace one of the two jurors involved in the incident with the alternate. The jury convicted Dillard of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, and possession of marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury found Dillard not guilty of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, possession of paraphernalia, and possession of a firearm in relation to drug trafficking. The court sentenced Dillard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>twelve years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but six years suspended, and five years of supervised probation upon release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Dillard appealed his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court held that, although Dillard preserved for appellate review his claim that the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to grant his motion for a mistrial, Dillard failed to preserve his complaint that the trial judge did not conduct a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jurors because he failed to request such an examination. Further, the intermediate appellate court held that the trial judge did not err or abuse his discretion in denying Dillard\u2019s request for a mistrial. In the intermediate appellate court\u2019s view, the jurors in question did not engage in any misconduct because they did not violate the trial judge\u2019s instructions by talking to Detective Smith. Additionally, according to the Court of Special Appeals, the jurors\u2019 conduct was \u201cneither nefarious nor prejudicial\u201d on its face, and was not extended in length. Thus, the intermediate appellate court held that Dillard had not advanced a reason to presume prejudice based on the jurors\u2019 limited contact with Detective Smith. Further, the Court of Special Appeals pointed out that it is not improper for the jurors to have tentative opinions as to the question of Dillard\u2019s guilt or innocence. The juror\u2019s comments did not demonstrate bias, in the intermediate appellate court\u2019s view, but rather were merely an instinctive human reaction to the testimony. Finally, the intermediate appellate court pointed out that the trial judge\u2019s subsequent instructions on the State\u2019s burden and the presumption of innocence were presumed to be followed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Dillard petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. We granted Dillard\u2019s petition to resolve the following question: \u201cShould prejudice to Petitioner be presumed where, following the testimony of the State\u2019s primary law enforcement witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>two jurors patted the witness on the back and commended him for doing a \u2018good job\u2019?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Generally, appellate courts review the denial of a motion for a mistrial under the abuse of discretion standard, because the \u201ctrial judge is in the best position to evaluate whether or not a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury has been compromised.\u201d <em>Allen v. </em>State, 89 Md.App. 25, 42-43, 597 A.2d 489, 497 (1991); <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 277, 604 A.2d 489, 493 (1992). \u201cThe judge is physically on the scene, able to observe matters not usually reflected in a cold record. The judge is able to ascertain the demeanor of the witnesses and to note the reaction of the jurors____\u201d <em>Hawkins, </em>326 Md. at 278, 604 A.2d at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, <em>by an impartial jury </em>of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed----\u201d (Emphasis added.) Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights also guarantees \u201c[t]hat in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right ... to a speedy trial <em>by an impartial jury, </em>without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cA criminal defendant\u2019s right to have an impartial jury trial is one of the most fundamental rights under both the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Inherent in both documents are the paramount notions of justice and fair process during criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>375 Md. 284, 299, 825 A.2d 1008, 1017 (2003). \u201cThe potency of the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial relies on the promise that a defendant\u2019s fate will be determined by an impartial fact finder who depends solely on the evidence and argument introduced in open court.\u201d <em>Wright v. State, </em>131 Md.App. 243, 253, 748 A.2d 1050, 1055 (2000) (quoting <em>Allen v. State, </em>89 Md.App. at 42, 597 A.2d 489).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In the context of a jury trial, \u201cprivate, intentional communications and/or contacts between jurors and witnesses are generally improper, and convictions in such cases are subject to reversal unless the contacts are proven to be nonprejudicial to the defendant.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 301, 825 A.2d at 1018 (citing <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>146 U.S. 140, 13 S.Ct. 50, 36 L.Ed. 917 (1892)). Contacts between witnesses and jurors are generally improper because such contacts \u201craise fundamental concerns on whether the jury would reach their verdict based solely on the evidence presented at trial or whether it would be improperly influenced by inappropriate contacts.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Turner v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 466, 472-73, 85 S.Ct. 546, 550, 13 L.Ed.2d 424, 429 (1965) (\u201cIn the constitutional sense, trial by jury in a criminal case necessarily implies at the very least that the \u2018evidence developed\u2019 against a defendant shall come from the witness stand in a public courtroom\u201d rather than extended extrajudicial contact with a witness.).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Because communications between jurors and witnesses raise serious concerns about the fundamental fairness of a jury trial, in some cases, private communications between a juror and a third party are \u201cdeemed presumptively prejudicial\u201d to the defendant. <em>Remmer v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 227, 229, 74 S.Ct. 450, 451, 98 L.Ed. 654, 656 (1954); <em>Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 340-41, 825 A.2d at 1041. If the contact is presumptively prejudicial, the burden of proof shifts to the State, which may overcome the presumption by showing that the contact was harmless. <em>Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 301, 825 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>at 1018. The presumption of prejudice applies to cases where the juror misconduct was \u201cexcessive and egregious.\u201d <em>Jenkins, 375 </em>Md. at 315, 825 A.2d at 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In the present case, Dillard argues that the jurors\u2019 conduct was both intentional and egregious and, accordingly, a presumption of prejudice should attach to their actions. In Dillard\u2019s view, it is of no moment that the trial court failed to instruct the jurors to avoid contact with the witnesses. Dillard points out that such preliminary and interim instructions are not mandatory pursuant to Md. Rule 4-325(a), and asserts that the jurors should have known that intentionally speaking to the State\u2019s primary witness was inappropriate. Even if the jurors did not realize their conduct was inappropriate, Dillard asserts that the relevant question is not whether the jurors believed that their actions were appropriate, but rather whether their actions deprived Dillard of his right to a fair trial. The jurors did not approach Detective Smith with mere pleasantries or common-place gestures, according to Dillard. Rather, in Dillard\u2019s view, the jurors expressed a view that Detective Smith \u201chad arrested the right man,\u201d or, at a minimum, that they had a favorable view of the police investigation. Further, Dillard points out that the jurors felt strongly enough about their view of Dillard\u2019s guilt to state it openly, in front of anyone present in the hallway. According to Dillard, the jurors\u2019 actions call into question their ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions on the presumption of innocence, the weight due to the testimony of law enforcement officers, and the State\u2019s burden of proof. Without a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jurors, there is no way to know whether the jurors were able to follow the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The State, in response, argues that the content of the jurors\u2019 contact with Detective Smith fails to demonstrate prejudice intrinsically and, accordingly, Dillard failed to carry his initial burden of showing prejudice. In the State\u2019s view, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jenkins, 375 </em>Md. 284, 825 A.2d 1008, stands for the idea that presumption of prejudice only arises in cases where there is egregious juror and witness miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>duct. In this case, because the jurors had not violated any instructions from the court, the jurors did not engage in any misconduct according to the State. The State asserts that the contact in this case was \u201cfleeting,\u201d and that there was no evidence that the jurors sought out Detective Smith, or that they acted in concert. Additionally, the State acknowledges that Detective Smith did not engage in any misconduct, and rather behaved commendably under the circumstances. Because Detective Smith did not engage the jurors, as the State points out, there is no danger, the State\u2019s argument continues, that Smith subconsciously swayed the jurors\u2019 view of his credibility through polite banter. Further, according to the State, the trial judge\u2019s instructions on the presumption of innocence and the State\u2019s burden of proof were sufficient to ensure that Dillard received a fair trial. The jury\u2019s decision to acquit Dillard of half of the charges confirms that the jury heeded the trial judge\u2019s instructions, in the State\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Even if we accept the State\u2019s argument that <em>Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 340-41, 825 A.2d at 1041, limits the scope of presumptive prejudice to situations where the jury misconduct is \u201cexcessive or egregious,\u201d we cannot determine from the record before us whether the contact between the jurors and Detective Smith was sufficiently egregious to create a presumption of prejudice to Dillard. In our view, the relevant question raised by the contact between the jurors and Detective Smith is not whether the jurors violated the court\u2019s instruction, but rather, whether the jurors had formed a fixed opinion as to Dillard\u2019s guilt before hearing all of the evidence in the case, or whether the jurors had engaged in premature deliberations about Dillard\u2019s guilt or innocence. Without a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jurors to determine the intent or sub-text of their comments and whether they had discussed the issue of Dillard\u2019s guilt or innocence, the trial judge did not have sufficient information to determine whether the presumption of prejudice attached to the contact or to rule on Dillard\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Thus, the trial judge\u2019s failure to clarify the factual scenario raised by the contact between the jurors and Detective Smith constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Although the contact between the jurors and Detective Smith was brief and thus not excessive, the contact may have been egregious because its content was suspect. The contact was particularly troubling for several reasons. First, Detective Smith was a key witness for the State. Contact between a juror and a key witness is more likely to be prejudicial than contact between a juror and an uninterested party. <em>See Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 306, 825 A.2d at 1031. Second, the jurors specifically sought out the witness to make a comment about his testimony, as opposed to \u201cmere casual contact,\u201d like saying \u201chello\u201d or exchanging passing pleasantries. <em>Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 322, 825 A.2d at 1030. Further, the contact was not, on its face, an \u201cinstinctive human reaction\u201d or a mere passing observation arising out of some detail of the testimony, as asserted by the Court of Special Appeals, but rather was a comment about the content of the witness\u2019s testimony that may be related to the question of guilt or innocence. Third, the contact is evidence that the jurors may have formed an opinion as to Dillard\u2019s guilt before Dillard presented his case. \u201cIf a juror has formed a fixed opinion on a defendant\u2019s guilt prior to deliberations, the juror may stand by the opinion even if contradicted by subsequent evidence. A juror may also form premature conclusions without the benefit of final arguments, instructions of law, and jury deliberations.\u201d <em>State v. Rojas, </em>177 Ariz. 454, 868 P.2d 1037, 1041 (App.1993). Finally, the fact that two jurors independently made the same comment about Detective Smith\u2019s testimony suggested that the jurors may have discussed the case or engaged in premature deliberation about the question of Dillard\u2019s guilt or innocence, or Detective Smith\u2019s credibility, prior to the completion of testimony. <em>See United States v. Resko, </em>3 F.3d 684, 686 (3d Cir.1993); <em>Abernathy v. State, </em>109 Md.App. 364, 377, 675 A.2d 115, 122 (1996). Because the content of the contact raised these potential factual issues, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to resolve the factual controversy that relates to the jurors\u2019 ability to render an impartial verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The present case is distinguishable from the facts of <em>Abernathy, </em>109 Md.App. 364, 675 A.2d 115, on which the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Special Appeals relied in this case. In <em>Abernathy, </em>one juror made a comment to another juror about the lifestyle of one of the witnesses, saying \u201cThat\u2019s what you call a dysfunctional family.\u201d <em>Abernathy, </em>109 Md.App. at 377, 675 A.2d at 122. The intermediate appellate court held that the offhand remark was \u201cinconsequential\u201d and thus the trial judge did not abuse his discretion \u201cin not pursuing further this will-o\u2019-the-wisp.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The intermediate appellate court further observed that \u201c[jjurors are not Sphinxes and, inevitably, they make some comments to each other.... It is nothing more than an instinctive human reaction to the events unfolding around one ... [and] does not constitute deliberation on the merits of the case and is not evidence of bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Unlike in the present case, the comments in <em>Abernathy </em>were not between a juror and a third party or witness, but were between two jurors. Further, the content of the comments did not suggest that the jurors had formed any opinions on the ultimate question of Abernathy\u2019s guilt or innocence, or even that the jurors had formed an opinion on the witness\u2019s credibility. Rather, the comment was merely a passing idle observation about the witness\u2019s family life, based on her testimony. The opinion about the family life of a witness had no bearing on the outcome of the case, unlike in the present case, where the jurors\u2019 opinions about Detective Smith\u2019s testimony could suggest that they had formed an opinion about Dillard\u2019s guilt and Detective Smith\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Once the parties raise the issue of juror-witness contact, and facts show that the jurors intentionally made contact with a key prosecution witness and that the contact may have been about the substance of his testimony, and that the jurors may have discussed and formed an opinion on the ultimate question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, the trial judge must conduct a meaningful inquiry that will resolve the factual questions raised by the contact. The contact between the jurors and a key witness creates an appearance of impropriety that must be resolved by the court. Unlike in other motions, where if the party does not carry its burden, the trial court is within its discretion to deny the motion, cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>of juror misconduct will undermine the appearance of and the integrity of the judicial process itself. Impropriety and the appearance of impropriety must be avoided because it \u201ccasts a shadow over the trial process, which necessarily diminishes the integrity of the system in the minds of defendants and the public itself.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 328, 825 A.2d at 1034. Thus, the trial court has an obligation to resolve questions of impropriety or threats to the integrity of the jury trial. <em>See United States v. Sears, </em>663 F.2d 896, 900 (9th Cir.1981) (holding that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when the trial judge \u201cquestioned the juror extensively enough to <em>satisfy itself </em>that the juror was not biased\u201d (emphasis added));<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth v. Mosley, </em>535 Pa. 549, 637 A.2d 246, 250 (1993) (holding that the court has a duty to resolve the issue of prejudice arising out of jury misconduct, even though the defense could have requested a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the juror in its Motion to Disqualify).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In the present case, the trial judge could not resolve the issue of juror misconduct without conducting a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jurors to determine the intent or meaning of their contact with Detective Smith, whether they had reach a fixed opinion as to Dillard\u2019s guilt, and whether they had engaged in premature deliberations. Where there is a serious allegation of bias or possible prejudice, \u201c[t]he trial judge [has] an affirmative obligation to inquire whether the juror could nonetheless render a fair and impartial verdict\u201d by conducting a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the juror prior to ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>on <em>the </em>motion. <em>Wilson v.

Determining whether there is prejudice is the goal of <em>voir dire. See Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 726, 506 A.2d 580, 600 (1986) (noting that even if contact raises the presumption of prejudice, the jurors may be \u201crehabilitated through additional questioning\u201d); <em>Summers v.

Generally, in cases where the trial judge or the parties conducted a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the juror or jurors in question, the appellate courts have upheld the trial court\u2019s decision on the issue of prejudice to the defendant. <em>E.g., Grandison, </em>305 Md. at 726-27, 506 A.2d at 618-19; <em>Eades v.

[In the present case, however], we fail to see how the district court could have made a reasoned determination that the defendants would suffer no prejudice due to the jurors\u2019 premature discussions\u201d without further information about the content of the discussions); <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>360 F.2d 366, 369 (5th Cir.1966) (\u201cIn failing to conduct \u2018a thorough inquiry ... to determine exactly what ... occurred\u2019 before overruling the motion, the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>United States v. Vasquez-Ruiz, </em>502 F.3d 700 (7th Cir.2007); <em>Rojas, </em>868 P.2d at 1041-42; <em>Mosley, </em>637 A.2d at 250 (\u2018Without the juror\u2019s testimony, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>trial judge was not in a position to determine that the encounter between Sergeant Wilson and the juror amounted to harmless error.\u201d); <em>State v. Pike, </em>712 P.2d 277, 280-81 (Utah 1985) (noting that the court presumed prejudice when no <em>voir dire </em>examination of the juror, witness examined); <em>see also Castro v. State, </em>186 Ga.App. 248, 367 S.E.2d 42, 43 (1988) (\u201c[A]s the juror was not called to explain the incident ... the prosecution failed to carry its burden showing the absence of harm beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">The cases in which an appellate court upheld a trial judge\u2019s determination about the prejudicial effect of juror misconduct without a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the juror or jurors in question are distinguishable from the facts of the present case. For example, in <em>Bruce v. State, </em>351 Md. 387, 396, 718 A.2d 1125, 1129 (1998), an electronic bulletin board in the courthouse displayed information about another case involving the defendant, which if seen by the jurors, may have provided prejudicial information. We held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he determined that \u201cthere was no reasonable likelihood that any of the jurors had seen the potentially prejudicial information ... [on] the electronic bulletin board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Unlike in the present case, in <em>Bruce, </em>there was no allegation that the jurors actually received prejudicial information, only that it was possible. The facts uncovered by the trial judge in <em>Bruce </em>also showed that it was unlikely that the jurors would have seen the bulletin board, because they were instructed to use another entrance to the courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. O'Brien, </em>972 F.2d 12, 14-15 (1992), the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in relying on a <em>voir dire </em>examination of a \"witness to make a determination about prejudice. In <em>OBrien, </em>the <em>voir dire </em>of the potential witness revealed that the jurors did not know he was involved in the case when they had contact with him, and that the contact was brief and was not about the content of the case. <em>Id. </em>Unlike in <em>OBrien, </em>in the present case, the jurors clearly knew that Detective Smith was a key witness in the case, because they had just listened to his testimony. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ther, the jurors\u2019 contact with Detective Smith was related to the content of his testimony. Thus, unlike in <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>the trial judge could not rely solely on Detective Smith\u2019s perceptions about the conversation, but rather needed critical information about the jurors\u2019 intent and how they perceived the conversation. Additionally, in <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>unlike in the present case, the defendant specifically objected to a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jurors. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>972 F.2d at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In <em>State v. Overton, </em>279 Kan. 547, 112 P.3d 244, 252-53 (2005), the Supreme Court of Kansas held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that there was no prejudice to the defendant when jurors overheard a spectator comment that the defendant \u201cwill get his judgment when the day comes.\u201d Although the trial judge did not conduct a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jurors about the incident, the judge personally heard the same comment and was able to evaluate its prejudicial effect based on his direct experience. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge in the present case did not have the benefit of firsthand knowledge about the contact between the jurors and Detective Smith. Additionally, in <em>Overton, </em>unlike in the present case, the person making the comment was an unknown spectator, not a witness in the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The present case is analogous to the facts of <em>Mosley, </em>637 A.2d 246. In <em>Mosley, </em>a juror had a conversation with a key law enforcement witness during the course of the trial. <em>Mosley, </em>637 A.2d at 247. Mosley asked that the juror be excused for cause and replaced with an alternate. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge conducted a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the law enforcement witness, who testified that the conversation \u201cwas loud enough for all to hear, lasted less than a minute and did not relate in any way to the case\u201d or to the witness\u2019s law enforcement duties, or anything else related to the criminal justice system. <em>Mosley, </em>637 A.2d at 248. The trial judge found that the conversation did not raise an issue of prejudice and was at worst \u201charmless error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, after noting that this contact was not incidental, and that the law enforcement officer was a key witness whose credibility had a strong bearing on the case, held that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>judge abused his discretion in failing to question the juror \u201cabout any possible taint which may have resulted from his conversation\u201d with the witness. <em>Mosley, </em>637 A.2d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Further, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that it was error for the trial judge to rely solely on defense counsel to call witnesses in support of counsel\u2019s Motion to Disqualify the juror. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]his placed defense counsel in the difficult position of deciding whether to avoid questioning the juror or run the risk of antagonizing a juror who might remain to decide his client\u2019s fate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court determined that it was not acceptable to leave the juror unexamined, even if this were a strategic decision on the part of defense counsel because \u201c[wjithout the juror\u2019s testimony, the trial judge was not in a position to determine that the encounter between [the witness] and the juror amounted to harmless error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\u2019s holding suggests, as we have explicitly stated in the present case, that it is the duty of the court to fully investigate and resolve an issue of juror-witness contact that may be prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We agree with the State that the trial judge may rehabilitate juror misconduct through a curative instruction in some cases. While it is undoubtedly true that courts should generally consider curative instructions to correct possible prejudice, <em>see Rainville v. State, </em>328 Md. 398, 410-11, 614 A.2d 949, 955 (1992), the court cannot evaluate the propriety and effect of a curative instruction unless it fully inquires about or knows the extent of the prejudice to the defendant. Jurors generally are presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions, including curative instructions, <em>Ezenwa, </em>82 Md.App. at 518, 572 A.2d at 1115, however, in the present case, it is unknown whether the contact with the witness demonstrated a prejudice that would render the jurors unable to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>See State v. Cook, </em>338 Md. 598, 616-17, 659 A.2d 1313, 1323 (1995) (noting that the judge, upon conducting a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the witness, may determine that the juror is unable to follow the court\u2019s instructions). A <em>voir dire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>examination of the juror, combined with a curative instruction, may have resolved the issue in the present case, but a curative instruction without full knowledge of the extent of the prejudice to the defendant could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case for a new trial. The appropriate remedy for the improper denial of a motion for a mistrial is a new trial. <em>Stewart v.

I see no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying Petitioner\u2019s request for a mistrial. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which, in turn, affirmed the Circuit Court for Charles County because the casual and isolated communication by two jurors commending a witness\u2019s testimony could not have prejudiced Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">As the majority seems to acknowledge, under <em>Jenkins, </em>juror misconduct must be \u201cexcessive or egregious\u201d before prejudice to the defendant may be presumed. <em>See Jenkins v. State, </em>375 Md. 284, 315, 825 A.2d 1008, 1026 (2003). Indeed, \u201cnot all incidental contacts between jurors and witnesses are inherently prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 825 A.2d at 1030. The majority reverses, not because the juror misconduct was excessive or egregious, but on the grounds that the trial court failed to conduct a voir dire examination of the jurors \u201cto determine the intent of their comments and whether they had discussed the issue of Dillard\u2019s guilt or innocence[.]\u201d Majority Op. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>457, 3 A.3d at 410. While the majority may not presume prejudice, it certainly requires that the court conduct a voir dire of the jury when even the most incidental contact between a juror and a witness transpires. In my view, this is an improper resolution of the case, for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">First, Petitioner never asked the trial court to conduct a voir dire of the jurors. Examination of the transcript below reveals that when the police officers could not describe or identify the jurors without the jurors present, defense counsel asked \u201cthat the jurors be brought in, observed, and then taken away so that the officers then can\u2014tell the court.\u201d The court complied with this request, bringing the jurors in, and had them identify themselves by their juror numbers. With that information, Detective Smith was able to identify Jurors 194 and 177 as the ones who complimented his testimony. The trial court <em>twice </em>asked whether counsel had any further requests of the court. Defense counsel responded the second time by asking to question Detective Smith about which juror spoke to him first. Smith responded, \u201c[t]he elderly gentleman said it to me first. The other juror wasn\u2019t in view when he said it. The other juror was around the comer. It was in passing. Everybody was walking by.\u201d Neither counsel asked for voir dire of the jurors. Rather, after she questioned the detectives, Petitioner\u2019s counsel simply repeated her request for a mistrial, and alternatively, to \u201cunseat [juror 194] and replace [him] with an alternate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Under these circumstances, there was no reason for the trial judge to administer a voir dire of the two jurors before ruling on the mistrial, and we should not reverse the court\u2019s exercise of its discretion for failing to do something it was not asked to do. As the Court of Special Appeals said in the case below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">Considerations of fairness and judicial efficiency generally require that all challenges that a party wishes to make to a trial court\u2019s ruling, action, or conduct \u201cbe presented in the first instance to the trial court so that (1) a proper record can be made with respect to the challenge, and (2) the other parties and the trial judge are given an opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>consider and respond to the challenge.\u201d <em>Chaney v. State, </em>397 Md. 460, 468 [918 A.2d 506] (2007).... On this basis, appellant\u2019s complaint as to the court\u2019s failure to take curative action is unavailing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><em>Dillard v. State, </em>No. 1578, slip op. at 18 (Md.Ct.Spec.App. Feb. 11, 2009). Although there may be some instances in which a trial court must initiate the voir dire of the jury on its own, 2 without request from counsel, in my view, this isolated and innocuous occurrence does not justify such a ruling. The reasons for my conclusion will be evident from my discussion of the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the motion for mistrial, which follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In my view, the trial court did not commit error by its refusal to grant a mistrial, which was the remedy requested by Dillard. To explain my view of this issue, I quote liberally from the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">[T]he conduct of a criminal trial is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for mistrial absent an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">Whether a mistrial is warranted hinges upon the question of prejudice to the defendant.... A mistrial is ... an extreme sanction that sometimes must be resorted to when such overwhelming prejudice has occurred that no other remedy will suffice to cure the prejudice. Noting that the purpose of a mistrial is remedial, not \u201cprophylactic,\u201d ... the <em>Burks </em>Court added: \u201c[T]he decision as to whether a mistrial is called for is contingent upon the impact of an error and not upon the motivation behind the error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-9\"><em>Dillard, </em>slip op. at 18-19 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Applying the appropriate standard of review of the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion, the intermediate appellate court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">Notably, jurors 177 and 194 did not engage in any \u201cmisconduct,\u201d because they did not violate the court\u2019s instructions by talking to Smith. Moreover, their conduct did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>demonstrate that they had decided Dillard\u2019s guilt before hearing all the evidence and prior to deliberations. In the context of this case, we agree with the State, which posits: \u201cWhere an individual juror\u2019s conduct at trial is neither nefarious nor prejudicial, a trial court\u2019s discretionary decision not to question the juror or declare a mistrial will be upheld.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><em>Dillard, </em>slip op. at 20. I agree with the Court of Special Appeals that jurors 177 and 194 engaged in no \u201cmisconduct.\u201d They were not instructed that they could not say anything to the witnesses. Significantly, they did not go out of their way to contact this witness\u2014the jurors were walking by the witness in the course of going to lunch, and made the brief complimentary comment and gesture about his testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Unquestionably, the witness did not communicate with the jurors in any way outside his testimony. So, there is no possibility that the jurors were influenced by some ex parte contact, or that their verdict was tainted by some inappropriate outside information or opinion. This fact isolates the instant case from <em>Jenkins </em>and the other cases cited by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The majority\u2019s decision to reverse and order a new trial, then, must rest on the shaky premise that jurors must not evaluate testimony as they hear it, and if they do so, their verdict is tainted and must be vacated. Indeed, the majority, citing an Arizona case, concludes that a trial court must grant a mistrial if it determines the jurors had \u201cengaged in premature deliberation about the question of Dillard\u2019s guilt or innocence, or Detective Smith\u2019s credibility, prior to the completion of testimony.\u201d Majority Op. at 458, 8 A.3d at 410. I respectfully disagree, and submit that we would be naive to suppose that jurors suspend all judgment about the witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>and other evidence presented to them until the time of formal deliberations. Studies of juries and their decision-making processes bear this out.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Numerous studies of juror cognition and behavior indicate that jurors are continually evaluating the information that they receive during a trial, beginning with opening arguments and proceeding up to and through jury deliberations. <em>See </em>Robert K. Bothwell, <em>Social Cognition in the Courtroom: Juror Information Processing and Story Construction, in </em>A Handbook of Jury Research 17-1 through -18 (Walter F. Abbott &amp; John Batt eds., 1999). Indeed, some research suggests that the presentation of the opening argument itself makes a substantial impact on how jurors view the remainder of a trial. <em>Id. </em>at 17-8 through -10; <em>see also </em>Jansen Voss, <em>The Science of Persuasion: An Exploration of Advocacy and the Science Behind the Art of Persuasion in the Courtroom, </em>29 Law &amp; Psychol. Rev. 301, 311-12 (2005) (Opinions formed as a result of the first argument presented at trial \u201chave been found to bias the interpretation of subsequent evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The leading theory on juror decision-making states that jurors \u201cimpose a narrative story organization on trial information.\u201d Nancy Pennington &amp; Reid Hastie, <em>A Cognitive Theory of Juror Decision Making: The Story Model, </em>13 Cardozo L.Rev. 519, 521 (2006) (discussing the \u201cStory Model\u201d of juror decision-making). The process of constructing such a narrative engages jurors in an \u201cactive, constructive, comprehension process in which evidence is organized, elaborated, and interpreted by them during the course of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Indeed, studies suggest that jurors change their positions during the course of a trial as new evidence is presented to them. <em>See </em>Shari Seidman Diamond, <em>Beyond Fantasy and Nightmare: A Portrait of the Jury, </em>54 Buffalo L.Rev. 717, 743-46 (2006) (discussing studies in which mock jurors provided differing \u201cinterim verdicts\u201d during the course of trial proceedings). One psychologist has stated that the process of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>[A]ecount[ing] for the facts by inferring causal and intentional links among particular facts ... begins <em>during </em>the trial. Clearly, the law\u2019s assumptions and injunctions\u2014that jurors suspend judgment, hear all the evidence, and then weigh the evidence and decide-\u2014is at odds with what jurors actually do----The law\u2019s fictional assumption is akin to a stricture ordering readers of detective fiction not to think about whodunnit until they reach the last chapter. It cannot be done, except, perhaps, by the most incurious of minds, or by a mind so compartmentalized that a psychiatric diagnosis is in order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Norman J. Finkel, <em>Commonsense Justice: Jurors\u2019 Notions of the Law </em>74-75, 350 n. 69 (1995) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Although in a theoretical model of a perfect trial, jurors might suspend all judgment until the introduction of all evidence and closing arguments are heard, we cannot ignore the reality that jurors are undertaking a continual evaluation of the information they receive during trial. I see no reason and no benefit in deciding cases based on the fanciful notion that the real people who sit on juries conform to a purist model of what we (and our predecessors) deem to be ideal for fair adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The trial court wisely recognized the futility of attempting to enforce this fictional model of juror conduct, commenting,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">It is customary when we send jurors out of the room to go to lunch or go home or something, to say look don\u2019t discuss the case among yourself\u2014selves\u2014don\u2019t allow other people to discuss it with you. I know ... they seldom abide by the first part, but my sense is that for the most part they abide by the second part, allowing other people to discuss it with them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">The trial judge is the one who has experience dealing with juries, and based on that experience, he made an assessment\u2014that the jurors in question acted within the range of usual juror conduct. They evaluated the case as they went along, and maybe made a comment to each other about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>whether a witness was credible or effective. The trial court believed this was not juror misconduct, and not a big deal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjJ\">It occurs to me though that it [is] really a situation where we happen to have at this juncture a little more information about something you know\u2014going on in the mind of two jurors than we otherwise would have. I can\u2019t imagine for a moment that commentary\u2014about a witness performance\u2014 positive or negative\u2014doesn\u2019t get uttered behind that door\u2014 with some regularity before the jury retires to deliberate. I would think when they take a [bathroom] break that ... it would be ... contrary to human experience for remarks like that not to be made occasionally, or remarks not to be made ... I don\u2019t find from this that it\u2019s necessary to conclude that the ... juror was doing ... anything other than saying nice police work. And it doesn\u2019t necessarily amount to any kind of commentary on the relationship of that police work to this defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The assessment of this conduct was the trial judge\u2019s call, not ours to make. The judge obviously gave serious consideration as to whether any misconduct had occurred or any harm had been done, and decided no, in both respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">As I mentioned before, this case bears little resemblance to <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>the case relied on heavily by Petitioner. The Court of Special Appeals explained the facts of <em>Jenkins:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKx\">In <em>Jenkins, </em>a detective who had testified at a murder trial informed the prosecutor, five days after the verdict, that she had contact with a juror during the course of the trial. The defendant moved for a new trial, alleging \u201can improper contact between a juror and a detective witness for ... the State,\u201d which \u201ccaus[ed] prejudice to [Jenkins] and precluded] his right to a fair trial.\u201d At a motion hearing, the detective and the juror testified about what the Court characterized as \u201cthe extensive contact they had\u201d during a weekend religious retreat, held while the trial was in progress. The juror testified that he recognized the detective and tried to avoid her, but then approached the detective and told her he could not talk to her. The juror thought the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>detective was under the impression that the juror had served on a completed case, because the detective asked if the jury had found the defendant guilty. The juror advised that the case was still in progress. According to the juror, the two did not discuss the case further, but they sat together at a seminar; had lunch together; and the detective drove the juror to his car at the end of the retreat. The detective provided similar testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><em>Dillard, </em>slip op. at 21 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The Court of Special Appeals went on to explain that the burden initially falls on the defense to show the impropriety, and shifts to the State with regard to <em>\u201csome </em>such juror contacts with third parties and/or misconduct.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 301, 825 A.2d at 1018 (emphasis added). Interpreting our decision in <em>Jenkins </em>it also explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">[The Court of Appeals] clarified that instances of presumptively prejudicial contact arise when there is excessive or egregious jury misconduct or improper contact by a third party occurs. The Court added that prejudice is presumed where <em>\u201cegregious </em>juror <em>and </em>witness <em>misconduct </em>occurs,\u201d such as when both the juror and the witness ignore the court\u2019s orders and choose to interact, including \u201cwhen a witness and a juror go to lunch together during the middle of a trial when both have been admonished, in one way or another, to avoid each other.\u201d Further, the Court explained that when the record is silent with respect to whether intentional and inappropriate juror contact was prejudicial, prejudice may be presumed if the nature of such contact \u201craise[s] fundamental concerns on whether the jury would reach [its] verdict based solely upon the evidence presented at trial or whether it would be improperly influenced by the inappropriate contacts.\u201d In these circumstances, the burden falls on the State to rebut the presumption of improper influence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">The <em>Jenkins </em>Court concluded that prejudice would be presumed based on the egregious circumstances presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>that case\u2014a juror lunching with a police detective who had recently testified in a murder trial, while that case was still being tried to that juror. Similarly, prejudice has been presumed in other egregious circumstances. <em>See Turner v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 466, 471-74 [85 S.Ct. 546, 13 L.Ed.2d 424] (1965) (concluding that extensive daily contact between a sequestered jury and two deputy sheriffs who testified at trial was presumptively prejudicial)----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><em>Dillard, </em>slip op. at 22-23 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The Court of Special Appeals went on to conclude that the presumption of prejudice that we applied in <em>Jenkins </em>was not applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">[T]he contact here was minimal, consisting of a few complimentary words (\u201cgood job\u201d); uttered by two jurors independently, and a common-place gesture of a pat. Clearly, there was no \u201cprolonged contact,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 289 [825 A.2d 1008], between the jurors and Smith. Nor was there misconduct by \u201cjuror <em>and </em>witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319 [825 A.2d 1008] (emphasis in original). In this regard, it is noteworthy that the jurors did not violate any cautionary instructions from the court, as none were given. Nor did Smith, the witness, respond to the comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">Moreover, the compliment, \u201cgood job,\u201d and the accompanying pat on Detective Smith\u2019s back, could have referred to the investigation or to the detective\u2019s testimony. Of import, neither the comment nor the gesture said anything about the jurors\u2019 view[s] as to Dillard\u2019s culpability. Indeed, the jurors\u2019 actions were so minimal that they could not be said to establish a lack of impartiality or demonstrate that the jurors had already reached guilty verdicts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\"><em>Dillard, </em>slip op. at 26. I agree with the Court of Special Appeals that neither <em>Jenkins </em>nor any other case cited by Dillard supports the conclusion that prejudice should be presumed, or that the conduct of the jurors mandated a mistrial, or even that the trial court was required to question the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The majority opinion, as I read it, does not exactly presume prejudice, but it comes close. It holds that the trial court missed the opportunity to verify, by questioning the jurors, that the incident would have no influence on the jurors\u2019 decisions, and that this was an abuse of discretion, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s failure to request that the trial court do so. I respectfully dissent because I cannot see how this incident could possibly influence the jurors in their thinking about the case. The jurors heard the testimony, and made a contemporaneous evaluation. As the trial court indicated, this brief communication by the two jurors was simply giving the court and counsel \u201ca little more information about something ... going on in the mind of two jurors than we otherwise would have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">For these reasons, I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">. The prosecutor reported the incident to the court, saying that the police officers reported to her that \"when we broke for lunch that\u2014two jurors walked by\u2014as the jurors were walking by two of them\u2014patted\u2014 Detective Smith on the back and said, 'Good job[.]\u2019 In response Detective Smith did nothing____He kept walking his direction, they\u2019re walking opposite directions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
