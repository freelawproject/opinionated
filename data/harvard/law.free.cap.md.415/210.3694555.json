(\u201cCountry Fresh\u201d) in which the Circuit Court for Caroline County granted summary judgment in Petitioner\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because, however, the order granting summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>judgment was not a final judgment as to all defendants and was not properly certified under Maryland Rule 2\u2014602(b), we shall not reach the merits of the issues presented to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Petitioner custom manufactures machinery, including food processing machinery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The machine at issue here is a brine-filling machine (\u201cthe Machine\u201d) commissioned by Country Fresh to be fabricated according to a design for a machine previously manufactured by a defunct company named A.K. Robins. Country Fresh commissioned the Machine for use in a mushroom processing plant assembly line at a Hanover Foods Corporation (\u201cHanover\u201d) facility in Ridgely, Maryland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Machine was installed in Hanover\u2019s mushroom processing assembly line to fill buckets of mushrooms with brine.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">During the time period relevant to this case, three employees filled buckets of various sizes with mushrooms and placed them on a conveyor belt. The buckets then moved down the belt to the Machine, at which point the Machine\u2019s sensors detected the buckets and engaged a carriage system, five nozzles attached to a beam located above the conveyor belt. Once the buckets stopped beneath the carriage system, it would descend until the nozzles were inside the buckets and fill them with brine. After filling the buckets, the carriage system would ascend to the default position above the convey- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>or belt, and the mushroom buckets continued down the assembly line.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Ms. Wall, a quality control coordinator for Hanover, tested samples of mushroom brine by taking a full bucket off of the belt after the bucket moved out from under the Machine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 1, 2003, Ms. Wall was resting her hand on a table behind the Machine, while waiting for it to fill some mushroom buckets so she could take a sample, when the carriage system descended unexpectedly. Before Ms. Wall could remove her hand, the carriage system lowered onto her hand and pulled it inside the carriage system up to her mid forearm. Upon seeing the incident, other Hanover employees ran to Ms. Wall\u2019s aid, but they could not lift the carriage system off of her arm. Despite unplugging and plugging back in the Machine, Ms. Wall\u2019s armed was trapped for ten minutes before the carriage system ascended and released her arm. Ms. Wall suffered fractures to her hand and wrist, lacerations, and scarring.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\n<em>The Lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">On April 13, 2006, Respondents filed suit against Petitioner and Country Fresh in the Circuit Court for Caroline County. The complaint was comprised of multiple counts, sounding in negligence and strict liability, for design defect, manufacturing defect, failure to warn, breach of an express warranty, breach of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and loss of consortium. On April 16, 2007, Petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In the memorandum supporting the motion, Petitioner argued that the defective design counts failed because the contractor\u2019s defense insulated Petitioner from liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tioner argued that the failure to warn counts failed because any risks associated with the Machine were \u201copen and obvious\u201d and because Petitioner supplied the Machine to a \u201csophisticated user,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which shifted the duty to warn from Petitioner to Hanover. Petitioner further argued that the breach of express warranty and manufacturing defect counts failed because Respondents had provided no evidence that the Machine deviated from the design plans provided and, likewise, provided no evidence of any express statements regarding the Machine\u2019s fitness for the \u201cuse in the manner in which it was being used and operated.\u201d Additionally, Petitioner argued that the count alleging breach of an implied warranty of merchantability must fail because Petitioner fabricated the Machine according to the designs provided by Hanover and thus could not have impliedly warranted for the safety or efficacy of the Machine. At most, Petitioner argued that it could have impliedly warranted \u201cthat the [M]achine would be constructed in a workmanlike manner in accordance with the specifications it was provided[.]\u201d Petitioner argued that the count alleging breach of an implied warranty for a particular purpose failed because Respondents failed to establish any evidence that Hanover was relying on Petitioner\u2019s expertise and Petitioner merely constructed the Machine according to the design provided by Hanover, an experienced and knowledgeable buyer. After a hearing on September 27, 2007, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Circuit Court issued an order granting Petitioner\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On October 19, 2007, Respondents filed with the Circuit Court a motion for entry of a final judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Rule permits a trial court to certify as final an order that resolves fewer than all of the pending claims or parties. <em>See Md.-Nat'l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Smith, </em>333 Md. 3, 6-7, 633 A.2d 855, 857 (1993). Respondents argued in the motion that certification was proper because, if they proceeded to trial against Country Fresh and obtained a verdict in their favor, \u201cinconsistent outcomes as to the two Defendants would occur.\u201d Specifically, Respondents argued that if they obtained a verdict against Country Fresh and then successfully appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Petitioner\u2019s favor, the subsequent trial against Petitioner would involve the same issues already tried against Country Fresh and therefore be an inefficient use of judicial resources. Additionally, Respondents argued that, because Country Fresh would likely assert in a motion for summary judgment some of the same arguments as Petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, timely appellate resolution of those matters would serve the \u201cinterests of justice and judicial economy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>On October 24, 2007, without the benefit of a hearing, the Circuit Court, \u201chaving determined that there is no just reason for delay,\u201d granted Respondents\u2019 motion. Consequently, the court entered a final judgment based on the order granting summary judgment in Petitioner\u2019s favor. The Circuit Court order consisted of a single page and provided no explanation for the court\u2019s determination that \u201cthere was no just reason for delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">On November 19, 2007, Respondents timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On appeal, Respondents argued that the Circuit Court had erred in granting summary judgment in Petitioner\u2019s favor because a genuine dispute of material fact existed as to each count: defective design, manufacturing defect, failure to warn, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, and breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. On September 3, 2009, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed in part and vacated in part the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Court of Special Appeals at the outset noted that, even though Respondents\u2019 claim was not settled as to all parties when the Circuit Court granted summary judgment, Respondents\u2019 appeal was proper because, pursuant to Rule 2-602(b), the Circuit Court had entered a final judgment with respect to Petitioner. The Court of Special Appeals did not address the propriety of the Circuit Court\u2019s Rule 2-602(b) certification. Turning to the merits of Respondents\u2019 appeal, the court held that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the contractor\u2019s defense would insulate from liability a custom manufacturer that built a product to customer specifications, a factual dispute existed as to whether Petitioner contributed to the Machine\u2019s design and, therefore, the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment on the design defect counts. Because, however, Respondents \u201cfailed to meet their burden of producing evidence of [Petitioner\u2019s] specifications and the Machine\u2019s non-conformance,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals upheld the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the manufacturing defect counts. As to the counts alleging failure to warn, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>court held that the sophisticated user defense shielded Petitioner from liability because Hanover was a \u201c \u2018knowledgeable industrial user\u2019 that had \u2018reason to know of any dangerous condition which might be inherent in the product\u2019 \u201d and, therefore, affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on these counts. (Citation omitted). The Court of Special Appeals then addressed each of the counts alleging breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The court affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the breach of express warranty count, concluding that Respondents failed to present any evidence that Petitioner was aware that employees would obtain brine samples and therefore \u201ccould not have expressly warranted the Machine\u2019s safety for this use.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals reversed, however, the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with respect to the count alleging breach of implied warranty of merchantability. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Respondents, the court concluded that Respondents had produced sufficient evidence to create a question of fact as to whether the Machine would \u201c \u2018[pjass without objection in the trade under the contract description[.]\u2019 \u201d (Quoting Md. Code (1999 RepLVol., 2005 Supp.), \u00a7 2-314(l)(a) of the Commercial Law Article). Finally, discerning no evidence in the record that Petitioner knew that Hanover employees would obtain brine samples near the Machine, the court affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the count alleging breach of implied warranty for a particular purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Consequently, on October 20, 2009, Petitioner filed with this Court a petition for writ of certiorari, and on November 4, 2009, Respondents filed a conditional cross-petition for writ of certiorari. We granted both petitions. <em>Miller Metal Fabrication, Inc. v. Wall, </em>411 Md. 740, 985 A.2d 538 (2009).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>mentioned, however, we shall not reach the issues presented because, for the reasons we shall explain, the Circuit Court\u2019s certification of the order granting summary judgment in Petitioner\u2019s favor did not merit certification pursuant to Rule 2-602(b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">It is a \u201clong-standing bedrock rule of appellate jurisdiction, practice, and procedure that, unless otherwise provided by law, the right to seek appellate review in this Court or the Court of Special Appeals ordinarily must await the entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>of a final judgment that disposes of all claims against all parties.\u201d <em>Silbersack v. AC &amp; S, Inc., </em>402 Md. 673, 678, 938 A.2d 855, 857 (2008); <em>see generally Planning Board v. Mortimer, </em>310 Md. 639, 644-48, 530 A.2d 1237, 1239-42 (1987) (outlining the pitfalls of permitting immediate appeals from every order issued in cases involving multiple claims or multiple parties). As stated above, Rule 2-602(b) provides an exception to this principle by permitting a trial court to certify as a final judgment an order adjudicating fewer than all of the claims against all of the parties in a given action. <em>Schuele v. Case Handyman &amp; Remodeling Servs., LLC, </em>412 Md. 555, 567, 989 A.2d 210, 217 (2010). Specifically, Rule 2-602(b) provides, in relevant part, that, \u201c[i]f the court expressly determines in a written order that there is no just reason for delay, it may direct in the order the entry of a final judgment ... as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Absent an \u201cexpress determination that there is no just reason for delay,\u201d an order directing the entry of a final judgment pursuant to Rule 2-602(b) is invalid. <em>See </em>Rule 2-602(b); <em>Blucher v. Ekstrom, </em>309 Md. 458, 462-63, 524 A.2d 1235, 1237 (1987) (concluding that a trial court order certified as a final judgment under Rule 2-602(b) was invalid because the order did not contain an \u201cexpress determination of no just reason for delay\u201d). In the present case, the Circuit Court order granting Respondents\u2019 motion for entry of a final judgment expressly stated that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay\u201d and thus satisfied the express requirements of Rule 2-602(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The discretionary authority vested in the trial courts by Rule 2-602 reflects their role as the \u201cdispatcher\u201d of final orders. <em>Mortimer, </em>310 Md. at 647, 530 A.2d at 1241. The Rule grants trial courts this discretionary authority because they sit at the best vantage point from which to determine whether a particular claim warrants an exception to the general rule requiring the entry of a final judgment disposing of all claims against all parties before an appeal may be taken. <em>Silbersack, </em>402 Md. at 678-79, 938 A.2d at 857-58 (acknowledging that the trial judge \u201cnormally has a much better grasp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>of the situation than an appellate court\u201d and is therefore viewed as the \u201cdispatcher\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>Smith v. Lead, </em>386 Md. 12, 26, 871 A.2d 545, 553 (2005) (\u201c[The trial court] not only has greater knowledge than an appellate court regarding the overall effect of an immediate appeal but a greater interest in whether the case remaining before it should be \u2018put on ice\u2019 while an interlocutory appeal proceeds.\u201d). Because the discretionary authority conferred by Rule 2-602 enables trial courts to grant exceptions to this \u201cbedrock rule of appellate jurisdiction,\u201d however, trial courts must reserve the exercise of this discretion for the \u201c \u2018very infrequent harsh case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silbersack, </em>402 Md. at 678-79, 938 A.2d at 857-58 (quoting <em>Diener Enters. v. Miller, </em>266 Md. 551, 556, 295 A.2d 470, 473 (1972)); <em>Diener, </em>266 Md. at 555-56, 295 A.2d at 473 (\u201cAs a guide to trial judges, we suggest that when they contemplate utilizing the provisions of [the Rule] to enter an appealable judgment they exercise considered discretion.\u201d). Thus, though we defer to a trial judge\u2019s advantage as the \u201cdispatcher\u201d of final orders, appellate courts retain the authority to review a trial court\u2019s exercise of its certification power \u201cto determine if there is anything in the record which establishes the existence of any hardship or unfairness which would justify discretionary departure from the usual rule establishing the time for appeal.\u201d <em>Lead, </em>386 Md. at 24-25, 871 A.2d at 552 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also Mortimer, </em>310 Md. at 648, 530 A.2d at 1242 (\u201cThe exercise of discretion is reviewable and should not be routinely exercised.\u201d); <em>Diener, </em>266 Md. at 555-556, 295 A.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">To assist appellate review of trial court decisions directing the entry of a final judgment pursuant to Rule 2-602, the Court of Special Appeals has strongly encouraged trial courts to set forth, in addition to the magic words \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d the reasons supporting such a determination. <em>Murphy v. Steele Software Sys. Corp., </em>144 Md.App. 384, 394, 798 A.2d 1149, 1154 (2002) (\u201cThe court should clearly articulate the reasons and factors underlying its decision to grant ... certification.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); <em>Canterbury Riding Condo. v. Chesapeake Investors, Inc., </em>66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Md.App. 635, 651, 505 A.2d 858, 866 (1986) (\u201cAlthough we stop short of adding any rigid requirement, ... when a trial judge certifies a case as final under Rule 2-602, we nonetheless find it more difficult to affirm the exercise of discretion where no reasons for that exercise are given.\u201d). Likewise, this Court has established that the trial court\u2019s failure to set forth those reasons leaves the certification determination less insulated from appellate scrutiny. <em>Miller &amp; Smith v. Casey PMN, LLC, </em>412 Md. 230, 245, 987 A.2d 1, 9 (2010)(\u201c[W]e will not hesitate to ... dismiss an appeal upon a finding that the trial court did not articulate a sufficient reason why there was no just reason for delay of an appeal.\u201d); <em>Silbersack, </em>402 Md. at 680, 938 A.2d at 858 (stating that, upon determining that certification was not sufficiently justified, \u2018Tthis Court and the Court of Special Appeals] have \u2018not hesitated to countermand the entry of a judgment under Rule 2-602(b)[.]\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Lead, </em>386 Md. at 25, 871 A.2d at 552)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Even though Rule 2-602 does not expressly require trial courts to set forth an explanation of the basis for the determination that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay,\u201d such express findings ensure \u201cmeaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Canterbury, </em>66 Md.App. at 650-51, 505 A.2d at 865-866 (noting that, because \u201cthe interests of judicial economy and the policy against piecemeal appeals are readily apparent considerations militating against certification,\u201d the absence of an explanation of a trial court\u2019s reasoning supporting certification leaves the court to \u201cspeculate as to what the countervailing considerations might be\u201d). In <em>Canterbury, </em>the Court of Special Appeals correctly noted that the current iteration of Rule 2-602(b) is derived from Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and, accordingly, that court relied on federal cases touting the utility of including in certification orders an explanation of the trial court\u2019s reasoning for determining that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 66 Md.App. at 648-50, 505 A.2d at 865-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>66 (\u201c[W]e note that neither Md.

Moreover, when trial courts expressly set forth the basis for the determination that there is \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d the presumption against piecemeal appeals is better safeguarded. <em>Braswell, </em>2 F.3d at 1336 (pointing out that encouraging the \u201cexercise\u201d of setting forth the reasons for a finding of \u201cno just reason for delay\u201d aids the trial court\u2019s assessment of the equities); <em>Harriscom, </em>947 F.2d at 629-30 (explaining that when the reasons for certification are not obvious the \u201cmere recitation of the language of the rule\u201d does not ensure sufficiently that trial court\u2019s engage in the requisite \u201creasoned analysis\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>Ettrick Wood Prods., </em>916 F.2d at 1218 (noting that encouraging trial courts to provide an explanation of the reasons for certification \u201censure[s] a reasoned exercise of discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Despite the benefits of mandating that all certification orders set forth the basis for the trial court\u2019s determination of \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d the federal courts have not uniformly interpreted Rule 54(b) to impose that strict requirement. <em>Compare Anthuis, </em>971 F.2d at 1003 (emphasizing that the trial court\u2019s failure to set forth the reasons for the exercise of its certification discretion was fatal to the certification), <em>with Willhauck, </em>953 F.2d at 702 n. 11 (noting that a written statement of the trial court\u2019s reasons for exercising its certification discretion is not necessary but is suggested). Instead, when faced with a certification decision without any explanation of the trial court\u2019s analysis, many of these courts have held that \u201cany deference [an appellate court] might otherwise accord ... the certification decision will be nullified.\u201d <em>Ebrahimi, </em>114 F.3d at 166-67; <em>see also Braswell, </em>2 F.3d at 1336 (acknowledging that, when the trial court\u2019s \u201ccertification is devoid of findings or reasoning in support thereof, the deference normally accorded such a certification is nullified\u201d); <em>Ettrick Wood Prods., </em>916 F.2d at 1218 (explaining that a trial court\u2019s failure to explain the exercise of its certification power subjects the certification determination to skepticism from appellate courts); <em>Knafel, </em>850 F.2d at 1159 (opining that \u201c[c]ertainly a proper exercise of discretion under Rule 54(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>requires the Ltrial court] [to] do more than just recite the 54(b) formula\u201d and when the trial court fails to \u201carticulate the analysis guiding it certification, any deference due the ... order is nullified\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); <em>Mooney, </em>784 F.2d at 876 (declining to \u201cmake mandatory a statement of reasons\u201d for the certification).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">As under federal law, Maryland recognizes a strong presumption against piecemeal appeals because, \u201c \u2018beyond being inefficient and costly, [piecemeal appeals] can create significant delays, hardship, and procedural problems.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silbersack, </em>402 Md. at 679, 938 A.2d at 858 (quoting <em>Lead, </em>386 Md. at 25, 871 A.2d at 553). Moreover, in our effort to emphasize the \u201climited nature of the discretion accorded under Rule 2-602(b),\u201d <em>Lead, </em>386 Md. at 25, 871 A.2d at 552, we have cited favorably opinions in which the Court of Special Appeals \u201ccountermanded] the entry of judgment under [the] Rule ... and dismissed] an appeal upon a finding that the trial court had not articulated a sufficient reason why there was no just reason for delay,\u201d <em>id., </em>871 A.2d at 552; <em>Silbersack, </em>402 Md. at 680, 938 A.2d at 858. Despite our emphasis on the importance of carefully considering the exercise of Rule 2-602(b) discretion and the propensity of this Court and the Court of Special Appeals to dismiss those appeals insufficiently supported, evidently some ambiguity as to the applicable standard of review remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Thus, we take this opportunity to eliminate any ambiguity and declare expressly the appellate standard of review of certification pursuant to Rule 2-602(b). We adopt the standard applied by a number of federal courts as expressed by the Fourth Circuit in <em>Braswell: </em>When a trial court, after expressly finding \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d directs the entry of a final judgment pursuant to Rule 2-602(b), but fails to articulate in the order or on the record the \u201cfindings or reasoning in support thereof, the deference normally accorded such a certification is nullified.\u201d 2 F.3d at 1336. Although this standard does not automatically invalidate an appeal taken from a certification order for which the trial court has failed to set forth an explanation of the reasons supporting its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>finding of \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d that order only will be a valid exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion if the record clearly demonstrates \u201cthe existence of any hardship or unfairness\u201d sufficient to \u201cjustify discretionary departure from the usual rule establishing the time for appeal.\u201d <em>Diener, </em>266 Md. at 555, 295 A.2d at 473; <em>see also Ebrahimi, </em>114 F.3d at 166 (\u201cIf the reasons for the entry of the judgment are obvious and remand to the [trial court] will result only in unnecessary delay in the appeal process, we will not require an explanation.\u201d); <em>Ettrick Wood Prods., </em>916 F.2d at 1218 (acknowledging that a failure to provide the rationale for the trial court\u2019s certification decision is not fatal \u201cwhere the reasons are apparent from the record\u201d). As alluded to above, this standard not only will facilitate appellate review of judgments certified under Rule 2-602(b), but also will ensure that Maryland trial courts considering certification carefully weigh the requisite judicial administrative interests against the \u201cexigencies of the case before them.\u201d <em>Diener, </em>266 Md. at 556, 295 A.2d at 473; <em>Silbersack, </em>402 Md. at 679, 938 A.2d at 858 (explaining that the purpose of Rule 2-602(b) is to prevent piecemeal appeals); <em>see also Ebrahimi, </em>114 F.3d at 166 (emphasizing that certification \u201cmust be reserved for the unusual case in which the costs and risks of ... overcrowding the appellate docket are outbalanced by pressing needs of the litigants for an early and separate judgment as to some claims or parties\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). With this standard of appellate review in mind, we now turn to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">As mentioned, the Circuit Court, pursuant to Rule 2-602(b), certified as a final judgment the order granting summary judgment in Petitioner\u2019s favor. The order reflecting that decision was entered without the benefit of a hearing, consisted of a single page, and provided no explanation for the court\u2019s determination that \u201cthere was no just reason for delay.\u201d We have established, however, that a trial court\u2019s failure to articulate the reasons supporting its finding of \u201cno just reason for delay\u201d is not fatal to the corresponding appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>if the record clearly demonstrates \u201cthe existence of any hardship or unfairness\u201d sufficient to \u201cjustify discretionary departure from the usual rule establishing the time for appeal.\u201d <em>Diener, </em>266 Md. at 555, 295 A.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Courts commonly find \u201cno just reason for delay\u201d when delaying an appeal will have a significant adverse economic impact on the party requesting certification. <em>See, e.g., Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. General Electric Co., </em>446 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 1460, 64 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980) (affirming certification because of the substantial daily economic losses the plaintiff would suffer if the appeal were delayed). Certification is not proper, however, when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">[t]he appellate court may be faced with having the same issues presented to it multiple times; the parties may be forced to assemble records, file briefs and records extracts, and prepare and appear for oral argument on multiple occasions; resolution of the claims remaining in the trial court may be delayed while the partial appeal proceeds, to the detriment of one or more parties and the orderly operation of the trial court; and partial rulings by the appellate court may do more to confuse than clarify the unresolved issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\"><em>Lead, </em>386 Md. at 25-26, 871 A.2d at 553. Certification is also improper when the pending claim, or claims, and the claim subject to appeal \u201carise from a nexus of fact and law so intertwined that if we decide the one now, we may nonetheless face many of the same questions in determining the other later.\u201d <em>Babbitt, </em>161 F.3d at 745; <em>Ebrahimi, </em>114 F.3d at 167 (noting that when the \u201cfactual underpinnings of the adjudicated and unadjudicated claims are intertwined, courts should be hesitant to employ Rule 54(b)\u201d). Furthermore, in the context of the certification of an order dismissing certain claims, a trial court\u2019s preference for \u201cearly review by the appellate court ... [to] eliminate the necessity for a second trial in the event\u201d of a reversal of those claims is not a proper basis upon which to rest a finding of \u201cno just reason for delay.\u201d <em>Ebrahimi, </em>114 F.3d at 168; <em>see also Murphy, </em>144 Md.App. at 394, 798 A.2d at 1155 (dismissing an appeal from a judgment entered pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>to a Rule 2-602 certification order because the trial court did not provide the reasons for exercising that discretion and the record suggested \u201cno more than a benefit to the parties and potential judicial economy to the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Our review of the record does not reveal \u201chardship or unfairness\u201d sufficient to \u201cjustify discretionary departure from the usual rule establishing the time for appeal.\u201d <em>Diener, </em>266 Md. at 555, 295 A.2d at 473. Nothing in the record indicates that the parties would suffer significant hardship, financial or otherwise, if required to wait to appeal until after the counts alleged against Country Fresh are resolved and a final judgment is entered as to both parties. Moreover, despite Respondents\u2019 arguments to the contrary, we are not persuaded that immediate appellate review of the issues presented in this case would serve the interests of judicial economy. Instead, because Respondents allege against Country Fresh and Petitioner a single claim, albeit comprised of multiple counts, arising out of identical facts, we would be remiss to permit an appeal at this time. <em>See Babbitt, </em>161 F.3d at 745; <em>Ebrahimi, </em>114 F.3d at 167. <em>Cf. Wilde v. Swanson, </em>314 Md. 80, 87-88, 548 A.2d 837, 840-41 (1988) (affirming certification of an order dismissing a claim for lack of venue against a single defendant in an action against multiple defendants because, if erroneous, the order would unnecessarily require the plaintiffs to assert the same claims, arising out of the same occurrence, in two separate actions in two separate courts). Under such circumstances, the risk is great that separate appeals presenting the same issues would arise and therefore certification would be an inefficient use of judicial resources. Finally, speculating (as we must because of the dearth of findings related to the Circuit Court\u2019s exercise of its certification discretion) that the Circuit Court granted Respondents\u2019 motion for certification to seek the benefit of \u201cearly review by the appellate court,\u201d we reiterate that this is an improper justification for the exercise of the discretion granted by Rule 2-602(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Because the record does not support the Circuit Court\u2019s finding of \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Circuit Court abused its discretion when it granted Respondents\u2019 motion to certify pursuant to Rule 2-602(b) the order granting summary judgment in favor of Petitioner.
