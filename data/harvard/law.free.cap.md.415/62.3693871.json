Accordingly, the trial court excluded the evidence, but the Court of Special Appeals, relying on <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), and our decisions applying <em>Leon, </em>concluded that exclusion was inappropriate because the police officers relied on the warrant in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We shall hold that the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule, as established by the Supreme Court in <em>Leon </em>and applied by this Court in <em>Patterson v. State, </em>401 Md. 76, 930 A.2d 348 (2007), and other cases, does not prohibit exclusion of the evidence in this case. The affidavit submitted to the issuing judge provided no indicia of probable cause to believe that contraband would be found in the petitioner\u2019s home. The affidavit also provided limited facts suggesting that the petitioner was involved with criminal activity that might justify the search. Accordingly, no reasonably well-trained police officer could have believed that there was probable cause to search the petitioner\u2019s home. We shall therefore hold that the trial court was correct to suppress the evidence recovered during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">This case originated in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On April 11, 2007, the petitioner, Gary Samuel Agurs, was arrested and charged with a variety of offenses relating to possession and distribution of Controlled Dangerous Substances (\u201cCDS\u201d) and possession of firearms. He was subsequently indicted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before trial, he filed a motion asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the trial court to exclude all evidence recovered from a search of his home and vehicles, arguing that there had been no probable cause to support the warrant authorizing the search and that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply. On April 17, 2008, the trial judge conducted a hearing and granted Agurs\u2019 motion, concluding that there had been no probable cause upon which to base the warrant because there was no \u201cnexus between any illegal activity, the home, or his vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The State noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That court issued an unpublished opinion in which it reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling. Although the intermediate appellate court concluded that \u201cthe issuing judge had a substantial basis to find probable cause that Agurs was somehow involved with [his alleged associate Andrew] Tillman in the distribution of cocaine,\u201d it also concluded that no warrant should have been issued to search Agurs\u2019 house or vehicles because \u201cthe issuing judge did not have a substantial basis to conclude there was a fair probability police would find evidence of drug law violations\u201d in those places. Nonetheless, the intermediate appellate court held that exclusion was inappropriate because it concluded that \u201cnone of the four established limitations to the [good faith exception to the exclusionary rule] apply to the warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Agurs petitioned this Court for certiorari, presenting the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">Whether the Court of Special Appeals misconstrued <em>Patterson v. State, </em>401 Md. 76 [930 A.2d 348] (2007), and erred in finding good faith where the search warrant was based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>an affidavit that was so lacking in probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable?[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We granted certiorari on that question, <em>Agurs v. State, </em>407 Md. 275, 964 A.2d 675 (2009), and shall answer it in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">On April 6, 2007, two detectives from the Baltimore City Narcotics Unit applied for and obtained \u201ca search and seizure warrant pertaining to violations of the Controlled Dangerous Substance laws, Criminal CR 5-101 through CR 5-1101<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Criminal Law Article of Maryland.\u201d The affidavit submitted in support of the application for the warrant lists two residences, five vehicles, and four individuals to be searched. The affidavit identifies one of the residences, 3 Six Point Ct., Windsor Mill, MD 21244, as Agurs\u2019 residence, based on the detectives\u2019 review of Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) records. The affidavit asserts that the other residence, 904 Mount Holly St., Baltimore, MD 21229, was frequented by Agurs\u2019 alleged associate, Andrew Lee Tillman. Four of the vehicles listed in the affidavit are identified as belonging to Agurs, with the other belonging to Tillman.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The four individuals to be searched were Agurs; Maria Bertina Agurs, Agurs\u2019 wife; Tillman; and Talesha Shappell Conquest, who is identified as living in and owning the second residence and owning a vehicle Tillman was seen driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>After setting forth the places and people to be searched, the affidavit describes the detectives applying for the warrant. One detective is described as having been a member of the Baltimore City Police Department since March 1998 and as having had training in illegal narcotics enforcement, automobile theft, wiretaps, and current drug trends. It also describes him as having worked in a variety of departments and as having testified as an expert witness in the area of illegal narcotics. Finally, the affidavit asserts that the detective is familiar with CDS and drug paraphernalia, has participated in hundreds of arrests involving narcotics, and has executed approximately 400 search and seizure warrants for illegal narcotics. The affidavit describes the other detective as having been a member of the Baltimore City Police Department since 2002 and as having been involved with over 500 drug arrests and over 30 search and seizure warrants. It also describes his specialized training related to CDS; familiarity with the language, terminology, street slang, prices, and packaging related to CDS; and involvement with surveillance of thousands of narcotics transactions. Finally, the affidavit asserts that the detective has interviewed narcotics distributors and users, has testified as an expert witness concerning CDS, and has been part of the Baltimore City Organized Crime Division Narcotics Investigation Section and Violent Crime Impact Team.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The affidavit then sets forth information about drug traffickers that the detectives \u201cknow[ ]\u201d because of their \u201ctraining, experience and participation in other investigations involving illegal CDS.\u201d The detectives asserted their belief that drug traffickers often use assumed names, keep large amounts of cash on hand, maintain records relating to their trafficking, keep contraband and other related items in secure locations (such as their residences), use domestic banks and other financial devices to store their profits, maintain records of their associates, take and keep photographs of themselves and their possessions, use vehicles to move drugs and currency, and rent the vehicles they use for such activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Next, the affidavit asserts a variety of alleged facts that were \u201ceither known to [the detectives] through personal observation or [had] been obtained through reliable confidential sources, law enforcement reports and/or directly from other law enforcement officers.\u201d As these asserted facts are central to this case, we shall summarize them extensively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">\u2022 The police had been investigating drug trafficking in the Edmondson Village and Cherry Hill areas of Baltimore City, and \u201cmultiple confidential informants\u201d advised the detectives that \u201cAgurs and associates were upper level distributors supplying crack cocaine in and around these locations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">\u2022 A confidential informant, referred to as \u201cCI-2440,\u201d had previously led the police to several drug arrests and seizures. Another confidential informant, referred to as \u201cCI-3232,\u201d had led the police to recover \u201capproximately 2 ounces of suspected crack cocaine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u2022 CI-2440 informed the police that \u201ca male known as \u2018G\u2019 was supplying suspected crack cocaine in and around the area of Edmondson Village.\u201d He informed the police that he did not personally know \u201cG,\u201d but that \u201cG\u201d was a Baltimore City employee who \u201cwas assisted by his \u2018cousin\u2019 ... \u2018Dru.\u2019 \u201d Based on a photo of Agurs, CI-2440 positively identified Agurs as \u201cG.\u201d Agurs was an employee in the Baltimore City Department of Public Works in the Sanitation Division.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">\u2022 In March 2007, under police observation and direction, CI-3232 made two controlled purchases of suspected crack cocaine from Tillman, who was driving a burgundy 1999 Mercury Grand Marquis with tinted windows and Maryland tag number A128989. CI-3232 advised the police that Tillman was known as \u201cDru.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">\u2022 On or about March 27, 2007, the police followed Tillman as he drove around Cherry Hill in the same Grand Marquis for approximately two hours. They saw Tillman park in several areas, where people approached his car and entered the passenger side for about one minute each. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>people each left \u201cactively and cautiously looking around prior to quickly leaving the area.\u201d Police followed Tillman into Edmondson Village, where Tillman parked and entered the rear door of 904 Mount Holly St.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u2022 On or about March 30, 2007, the police saw Agurs leave 3 Six Point Ct. and enter a burgundy 2007 Ford F-150 with Maryland tag number 17T388, which he drove for approximately ten minutes while talking on a cell phone. Agurs parked and stood outside of the 2800 block of W. Lafayette Ave., where a black Infinity pulled up and an unknown black male left the car and approached Agurs. They entered a clothing store for approximately one minute, after which \u201cthe unknown male slowly exited the store cautiously looking around in each direction\u201d with \u201ca bulge in his right pocket, which was not previously noticeable.\u201d Both men left the area in their vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u2022 Agurs then drove his truck to an auto detail shop, where he stood for approximately an hour while talking on his cell phone and with passers-by. Tillman then pulled up to the detail shop in the Grand Marquis and Agurs got in the passenger side of the car. Agurs left Tillman\u2019s car two minutes later and Tillman \u201cquickly left the area,\u201d after which Agurs drove away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u2022 Police saw Tillman entering or leaving 904 Mount Holly St. several times, most recently around March 27, 2007, and they saw his Grand Marquis there early in the morning and late at night. Constellation Energy records listed Conquest as the account-holder for 904 Mount Holly St., and the police searched several databases to determine that Conquest owned the home and listed it as her residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">\u2022 The Grand Marquis had never been seen at its registered address, 311 Mountain Ridge Ct., Apt. I, Glen Burnie MD, 21061, which Tillman listed as his address with the MVA. The Constellation Energy account at that address was inactive. On or about November 8, 2006, Tillman provided the 311 Mountain Ridge Ct. address to the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>during a traffic stop. He was operating a 1993 Honda Accord registered and owned by Conquest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u2022 The police saw Agurs enter and leave 3 Six Point Ct. several times, most recently around March 30, 2007. His vehicles\u2014a 2001 Ford Explorer, a 2006 Mercedes, a 2007 Lexus, and the Ford F-150\u2014were seen there multiple times during the early morning and evening. Constellation Energy records listed Agurs as the account holder for 3 Six Point Ct., and the police searched several databases to determine that Agurs and his wife owned the home and listed it as their residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u2022 Agurs\u2019 criminal record shows that he was convicted of CDS manufacturing and production in 1991 and of CDS possession twice in 1987. It also shows that he has been convicted of prostitution twice (2002 and 2000), robbery (1991), and \u201cunauthorized use\u201d (1987), and that charges for assault with intent to commit murder (1994) and theft (1987) were put on the inactive docket. Tillman had no prior criminal record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">\u2022 Agurs\u2019 pre-taxed wage earnings as a Baltimore City employee were $30,701 for 2005 and $23,766 through the first three quarters of 2006. Maria Agurs\u2019 pre-tax wage earnings were $1,686 for the fourth quarter of 2005 and $6,171 for the first two quarters of 2006. Tillman\u2019s pre-tax wage earnings were $74 for the third quarter of 2005, and he had no reported income for 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">\u2022 The police determined the approximate market values of the homes and vehicles belonging to Agurs, Maria Agurs, Tillman, and Conquest. The 3 Six Point Ct. home was valued at $320,000; the Ford F-150 at $35,000-$39,420; the Lexus at $46,279-$53,090; the Mercedes at $90,590-$97,275; the Ford Explorer at $8,830; the Mercury Grand Marquis at $6,360-$6,885; and the 904 Mount Holly St. home at $62,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Based on these asserted facts, the affidavit concludes that probable cause existed to believe that Agurs and Tillman \u201care participating in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>monly known as crack cocaine\u201d and \u201cthat the premises at 3 Six Point Court ... and 904 Holly Street ... are being used for the storage and distribution of narcotics, narcotics proceeds, and the facilitation of narcotics offenses.\u201d The affidavit also concludes that \u201cevidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of the aforementioned violations of the [CDS] laws\u201d will be found on Agurs and Tillman and at the 3 Six Point Ct. and 904 Mount Holly St. residences. The particular items to be seized included CDS, documents related to drug trafficking, drug paraphernalia, travel documents, currency, indicia of occupancy, firearms, and communication devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">On April 6, 2007, based on this affidavit, the police obtained a warrant to search the 3 Six Point Ct. residence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Members of the Baltimore City Narcotics Unit executed the warrant on April 11, 2007. In the residence, they recovered cocaine, marijuana, over $30,000 in United States currency, a digital scale, a handgun and ammunition, a Breitling watch in a \u201cfalse book,\u201d a Rolex watch, paperwork, and numerous empty jars. The police also searched four vehicles parked on the property, each of which was identified in the affidavit as belonging to Agurs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the Lexus, they recovered another handgun, more ammunition, and paperwork. They recovered another Rolex watch from the Mercedes.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">As explained above, Agurs asked the trial court to suppress the items seized during the search. The trial judge granted that request, concluding that there had been no substantial basis for the issuing judge to find probable cause to search Agurs\u2019 home and vehicles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The State appealed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the Court of Special Appeals reversed the trial judge\u2019s ruling, agreeing with the trial court that there had been no substantial basis for the warrant, but concluding that exclusion was nonetheless inappropriate because the officers had relied on the warrant in good faith. Agurs petitioned this Court for certiorari, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AT7\">Constitutional Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">This case concerns our application of the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule, as established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Leon </em>and applied by this Court in <em>Patterson </em>and other cases. Application of this exception involves the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, <em>Leon, </em>and cases applying <em>Leon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The Fourth Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">U.S. Const, amend. IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">In <em>Patterson, </em>a case in which we applied the good faith exception, we discussed the Fourth Amendment\u2019s probable cause requirement as it relates to search warrants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">Probable cause has been defined by this Court as a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>found in a particular place. Probable cause is a nontechnical conception of a reasonable ground for belief that the items sought will be found in the premises searched. Probable cause involves practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">Before conducting a search, ordinarily the police must obtain a search warrant that is, itself, based upon sufficient probable cause to justify its issuance as to each person or place named therein. The judge issuing that warrant must make a practical common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him [or her], including the \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">401 Md. at 91-92, 930 A.2d at 358 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Subject to a few exceptions that are inapplicable here, a search conducted without a warrant supported by probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches. <em>Belote v. State, </em>411 Md. 104, 112, 981 A.2d 1247, 1252 (2009). The exclusionary rule, which was adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914), and applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), is \u201cordinarily ... the appropriate remedy for a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Myers v. State, </em>395 Md. 261, 278, 909 A.2d 1048, 1058 (2006). The exclusionary rule has its limitations, however, as the Supreme Court has explained repeatedly, most recently in the Court\u2019s last term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">The fact that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>that a search or arrest was unreasonable\u2014does not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 223, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>527 (1983). Indeed, exclusion \u201chas always been our last resort, not our first impulse,\u201d <em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586, 591, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006), and our precedents establish important principles that constrain application of the exclusionary rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><em>Herring v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 695, 700, 172 L.Ed.2d 496, 504 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">One limitation on the exclusionary rule is the good faith exception, which the Supreme Court established in <em>Leon. </em>In that case, the Court weighed \u201cthe costs and benefits of preventing the use in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief of inherently trustworthy tangible evidence obtained in reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate that ultimately is found to be defective.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 907, 104 S.Ct. at 3412, 82 L.Ed.2d at 688. The Court concluded \u201cthat the marginal or nonexistent benefits produced by suppressing evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search warrant cannot justify the substantial costs of exclusion,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922, 104 S.Ct. at 3420, 82 L.Ed.2d at 698. The Court therefore held that \u201c[i]n the absence of an allegation that the magistrate abandoned his detached and neutral role, suppression is appropriate only if the officers were dishonest or reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926, 104 S.Ct. at 3422, 82 L.Ed.2d at 700-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Like the exclusionary rule itself, however, this good faith exception has limits. In <em>Leon, </em>the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">We do not suggest, however, that exclusion is always inappropriate in cases where an officer has obtained a warrant and abided by its terms. \u201c[Sjearches pursuant to a warrant will rarely require any deep inquiry into reasonableness,\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S., at 267 [103 S.Ct. 2317] (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment), for \u201ca warrant issued by a magistrate normally suffices to establish\u201d that a law enforcement officer has \u201cacted in good faith in conducting the search.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 823, n. 32 [102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>S.Ct 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572] (1982). Nevertheless, the officer\u2019s reliance on the magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination and on the technical sufficiency of the warrant he issues must be objectively reasonable, <em>cf. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 815-819 [102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396] (1982), and it is clear that in some circumstances the officer will have no reasonable grounds for believing that the warrant was properly issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 922-23,104 S.Ct. at 3420, 82 L.Ed.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The <em>Leon </em>Court outlined four situations where the good faith exception would not apply even though the police had relied on a warrant when conducting a search that was not based on probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 923, 104 S.Ct. at 3421, 82 L.Ed.2d at 698-99. We described those situations in <em>Patterson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">(1) the magistrate was mislead by information in an affidavit that the officer knew was false or would have known was false except for the officer\u2019s reckless regard for the truth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">(2) the magistrate wholly abandoned his detached and neutral judicial role;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">(3) the warrant was based on an affidavit that was so lacking in probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">(4) the warrant was so facially deficient, by failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized, that the executing officers cannot reasonably] presume it to be valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">401 Md. at 104, 930 A.2d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">Of these four situations, only the third is at issue in this case. We explained this limitation on the good faith exception in <em>Patterson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-13\">This exception under <em>Leon </em>requires the application of an objective test of a police officer\u2019s good faith reliance on the search warrant. The objective test requires that \u201cofficers, exercising professional judgment, could have reasonably believed that the averments of their affidavit related [ ] a present and continuing violation of law, not remote from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>date of their affidavit, and that the evidence sought would be likely found at [the place identified in the affidavit].\u201d <em>Connelly [v.

As we have explained, \u201cit is [appropriate] for the appellate court to decide whether the affidavit was sufficient to support the requisite belief that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>warrant was valid\u201d because this is an \u201cobjectively ascertainable question.\u201d <em>Connelly, </em>322 Md. at 735, 589 A.2d at 967; <em>see also McDonald v.

DeQuasie, </em>373 F.3d 509, 520 (4th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We have applied the good faith exception in a number of situations, and we have typically refused to apply the limitation at issue in this case. For example, we concluded in <em>Patterson </em>that the police had relied on a warrant in good faith even though the affidavit submitted to the issuing judge asserted few facts suggesting that contraband would be found in the place to be searched. 401 Md. at 107-10, 930 A.2d at 367-69. Patterson had fled the police after a traffic stop, and the police discovered an empty holster beneath him when they tackled him. <em>Id. </em>at 82-83, 930 A.2d at 352. An eyewitness had also seen Patterson holding his hip as he ran. <em>Id. </em>at 83, 930 A.2d at 352. The police never found a gun, but they subsequently searched the vicinity of the chase and found ammunition that could be used in a gun that fit the holster. <em>Id. </em>at 83-84, 930 A.2d at 352-53. The police also discovered that Patterson had been convicted for being an accessory to murder after the fact four and a half years earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 85 n. 3, 930 A.2d at 353 n. 3. After surveilling Patterson for the next 34 days, the police applied for and received a search warrant to search for a gun and related items in a motel room that Patterson was seen frequenting. <em>Id. </em>at 84-87, 930 A.2d at 353-55; <em>see also </em>Md.Code (2003), \u00a7 5-133(c) of the Public Safety Article (prohibiting possession of a regulated firearm by individuals who have been convicted of a crime of violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We concluded that the warrant had been issued without a substantial basis to find probable cause. <em>Patterson, </em>401 Md. at 103, 930 A.2d at 365. In our view, there were too few facts indicating that Patterson had a gun in the hotel room considering that so much time had passed between the arrest and the warrant application and that there were no facts connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ing Patterson to ongoing criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 101-03, 930 A.2d at 364-65. We nonetheless held that the officer\u2019s reliance on the warrant was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d and that exclusion was inappropriate because \u201c[t]he warrant application provided, although substantially weak, some indicia of probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 930 A.2d at 367-68.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We also noted that each of the lower courts reviewing the warrant application had upheld the warrant, which further indicated that the officers\u2019 reliance on the warrant was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 109, 930 A.2d at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">We have applied the good faith exception in other cases and similarly determined that the third limitation to that exception did not require exclusion. In <em>McDonald, </em>marijuana was discovered in a package to be delivered to McDonald\u2019s home and, based on that discovery, a warrant was issued to search his home. 347 Md. at 456-58, 701 A.2d at 677-78. The warrant was not conditioned on delivery of the package to the home. <em>Id. </em>at 461, 701 A.2d at 679. Accordingly, McDonald argued that the warrant was an anticipatory warrant and that, as a result, there had been no probable cause to issue it. <em>Id. </em>at 456, 701 A.2d at 677. We chose to address the good faith issue without deciding whether probable cause was lacking, holding that \u201cthe affidavit was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause that it was unreasonable for the officers to rely upon it\u201d because the police \u201cwere aware of the contents of the package, the package\u2019s weight, the delivery address, and the use of what appearj ed] to be a fictitious name\u201d on the package. <em>Id. </em>at 469-70, 472, 701 A.2d at 683-84. We came to a similar conclusion in <em>Minor v. State, </em>where we held that although the affidavit provided no information about the confidential sources upon which the applying officer had relied, it did note particular facts that the informant had told the police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>about the location of the goods to be recovered, about the goods themselves, about the location from which the goods had been stolen, and about the time when they were stolen. 334 Md. 707, 715-20, 641 A.2d 214, 217-19 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We also found good faith on the part of the police officers in <em>Connelly, </em>322 Md. at 735, 589 A.2d at 967. A warrant to search Connelly\u2019s home and store had been issued pursuant to an affidavit that failed to provide specific dates for the surveillance upon which it was based. <em>Id. </em>at 733-34, 589 A.2d at 965-67. We held that exclusion of the evidence recovered was still inappropriate because the affidavit could be read in one of two ways: as either \u201cpresenting stale probable cause\u201d or indicating \u201cthat the affiants ... were describing a continuing criminal enterprise, ongoing at the time of their application, and thus the probable cause relied upon was not stale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734, 589 A.2d at 966. We concluded that because, under these circumstances, \u201creasonable minds may differ as to the correct determination,\u201d the officers could have relied upon the affidavit in good faith. <em>Id. </em>at 735, 589 A.2d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We have not, however, always refused to apply the third limitation to the good faith exception. In <em>Greenstreet v. State, </em>we concluded that the police could not have relied on the warrant in good faith because the affidavit submitted to the issuing judge asserted stale facts. 392 Md. 652, 682-83, 898 A.2d 961, 979 (2006). The affidavit stated that the police had searched Greenstreet\u2019s trash, but\u2014perhaps due to a typographical error\u2014it also stated that the search was performed 11 months before any other evidence was gathered and one year before the warrant was issued. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 898 A.2d at 979. Considering the remoteness of this evidence, we concluded that \u201cthe lack of probable cause [was] apparent on the face of the affidavit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 898 A.2d at 979. Accordingly, we held that the evidence recovered during the search should be excluded. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">These cases present some generally applicable principles regarding the third limitation to the good faith exception. This limitation is inapplicable where there is \u201csome indicia of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>probable cause.\u201d <em>See Patterson, </em>401 Md. at 108, 930 A.2d at 368; <em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 472, 701 A.2d at 685. It is also inapplicable when reasonable minds might disagree about its applicability. <em>See Connelly, </em>322 Md. at 735, 589 A.2d at 967. It will apply, however, when the absence of probable cause \u201cis apparent on the face of the affidavit.\u201d <em>Greenstreet, </em>392 Md. at 683, 898 A.2d at 979. With these principles in mind, we turn to the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Our only inquiry in this case is whether the evidence recovered during the search of Agurs\u2019 home should be excluded or whether the <em>Leon </em>good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies, making exclusion inappropriate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We shall conclude that the evidence should be excluded because the affidavit submitted to the issuing judge lacked any indicia of probable cause supporting the conclusion that drugs would be found in Agurs\u2019 home. Furthermore, the affidavit provided limited facts suggesting that Agurs was involved with drug distribution. Under these circumstances, no reasonably well-trained police officer could have relied on the warrant that authorized the search of Agurs\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In his brief filed in this Court, Agurs argues that the third limitation to the good faith exception makes exclusion appropriate, <em>ie., </em>\u201cthe warrant was based on an affidavit that was so lacking in probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>401 Md. at 104, 930 A.2d at 365. He bases this argument on several contentions: (1) the police should have realized that a nexus between criminal activity and the place to be searched is necessary for probable cause to exist, (2) the affidavit was so lacking in indicia of a nexus that the police could not have reasonably believed probable cause existed, (3) there was no substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>basis for the issuing judge to find probable cause of Agurs\u2019 involvement with drugs, and (4) the warrant was over-inclusive such that the police could not have relied on it in good faith.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In response, the State asserts that the police reasonably relied on the warrant because: (1) the warrant was not based on purely conclusory statements, (2) the warrant had some indicia of probable cause, (3) a nexus may be established by the police officer\u2019s knowledge based on the officer\u2019s training and experience, (4) the affidavit does establish a nexus, and (5) the warrant was not over-inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\n<em>Nexus Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">We first consider whether the police should have been aware that there must be a nexus between criminal activity and the place to be searched. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that this nexus requirement is a \u201cfine legal detail\u201d that officers could not be required to know. We disagree. As we explained in <em>Greenstreet, </em>\u201c[a] well-trained police officer is required to be aware of well-established current law and to have a reasonable knowledge of what the law prohibits.\u201d 392 Md. at 679, 898 A.2d at 977. Our interpretation of the nexus requirement is sufficiently well-established that the police must be aware of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We explained extensively the nexus requirement in <em>Holmes v. State, </em>368 Md. 506, 796 A.2d 90 (2002), where we considered whether there had been probable cause to search Holmes\u2019 residence when he was known to have been selling cocaine. We held that probable cause to search Holmes\u2019 residence could be based on inferences, as opposed to direct evidence, that suggested contraband would be found there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Direct evidence that contraband exists in the home is not required for a search warrant; rather, probable cause may be inferred from the type of crime, the nature of the items sought, the opportunity for concealment, and reasonable inferences about where the defendant may hide the incriminating items. The thrust of [cases stating this rule] was characterized by the court in <em>[United States v. Thomas, </em>989 F.2d 1252, 1255 (D.C.Cir.1993) ], in a unanimous <em>per curiam </em>opinion by a panel that included now Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that \u201cobservations of illegal activity occurring away from the suspect\u2019s residence, can support a finding of probable cause to issue a search warrant for the residence, <em>if there is a reasonable basis to infer from the nature of the illegal activity observed, that relevant evidence will be found in the </em>residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 522, 796 A.2d at 100 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Although we concluded that direct evidence that contraband will be found in a suspected criminal\u2019s home is not required to establish probable cause to search that home, we also explained that the suspect\u2019s alleged participation in criminal activity, on its own, would not necessarily be enough:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">[T]he mere observation, documentation, or suspicion of a defendant\u2019s participation in criminal activity will not necessarily suffice, by itself, to establish probable cause that inculpatory evidence will be found in the home. There must be something more that, directly or by reasonable inference, will allow a neutral magistrate to determine that the contraband may be found in the home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 523, 796 A.2d at 100-01 (citations omitted). We concluded that a nexus existed between Holmes\u2019 alleged drug sales and his home because, among other things, the police had observed Holmes in a drug transaction that occurred less than a block from his home, they had seen him frequently enter and exit his home around the time of the transaction, and they had discovered drugs on him before they conducted the search. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 796 A.2d at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals considered the nexus requirement soon after our decision in <em>Holmes. </em>In <em>State v. Coley, </em>the intermediate appellate court noted \u201cthat some jurisdictions have held that there is probable cause to believe that drug dealers will keep drugs and records of the drug trade in their homes,\u201d but the court refused to adopt that rule. 145 Md. App. 502, 527 n. 18, 805 A.2d 1186, 1202 n. 18 (2002). The Court of Special Appeals instead noted that Maryland \u201chas explicitly rejected this notion\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">[t]he approach used by Maryland ... and other jurisdictions requires some nexus be established, even in the absence of direct evidence, between the nature of the items sought and the place where they are to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 527-28 n. 18, 805 A.2d at 1202 n. 18 (citing <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d at 101).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded in <em>Coley </em>that the affidavit established a nexus between Coley\u2019s alleged drug sales and his home because it asserted several important facts: the officers believed that drug traffickers in the county in question were likely to store contraband in their homes; an informant had stated that there was a connection between Coley\u2019s drug sales and his home; and Coley entered and exited his home before and after controlled buys. <em>Id. </em>at 530-31, 805 A.2d at 1204. Although the intermediate appellate court determined that this established a sufficient nexus between Coley\u2019s alleged drug sales and his home to justify the warrant authorizing the search, it also noted that, \u201c[a]s in <em>Holmes, </em>we do not \u2018determine whether an isolated drug transaction, especially if it were to occur some considerable distance from the home, will suffice, because here there was additional evidence connecting the transaction to the home.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531 n. 19, 805 A.2d at 1204 n. 19 (quoting <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d at 101).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Coley </em>suggest, we have never provided a definitive test for establishing whether a sufficient nexus exists between alleged criminal activity and the suspected criminal\u2019s home. These cases do, however, establish some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>relevant principles. As evidenced by <em>Holmes, </em>there is more likely to be probable cause to search a suspected drug dealer\u2019s home when the police have seen the suspect engage in a drug sale near his home, when the police have found drugs on the suspect before the search, and when the defendant has been in and out of his home near the time of the drug sale. These factors support the \u201creasonable inference ... that the contraband may be found in the home.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d at 101; <em>see also Coley, </em>145 Md.App. at 530-31, 805 A.2d at 1204 (asserting similar facts). On the other hand, there must be facts shown from which this reasonable inference may be drawn. <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d at 100. Our decision in <em>Holmes </em>twice states that a suspect\u2019s home cannot be searched unless there are facts supporting a reasonable inference that contraband might be found there, 368 Md. at 522-23, 796 A.2d at 100-01, and the Court of Special Appeals reiterated that requirement in <em>Coley, </em>145 Md.App. at 526, 530, 805 A.2d at 1201, 1204. We conclude that these principles are sufficiently well-established that the police must be aware of them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>Good Faith</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Applying the principles from <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Coley </em>to this case, we further conclude that no reasonably well-trained police officer could have relied in good faith on the warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>authorizing the search of Agurs\u2019 home. Not only did the affidavit submitted to the issuing judge lack any indicia of probable cause that the nexus requirement was satisfied, it also provided limited facts suggesting that Agurs was involved with drug distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">As we have explained, we have interpreted the Fourth Amendment to require a reasonable inference that contraband may be found in a suspect\u2019s home before there will be probable cause to search there. <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d at 101. In its opinion below, the Court of Special Appeals explained how the affidavit in this case completely failed to establish such an inference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">There are only two items in the affidavit that might arguably establish a nexus between Agurs\u2019s criminal activity and his house. The first is the police officers\u2019 assertion, based on their significant training, experience, and expertise, that drug dealers often store drugs, cash, records, and other evidence of drug law violations in their residences. Such an assertion in an affidavit has some significance in determining whether there is a substantial basis to conclude police will actually find evidence at a drug dealer\u2019s home. <em>Coley, supra, </em>145 Md.App. at 530-31 [805 A.2d 1186]. In <em>Coley, </em>however, we did not hold that a defendant\u2019s status as a drug dealer entitles the police to search the defendant\u2019s home. To the contrary, we noted that Maryland has in the past rejected the notion that it is always reasonable to predict that evidence of crime will be found in the residence of a known drug dealer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">In <em>Coley, </em>we concluded an adequate nexus was provided by the evidence that Coley had engaged in drug transactions immediately after leaving the residence. In contrast, the affidavit in Agurs\u2019s case described no drug transaction that had any connection with the residence. The incident involving the clothing store on March 30, 2007, did not provide any nexus between the residence and drugs. To recount: Police observed Agurs exit his house and drive his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Ford F-150 to the 2800 block of W. Lafayette Avenue in the Baltimore neighborhood of Mosher. Agurs parked, exited his truck, and waited five minutes until a Nissan Infiniti pulled up in the same block. An unidentified man exited the passenger seat, approached Agurs, and the two entered a clothing store on the block together. The Nissan waited while about a minute of time passed. Then, according to the affidavit, \u201cthe unknown male slowly exited the store cautiously looking around in each direction. It was observed [that] this unknown male had a bulge in his right pocket, which was not previously noticeable.\u201d Agurs exited the store immediately behind the unidentified man. The latter got into the Nissan, which drove away. Agurs got into his Ford F150 and drove to the auto detail shop where he ultimately met Tillman, after which he drove away and the surveillance ended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Upon consideration of these facts, the Court of Special Appeals held that the conclusion that Agurs had drugs in his home \u201cfrom such ambiguous observations would require so much speculation that we are unable to agree that the issuing judge could reasonably find a nexus based on that portion of the affidavit.\u201d We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that a nexus in this case could only be based on unreasonable speculation and further conclude that such unreasonable speculation cannot provide the basis for a reasonable inference that contraband might be found in a suspect\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We disagree, however, with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the affidavit asserted \u201cenough information for the police officers to have believed, in good faith, that the issuing judge properly issued a valid warrant.\u201d While the affidavit included a significant number of facts about Agurs and Tillman, it failed to assert any facts suggesting a nexus between drugs and Agurs\u2019 home. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, the only factual assertion that could have possibly suggested such a nexus was that Agurs once left his home and met with another individual who subsequently had a previously unnoticed bulge in his pocket. This single assertion, which could have a number of innocent explanations, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>not constitute indicia of probable cause that drugs might be found in Agurs\u2019 home. Without such indicia, the lack of probable cause is \u201capparent on the face of the affidavit\u201d and the police could not have relied on the warrant in good faith. <em>See Greenstreet, </em>392 Md. at 683, 898 A.2d at 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The State, citing <em>Patterson, </em>argues that the good faith exception nonetheless applies because the warrant was \u201cbased on more than purely conclusory statements.\u201d We again disagree. Merely including non-conclusory statements in a warrant application does not necessarily make the good faith exception applicable. While the affidavit in this case does include a significant number of assertions, some of which may not be conclusory, it lacks any assertions establishing a reasonable inference that drugs might be found in Agurs\u2019 home. For example, the State points to statements from confidential sources implicating Agurs in drug distribution and to facts suggesting that the sources were reliable. These statements, whether conclusory or not, establish no relationship between drugs and Agurs\u2019 home. The State points to two assertions that do relate to Agurs\u2019 home\u2014the fact that he lives there and keeps \u201cexpensive assets\u201d there\u2014but these bear no relation to drugs. The single assertion that the State claims would establish an inference that Agurs keeps drugs in his home is the police officers\u2019 own \u201cbelief that they would find evidence of Agurs\u2019s illegal drug distribution conspiracy at this residence.\u201d This is precisely the sort of conclusory statement that cannot provide the basis for probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The State argues, however, that \u201c[t]he expertise of police officers along with circumstantial evidence is sufficient to establish [a] nexus.\u201d That has never been our interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To support its argument, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>State cites our decision in <em>Holmes</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Coley,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but, as we have explained, the nexus in each of those cases was based on more than just police officers\u2019 assertions. The State also cites <em>Patterson, </em>but the affidavit in <em>Patterson </em>asserted several facts that suggested a gun would be found in the hotel room Patterson was seen frequenting. Patterson, a convicted felon, fled the police after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>a routine traffic stop, he was seen holding his hip while running from the police, there was an empty holster beneath him when he was arrested, ammunition was found in the area where he was arrested, and the police could not find a gun at the scene of the arrest. <em>Patterson, </em>401 Md. at 108-09, 930 A.2d at 368. The inference to be drawn from these facts was that Patterson had returned to the scene of the chase and retrieved the gun, and that either the gun or evidence of his illegal possession of the gun would be found in his hotel room. Although the facts suggesting Patterson had a gun in his hotel room were \u201csubstantially weak,\u201d we held that these facts provided some indicia of probable cause that the nexus requirement was satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 930 A.2d at 368. In contrast, the affidavit in this case provided no such indicia. The police never saw Agurs with drugs of any kind, and he never exhibited any behavior that could not be easily interpreted as innocent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\"><em>Patterson </em>is distinguishable from the present case in other ways. The defendant in <em>Patterson </em>had a number of recent arrests, including arrests for five offenses within a year of the search, and at least one conviction, for being an accessory to murder after the fact, less than five years before the search. <em>Id. </em>at 85-86 n. 3, 930 A.2d at 353-55 n. 3. In addition, each of the judges who had previously considered the warrant in <em>Patterson </em>had concluded that there was a substantial basis for the issuing judge to find probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 109, 930 A.2d at 368; <em>see also Connelly, </em>322 Md. at 735, 589 A.2d at 966-67 (explaining that good faith might be found when \u201creasonable minds may differ\u201d as to whether probable cause existed). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Agurs, on the other hand, had no convictions within five years of the search and no CDS-related convictions within 15 years. Furthermore, each court reviewing the affidavit in the present case has agreed that it could not have possibly satisfied the nexus requirement. In our view, the warrant in <em>Patterson </em>fell into a grey area in which an officer could have relied on it in good faith; the warrant in this case did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The State\u2019s good faith argument is further weakened by the fact that the affidavit failed to provide a substantial basis to find probable cause that Agurs was involved with drug distribution. The Court of Special Appeals noted that many of the assertions suggesting Agurs was involved with drug distribution are \u201cspeculative],\u201d \u201cinconclusive,\u201d or have \u201cminimal\u201d probative value:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">The affidavit provides some evidence that Agurs and his wife were living beyond what their recent wages could support, but, as the suppression court noted, we can only speculate as to where the extra money came from. Additionally, the affidavit describes what would have been a drug deal between Agurs and an unidentified man at a clothing store, but, as discussed below, this also was too inconclusive for the issuing judge to draw any inference of criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">The affidavit also provides Agurs\u2019s criminal record, which does include drug law violations. Past convictions for drug law violations are relevant to determining whether there is probable cause to believe a suspect is currently dealing drugs. <em>[State v. Jenkins, </em>178 Md.App. 156, 187, 941 A.2d 517, 535 (2008) ] (citing <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 616 [224 A.2d 677] (1966)). Nevertheless, Agurs\u2019s criminal record, by itself, would not justify even a reasonable suspicion that he was involved in criminal activity. <em>See State v. Nieves, </em>383 Md. 573, 597 [861 A.2d 62] (2004) (\u201cto allow the reasonable articulable suspicion standard to be satisfied based upon a person\u2019s [criminal] status, rather than an individualized assessment of the circumstances, would undermine the purpose [of] requiring officers to justify their reasons for searching a particular individual.\u201d). Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the probable value of Agurs\u2019s convictions is minimal because they date back about twenty years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The Court of Special Appeals further explained that although the informant, CI-2440, who identified Agurs as a distributor of cocaine, had a history of reliability, the affidavit articulates \u201cbarely any basis of personal knowledge upon which the informant could claim that Agurs was involved in cocaine distribution.\u201d The intermediate appellate court also noted that CI-2440 told the police that Agurs worked for the City of Baltimore, although a tip from an informant \u201cmust provide something more than facts or details that are readily visible to the public.\u201d <em>Dixon v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 654, 697, 758 A.2d 1063, 1086 (2000); <em>see also Lee v. State, </em>311 Md. 642, 655, 537 A.2d 235, 241 (1988) (explaining that the State was required \u201cto present proof that the informer knew factual details about the crime beyond that which could be acquired by any person who for any reason whatsoever was interested in publicly reported facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The Court of Special Appeals did determine, however, that some of the assertions in the affidavit support the conclusion that Agurs was involved with drug distribution. CI-2440, who had a record of reliability, told the police that Agurs had a \u201ccousin\u201d named \u201cDru\u201d who assisted Agurs with his drug activities. A second informant, CI-3232, twice participated in controlled buys of drugs from Tillman and told the police that Tillman\u2019s nickname was \u201cDru.\u201d The intermediate appellate court considered these facts important because the affidavit also established that Agurs and Tillman were acquainted and that the two had met in a \u201cmanner in which other persons suspected of dealing in narcotics had interacted with Tillman.\u201d In addition, other unidentified and uncorroborated confidential informants had named Agurs as an upper-level distributor of cocaine. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that based on these assertions, \u201cthe issuing judge had a substantial basis to find probable cause that Agurs was <em>somehow </em>involved with Tillman in the distribution of cocaine.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">We do not accept this conclusion. As an initial matter, we do not apply the substantial basis standard in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>case. We apply the substantial basis standard when reviewing a judge\u2019s decision to issue a search warrant, see <em>Birchead v. State, </em>317 Md. 691, 701, 566 A.2d 488, 492-93 (1989), but that is not the issue before us. There is no question that the warrant in this case should not have been issued; the Court of Special Appeals concluded as such, and we denied the State\u2019s request to review that conclusion. The question before us is whether the officers relied in good faith on the warrant, as issued, and we make that determination as a matter of law, <em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 470 n. 10, 701 A.2d at 683 n. 10, upon a review of all the facts set forth in the affidavit, <em>Connelly, </em>322 Md. at 735, 589 A.2d at 966-67. The warrant in this case was based on Agurs\u2019 alleged involvement with drug distribution, so, in making the good faith determination, we shall consider the strength of the facts in the affidavit suggesting that Agurs was involved with drug distribution. The weaker those facts are, the less reasonable it was for the police to rely on the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">As the Court of Special Appeals explained, most of the facts asserted in the affidavit establish only an inconclusive connection between Agurs and drug distribution. For example, the police discovered a number of facts about Agurs through their own investigation: he seemed to be living beyond his means; he entered a clothing store with an individual who left the store with a bulge in his pocket; he had a criminal record. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, however, \u201cthe police observed no drugs and no transaction\u201d involving Agurs. Instead, their observations supported nothing more than mere speculation that Agurs was involved in drug distribution. <em>Cf. Ransoms v. State, </em>373 Md. 99, 111, 816 A.2d 901, 908 (2003) (finding no reasonable suspicion to frisk an individual who was in a high-crime area at night, with a bulge in his pocket, and was acting nervous around three un-uniformed police officers who approached him).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The informants\u2019 assertions are similarly inconclusive. GI-2440 told the police that someone named \u201cG,\u201d who CI-2440 identified as Agurs, worked for the City of Baltimore and was an upper-level drug distributor and that a \u201ccousin,\u201d known as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\u201cDru,\u201d assisted Agurs in this endeavor. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, however, the affidavit provided no basis for these assertions other than CI-2440\u2019s \u201cstreet level observations.\u201d In addition, CI-2440 apparently asserted no facts suggesting that he or she had personal knowledge about Agurs or his alleged drug distribution, such as predictive details about Agurs or any specific, non-public details about him. <em>Cf. Herod v. State, </em>311 Md. 288, 295, 534 A.2d 362, 365 (1987) (explaining that an informant\u2019s reliability was enhanced when she related \u201ca dozen specific facts\u201d about the defendant, ten of which the police corroborated); <em>Massey v. State, </em>173 Md.App. 94, 109, 917 A.2d 1175, 1183 (2007) (explaining that an informant\u2019s reliability \u201cwas enhanced when his statements about Massey\u2019s future actions were verified\u201d). As for the other confidential informants who made assertions about Agurs, the Court of Special Appeals correctly noted that the affidavit provided no information about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Little else suggests that CI-2440\u2019s statements are reliable. We recognize that, according to the affidavit, CI-2440 had supplied the police with reliable information in the past, which suggests that CI-2440\u2019s statements about Agurs were also reliable. <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 214, 821 A.2d 439, 448 (2003) (\u201cWhether a source is known to police or not is highly probative in determining whether the tip provided by the source is reliable.... \u201d). Contrary to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion, however, the statements were lacking in any independent corroboration. Other than the publicly-available fact that Agurs worked for the City of Baltimore, the police in this case did not verify any of the assertions that CI-2440 made about Agurs. CI-2440 told the police that a \u201ccousin,\u201d known as \u201cDru,\u201d assisted Agurs with drug distribution. A second informant, CI-3232, purchased drugs from Tillman and told the police that Tillman was known as \u201cDru.\u201d For all this might suggest about Tillman, it does not connect Agurs to drug distribution. It certainly does not corroborate CI-2440\u2019s assertion that \u201cDru\u201d was assisting Agurs with drug distribution. The meeting between Agurs and Tillman similarly fails to corroborate CI-2440\u2019s assertion about Agurs. The fact that the two men met does not establish that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>were involved in a drug distribution conspiracy, especially considering that the police apparently saw no exchange of anything, not to mention drugs, during the meeting. Other than a history of reliability, we see nothing that suggests that CI-2440\u2019s assertions about Agurs were reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The limited nature of the facts suggesting that Agurs was involved in drug distribution further establishes that the police officers\u2019 reliance on the warrant was unreasonable. Our cases support this conclusion, as neither this Court nor the Court of Special Appeals has ever found a nexus when the affidavit asserted such limited facts about the suspect\u2019s alleged criminal activity. For example, the affidavit in <em>Holmes </em>asserted that the police had seen Holmes engage in drug transactions and that they discovered drugs on him before the search of his residence. 368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d at 101. Similarly, the affidavit in <em>Coley </em>explained that the police had orchestrated two controlled buys of drugs from Coley. 145 Md.App. at 531, 805 A.2d at 1204. In <em>Patterson, </em>the affidavit established not only that Patterson had fled from the police after a routine traffic stop, but also that he was a recently convicted felon who appeared to have been illegally carrying a gun. 401 Md. at 108-09, 930 A.2d at 368. In this case, the Court of Special Appeals concluded only that Agurs was \u201csomehow\u201d involved with drugs, based entirely on inconclusive facts, uncorroborated statements by an informant with no stated personal knowledge to support those statements, and statements by unidentified and entirely uncorroborated informants. We are aware of no published cases where a nexus was established under such limited facts regarding the suspect\u2019s alleged criminal activity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The limited nature of the facts suggesting that Agurs was involved with drug distribution underscores our conclusion that the affidavit in this case completely failed to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>reasonable inference that Agurs had drugs in his home. To draw the inference that Agurs had drugs in his home, two factual leaps were necessary. First, the issuing judge had to infer that Agurs was involved with drug distribution based upon speculative assertions, the allegations of an uncorroborated informant who indicated no personal knowledge of Agurs\u2019 alleged criminal activities, and the allegations of unidentified and entirely uncorroborated informants. Second, based on that inference, the issuing judge had to infer that Agurs was likely to have drugs in his home, even though there were no indicia of probable cause to support this conclusion. We conclude that no reasonably well-trained police officer could have believed there was probable cause to search Agurs\u2019 home under these circumstances. Accordingly, the evidence recovered during that search must be excluded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The affidavit submitted to the issuing judge in this case was lengthy and detailed, but those qualities alone will not satisfy the Fourth Amendment. The affidavit must still assert facts that establish probable cause to justify the proposed search or seizure. Police officers cannot compensate for a lack of probable cause by submitting a lengthy affidavit and issuing judges must read carefully warrants and applications to ensure that this requirement is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We have interpreted the Fourth Amendment to require a reasonable inference that contraband may be found in a suspect\u2019s home before there will be probable cause to search that home. In this case, the police submitted an affidavit that completely failed to satisfy that requirement. The affidavit provided no indicia of probable cause that this requirement was met and provided limited facts suggesting that the suspect was involved with criminal activity. We conclude that no reasonably well-trained police officer could have relied upon this warrant in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\n<em>THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS REVERSED.

When we refer to the petitioner\u2019s \"home\u201d in this opinion, we are also referring to the vehicles, belonging to the petitioner, that were searched. The warrant was issued for a search of the petitioner\u2019s home, and, according to the Statement of Probable Cause describing the execution of the search, the vehicles were parked in the garage, driveway, and in front of the petitioner's home. In its opinion below, the Court of Special Appeals assumed that the warrant applied to the vehicles because they \"were parked within the house's curtilage at the time police executed the search warrant.\u201d The petitioner contends, however, that, despite the Statement of Probable Cause, \"[tjhere is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>absolutely no evidence or assertion in the record placing the cars within the curtilage of the house during the search\u201d and that this issue \"has never been litigated.\u201d We need not resolve this factual dispute because we conclude that the exclusionary rule applies to all evidence recovered pursuant to the warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\">.

The State presented a conditional cross-petition for review of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion that there was no substantial basis for the warrant authorizing the search of Agurs\u2019 home. We did not grant certiorari on that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\">.

The four vehicles identified in the affidavit as belonging to Agurs were a 2001 Ford Explorer, a 2006 Mercedes, a 2007 Lexus, and a 2007 Ford F-150. The other vehicle, a 1999 Mercury Grand Marquis, was identified as belonging to Tillman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">. The record does not indicate whether any other warrants were issued pursuant to the affidavit in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\">.

The trial court did not respond explicitly to the question of whether the officers acted in good faith reliance on the warrant. At the suppression hearing, the trial judge concluded that the warrant authorizing the search of Agurs' home and vehicles was not \u201cjustified\u201d and granted Agurs' motion to suppress. The only specific ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>trial court gave for suppression of the evidence was that there was no nexus shown between Agurs' alleged \"illegal activity, the home, or his vehicles.\u201d At no time, however, did he intimate that the good faith exception applied to save the warrant. Thus, when the trial judge granted Agurs' motion to suppress, the court implicitly concluded that the officers had not relied on the warrant in good faith. Therefore, we interpret the trial judge\u2019s ruling to mean that a reasonably well-trained officer would have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause and that he should not have applied for the warrant on the basis of what he presented. <em>See Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 346 n. 9, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1098-99 n. 9, 89 L.Ed.2d 271, 281 n. 9 (1986) (explaining that a police officer commits an \"unacceptable error\u201d when his or her request for a warrant is \"outside the range of the professional competence expected of an officer,\u201d even if a judge issues the warrant); <em>Bailey v. Superior Court, </em>11 Cal.App.4th 1107, 1113-14, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d 17 (1992) (holding that \"[t]he totality of the circumstances presented by [the] affidavit [did] not show 'a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime [would] be found in a particular place' \u201d and that \"[t]he affidavit [lacked] sufficient indicia of probable cause so as to make reliance upon it unreasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Although the trial court in the present case did not explicitly address the good faith issue in its ruling, we are not precluded from addressing that issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 267, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2347, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, 567 (1983) (White, J., concurring) (explaining that the good faith standard should be measured \"only by objective standards\u201d). The good faith issue was before the trial court, as Agurs raised the issue in his motion to suppress and both parties presented argument on the issue at the suppression hearing. Regardless, this Court could properly address the good faith issue even if it had not been raised in the trial court at all. <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 470 n. 10, 701 A.2d 675, 683-84 n. 10 (1997); <em>see also State v.

Furthermore, the Court of Special Appeals in the present case assumed that the good faith issue was properly before it on appeal, and neither party has objected to that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Finally, nothing precluded the State from requesting an evidentiary hearing to attempt to present other circumstances for the trial court to consider in determining whether a reasonably well-trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the issuing judge's authorization. <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 922-23 n. 23, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3420 n. 23, 82 L.Ed.2d 677, 698 n. 23 (1984) (\"In making \u25a0 [the good faith] determination, all of the circumstances\u2014 including whether the warrant application had previously been rejected by a different magistrate\u2014may be considered.\u201d); <em>see also United States v.

It is the State\u2019s burden to establish the facts to support a <em>conclusion </em>that the police acted <em>in good </em>faith in reasonable reliance upon the search warrant. <em>Ott v. State, </em>325 Md. 206, 222-23, 600 A.2d 111, 119 (1992). By failing to request an evidentiary hearing, the State waived that right. Moreover, the State has failed to raise any concerns in either this Court or the Court of Special Appeals about its need to have had an evidentiary hearing in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b119-6\">. Specifically, the indicia of probable cause in <em>Patterson v. State </em>included the empty gun holster found beneath Patterson, the ammunition found near where Patterson was arrested, eyewitness accounts that Patterson had been holding his hip as he ran, Patterson\u2019s criminal history, and the fact that the police gathered the information from firsthand observation. 401 Md. 76, 108-09, 930 A.2d 348, 368 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\">.

The Court of Special Appeals concluded that there was no substantial basis to issue the warrant, and we did not grant certiorari on that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\">. The State correctly points out that Agurs has mistakenly posed each of these arguments in his brief as a \"Question Presented.\u201d We granted certiorari on the specific question originally posed by Agurs in his petition for certiorari and quoted earlier in this opinion, not on the four questions posed by Agurs in his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">. We do not suggest that the good faith exception can never apply when a reviewing court determines that an affidavit failed to satisfy the nexus requirement. There will undoubtedly be circumstances where \u201creasonable minds may differ\u201d as to whether the nexus requirement was satisfied. <em>Connelly v.

An officer cannot, however, rely in good faith on a warrant that was based upon an affidavit that completely fails to establish a reasonable inference that contraband might be found in the place to be searched. <em>Holmes v. State, </em>368 Md. 506, 522-23, 796 A.2d 90, 101 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">. The State supports this contention almost entirely with cases from various federal circuit courts, none of which change our conclusion. The warrant authorizing the search of Agurs\u2019 home was obtained by Baltimore police officers from a Maryland state court seeking to arrest Agurs for Maryland state crimes. Although we certainly consider federal court decisions when interpreting the United States Constitution, it is our interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, confined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>United States Supreme Court precedent, that is relevant to the police officer\u2019s understanding of the nexus requirement in this case. <em>See United States ex rel.

This case involves the applicability of the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, which the Supreme Court first recognized in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 900, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3409, 82 L.Ed.2d 677, 684 (1984) and its companion case, <em>Massachusetts v.

In the ensuing years, a number of states have rejected the good faith exception as incompatible with those states\u2019 constitutions. <em>See </em>1W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 1.3(d) (4th ed. 2004) (collecting cases). Maryland, however, is among the states that have recognized and applied the good faith doctrine, as outlined in <em>Leon and Sheppard. See Patterson v. State, </em>401 Md. 76, 105, 930 A.2d 348, 366 (2007); <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 468-70, 701 A.2d 675, 683-84 (1997); <em>Connelly v. State, </em>322 Md. 719, 729, 589 A.2d 958, 963 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">To date, this Court has not recognized an exclusionary rule for evidence seized in violation of Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Fitzgerald v. State, </em>384 Md. 484, 508-09, 864 A.2d 1006, 1020-21 (2004) (recognizing the \u201ccurrent absence of an exclusionary rule under our state\u2019s constitution,\u201d and stating that \u201cthis is not the case to revisit whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Article 26 contains an exclusionary rule\u201d). <em>But see id. </em>at 520, 864 A.2d at 1026 (Greene, J., dissenting, joined by Bell, C.J.) (stating that the Court should take the opportunity presented in the case \u201cto break with the tradition of reading Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights <em>in pari materia </em>with the Fourth Amendment\u201d and \u201cshould interpret Article 26, in such a fashion, so as to afford [Maryland] citizens greater protections than those as interpreted under the Fourth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Unless and until this Court recognizes an Article 26-based exclusionary rule and disclaims any exception for \u201cgood faith\u201d violations of that state constitutional provision, I feel bound to follow the good faith doctrine as explicated and applied in <em>Leon, Sheppard, </em>and the cases that have applied that doctrine in Maryland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Faithful application of those cases, in my view, compels the conclusion that the police acted in good faith when they searched Petitioner\u2019s home pursuant to the search warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In <em>Leon, </em>the Supreme Court declared: \u201c[Suppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant should be ordered only on a case-by-case basis and only in unusual cases in which exclusion will further the purposes of the exclusionary rule.\u201d 468 U.S. at 918-19, 104 S.Ct. at 8418, 82 L.Ed.2d at 695-96. Therefore, \u201cthe Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule should be modified so as not to bar the use in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief of evidence obtained by officers acting in reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate but ultimately found to be unsupported by proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ble cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 900, 104 S.Ct. at 3409, 82 L.Ed.2d at 684. The <em>Leon </em>Court reasoned that, because the affidavit in support of the warrant at issue in that case set forth the results of an extensive police investigation, the warrant \u201cprovided evidence sufficient to create disagreement among thoughtful and competent judges as to the existence of probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926, 104 S.Ct. at 3422, 82 L.Ed.2d at 701. Consequently, \u201cthe officers\u2019 reliance on the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause was objectively reasonable, and application of the extreme sanction of exclusion [was] inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>104 S.Ct. at 3422, 82 L.Ed.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In <em>Sheppard, </em>the Court stated the good faith exception this way: \u201c[T]he exclusionary rule should not be applied when the officer conducting the search acted in objectively reasonable reliance on a warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate that subsequently is determined to be invalid[.]\u201d 468 U.S. at 987-88, 104 S.Ct. at 3427, 82 L.Ed.2d at 743. Applying the exception to the facts before it, the Court concluded that the warrant was facially defective in that it misstated the items that could be seized, yet the evidence the police obtained while executing the warrant was admissible because the affiant had properly set out the items to be seized and the police reasonably relied on the magistrate\u2019s representation that the warrant authorized them to conduct the requested search.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Leon </em>that evidence seized pursuant to an invalid warrant will rarely be suppressed because \u201ca warrant issued by a magistrate normally suffices to establish that a law enforcement officer has acted in good faith in conducting the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922, 104 S.Ct. at 3420, 82 L.Ed.2d at 698 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Court identified four circumstances, however, in which \u201cthe officer will have no reasonable grounds for believing that the warrant was properly issued\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">(1) In cases where \u201cthe magistrate or judge in issuing a warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for [the officer\u2019s] reckless disregard for the truth,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(citing <em>Franks v.

In any of those four circumstances, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply, and suppression of the evidence is the remedy for the Fourth Amendment violation. <em>Id. </em>at 923, 104 S.Ct. at 3421, 82 L.Ed.2d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Petitioner asserts the applicability of the third circumstance outlined in <em>Leon, </em>which applies the exclusionary rule when \u201cthe warrant was based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d Petitioner contends, in particular, that the affidavit in support of the search warrant provides no indicia of probable cause that contraband would be found in his home. The majority agrees with Petitioner. I do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">I begin with the proposition that the Supreme Court has not set a particularly high bar for demonstrating a probable cause belief that evidence of a crime might be found in a particular place. The Court has described \u201cprobable cause\u201d as \u201ca practical, nontechnical conception that deals with the factual and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 370, 124 S.Ct. 795, 799, 157 L.Ed.2d 769, 775 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The probable cause showing requires only a \u201cfair probability\u201d that the evidence sought is at the place designated to be searched. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, 548 (1983). Probable cause, moreover, \u201cis a fluid concept\u2014turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts\u2014not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.\u201d <em>Pringle, </em>540 U.S. at 370-71, 124 S.Ct. at 800, 157 L.Ed.2d at 775. Consequently, \u201cthe <em>quanta </em>... of proof appropriate in ordinary judicial proceedings are inapplicable to the decision to issue a warrant. Finely tuned standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence, useful in formal trials, have no place in the [probable-cause] decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 124 S.Ct. at 800, 157 L.Ed.2d at 775 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Rather, \u201c \u2018only the probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity is the standard of probable cause.\u2019\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 235, 103 S.Ct. at 2330, 76 L.Ed.2d at 546 (quoting <em>Spinelli v.

There need be only a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for that determination, and, if that test is satisfied, then any reviewing court is bound to find the warrant in compliance with the dictates of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238-39, 103 S.Ct. at 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d at 548.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>I accept for purposes of this opinion that there was not a substantial basis for the warrant-issuing judge\u2019s conclusion that the affidavit supplied probable cause to believe that Petitioner\u2019s house contained evidence of his suspected drug activity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The issue thus focuses solely on whether the good faith doctrine applies to foreclose application of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">To state the obvious, the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of the good faith doctrine is to exempt from exclusion evidence seized pursuant to a warrant that falls short of satisfying the dictates of the Fourth Amendment, that is, a warrant that supplies fewer facts in support of probable cause than would be necessary to satisfy the \u201csubstantial basis\u201d test.

We further explained in <em>Patterson </em>that the third <em>Leon </em>exception requires an objective inquiry that asks whether \u201c \u2018officers, exercising professional judgment, could have reasonably believed that the averments of their affidavit related to a present and continuing violation of law, not remote from the date of their affidavit, and that the evidence sought would be likely found at [the place identified in the affidavit].\u2019 \u201d 401 Md. at 107, 930 A.2d at 367 (quoting <em>Connelly, </em>322 Md. at 735, 589 A.2d at 967). Only if the answer to that inquiry is that no \u201cthoughtful and competent judge\u201d could find that an officer could reasonably believe there was probable cause for the search does the third exception to the good faith doctrine apply. <em>See Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 926, 104 S.Ct. at 3422, 82 L.Ed.2d at 701. In other words, \u201c[t]he affidavit cannot be so \u2018bare bones\u2019 in nature as to suggest that the issuing judge acted as a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 in approving the application for the warrant.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>401 Md. at 107, 930 A.2d at 367 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The affidavit in support of the warrant in the present case is not a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit. The warrant contains sufficient facts demonstrating, either directly or by reasonable inference, that Petitioner was an upper level distributor of crack cocaine in two Baltimore City neighborhoods and was engaged in that enterprise with his cousin Andrew Tillman; that Petitioner then lived at 3 Six Point Ct., Windsor Mill, Maryland, 21244 (a Baltimore City address); and that he kept at that address expensive assets belonging to him yet not corresponding to his reported income as an employee of Baltimore City.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Further, the two affiants, both of whom had significant experience and expertise in drug investigations, asserted that drug traffickers, as Petitioner was suspected of being, are likely to keep evidence of their drug distribution enterprise in their homes. Reviewing courts, like warrant-issuing magistrates in the first instance, are entitled to give credence to the expertise and experience of police officers in developing knowledge about the practices and proclivities of drug dealers. <em>See United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750-51, 151 L.Ed.2d 740, 749-50 (2002) (stating that such a totality of the circumstances approach \u201callows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">To be sure, the affidavit in the present case does not provide a <em>direct </em>nexus between Petitioner\u2019s suspected high-level drug distribution and his home as a repository of evidence of his drug activity. But no such direct nexus need be established in this case in order to conclude that the police acted in good faith in relying on the warrant. Several decisions of this Court explain why.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">One such case is <em>State v. Ward, </em>350 Md. 372, 712 A.2d 534 (1998). In that case, we considered \u201cwhether there was probable cause [contained in a search warrant] to believe that instrumentalities and evidence of a street murder could be found in the residence and/or motor vehicle of the person identified as the murderer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374, 712 A.2d at 534. We held that there was probable cause for such belief and, in so holding, we rejected the respondent\u2019s contention that there was an insufficient nexus between the item sought (the murder weapon or, at least, evidence that the respondent owned or possessed a firearm) and the places to be searched (the respondent\u2019s home and car). <em>Id. </em>at 377-78, 712 A.2d at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In reaching that conclusion, we relied on an earlier decision, <em>Mills v. State, </em>278 Md. 262, 363 A.2d 491 (1976), as well as decisions from our sister jurisdictions that \u201csustained warrants, without any express evidence of nexus,\u201d when the affidavits \u201ccontained probable cause to believe that a crime of violence, involving the use of a weapon, had been committed, that the defendant was the criminal agent, and that the defendant resided at the place to be searched.\u201d <em>See Ward, </em>350 Md. at 378-386, 712 A.2d at 536-40. We also relied in <em>Ward </em>on a passage from <em>United States v. Lucarz, </em>430 F.2d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir.1970), a case involving prosecution for theft from the mails:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">[T]his court and others, albeit usually without discussion, have upheld searches although the nexus between the items to be seized and the place to be searched rested not on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>direct observation, as in the normal search-and-seizure case, but on the type of crime, the nature of the missing items, the extent of the suspect\u2019s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide stolen property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><em>Ward, </em>850 Md. at 379, 712 A.2d at 537 (noting our favorable treatment of <em>Lucarz </em>in Mills) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">Concrete firsthand evidence that the items sought are in the place to be searched is not always required in a search warrant [.] The question is whether one would normally expect to find those items at that placet.] We think it clear that [the defendant\u2019s] residence would be a logical place to search for the weapon and clothing used in the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\"><em>Ward, </em>350 Md. at 383, 712 A.2d at 539 (quoting <em>Blount v. State, </em>511 A.2d 1030, 1033 (Del.1986)). We recognized in <em>Ward </em>that, even though the affidavit contained no facts indicating that the murder weapon and related evidence would be found in the respondent\u2019s home, there was sufficient evidence to infer a nexus between the two, or at the least, to defer to the magistrate\u2019s drawing such an inference. <em>See </em>350 Md. at 386, 389, 712 A.2d at 540, 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\"><em>Holmes v. State, </em>368 Md. 506, 796 A.2d 90 (2002), a case factually closer to the present case, is to like effect. That case involved a challenge to the issuance of a warrant to search the home of a suspected drug dealer. Holmes argued that the warrant affidavit did not establish a nexus between a single instance of his suspected involvement in drug dealing and his home as the repository of evidence of that activity. We disagreed, relying in large part upon the reasoning of <em>Ward, Mills, </em>and a number of federal cases that \u201capproach! ] the nexus issue in terms of pure deductive reasoning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522, 796 A.2d at 99 (citing <em>United States v. Feliz, </em>182 F.3d 82 (1st Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>785 F.2d 399 (2d Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Hodge, </em>246 F.3d 301 (3d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>974 F.2d 480 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. McClellan, </em>165 F.3d 535 (7th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>Riedesel, </em>987 F.2d 1388 (8th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Terry, </em>911 F.2d 272 (9th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>798 F.2d 380 (10th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We recognized that \u201cthe mere observation, documentation or suspicion of a defendant\u2019s participation in criminal activity will not necessarily suffice, by itself, to establish probable cause that inculpatory evidence will be found in the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 796 A.2d at 101 (internal citations omitted). We added that \u201c[t]here must be something more that, directly or by reasonable inference, will allow a neutral magistrate to determine that the contraband may be found in the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 796 A.2d at 101 (internal citations omitted). We observed, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">[t]he reasoning, supported by both experience and logic, is that, if a person is dealing in drugs, he or she is likely to have a stash of the product, along with records and other evidence incidental to the business, that those items have to be kept somewhere, that if not found on the person of the Defendant, they are likely to be found in a place that is readily accessible to the Defendant but not accessible to others, and that the Defendant\u2019s home is such a place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHG\"><em>Id. </em>at 521-22, 796 A.2d at 100. We held that the facts set forth in the warrant rendered Holmes\u2019s case one that \u201c[a]t the very least [ ] would fall within the realm of a marginal case in which ... deference must be given to the warrant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\"><em>Holmes, Ward </em>and <em>Mills </em>all involved warrants that were deemed to have <em>satisfied </em>the Fourth Amendment because, in each, there were sufficient facts alleged to permit at least a substantial basis for a reasonable inference of a nexus between the suspected criminal activity and the suspect\u2019s home. Here, of course, we are beyond determining whether the warrant satisfies the Fourth Amendment, because we have accepted that it does not. Therefore, we need only decide whether the warrant affidavit was so lacking in indicia of probable cause of a nexus between Petitioner\u2019s drug activity and his home as a repository of evidence of that activity as to render official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>belief in its existence entirely unreasonable. If thoughtful and competent judges could disagree on this point, then it follows that the police relied in good faith upon the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In my view, the facts alleged in the warrant affidavit are sufficient to allow reasonable officers, exercising their professional judgment, to believe that there was a fair probability that Petitioner\u2019s house contained evidence of his suspected drug activity. Therefore, the police could rely in good faith upon the warrant directing them to search Petitioner\u2019s home for such evidence. I therefore would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which comes to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Judge ADKINS has authorized me to state that she joins in the opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\">. Article 26 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">That all warrants, without oath or affirmation, to search suspected places, or to seize any person or property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general warrants to search suspected places, or to apprehend suspected persons, without naming or describing the place, or the person in special, are illegal, and ought not to be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Although Article 26 does not expressly address warrantless searches and seizures, this Court has long interpreted it to prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures under the same circumstances as does the Fourth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Givner v. State, </em>210 Md. 484, 492-93, 124 A.2d 764, 768 (1956); <em>Miller v. State, </em>174 Md. 362, 371, 198 A. 710, 716 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">. This is not the case to consider breaking from current Maryland law on this subject because the issue was neither briefed nor argued. <em>See Garner v. Archers Glen Partners, Inc., </em>405 Md. 43, 46, 949 A.2d 639, 641 (2008) (stating that \"appellate court[s] should use great caution in exercising [ ] discretion to comment gratuitously on issues beyond those necessary to be decided\u201d); <em>accord People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. County v. Loyola College in Md., </em>406 Md. 54, 92 n. 29, 956 A.2d 166, 189 n. 29 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\">. As does the majority, I include in my reference to Petitioner's \u201chome\u201d the vehicles that were also searched pursuant to the warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s adoption of the \"substantial basis\u201d test reflects the Court\u2019s strong preference that police act with a warrant, rather than without one. As the Court stated long ago in <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 106, 85 S.Ct. 741, 744, 13 L.Ed.2d 684, 687 (1965), \"a search under a warrant may be sustainable where without one it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>fail.\u201d This deference to the decision of the magistrate to issue a warrant means that \u201ca reviewing court is not to conduct a <em>de novo </em>probable cause determination,\u201d <em>Massachusetts v. Upton, </em>466 U.S. 727, 728, 104 S.Ct. 2085, 2085, 80 L.Ed.2d 721, 724 (1984), but instead is to decide only \"whether the evidence viewed as a whole provided a 'substantial basis\u2019 for the Magistrate\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732-33, 104 S.Ct. at 2088, 80 L.Ed.2d at 727.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. I must assume the lack of a substantial basis for the magistrate's probable cause decision because this Court denied the State\u2019s conditional cross-petition raising that question. We do not consider questions on which we declined to grant certiorari review. <em>See e.g., Jackson v. State, </em>364 Md. 192, 195 n. 2, 772 A.2d 273, 275 n. 2 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. Unlike the majority, I am satisfied that the affidavit contains sufficient evidence of Petitioner\u2019s connection to a drug trafficking enterprise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The Affiants reported that, during their three-week investigation of drug trafficking in Edmondson Village and Cherry Hill, \"multiple confidential informants\u201d advised the police that \"Gary Samuel Agurs [Petitioner] and associates were upper level distributors supplying crack cocaine in and around these locations.\" Both of the two informants specifically identified in the affidavit had proven themselves reliable in connection with prior drug arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">One of the informants identified Petitioner as a Baltimore City employee and described him \u201cas an upper level supplier of the suspected narcotics to the street dealers in the area.\u201d The police confirmed that Petitioner is employed at the Baltimore City Department of Public Works. And, during surveillance of Petitioner, the police witnessed an incident between him and another man that suggested a possible transfer of drugs. The same confidential informant disclosed that Petitioner was assisted by his cousin, \"Dru,\u201d whom police later identified as Andrew Tillman. The police conducted surveillance of Tillman, setup two controlled purchases from him of crack cocaine in Cherry Hill, and observed Tillman engage in other suspected drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Finally, the police observed Petitioner and Tillman meet outside an \"auto detail shop,\u201d where the police watched Petitioner \"entering the passenger side of [Tillman\u2019s] car.
