According to Appellants, the City\u2019s rent control program will impair the rental property market for the most affordable housing in the City, namely, rentals of rooms and common areas in single-family detached homes, while encouraging the rise of rents in the sector of the rental market already containing the most expensive housing, medium-rise and highrise apartments, by exempting those properties from the rent control restrictions. On these grounds, Appellants charge principally that the City\u2019s rent control program violates Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the anti-discrimination provisions of the State of Maryland and Prince George\u2019s County Fair Housing Acts, and constitutes impermissible de facto zoning by a legislative body without zoning power. For reasons we shall explain, we disagree with Appellants\u2019 contentions and affirm the grant by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County of summary judgment to the City on Appellants\u2019 claims, thereby upholding the validity of the City\u2019s unique rent control program.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Two years prior to the enactment of the City\u2019s rent control program in 2005, following discussions about using rent stabilization as a response to public concerns of rising rental costs, neighborhood deterioration, and inflated purchase prices for homes due to the increasing number of rental conversions in the City\u2019s traditional \u201csingle-family\u201d neighborhoods, the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Council drafted a comprehensive Housing Plan. The Housing Plan included a \u201cneighborhood revitalization\u201d component, which stated that \u201c[t]he quality of life in the city can and should be raised____\u201d In order to remedy this perceived \u201cquality of life\u201d problem, the Housing Plan recommended enactment of a rent control program in the City to be used as a \u201cregulatory tool\u201d to impair the profitability of rental conversions in so-called \u201csingle-family\u201d neighborhoods. Specifically, the Housing Plan noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Rent stabilization is one tool that can be used to ensure that rental units are available/maintained as affordable housing units. Rent stabilization limits what landlords can charge tenants. The effect on single-family homes converted to rentals will be to make it less profitable to make these conversions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">If legally feasible, rent stabilization could be considered as a regulatory tool to deter future conversions in residential areas which are primarily owner occupied. Assuming this, geographic boundaries can be drawn to include the areas that need to be protected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In April 2004, City Councilmember Robert Catlin, a retired economist, submitted a proposed ordinance which sought to implement the rent control concept outlined in the Housing Plan. Catlin\u2019s proposal provided that a rent ceiling would apply to all single-family, duplex, triplex, and quadraplex rental properties, but that larger multi-unit apartment buildings would be exempt. In Catlin\u2019s view, such a plan would decrease the number of \u201csingle-family\u201d properties that are rental units while encouraging construction of new apartment buildings which, in turn, would improve the balance between rental supply and demand in the City. Upon Catlin\u2019s request for a review of the legality of the proposal, the City Attorney, in a memorandum, expressed concern over the validity of the proposed rent control program, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">[W]e embarked upon drafting a rent stabilization ordinance in accordance with the parameters requested by Councilman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Catlin. Some of the provisions requested, such as exempting apartment buildings, establishing a rent ceiling based upon an amount certain, and using the protection of the City\u2019s stock of single family owner occupied housing as a purpose for enacting such an ordinance, have not been tested in Court. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the City would prevail in a challenge of the proposed ordinance. We have attempted to address all of the concerns raised by the Courts that have addressed rent control issues; however, some of the elements of the requested legislation are novel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Despite the concerns of the City Attorney, Catlin pressed forward with the rent control proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Prior to voting on Councilmember Catlin\u2019s proposed rent control ordinance, the City commissioned Anirban Basu, a policy analyst from the Sage Policy Group (a private consultant), to produce a report (hereinafter \u201cthe Sage Report\u201d) addressing the question of whether the City\u2019s stated policy objectives could be addressed reasonably through a rent stabilization program. The report, released in April 2005 and entitled \u201cThere is a Rational Basis for Rent Stabilization in College Park, Maryland,\u201d analyzed the available literature on rent control and City-specific data concerning the rental market. The report confirmed the City\u2019s beliefs regarding the pattern of declining home ownership, increasing rental conversions, diminished housing affordability, and code violations in the City. The Sage Report concluded that rent stabilization \u201cis likely to be conducive\u201d not just to stabilizing rents for affected properties, but also to enhancing home ownership and decreasing violations of the City code by reducing future rental conversions of single-family homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">One month after the Sage Report was released, on 24 May 2005, the Mayor and City Council adopted, by a 7-1 vote, Ordinance 05-2-02 (hereinafter \u201cthe Ordinance\u201d), which, according to its title, established a rent stabilization program in the City, set forth the fees and penalties associated with the program, and created a Rent Stabilization Board to administer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the program.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Ordinance\u2019s Preamble set forth the basic legislative facts as found by the City Council and explicated the general rationale underlying the City\u2019s adoption of the Ordinance, providing in pertinent part:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">WHEREAS, on June 10, 2003, the Mayor and City Council of the City of College Park approved the City of College Park Housing Plan (the \u201cHousing Plan\u201d); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">WHEREAS, according to the Housing Plan, the City of College Park had a total of 6,245 housing units in 2000 (not including 8,420 beds in University of Maryland dormitories, another 1,740 beds in public/private partnership housing on University of Maryland owned land, and 1,386 beds in fraternity and sorority houses); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">WHEREAS, 4,204 of those units, or 67.3%, are single-family detached homes, while 152 units or 2.4% are single-family attached houses (townhouses), 268 units, or 4.2%, are located within structures containing 2-4 units, and 1,613 units, or 25.8%, are within structures containing 5 units or more; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">WHEREAS, the 2000 United States Census reported an owner occupancy rate of 57.2% for College Park, a decline of 9.8% from 1980; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">WHEREAS, in 2000, renters occupied 2,582 units or 42.8% of the City\u2019s conventional housing units; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">WHEREAS, in 2000, the City\u2019s median monthly rent was $806 compared to Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s rate of $737; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">WHEREAS, in 1999, 40.6% of the renters in the City of College Park paid more than 35% of their household income for rent.

The College Park City Council finds that there is a pattern of steadily rising rents, and a shortage of affordable well-maintained housing, and that the rate of deterioration of the existing housing stock in the City has increased in recent years. The College Park City Council further finds that this situation poses a threat to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of College Park.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">C. The purposes of this chapter are to regulate residential rent increases in the City of College Park and to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>tenants from unwarranted rent increases, in order to help maintain the diversity of the community.

Specifically, Appellants suggested, among other things, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">\u2022 That the text and legislative history of the Ordinance exhibited an overt animus toward renters, and that, rather than being intended to protect tenants by capping rents, the Ordinance was intended to force renters to move to nearby apartment buildings and away from so-called \u201csingle-family\u201d neighborhoods;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">\u2022 That the Ordinance would not achieve the traditional goal of rent control programs, namely, lowering rents for tenants, because the Ordinance regulates only the least expensive rental housing in the City, traditional \u201csingle-family\u201d housing, while failing to regulate the most expensive rental housing in the City, units in apartment buildings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">\u2022 That the Ordinance would, in fact, result in higher rental rates citywide by reducing the supply of the least expensive rental housing, units in traditional \u201csingle-family\u201d neighborhoods;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">\u2022 That the Ordinance lacked meaningful underlying empirical data supporting the use of rent control in the City, and that the Ordinance was unnecessary because home ownership in the City is not abnormally low and rental rates in the City are not unnaturally high;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">\u2022 That the provisions of the Ordinance, including the use of CPI, the HUD value, and the percentage of assessed value figures in calculating the rent ceiling were arbitrarily designed by Councilman Catlin and unsupported by research or data; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">\u2022 That problems with code violations by renters should be resolved by code enforcement measures, rather than using economic legislation to segregate renters from certain \u201csingle-family\u201d neighborhoods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>In response to Appellants\u2019 contentions, the City tendered other evidentiary proffers and argument to the following effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u2022 That the main purpose of the Ordinance was to address a perpetual shortage of available rental housing in the City due largely to the presence of the University of Maryland and the City\u2019s proximity to nearby metropolitan centers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\u2022 That, because demand consistently outweighs supply for rental housing in the City, rental rates on single-family homes are disproportionate to the quality of those properties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\u2022 That, according to its research, rented single-family homes are not maintained as well as owner-occupied homes and that the stock of such homes had begun to deteriorate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u2022 That high rental demand has raised the cost of purchasing a single family home in the City, leading to purchases largely by landlords intending to earn a profit on their purchase rather than maintain and monitor their properties or involve themselves in the community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">\u2022 That apartment buildings did not implicate the public welfare concerns that the Ordinance was designed to address, such as declining owner occupancy, high rental rates and deteriorating properties, and that placing rent ceilings on apartment buildings would discourage construction of new buildings, further disrupting the balance between supply and demand in the City\u2019s rental housing market;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\u2022 That rental homes accounted for a higher proportion of City code violations than owner-occupied properties, including citations for trash, litter, and lawn maintenance; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-11\">\u2022 That the Ordinance\u2019s employment of the CPI, the HUD level, and the percentage of assessed value figures was not arbitrary, but instead was based upon Councilman Catlin\u2019s calculations of the average landlord\u2019s investment, insurance, taxes, and maintenance costs, adding in an amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>for profit, Gatlin\u2019s research reflecting that the HUD level was in the same range as his calculations while allowing for annual adjustments, and the use of CPI to determine rental rate increases by the City of Takoma Park.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">On 26 November 2008, the Circuit Court concluded that, finding no triable issue of material fact, the Ordinance was constitutional and otherwise legally valid. Accordingly, it granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Appellants\u2019 claims, explaining, in a written order and memorandum opinion, that, as a matter of law: (1) the Ordinance did not constitute a deprivation of Appellant\u2019s equal protection or due process rights because the stated goals of the Ordinance were legitimate and the Ordinance\u2019s rent ceiling and exemption of apartment rental units were related rationally to those purposes; (2) the Ordinance does not represent impermissible de facto zoning by the City because the Ordinance does not control or direct the use of land directly or regulate rent based upon location; (3) the Ordinance does not violate the State and County Fair Housing Acts because it does not discriminate facially on the basis of age, occupation, marital status, or familial status; rather, the Ordinance discriminates among certain types of rental properties and not based on the characteristics of the renters themselves; and, (4) the Ordinance is not confiscatory facially.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On 26 January 2009, Appellants noted timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.

Although the Maryland Constitution contains no similarly expressed equal protection clause, we have observed on numerous occasions that the concept of equal protection is embodied in the due process requirement of Article 24. <em>Conaway, </em>401 Md. at 272 n. 33, 932 A.2d at 602 n. 33; <em>Verzi v.

In addition, we have noted consistently that, as a general rule, we interpret Article 24 <em>in pari materia </em>with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, such that pertinent decisions of the Supreme Court are highly persuasive authorities; nevertheless, we recognize that Article 24 and the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Amendment are independent and capable of divergent effect. <em>Conaway, </em>401 Md. at 272 n. 33, 932 A.2d at 602 n. 33; <em>Verzi, </em>333 Md. at 417, 635 A.2d at 970; <em>Waldron, </em>289 Md. at 704, 426 A.2d at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In order to determine whether a given statute or ordinance satisfies the due process requirement of Article 24, we ask rhetorically whether the legislative enactment, as an exercise of the legislature\u2019s police power, bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the State or municipality. <em>Westchester West No. 2 Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Montgomery County, </em>276 Md. 448, 454, 348 A.2d 856, 860 (1975); <em>Bowie Inn, Inc. v. City of Bowie, </em>274 Md. 230, 236, 335 A.2d 679, 683 (1975). In applying this test, courts perform a very limited function, resisting interference unless it is shown that the legislature exercised its police power arbitrarily, oppressively, or unreasonably. <em>Westchester West, </em>276 Md. at 460, 348 A.2d at 863 (noting that \u201c[p]rice control, like any other form of regulation, is unconstitutional only if arbitrary, discriminatory, or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the legislature is free to adopt, and hence an unnecessary and unwarranted interference with individual liberty\u201d) (quoting <em>Nebbia v.

The wisdom or expediency of a statute duly adopted by the legislative body is not subject to judicial scrutiny, and the statute will not be held void if there are any considerations relating to the public welfare by which it may be supported. <em>Hargrove, </em>310 Md. at 427, 529 A.2d at 1382; <em>Westchester, </em>276 Md. at 455, 348 A.2d at 860; <em>Bowie Inn, </em>274 Md. at 236, 335 A.2d at 683. We have noted that \u201ccourts are under a special duty to respect the legislative judgment where the legislature is attempting to solve a serious problem in a manner which has not had an opportunity to prove its worth.\u201d <em>Bowie Inn, </em>274 Md. at 237, 335 A.2d at 684. As such, courts should hesitate before invalidating an ordinance where doing so would deprive the legislative body contemplating such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>statute \u201cof any opportunity to discover whether the chosen method will be good, bad or indifferent in its results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237-38, 335 A.2d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Where, as here, the legislative action at issue neither interferes with a fundamental right nor implicates a suspect classification,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the test for determining whether a statute violates the equal protection component of Article 24 is nearly identical to the due process examination. In such a case, we employ the least exacting and most deferential standard of constitutional review, namely, rational basis review, under which a legislative classification will pass constitutional muster so long as it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. <em>Conaway, </em>401 Md. at 273-74, 932 A.2d at 603-04; <em>Kane v.

In general, we will uphold a statute subject to rational basis review against an equal protection challenge unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that the court may conclude only that the governmental actions were arbitrary or irrational. <em>Conaway, </em>401 Md. at 274, 932 A.2d at 604. We noted that a classification having a reasonable basis does not offend equal protection merely because it is not made with \u201cmathematical nicety\u201d or because in practice it results in some inequality. <em>Id. </em>at 275, 932 A.2d at 604; <em>Bowie Inn, </em>274 Md. at 241, 335 A.2d at 686. In addition, we observed that legislative bodies are not required by equal protection to attack all aspects of a problem at the same time; rather, the legislative body \u201cmay select one phase of a problem and apply a remedy there, neglecting for the moment other phases of the problem.\u201d <em>Bowie Inn, </em>274 Md. at 241, 335 A.2d at 686; <em>see also Lonaconing Trap Club, Inc. v.

Where there are plausible reasons for the legislative action, the court\u2019s inquiry is at an end. <em>Conaway, </em>401 Md. at 325, 932 A.2d at 635. In this vein, we have described rational basis review as \u201c \u2018the paradigm of judicial restraint,\u2019 \u201d noting that \u201c \u2018[t]he Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process [and] that ... judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fed.

It is not the Court\u2019s \u201cprovince to determine the fairness or desirability of legislative [decisions and] classifications;\u201d that question is left to the legislature itself and ultimately to the affected electorate. <em>Hargrove, </em>310 Md. at 424, 529 A.2d at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In applying these standards then, we must consider two questions with regard to Appellants\u2019 constitutional facial challenge to the Ordinance\u2019s validity, namely, (1) whether the Ordinance\u2019s stated objectives are legitimate governmental ends, and (2) whether the means chosen by the City in the Ordinance bear a rational relationship to achievement of those ends. <em>See Rios v. Montgomery County, </em>386 Md. 104, 121, 872 A.2d 1, 10 (2005) (noting that, \u201cunless a suspect or quasi-suspect class is created or a fundamental or important right is implicated,\u201d the appropriate standard of review under due process or equal protection analysis is rational basis review). For reasons we shall explain, we answer each question in the affirmative. As such, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the City on Appellants\u2019 Article 24 claims, as plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>As noted by Appellants, the traditional purpose of rent control regulation has been the protection of tenants from exorbitant rents. Appellants pointed at the summary judgment hearing in the Circuit Court to an \u201cexpert statement\u201d from their expert witness, Dr. Stephen S. Fuller, a nationally recognized market economist, to this effect. Dr. Fuller explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">[T]he rationale for rent control in its historic context ... focus[es] on two conditions: (1) protecting low-income tenants from owners who would otherwise be able to profit unfairly from monopolistic powers stemming from unusual market conditions, and (2) in response to rapid general inflation occurring during war time or severe economic conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">The historic purpose of rent control programs was to have a broad-based effect on the rental stock in order to achieve the objective of the controls and not to burden smaller apartment operators or owners of individual units (condos, single-family units) with these regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">We noted as much in <em>Riger v.L &amp; B Limited Partnership, </em>278 Md. 281, 363 A.2d 481 (1976), where we stated that \u201c[a] rent control program is designed to regulate the economy, stemming inflation in rental housing where normal market factors are not operating to keep housing costs down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 363 A.2d at 490. Courts in other jurisdictions have noted similar traditionally-accepted problems for which rent control has been held to be a rational legislative response, including housing shortages, widespread imposition of exorbitant rents, monopoly control of the housing market, and the prevalence of substandard housing. <em>See, e.g., 440 Co. v.

To encourage private reinvestment by homeowners consistent with a neighborhood\u2019s character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">City Code \u00a7 127-1 .A. Although the above-stated goals differ from the traditional purpose of rent control legislation, namely, the protection of tenants from exorbitant rents, we cannot say, in light of the relevant case law and the broad discretion granted legislative bodies to determine and protect the public interest, that the goals of the Ordinance are illegitimate governmental ends.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We turn to consider whether the means selected by the City in the Ordinance are related rationally to achievement of those objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">As to the first two stated goals of the Ordinance, encouraging the availability of housing for households of all income levels, including university students, and preserving, maintaining, and improving existing housing, the City maintains that it is reasonable to believe that capping rent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>detached dwellings in single-family neighborhoods, but not in apartment buildings, will encourage builders, investors, and the University of Maryland to expedite the construction of apartment buildings capable of housing hundreds of renters in and near the City. In addition, the City asserts that the rent control program would reduce speculative pressure on home prices in single-family Neighborhoods, thereby lowering home prices in those neighborhoods and make them more attractive for single-family use. The City contends that it is not irrational to believe that an acceleration in apartment building construction would improve the quality of housing options for renters and that increasing home ownership would help preserve, maintain, and improve housing in traditional residential neighborhoods on the theory that homeowners commit more resources to the maintenance of their homes than do renters and landlords. In response, Appellants direct our attention to the \u201cexpert statement\u201d of Dr. Fuller to the effect that it is his opinion that the Ordinance would result in an increase in the cost of rental housing generally by restricting the supply of less expensive units in single-family neighborhoods, while permitting apartment buildings to increase rents due to increased demand, and that rent caps generally lead to further deterioration of rental properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Irrespective of the opinion evidence proffer presented by Appellants regarding Dr. Fuller\u2019s contrary view of the effect that the Ordinance may have on rental costs in the City and the City\u2019s existing housing stock, we cannot say that the City\u2019s perceived nexus between the rent control program and the goals of encouraging the availability of housing for households of all incomes is without any rational basis. It is entirely rational to believe that, by capping rents in the City\u2019s single-family neighborhoods, speculative investors will be less inclined to purchase such properties and, as a result, the price of those properties will be less inflated. Similarly, we are unprepared to say that the rent control program instituted by the Ordinance is not related rationally to the City\u2019s goal of preserving, maintaining, and improving existing housing. If rent control leads to increased construction of apartment buildings, landlords of other rental properties will be forced to improve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>their properties in order to compete for rental business, and, as noted <em>supra, </em>a decrease in single-family home prices may lead to increased home ownership and, thus, improved maintenance of the City\u2019s existing housing stock. Although the City\u2019s rent control plan may not result ultimately in achieving these legislative goals, as argued by Appellants, even well-supported criticism of the Ordinance and its likely effects provides an insufficient legal basis to find the Ordinance to be violative of the protections of Article 24.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Regarding the Ordinance\u2019s second major goal, namely, strengthening City neighborhoods by reducing the number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>of single-family homes that are rental properties, the City relies on research explicated in the Sage Report demonstrating that renters are cited more frequently for litter and garbage violations than occupying homeowners. Appellants retort by explaining, in considerable detail, that although renters are cited more frequently for litter and garbage violations than homeowners, other portions of the same data base shows that homeowners are more frequent violators of the City code in other ways, such as the presence of inoperable vehicles and \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d violations. According to Appellants, this revelation undermines the City\u2019s claim that instituting rent control will strengthen City neighborhoods by reducing code violations. Nevertheless, it is not Appellants\u2019 nor this Court\u2019s prerogative to determine which municipal code violations are more serious and pose a greater threat to the citizens of College Park; that judgment rests in the hands of the City. We shall not second-guess the City\u2019s determination as to which code violations to target and how best to overcome their pernicious effects. In addition, it is not clearly irrational for the City to believe that apartment buildings, where renters enjoy highly convenient waste services and pathways between units are generally confined inside the buildings, do not contribute in similar fashion to violations of the City code as do renters in detached \u201csingle-family\u201d properties. Thus, we cannot say that the Ordinance is unrelated to the City\u2019s goal of strengthening City neighborhoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Regarding the Ordinance\u2019s final purpose, encouraging private reinvestment by homeowners consistent with a neighborhood\u2019s character, we agree with the City\u2019s contentions that it is not irrational to believe that neighborhoods with a high number of private, owner-occupied residences, which, according to the City, will be the likely result of its rent control program, will be more stable than neighborhoods populated by properties whose market prices are driven by absentee landlords speculating on the future of the rental market. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>opinion of the Utah Supreme Court in <em>Anderson </em>reached a similar conclusion. In that case, the City of Provo amended a zoning ordinance governing residential neighborhoods near Brigham Young University to allow only those homeowners who reside in their homes to rent out \u201caccessory apartments,\u201d resulting in a distinction drawn between occupying and non-occupying landlords. <em>Anderson, </em>108 P.3d at 703. Against an equal protection challenge, the court upheld the validity of the amendment, concluding that the disparity in treatment was justified reasonably by the council\u2019s \u201cstated objective of balancing the city\u2019s competing interests in accommodating student housing needs and in preserving the character of single-family residential neighborhoods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708. Specifically, the court noted that the city concluded reasonably that \u201cpreventing absentee landlords from dominating ... neighborhoods would help to retain the neighborhoods\u2019 single family character rather than converting them, in effect, to duplexes with both units often occupied by semitransient residents.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">As acknowledged <em>supra, </em>it is possible that the City\u2019s rent control program may prove unsuccessful in addressing effectively the goals identified in \u00a7 127-l.A. Nevertheless, it is clear that, despite Appellants\u2019 considerable criticism of the City\u2019s methods and legislative fact-finding, the City is not without a rational basis to its belief that the Ordinance may achieve its stated objectives. As such, we hold that the Ordinance does not violate on its face Appellants\u2019 due process and equal protection rights under Article 24 because there is a rational relationship between the purported goals of the Ordinance, which we have found to be in the acceptable range of legitimacy, and the method chosen by the City to achieve those goals, namely, imposition of a rent control regime.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\n<em>STATE AND COUNTY FAIR HOUSING ACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Maryland Code, State Government Article \u00a7 20-705, entitled \u201cDiscriminatory housing practices-Sale or rental of dwelling,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">Except as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 20-703 and 20-704 of this subtitle, a person may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">(1) refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, disability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>marital status, familial status, sexual orientation, or national origin;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">(2) discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with the sale or rental of a dwelling, because of race, color, religion, sex, disability, marital status, familial status, sexual orientation, or national origin; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), State Gov\u2019t Art. \u00a7 20-705.

On this basis, Appellants contend that the Ordinance violates the State and County Fair Housing Acts by discriminating in housing on the basis of age, occupation, marital status, or familial status. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">By its very terms, the classification employed by the Ordinance distinguishes between rental units in traditional single-family neighborhoods and rental units in apartment buildings, among other types of excepted properties. On its face, the Ordinance does not discriminate in violation of the State or County Fair Housing Acts because it does not distinguish impermissibly between groups based on some characteristic of the group. Although it is true that the Ordinance may impact students more than any other demographic of renters due to the fact that most renters in the City are students at the University of Maryland, this alone cannot form a basis to conclude that the Ordinance discriminates facially on the basis of age, occupation, marital status, or familial status. As noted by the Circuit Court, people of every age, occupation, marital status, and familial status will be affected in the same manner if they live in rental housing in single-family neighborhoods. Thus, we conclude that the Ordinance on its face does not violate the State or County Fair Housing Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\n<em>BE FACTO ZONING</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">With the exception of the City of Laurel, municipal corporations within Prince George\u2019s County, including the City of College Park, are \u201cnot authorized, by means of an amendment to its charter or otherwise, to exercise any of the powers relating to planning, subdivision control, or zoning granted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission or the County Council of Prince George\u2019s County.\u201d Md. Code, Art. 28, \u00a7 7-103(b). Appellants contend that the Ordinance must be nullified as an act of \u201cde facto zoning\u201d by the City, beyond its enumerated powers. They are mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In <em>Maryland Overpak Corp. v. Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>we defined zoning as the \u201c \u2018process of setting aside disconnected tracts of land varying in shape and dimensions, and dedicating them to particular uses in some degree to serve the interests of the whole territory affected by the plan.\u2019 \u201d 395 Md. 16, 48, 909 A.2d 235, 254 (2006) (quoting <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs v. Stephans, </em>286 Md. 384, 388-89, 408 A.2d 1017, 1019 (1979)). Similarly, we observed that \u201c \u2018[t]he very essence of zoning is a territorial division according to the character of the land and the buildings, their peculiar suitability for particular uses, and uniformity of use within the zone.\u2019 \u201d <em>Donnelly Adver.

Overpak, </em>395 Md. at 50, 909 A.2d at 255)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">As noted by the City in its brief, the Ordinance does not divide the City into districts, define lot sizes, or mandate particular uses of any specific parcels or buildings. Rather, the Ordinance sets a limit on the amount of rent a single-family property owner may charge his or her tenants. That the Ordinance may contemplate land use changes, <em>i.e., </em>shifting rental housing into apartments and out of single-family neighborhoods, does not inherently convert what is a rent control ordinance into a zoning ordinance. <em>See Donnelly, </em>279 Md. at 665-66, 370 A.2d at 1130-31 (finding that a municipal ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>nance regulating signs under the police power was not an exercise of zoning power \u201c[although it is within the scope of the zoning power to regulate signs\u201d). As such, we reject Appellants\u2019 characterization of the Ordinance as an attempt by the City to engage in impermissible \u201cde facto zoning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>IS THE ORDINANCE CONFISCATORY?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Finally, Appellants contend that the City\u2019s method for calculating the rent ceiling, on its face, cannot possibly ensure a fair return on landlords\u2019 investments and, for that reason, is impermissibly confiscatory. A number of courts have found that rent control regulations may be considered to have a confiscatory effect \u201cif no rent adjustment mechanism is provided\u201d and the terms of the rent control ordinance \u201cwill not permit those who administer it to avoid confiscatory results in its application to the complaining parties.\u201d <em>Apt. Ass\u2019n of Greater L.A., </em>30 Cal.Rptr.2d at 232; <em>see also Richardson v. City and County of Honolulu, </em>802 F.Supp. 326, 332-33 (D.Haw.1992) (noting that a municipal rent control ordinance may be facially confiscatory where it provides \u201cno meaningful mechanism for obtaining relief when the lease rent formula results in a confiscatory rate\u201d). For example, in <em>Brunetti, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court observed that an ordinance may be confiscatory where it is so restrictive as to preclude facially any possibility of a just and reasonable return for landlords. 350 A.2d at 27. In that case, however, the court determined that the rent control ordinance at issue, which fixed rents at a given base level and permitted annual increases in rental charges, was not confiscatory facially because, although the annual increases were not unlimited, the ordinance permitted landlords to apply for unlimited rental increases in the event that he or she could demonstrate that he or she could not realize a reasonable profit from his or her investment. <em>Id. </em>Thus, in the court\u2019s eyes, the ordinance did not preclude facially the recovery of a just and reasonable return and, for that reason, was not impermissibly confiscatory. <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, in <em>Helmsley v. Borough of Ft. Lee, </em>78 N. J. 200, 394 A.2d 65 (1978), the court invalidated as confiscatory a rent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>control scheme which limited any rent increases to 2.5% of the base rent and contained a lengthy and burdensome hardship relief mechanism, noting that, where a municipality desires to enact rent control, \u201cit must be prepared to protect the landlords\u2019 interests by providing prompt, fair, and efficacious administrative relief\u201d if imposition of the ceiling results in confiscatory rates of return. <em>Id. </em>at 81, 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The Ordinance here accounts clearly on its face conceptually for landlords to receive a fair return on their investment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For example, where a landlord petitions the Board for an upward adjustment in the permissible annual rent increase, the Board is required to take into account the landlord\u2019s rate of return. \u00a7 127-7.C(l)(h). That section provides \u201cthat individual upward adjustments in the rent ceilings on units be made only <em>when the landlord demonstrates that such adjustments are necessary to provide the landlord with a fair return on investment.\u201d </em>\u00a7 127-7.0(2) (emphasis added). Furthermore, \u00a7 127-7.1 states that \u201c[n]o provision of this Chapter shall be applied so as to prohibit the Board from granting an individual rent adjustment that is demonstrated necessary by the landlord to provide the landlord with a fair return on investment.\u201d \u00a7 127-7.1. It is clear that, on its face, the Ordinance balances the City\u2019s goals of capping rent levels while maintaining an avenue for a landlord to obtain a fair return on his or her investment. Absent proof by Appellants that application of the Ordinance\u2019s rent ceiling and the Ordinance\u2019s related adjustment procedure results in unreasonably limited rates of return (no such facts admissible in evidence exist in this record), we cannot say that the Ordinance is confiscatory on its face.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Appellants waged unsuccessfully their battle against the City\u2019s initiative for a rent control program in the legislative arena. Undeterred, they turned to the Circuit Court, seeking essentially a spring board declaration that the Ordinance was unconstitutional on its face or otherwise legally invalid. In the view of that court, the Ordinance does not violate Article 24 because the City\u2019s goals in enacting the Ordinance were legitimate and the means selected to achieve those goals were rational, putting aside the likelihood of success. Similarly, the Circuit Court held that the Ordinance does not discriminate against student renters in violation of the State and County Fair Housing Acts, nor does it constitute an impermissible act of \u201cde facto zoning\u201d by the City. Finally, the trial court concluded that the Ordinance does not effect a facially confiscatory taking, as it permits landlords the ability to petition the Board for individual adjustments to the rent ceiling in order to maintain a fair rate of return. The Circuit Court recognized that even considerable and legitimate criticism of a legislature\u2019s chosen path will not provide the fodder for judicial interference in the legislative process, so long as the legislature\u2019s actions are calculated reasonably to achieve legitimate governmental ends. Indefatigably, Appellants pressed their arguments to us.

We do not read Appellants' brief or reply brief to maintain clearly or seriously that reversal is required because there was demonstrated a triable genuine dispute of material fact. Rather, it appears from our reading of the briefs and reflection upon oral argument that Appellants desired to have the case resolved as a matter of law, on this record. We too shall oblige.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\">. Neither party contends that the Ordinance implicates a suspect classification or a fundamental right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b543-11\">. Appellants recast the City's goals in a sinister fashion, suggesting that the intent of the City in passing the Ordinance was to force student renters out of single-family neighborhoods by reducing the number of more affordable rental properties in those areas and to benefit one sector of the rental market (apartment buildings) at the expense of another (landlords in single-family neighborhoods). Although certain other considerations, such as those suggested by Appellants, may have contributed to the passage of the Ordinance, we confine our consideration in analyzing this facial constitutional challenge to the stated objectives of the Ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b545-6\">. Such a debate is at the very heart of the legislative process and, if the City's intended goals fail to come to fruition as the result of the application of the Ordinance (the Ordinance provides for a 1 September 2012 \"sunset\u201d of its terms, at which time its effectiveness may be evaluated), the City is free to learn from its mistakes. In addition, should they be disappointed in the results of the rent control experiment, Appellants and others may exercise their political voices by voting for other candidates for Mayor and the City Council. Nevertheless, as noted <em>supra, </em>a court is not permitted to judge the wisdom or expediency of a given legislative action under rational basis review. Rather, our inquiry is confined to determining whether there is a rational basis to believe that the City\u2019s chosen means may effectuate its legitimate goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The opinion of the Iowa Supreme Court in <em>Ames </em>shares that view. <em>Ames, </em>like the procedural track taken by the present case, was decided by the trial court in favor of the city by the grant of summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action. The Iowa Supreme Court affirmed. In that case, the court considered the validity of a city zoning ordinance which only permitted single-family dwellings in certain areas of the city, and defined \"family\u201d as \"any number of related persons or no more than three unrelated persons.\u201d <em>Ames, </em>736 N.W.2d at 257. Upon equal protection challenge by a city landlord association, the court upheld the validity of the ordinance, finding that it was related rationally to the government\u2019s interest in providing quiet neighborhoods, even though the classification between related and unrelated persons relied heavily on stereotypes that groups of unrelated persons living together typically do not establish roots in the community, do not provide playmates\u2019 for neighbors\u2019 children, attract large numbers of friends, and create additional noise and traffic. <em>Id. </em>at 261-63. In addition, the court noted that, although the landlord association may be correct that the ordinance would do little to further the city\u2019s goals, it was the city\u2019s prerogative \"to fashion remedies to problems affecting its residents\u201d and that, should the ordinance prove ineffective, \u201cthe elected city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>council may change course and amend or repeal\u201d the ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 263.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\">. Appellants contend additionally that the Ordinance violates their equal protection rights because it targets unfairly students. In making this argument, Appellants rely heavily on our decision in <em>Kirsch. </em>In <em>Kirsch, </em>we invalidated the Prince George's County \"minidorm\u201d zoning ordinance, which regulated rental of residential property to three or more students pursuing higher education, finding that the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>deprived students of equal protection. <em>Kirsch, </em>331 Md. at 91, 107-08, 626 A.2d at 373, 381. Specifically, we found that the ordinance\u2019s classification was based \"solely on the occupation which the tenant pursues away from [their] residence,\u201d and concluded that such a distinction was an arbitrary classification not related rationally to the County\u2019s objective of clearing residential neighborhoods of noise, litter, and parking congestion. <em>Id. </em>at 106, 626 A.2d at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Although the Ordinance at issue here may have a considerable impact on students in the City, because they are nearly always renters rather than homeowners, <em>Kirsch </em>does not control here. The Ordinance does not make distinctions on the basis of occupation (students versus non-students). Rather, its operative premise is based on the type of rental property in question. Although in <em>Kirsch </em>we concluded that the distinction between students and nonstudents bore no rational relationship to the goal of reducing noise, litter, and parking congestion because both groups were equally capable of committing such violations, the City presented a considerable evidentiary proffer suggesting that capping rent on single-family homes, while exempting apartment buildings, will lead to the accomplishment of its goals of making housing in the City more affordable, reducing the number of certain code violations, and stabilizing residential neighborhoods in the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Appellants make the further contention that the methods chosen by the City to calculate the rent ceiling, including the use of CPI, the HUD value, and the percentage of assessed value figure, were chosen arbitrarily by Councilmember Catlin and the City Council and bear no rational relationship to the goals set forth in the Ordinance. We disagree. The City provided the Circuit Court with explanations underlying its reliance on those figures which demonstrated that they were not chosen in an entirely arbitrary fashion. Likewise, in light of those facts, we cannot say that use of these figures in calculating the rent ceiling is unreasonable completely. <em>See Brunetti, </em>350 A.2d at 27 (finding that formulae for calculating rent increases that rely on CPI or fixed percentage rates \"bear a rational relation to the legitimate municipal purpose of stabilizing rental levels\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\">.

Appellants contend that the purpose of the Ordinance, namely, to make rental conversions less profitable for landlords in order to reduce the number of rental properties in single-family neighborhoods, contradicts a finding that the statute is not facially confiscatory.

Although the Ordinance places limits on the profitability of rental units, such a fact does not mean inherently that landlords will be unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>earn a fair return on their investments. Rather, landlords renting rent-controlled properties will no longer be permitted to determine unilaterally their profit margin return from their investments and, as such, may be dissuaded from renting such properties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>BATTAGLIA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3M\">dissenting in which BELL, C.J., and MURPHY, J., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">I respectfully dissent.

The ordinance, enacted by Prince George\u2019s County, but apparently intended to combat a perceived problem concerning noise, litter, and parking in neighborhoods surrounding the University of Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>land at College Park,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 105-06, 626 A.2d at 380, defined a \u201cmini-dormitory\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201cAn off-campus residence, located in a building that is, or was originally constructed as a one-family, two-family, or three-family dwelling which houses at least three (3), but not more than five (5), individuals, all or part of whom are unrelated to one another by blood, adoption or marriage and who are registered full-time or part-time students at an institution of higher learning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 93, 626 A.2d at 373-74, quoting Prince George\u2019s County Code (1990), Section 27-107.1(a) (150.1) (emphasis omitted). Because no suspect class or fundamental right was implicated, we applied the rational basis test. <em>Kirsch, </em>331 Md. at 104, 626 A.2d at 379. We, nevertheless, held that the zoning ordinance was not rationally related to its stated \u201cobjective of clearing residential neighborhoods of noise, litter, and parking congestion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, 626 A.2d at 380. We reasoned that differentiating \u201cbetween permissible residential tenant classes by creating more strenuous zoning requirements for some and less for others based solely on the occupation which the tenant pursues away from that residence [was] that sort of arbitrary classification forbidden under our constitutions.\u201d <em>Id. See also id. </em>at 104-05, 626 A.2d at 379-80 (collecting cases where we applied the rational basis test to invalidate statutes regulating occupations, because the classification schemes were essentially arbitrary).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In <em>Verzi v. Baltimore County, </em>333 Md. 411, 635 A.2d 967, we determined that a county ordinance mandating that a licensed tow operator maintain a place of business within that county as a precondition for eligibility to be called by police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>for towing vehicles disabled by accidents, violated equal protection. We could \u201cfind no rational basis for the distinction between in-county and out-of-county [tow operators],\u201d and thus we were \u201cled to the \u2018more reasonable and probable view ... that [the classification] was intended to confer the monopoly of a profitable business upon residents of the town.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 635 A.2d at 974, quoting <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Havre de Grace v. Johnson, </em>143 Md. 601, 608, 123 A. 65, 67 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In the case at bar, we are faced with a classification of landlords: \u201cfavored\u201d landlords, commercial enterprises that operate multi-occupant and high-rise apartment complexes; and \u201cdisfavored\u201d landlords, primarily individuals who own single-family houses and rent them to students attending the University of Maryland at College Park. The openly-acknowledged purpose of the classification scheme is to depress rents that \u201cdisfavored\u201d landlords can charge, so that the \u201cfavored\u201d landlords are placed in a more advantageous position. The hope is that the single-family homeowners, unable to charge sufficient rents to cover their expenses, will cease their endeavors, thereby creating a decrease in the supply of \u201cdisfavored\u201d rental units. This \u201cengineered\u201d rental housing shortage will then result in more \u201cfavored\u201d apartment units in the City of College Park, built by commercial entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">What is striking about this scheme is that nowhere does it address the needs or interests of renters, nor does it protect the otherwise appropriate use of private property. Rather, the College Park rent control ordinance is intended to penalize a \u201cdisfavored\u201d class of landlords, for the benefit of two other groups: a \u201cfavored\u201d class of commercial landlords, whose bottom line will fatten through elimination of a competitor; and owner-occupants of single-family houses in the neighborhoods adjacent to the University, who do not rent their dwellings, and anticipate rising home prices (or perhaps greater quality of life) through elimination of the rental market for single-family houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Undoubtedly some renters, those fortunate enough to be able to continue occupying the rent-controlled housing, likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>also will benefit in the short term by paying below-market rents, but the ordinance does not appear to countenance this result. The ultimate result of the ordinance appears likely to be higher rents, on average, than would otherwise prevail in its absence, because the clear purpose and likely effect will be to create an artificial shortage of the least expensive rental units, while encouraging profiteering by the operators of the most expensive units.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">I also would point out that the City\u2019s assertion that the \u201cdisfavored\u201d rental properties are to blame for the lion\u2019s share of code enforcement problems has little or no evidentiary support in the record. Although it may be sufficient to hypothesize any reasonably conceivable state of facts tending to support a statutory classification scheme, <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Fields Road Corp., </em>282 Md. 575, 580, 386 A.2d 344, 347 (1978) (\u201c \u2018When the classification in such a law is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U.S. 61, 78, 31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369, 377 (1911)), such a presumption still must be <em>reasonable. </em>In my view, if code enforcement is a problem, the simple answer would be to <em>enforce </em>the housing code. In any event, any step short of closing down the University would be unlikely to ameliorate the problem, because the concerns raised by the City are caused, ultimately, by the students themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Finally, without addressing Tyler\u2019s contention that the rent control ordinance is confiscatory, the \u201creview\u201d process also raises due process concerns. College Park Code Section 127-7 authorizes the Rent Stabilization Board to grant \u201cindividual rent ceiling adjustment[s]\u201d when persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence \u201cthat such adjustments are necessary to provide the landlord with a fair return on investment.\u201d Code Section 127-8 authorizes the Board to grant \u201ctemporary exemption[s]\u201d in cases of \u201cextreme financial hardship because of mortgage or financial obligations related to the property incurred before the effective date of [the Ordinance].\u201d Each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>these sections provides the Board with what amounts to unbridled discretion to determine what constitutes a <em>fair </em>return on investment or what constitutes an <em>extreme </em>financial hardship. Permitting the Board to apply such amorphous standards is tantamount to granting the Board legal authority to act arbitrarily and capriciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Admittedly, the statutory scheme may stifle the ability of private homeowners to rent their dwellings to college students, which is its purpose. This does not mean, however, that the rational basis test is satisfied. Rather, it is the purpose itself, I would submit, that is illegitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">To diminish the capacity of private homeowners to rent their properties through a deliberate scheme to squeeze rents below that required for maintenance and a fair operating profit, in favor of commercial vendors not similarly constrained, absent a legitimate public benefit, is to permit the government to act as a henchman for high rise owners, not a steward of the public interest. There is no reasonable argument that leasing one\u2019s house to a tenant is against the public interest or should be legally disfavored in any way. <em>See, e.g., Simard v. White, </em>383 Md. 257, 269 n. 11, 859 A.2d 168, 175 n. 11 (2004) (warning against assaults on property rights \u201c \u2018carried out in the name of \u201ccommon good,\u201d an elastic concept, defined by those whose interests it serves\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Richard Pipes, <em>Property and Freedom </em>225 (1999)). Consequently, there is no <em>legitimate public </em>purpose furthered by the City rent-control ordinance in the present case, but rather, a private benefit conferred on a class that may be favored in the political realm. As in <em>Verzi, </em>I can \u201cfind no rational basis for the distinction between [high-rise landlords] and [landlords renting out single-family houses],\u201d and thus am \u201cled to the more reasonable and probable view ... that [the classification] was intended to confer the monopoly of a profitable business upon [favored interests].\u201d 333 Md. at 427, 635 A.2d at 974 (internal quotation marks omitted).
