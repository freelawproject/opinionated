We have compressed the various questions into one, that being:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">Was the Circuit Court correct in granting summary judgment against an insurer on the basis that a waivers of subrogation clause in a form contract plainly and unambiguously encompassed losses sustained after completion of construction and final payment, rather than solely during construction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\"><em>Mattingly Constr. v.

In the insurance context, \u201c[a]n insurer asserting a subrogation right is usually viewed as \u2018standing in the shoes\u2019 of the insured so that the insurer\u2019s rights are equal to, but no greater than, those of the insured.\u201d Robert E.

Within this framework, we consider the factual circumstances underlying the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In 2002, K.B.K., Inc. and John L. Mattingly Construction Co., Inc., Petitioner, entered into an American Institute of Architects (\u201cAIA\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> form contract number A107-1997,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to build an Arby\u2019s Restaurant in Dunkirk, Maryland. The contract designated K.B.K. as the \u201cOwner\u201d and Mattingly as the \u201cContractor\u201d and provided that \u201cthe Project is\u201d the Arby\u2019s Restaurant in Dunkirk. Section 16.4, governing \u201cProperty Insurance,\u201d required K.B.K. to \u201cpurchase and maintain\u201d property insurance \u201cuntil final payment has been made\u201d or \u201cuntil no person ... other than [K.B.K.] ha[d] an insurable interest in the property\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">16.4.1. <em>Unless otherwise provided, the Owner shall purchase and maintain, in a company or companies lawfully authorized to do business in the jurisdiction in which the Project is located, property insurance on an \u201call-risk\u201d policy form, </em>including builder\u2019s risk, in the amount of the initial Contract Sum, plus the value of subsequent modifications and cost of materials supplied and installed by others, comprising total value for the entire Project at the site on a replacement cost basis without optional deductibles. Such property insurance shall be maintained, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents or otherwise agreed in writing by all persons and entities who are beneficiaries of such insurance, until final payment has been made as provided in Paragraph 14.5 or until no person or entity other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>than the Owner has an insurable interest in the property required by this Paragraph 16.4 to be covered, whichever is later. This insurance shall include interests of the Owner, the Contractor, Subcontractors, and sub-subcontractors in the Project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">(Emphasis added). Section 16.5, governing \u201cWaivers of Subrogation,\u201d stated that K.B.K. and Mattingly \u201cwaive[d] all rights against ... each other and any of their subcontractors\u201d for damages \u201ccovered by property insurance ... applicable to the Work\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">16.5.1 The Owner and Contractor waive all rights against ... each other and any of their subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, agents and employees, each of the other ... for damages caused by fire or other causes of loss <em>to the extent covered by property insurance obtained pursuant to Paragraph 16.b or other property insurance applicable to the Work, </em>except such rights as they have to proceeds of such insurance held by the Owner as fiduciary.... The policies shall provide such waivers of subrogation by endorsement or otherwise. A waiver of subrogation shall be effective as to a person or entity even though that person or entity would otherwise have a duty of indemnification, contractual or otherwise, did not pay the insurance premium directly or indirectly, and whether or not the person or entity had an insurable interest in the property damaged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">(Emphasis added). \u201cThe Work\u201d was defined in Section 6.3 of the contract as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">The term \u201cWork\u201d means the construction and services required by the Contract Documents, <em>whether completed or partially completed, </em>and includes all other labor, materials, equipment and services provided or to be provided by the Contractor to fulfill the Contractor\u2019s obligations. <em>The Work may constitute the whole or a part of the Project.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>14.5.3 The making of final payment shall constitute a waiver of claims by the Owner except those arising from:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>(Emphasis added). Section 14.5, governing \u201cFinal Completion and Final Payment,\u201d provided that final payment by K.B.K. constituted a waiver of claims, with limited exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>.1 hens, claims, security interests or encumbrances arising out of the Contract and unsettled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">.2 <em>failure of the Work to comply with the requirements of the Contract Documents; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">.3 terms of special warranties required by the Contract Documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Mattingly hired several subcontractors, including Wilma L. Phoebus d/b/a Wilma Phoebus Electric Company, the other Petitioner herein, which performed electrical work. Although Phoebus was not a party to the K.B.K.\u2014Mattingly contract, Section 10.3 of the K.B.K.\u2014Mattingly contract provided that subcontractors, such as Phoebus, were entitled to \u201call rights, remedies, and redress afforded\u201d to Mattingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">10.3 Contracts between the Contractor and Subcontractors shall (1) require each Subcontractor, to the extent of the Work to be performed by the Subcontractor, to be bound to the Contractor by the terms of the Contract Documents, and to assume toward the Contractor all the obligations and responsibilities, including the responsibility for safety of the Subcontractor\u2019s Work, which the Contractor, by the Contract Document, assumes toward the Owner and Architect, and (2) <em>allow the Subcontractor the benefit of all rights, remedies and redress afforded to the Contractor by these Contract Documents.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Construction was completed and the restaurant opened for business in October, 2003, after which K.B.K. made final payment on the contract. Subsequently, K.B.K. purchased from Hartford Underwriters Insurance Company, Respondent, a policy of property insurance insuring the restaurant,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>with effective coverage dates of October 1, 2004, through October 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Sixteen months after final payment was made, on May 8, 2005, a fire broke out, causing substantial damage to the Arby\u2019s. K.B.K. submitted a claim to Hartford for property damage totaling $1,117,711.26, which Hartford paid, less a $1,000 deductible. Thereafter, Hartford, as subrogee<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of K.B.K., filed a complaint against Mattingly and Phoebus in the Circuit Court for Calvert County, alleging negligence, breach of contract, and breach of warranty, asserting that the \u201cfailure of electrical wiring within the Arby\u2019s Restaurant\u201d caused the fire.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Mattingly and Phoebus answered, generally denying liability and asserting various affirmative defenses. Thereafter, Petitioners filed motions for summary judgment, asserting that the waivers of subrogation clause, Section 16.5 in the AIA form contract, precluded Hartford\u2019s claim. Specifically, Mat-tingly and Phoebus argued that \u201cthe parties agreed to look solely to the insurance\u201d to cover perils such as fire, and therefore, Hartford could not enforce any subrogation rights. Hartford opposed the motions and also filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment, asserting that the waivers of subrogation provision was not applicable, because K.B.K., its insured, sustained the loss after completion of construction and final payment. Mattingly filed a reply and opposition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Hartford\u2019s cross-motion for partial summary judgment, and Phoebus filed a supplemental memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">After a hearing on the motions, the judge issued an opinion and order granting summary judgment in favor of Mattingly and Phoebus and denying Hartford\u2019s cross-motion for partial summary judgment. The judge determined that the waivers of subrogation clause was clear and unambiguous because the term \u201cthe Work\u201d in Section 6.3 of the form contract included \u201cthe building as constructed, even after final payment.\u201d The judge also reasoned that because the damage caused by the fire was covered by \u201cother insurance applicable to the Work,\u201d a phrase in Section 16.5 of the contract, K.B.K., and consequently, Hartford waived any rights against Mattingly and Phoebus.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Hartford noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed and remanded in a reported opinion, <em>Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Phoebus, </em>187 Md.App. 668, 979 A.2d 299 (2009), in which it concluded that the waivers of subrogation provision, read in tandem with the definition of \u201cthe Work,\u201d was ambiguous and \u201creasonably [could] be read to have more than one meaning, temporally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685, 979 A.2d at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that summary judgment in favor of Mattingly and Phoebus was improper, because the waivers of subrogation clause was ambiguous as to whether it encompassed losses sustained after completion of construction and final payment; we add our two cents, nevertheless, regarding the path that should be followed by the Circuit Court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The entry of summary judgment is governed by Rule 2-501, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">(f) Entry of judgment. The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">As we recently stated in <em>Blondell v. Littlepage, </em>413 Md. 96, 991 A.2d 80 (2010), the standard of review of a grant of such a motion is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">In considering a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment, this Court reviews the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v.

Crews, 405 </em>Md. 722, 735-36, 955 A.2d 769, 777-78 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Mattingly and Phoebus assert that the waivers of subrogation clause in Section 16.5 of the contract clearly and unambiguously encompassed losses sustained after substantial completion of the Arby\u2019s and final payment. Petitioners claim that the phrase \u201cother property insurance applicable to the Work\u201d in Section 16.5 refers to both ongoing construction as well as the completed restaurant, as evidenced by the definition of \u201cthe Work\u201d in Section 6.3. Mattingly and Phoebus also cite decisions from other jurisdictions which they claim support the notion that subrogation waivers clearly encompass post-construction losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Hartford counters that the contract is \u201cvague and ambiguous\u201d regarding whether the waivers of subrogation provision remained in force after the completion of the restaurant and that the \u201cmost reasonable interpretation\u201d is that the waiver \u201cwas not intended to apply to losses that occur many months or years after substantial completion and final payment.\u201d Hartford further asserts that decisions from other jurisdictions cited by Mattingly and Phoebus are inapposite, because those courts interpreted different ALA form contracts from the instant one in that they included provisions specifically addressing what to do in the event of damages occurring after construction was completed and final payment made.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In interpreting the contract in issue, we are mindful that \u201cMaryland adheres to the principle of the objective interpretation of contracts.\u201d <em>Clancy v. King, 405 </em>Md. 541, 557, 954 A.2d 1092, 1101 (2008), quoting <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 16, 919 A.2d 700, 709 (2007). Our task in determining the meaning of a contract is necessarily \u201cfocused on the four corners of the agreement.\u201d <em>Clancy, </em>405 Md. at 557, 954 A.2d at 1101, quoting <em>Cochran, </em>398 Md. at 17, 919 A.2d at 710. \u201cWhen the clear language of a contract is unambiguous, the court will give effect to its plain, ordinary, and usual meaning, taking into account the context in which it is used.\u201d <em>Sy-Lene </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>of Washington, Inc. v.

In contrast, a contract is \u201cambiguous if it is subject to more than one interpretation when read by a reasonably prudent person.\u201d <em>Sy-Lene, </em>376 Md. at 167, 829 A.2d at 547; <em>see also Calomiris v.

St. Charles </em>Assocs. <em>Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>366 Md. 426, 445, 784 A.2d 545, 556 (2001). \u201cIt is a basic principle of contract law that, in construing the language of a contract, ambiguities are resolved against the draftsman of the instrument.\u201d <em>Burroughs Corp. v. Chesapeake Petroleum &amp; Supply Co., Inc., </em>282 Md. 406, 411, 384 A.2d 734, 737 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Section 16.5, governing \u201cWaivers of Subrogation,\u201d stated that K.B.K. and Mattingly \u201cwaive[d] all rights against ... each other and any of their subcontractors\u201d for damages caused by perils such as fire \u201cto the extent covered by property insurance obtained pursuant to [Section] 16.4 or <em>other property insurance applicable to the Work ....\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The issue is whether property insurance underwritten by Hartford, secured after completion of the restaurant, comes within this phrase, \u201cother property insurance applicable to the Work,\u201d abrogating any rights of subrogation. Mattingly and Phoebus assert that this language plainly refers to the construction period as well as the completed restaurant, such that K.B.K. waived subrogation rights, without any temporal limitation to the clause whatsoever. Hartford counters that the use of the phrase \u201cthe Work\u201d varies throughout the contract, such that the waivers of subrogation clause is rendered ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u201c[T]he Work\u201d is defined in Section 6.3 of the form contract as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">The term \u201cWork\u201d means the construction and services required by the Contract Documents, whether completed or partially completed, and includes all other labor, materials, equipment and services provided or to be provided by the Contractor to fulfill the Contractor\u2019s obligations. The Work may constitute the whole or a part of the Project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In the first sentence of the definition, the phrase \u201cconstruction and services required by the Contract\u201d clearly refers to the construction period. The next phrase, \u201cwhether completed or partially completed,\u201d however, could yield a different understanding because it could refer reasonably to the completed restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The second sentence of the definition, which states, \u201c[t]he Work may constitute the whole or a part of the Project,\u201d also could be construed to modify the prior phrase to include all actions necessary to constitute performance under the contract. On the other hand, this phrase could be interpreted reasonably to refer to the completed Arby\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">As a result, the waivers of subrogation clause, including \u201cother property insurance applicable to the Work,\u201d may refer reasonably to \u201cother property insurance applicable\u201d to the ongoing construction, or, \u201cother property insurance applicable\u201d to the completed Arby\u2019s. Thus, the waivers of subrogation clause, in which the words \u201cthe Work\u201d are prominent, is internally inconsistent, and ergo, ambiguous, as also recognized by our colleagues on the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Section 14.5, governing \u201cFinal Completion and Final Payment,\u201d exacerbates this ambiguity contextually. The provision states that by making final payment, K.B.K. does not waive any claim that \u201cthe Work\u201d does not comply with the contract. As noted by the intermediate appellate court, the clause \u201creferences the future,\u201d because \u201cany such claim necessarily would be made\u201d after the restaurant \u201cis built and paid for.\u201d <em>Hartford, </em>187 Md.App. at 686, 979 A.2d at 310. That Section, however, does not indicate the precise meaning of \u201cthe Work,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>or whether, in the event of a claim by K.B.K., the \u201cWaivers of Subrogation\u201d Section would remain in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Mattingly and Phoebus, nevertheless, refer us to what they term a \u201cmajority\u201d of jurisdictions that recognize waivers of subrogation in AIA form contracts as encompassing losses sustained after completion of construction and final payment. <em>See Town of Silverton v.

According to one of the cases cited by Mattingly and Phoebus, an example of a completed project insurance clause was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\"><em>[Iff after final payment property insurance is to be provided on the completed Project through a policy </em>or\u25a0 <em>policies other than those insuring the Project during the construction period, the Owner shall waive all rights in accordance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>with the terms of [the Waivers of Subrogation clause </em>] for damages caused by fire or other perils covered by this separate property insurance ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><em>Silverton, </em>948 P.2d at 11 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In <em>Silverton, </em>the Town entered into an AIA form contract with a builder to install a new roof on the town hall. More than a year after the roof was completed and paid for, a fire severely damaged the building. The Town obtained compensation under a property insurance policy, and the insurer assigned its subrogation rights to the Town. Thereafter, the Town filed a complaint against the builder and several subcontractors, alleging that defective installation of a snow melting system had caused the fire. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the builder and subcontractors, reasoning that subrogation waivers in the contract prohibited the Town\u2019s claim. <em>Silverton, </em>948 P.2d at 11. The Colorado intermediate appellate court affirmed, examining the waivers of subrogation and completed project insurance clauses in harmony. In so doing, the court emphasized that the completed project insurance clause specifically \u201cprovide[d] for a waiver of subrogation rights after final payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Similarly, in <em>Colonial Properties, </em>567 S.E.2d 389, a real estate developer, Colonial, hired a contractor to build an apartment complex. A year after the complex was complete, one of the apartment buildings was extensively damaged by a fire inadvertently started by a resident. Colonial\u2019s insurer paid the loss and filed a subrogation action against the contractor alleging negligent supervision, negligence per se, gross negligence, and breach of contract. The trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of the contractor, and the Georgia intermediate appellate court affirmed, reasoning that a waivers of subrogation clause and the completed project insurance provision in the AIA form contract, identical to that in <em>Silver-ton, </em>demonstrated that \u201cthe parties intended to provide for waiver of subrogation rights for losses occurring after the project was completed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>In <em>TX. C.C., </em>233 S.W.3d 562, a restaurant owner entered into an AIA form contract with a contractor for the construction of a restaurant. Three years after the restaurant was complete, a fire caused by a faulty fireplace destroyed the restaurant. The restaurant owner was compensated under a property insurance policy, and the insurer filed a subrogation claim against the contractor and subcontractor, who installed the fireplace, for reimbursement. The Texas intermediate appellate court determined that the trial judge properly granted summary judgment in favor of the contractor and subcontractor, because the waivers of subrogation clause, interpreted in conjunction with the completed project insurance clause, identical to that in <em>Silverton, </em>specifically contemplated losses sustained after completion of construction and final payment. <em>Accord Argonaut, </em>2007 WL 4554219, at *7, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93846, at *26 (granting motions for summary judgment in favor of a contractor and subcontractor because a completed project insurance clause in the contract \u201cma[de] clear that the parties contemplated that the Owners would acquire additional insurance ... and that the waiver of subrogation ... would apply to those additional policies\u201d); <em>Royal Surplus Lines, </em>2006 WL 897078, at *4, 2006 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 9794 (reasoning owner and insurer could not bring claim against contractor for losses sustained more than four years after construction was complete, because of subrogation waiver and completed project insurance clause in form contract); <em>Midwestern Indem., </em>801 N.E.2d at 670 (holding an insurer\u2019s subrogation action was precluded by a subrogation waiver and completed project insurance clause, indicating that if the owner \u201cobtained property insurance after project completion it would waive its rights against contractors and subcontractors\u201d); <em>Acuity, </em>2008 WL 625097, at *11, 2008 Ohio App. LEXIS 896, at *29 (interpreting a completed project insurance clause as indicating that if the owner purchased property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>insurance \u201cthrough a policy other than those policies insuring the project during the construction period, the owner waives all rights in accordance with the [waivers of subrogation clause] for [post-construction] damages\u201d); <em>Universal Underwriters, </em>916 A.2d 686 (reasoning a trial judge properly granted summary judgment in favor of a contractor and subcontractor because the owner obtained property insurance after the completion of construction and final payment pursuant to a completed project insurance clause).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>But see Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Grinnell Corp., </em>477 F.Supp.2d 327 (D.Mass. 2007) (reasoning that although a form contract contained a completed project insurance clause, unless the parties plainly required the owner to obtain post-completion, post-payment property insurance, the contract language demonstrated an intention not to waive subrogation rights after completion and final payment).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>In this regard, it seems disingenuous for Mattingly and Phoebus to assert that the Court of Special Appeals, in differentiating many of the same cases, inappropriately resorted to \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d to discuss completed project insurance clauses. The ambiguity in the contract in issue was not created by the Court of Special Appeals, but by the definition of \u201cthe Work\u201d in the waivers of subrogation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Hartford, instead, urges us to embrace the reasoning of <em>Automobile Insurance Co. of Hartford v. United H.R.B. General Contractors, Inc., </em>876 S.W.2d 791 (Mo.Ct.App.1994), in which the Missouri intermediate appellate court considered the temporal scope of a waivers of subrogation clause in an AIA form contract that was not interrelated with a completed project insurance clause. In that case, as here, the contract contained a waiver of all claims \u201cfor damages caused by fire or other perils to the extent covered by ... any other property insurance applicable to the Work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 792. The contract defined \u201cthe Work,\u201d in turn, as \u201ccomprising] the completed construction required by the Contract Documents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 798. The contract also contained a clause regarding final payment, similar to that in the present case, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adh\">The making of final payment shall constitute a waiver of all claims by the Owner except those arising from faulty or defective Work appearing after Substantial Completion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 794. The court determined that the waivers of subrogation clause, when read in tandem with the definition of \u201cthe Work\u201d and provision regarding final payment, was ambiguous. To resolve the ambiguity, the court gave preference \u201cto the specific provisions over the general\u201d and reasoned that the final payment provision was more specific than the waivers of subrogation clause, such that the subrogation waiver terminated upon completion of construction and final payment. <em>Id. </em>at 794-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We embrace the reasoning that the instant waivers of subrogation clause, with the definition of \u201cthe Work\u201d included as one of its terms, is ambiguous, but we cannot reconcile the ambiguity without consideration of the parties\u2019 intent. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>precepts of contract interpretation dictate that when faced with an ambiguous contract, \u201cthe court must consider extrinsic evidence which sheds light on the intentions of the parties at the time of the execution of the contract.\u201d <em>Sy-Lene, </em>376 Md. at 167-68, 829 A.2d at 547, quoting <em>County Comm\u2019rs v. St. Charles, </em>366 Md. at 445, 784 A.2d at 556; <em>see also Brendsel v. Winchester Constr. Co., </em>392 Md. 601, 624-25, 898 A.2d 472, 486 (2006) (\u201cOnly when the language of the contract is ambiguous will we look to extraneous sources for the contract\u2019s meaning. In that event, the intention of the parties must be established through relevant parol evidence or by strictly construing the clause against its author.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Proceedings on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u201cIt is a basic principle of contract law that, in construing the language of a contract, ambiguities are resolved against the draftsman of the instrument,\u201d <em>Burroughs Corp. v. Chesapeake Petroleum, &amp; Supply Co., Inc., </em>282 Md. 406, 411, 384 A.2d 734, 737 (1978), or, in the case of a form contract, the proponent of the contract. <em>See, e.g., Fayetteville Investors v. Commercial Builders, Inc., </em>936 F.2d 1462 (4th Cir.1991). This principle is often referred to under the Latin term of <em>contra proferentem, </em>which literally means, \u201cagainst the offer- or, <em>he who puts forth, </em>or proffers or offers the language.\u201d Richard A. Lord, 11 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 32:12, at 472-75 (4th ed. 1999) (emphasis added). Although the Court of Special Appeals stated that \u201cthere is no such extrinsic evidence\u201d shedding light on the meaning of the waivers of subrogation clause in the form contract, <em>Hartford, </em>187 Md. App. at 679 n. 3, 979 A.2d at 305 n. 3, there may be other facts to explore, such as, primarily, who proposed the form contract used in the present case, among the various ALA forms that may have been available.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In <em>Fayetteville Investors, </em>the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals considered the language of a performance bond,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>anteeing construction of a hotel owned by Fayetteville Investors. Although construction of the hotel was to be completed by November 1985, serious structural problems persisted, and the contractor and subcontractors continued work on the site until October 1987, when the contractor indicated that it would do no further work without additional payment. <em>Id. </em>at 1463. Pursuant to the terms of the performance bond, Fayetteville notified the surety of \u201cContractor Default\u201d and subsequently filed a complaint against the surety. The trial judge dismissed the complaint, pursuant to a motion to dismiss filed by the surety, reasoning that the terms of the performance bond required that any such action be brought within two years, and the complaint alleged that \u201cthe Contractor abandoned the project in June, 1986,\u201d three years earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 1464.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">In interpreting the phrase \u201cContractor Default,\u201d the court noted that \u201cany ambiguities in the interpretation of the performance bond <em>must be construed against the party drafting or adopting the </em>document\u2014in this case, the surety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1465 (emphasis added). In so doing, the court emphasized that the surety proposed and used an AIA form performance bond, widely used in the industry. <em>Id. &amp; </em>n. 3. As a result, the court reasoned that the terms of the performance bond \u201ccontemplated that a contractor would be afforded a reasonable time to ... make repairs and corrections,\u201d such that the trial judge improperly granted the surety\u2019s motion to dismiss, because the contractor actually continued work on the site as late as 1987. <em>Id. </em>at 1466. <em>See also Blue Cross of Southwestern Virginia v. McDevitt &amp; Street Co., </em>234 Va. 191, 360 S.E.2d 825, 827 (1987) (reasoning that when the language of a <em>form </em>contract \u201carguably supports two antithetical interpretations,\u201d courts will construe any ambiguity against the architect or contractor \u201cwho supplied [the] printed forms\u201d); <em>cf. Associated Eng\u2019rs, Inc. v. Grand Elec. Coop., Inc., </em>370 F.2d 633, 650 n. 8 (8th Cir.1966) (noting ambiguities in a form contract should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>not be construed against the contractor, because the contractor financed the construction with a Rural Electric Administration loan and was <em>not </em>\u201cfree to choose whether or not to use the REA form\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Accordingly, we remand this case to the Court of Special Appeals with directions to remand the case to the Circuit Court to more fully develop the record as to what the parties intended. Because Mattingly and Phoebus asserted the viability of the waivers of subrogation clause as a defense, they will be required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Hartford cannot assert a subrogation claim against them under the form contract; in doing so, consideration must be given to who proposed the form contract at issue in this case, as well as any other relevant evidence of the parties\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Are parties to a construction contract able to freely negotiate the allocation of risks to insurers to the extent such risks are covered by insurance without regard to temporal limitations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">B.
