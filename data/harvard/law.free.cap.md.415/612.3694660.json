The court remonstrated that Hardy discharging his present counsel might prove deleterious to his defense. In response, Hardy abandoned any initiative to change his trial counsel and the trial continued, resulting in convictions on the above charges. Upon appellate review, we are asked to determine whether Hardy\u2019s statement that he was \u201cthinking about changing [his] attorney or something\u201d qualified as a request to discharge counsel under Maryland law and rules and, if so, whether the trial court addressed properly the request. For reasons we shall explain, we hold that: (1) Hardy\u2019s statement constituted a request to discharge defense counsel; (2) Maryland Rule \u00e9-^lACe),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which dictates the procedure a trial court must follow in response to a request to discharge counsel, does not apply after voir dire begins; and, (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in how it addressed Hardy\u2019s request to discharge his counsel during trial. As such, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals that held, in pertinent part, to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">On 19 February 2006, around 1:30 a.m., an officer of the Baltimore City Police Department discovered Emmitt Camm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>leaning against a gas station pump in the 2500 block of Liberty Heights Avenue in Baltimore. Camm appeared to have been beaten severely. Paramedics transported him to Sinai Hospital for treatment. Camm informed police that he had been driving his Ford Explorer when two men, one of whom he identified as an acquaintance, \u201cWill,\u201d stopped him and asked for a ride. At some point during their travels thereafter, the men told Camm to pull over. Camm stopped the car and stepped out, at which time the men advanced on him and demanded his \u201cproperty.\u201d The men threatened Camm with a knife, beat him, and threw him into the trunk of his car. Camm \u201cgot out somehow\u201d and stumbled to the gas station where the police found him. All in all, the men stole Camm\u2019s wallet, cell phone, car keys, and vehicle. Approximately a month after the attack, Camm identified from a police photo array \u201cWill\u201d as the Respondent, Wilbert Hardy. Police arrested Hardy on 20 June 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">At the outset of Hardy\u2019s trial in the Circuit Court on 19 March 2007, immediately prior to the colloquy at issue in this appeal, the court swore the venire panel, introduced the factual allegations of the case to the venire, and proceeded to ask the venirepersons several questions and receive their responses. The court then asked counsel and Hardy to approach the bench to discuss further voir dire inquiries. At the bench, the following exchange commenced the colloquy that we consider pointedly in this ease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Also, my client wanted to address the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">THE COURT: About what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He won\u2019t tell me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">THE COURT: No. You sit down, sir. The only thing you should have addressed me on is whether you wanted that 12 years.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] You not wanting it you\u2019re getting exactly what you asked for, a trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>[HARDY]: I\u2019m saying I haven\u2019t changed about me wanting a trial. <em>I\u2019m thinking about changing the attorney or something.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">THE COURT: Okay. Sit down a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">[HARDY]: She [my attorney] asking me about taking time. I\u2019m not going to do this. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-W\">THE COURT: Well, sir, at this point actually, you only have two options. One is to discharge your lawyer and proceed to represent yourself, which I would not recommend. You have a constitutional right to represent yourself. But I don\u2019t feel that I am able to force her to sit at the trial table and assist you. Now if you have another lawyer who is ready, willing and able to step in her shoes, by all means, fire her if the other person is ready to step in. [HARDY]: I\u2019m not saying that\u2014no disrespect\u2014I\u2019m saying, I haven\u2019t talked to my lawyer an hour in over a year. <em>I\u2019ve had her for a year. I haven\u2019t even talked to my lawyer one hour. </em>I\u2019m saying, that\u2019s no time to prepare a case. <em>I spoke to her 15 minutes </em>with her out in Hagerstown [a detention facility] because she had to leave. I can\u2019t prepare a case in 15 minutes (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">THE COURT: I can\u2019t believe that counsel would have only talked to you 15 minutes. Is that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No. We spoke\u2014when I went to visit him in Hagerstown I was kicked out because there were\u2014they ended it, but <em>we spoke for 20, 25 minutes. And we have spoken extensively on Friday </em>[16 March]. <em>That was well over an hour.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>THE COURT: See, sir, what you\u2019re saying is basically you\u2019re upset because you believe that her suggestion to you that you take time on this case she\u2019s trying to throw you. Is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">[HARDY]: I feel like she don\u2019t believe in me. You know what I\u2019m saying. <em>She asked me to take time for something I didn\u2019t do.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">THE COURT: She\u2019s got to. The same way I had to go over what you were charged with, what the elements were and what the offer was so that you don\u2019t turn around and say, they never told me. You understand, sir? Ethically she\u2019s got to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">[HARDY]: She\u2019s been telling me about take the time every time I see her she says something about taking some time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">THE COURT: That\u2019s because you\u2019re exposed to so much more. That\u2019s why. She\u2019s a good lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">[HARDY]: I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s not a good lawyer. I\u2019m just saying (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">THE COURT: She\u2019s going to work hard for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">[HARDY]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">THE COURT: She\u2019s only doing what anybody else does. A decision whether or not you want to take time is in your hands, not in her hands. You understand? That\u2019s why she\u2019s telling you. That\u2019s why I told you. So it couldn\u2019t come up later on, say, look, that judge didn\u2019t even tell me. You see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-13\">[HARDY]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-14\">THE COURT: Okay. You all can step back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">The judge revisited the matter of Hardy\u2019s earlier expressed dissatisfaction with his defense counsel at the close of voir dire. The court asked counsel and Hardy to approach the bench to note any exceptions to the voir dire questions it had asked. After he gave the lawyers the opportunity to note these exceptions, the judge addressed Hardy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>THE COURT: ... [S]ir, do you feel better about\u2014after talking to me about\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">[HARDY]: (inaudible) wanted to finish talking to my attorney before I come back in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We\u2019ll speak again during the lunch break.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">THE COURT: Yeah, you will. To be quite honest, sir, she\u2019s only giving her\u2014you, her opinion based on what she has seen me do to people involved in violent offenses with any record. She\u2019s just giving you her\u2014you her honest opinion. You see what I mean. Nothing person[al], but she\u2019s really telling you the way it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">[HARDY]: I understand what you\u2019re saying. (Inaudible.) THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Hardy did not make any further statements during trial bearing on dissatisfaction with or discharging his counsel. The jury convicted Hardy on the specific counts mentioned at the outset of this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">II. APPELLATE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">After he was sentenced, Hardy noted timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, in which he alleged that four errors in the proceedings before the Circuit Court merited reversal of his convictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court reversed Hardy\u2019s convictions and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for a new trial, holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>that the trial court, in addressing Hardy\u2019s concerns regarding his trial counsel, failed to adhere to the mandatory procedures for consideration of requests to discharge counsel contained in Rule 4-215(e).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The State filed timely a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted, 411 Md. 740, 985 A.2d 538 (2009), to consider the following issues: (1) whether Hardy\u2019s statement that he was \u201cthinking about changing the attorney or something\u201d qualified as a request to discharge his counsel, (2) if so, whether Rule 4-215(e) applies to such requests after voir dire begins, and (3) if Rule 4-215(e) applies, whether the trial court\u2019s colloquy with Hardy complied with the Rule\u2019s mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">When applicable, Rule 4-215(e) demands strict compliance. \u201cThe provisions of the rule are mandatory\u201d and a trial court\u2019s departure from them constitutes reversible error. <em>Williams v. State, </em>321 Md. 266, 272, 582 A.2d 803, 806 (1990). Where a motion to discharge counsel is made during trial, however, Rule 4-215(e) does not apply, and we evaluate the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to discharge counsel under the far more lenient abuse of discretion standard. <em>State v. Brown </em>(hereinafter <em>\u201cBrown </em>\u201d), 342 Md. 404, 429, 676 A.2d 513, 525 (1996). We have noted that a court abuses its discretion in this regard only when it acts \u201c \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles,\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>373 Md. 234, 250, 817 A.2d 241, 250 (2003) (quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110, 118 (1997)),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that we find an abuse of discretion only when the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>act is so untenable as to place it \u201c \u2018beyond the fringe of what the court deems minimally acceptable,\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>373 Md. at 250, 817 A.2d at 250 (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 14, 648 A.2d 1025, 1032 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">IY. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">As we shall explain, we hold that the trial court did not commit reversible error in its response to Hardy\u2019s request to discharge his trial counsel. As a threshold matter, we find that Hardy\u2019s statement regarding \u201cthinking about changing [his] attorney or something\u201d qualifies as a request to discharge counsel because a trial court reasonably should have interpreted it as such. We determine, however, that the court, in responding to Hardy\u2019s request, was not required to comply literally with the strictures of Rule 4-215(e) because the request was raised after the beginning of voir dire, which, in our view, constitutes a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding.\u201d Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s handling of Hardy\u2019s request under an abuse of discretion standard. Finding none, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which granted Hardy a new trial on its resolution of this issue alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">A. <em>Hardy\u2019s statement qualified as a request to discharge his counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">At the outset, we address the threshold question of whether Hardy\u2019s statement regarding \u201cthinking about changing [his] attorney or something\u201d qualifies as a request to discharge counsel. We have observed that \u201cany statement by the defendant from which the court could reasonably conclude that the defendant desire[s to discharge his counsel is] sufficient\u201d for the court to consider that statement as a request to discharge counsel. <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 127, 406 A.2d 98, 101 (1979). There is no \u201ctalismanic phrase\u201d that a defendant must utter to make such a request, <em>Leonard v. State, </em>302 Md. 111, 124, 486 A.2d 163, 169 (1985); rather, the defendant need only indicate reasonably to the court a desire to discharge his or her counsel in order to engage the requirement that the court consider the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>Campbell, </em>385 Md. 616, 631, 870 A.2d 217, 225 (2005); <em>see also Snead, </em>286 Md. at 130, 406 A.2d at 102 (noting that former rule governing procedure for requests to discharge counsel is triggered \u201cwhen a defendant indicates a <em>desire </em>or <em>inclination </em>to waive counsel\u201d (emphasis added)). A defendant makes such a request even when his or her statement constitutes more a declaration of dissatisfaction with counsel than an explicit request to discharge. <em>See, e.g., Campbell, </em>385 Md. at 632, 870 A.2d at 226 (finding request to discharge counsel when defendant stated \u201cI don\u2019t like this man as my representative---We had conflicts way before this ever started\u201d); <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>311 Md. 586, 607, 536 A.2d 1149, 1160 (1988) (treating as request to discharge counsel defendant\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]f possible I would rather get rid of her [my attorney], get new [sic] attorney\u201d); <em>Leonard, </em>302 Md. at 125, 486 A.2d at 170 (declaring request to discharge counsel \u201cobvious\u201d where defendant said \u201ccan I get appointed another counsel? ... Well, he\u2019s not representing me then\u201d); <em>Snead, </em>286 Md. at 131, 406 A.2d at 103 (finding request to discharge counsel when defendant said \u201cI don\u2019t want no attorney then\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Hardy\u2019s statement here was hardly talismanic, but it communicated nevertheless his unhappiness (albeit a passing state of mind at the time) with his trial counsel clearly enough to constitute a request to discharge counsel. Although not worded as a decisional motion, Hardy\u2019s declaration that he was \u201cthinking about changing the attorney or something\u201d reasonably should have led a trial judge to conclude that Hardy wanted, or at the very least was inclined, to discharge his counsel. That is all that Maryland law requires in order for a court to consider his statement a request to discharge counsel and address the matter accordingly. As in <em>Campbell, Fowlkes, Leonard, </em>and <em>Snead, </em>Hardy\u2019s statement was an indication of dissatisfaction with his lawyer, and, likewise, Hardy\u2019s statement qualifies as a request to discharge defense counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>B. <em>Rule U-215(e) does not apply to requests to discharge counsel made after voir dire has begun.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Having concluded that Hardy made a legitimate request to discharge his trial counsel, we must determine whether the trial judge\u2019s consideration of that request is governed purely by its discretion, or whether it should be circumscribed by the procedural demands of Rule 4-215(e), which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">Discharge of counsel\u2014Waiver. If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney ... the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Rule 4-215(e). As we shall explain, we conclude that Rule 4-215(e) does not apply literally once voir dire begins, and, therefore, the trial judge was not obliged necessarily to adhere to the Rule\u2019s strict procedural requirements in considering Hardy\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">We have held that Rule 4-215(e) ceases to apply as soon as \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d begin. <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 427-28, 676 A.2d at 525.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We refused to draw a bright line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>definition delimiting the precise moment that marks the beginning of \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 423, 676 A.2d at 522 (declining to adopt \u201can inflexible rule of <em>per se </em>untimeliness\u201d), choosing rather to evaluate each situation on a case-by-case basis. Our case law makes clear that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d commence no later than by the time the court instructs the jury, <em>see State v. Wischhusen, </em>342 Md. 530, 543, 677 A.2d 595, 601 (1996) (holding that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d had commenced by.time of potential motion to reinstruct the jury), and after the State begins to present evidence, <em>see Brown, </em>342 Md. at 429, 676 A.2d at 525 (concluding that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d had commenced by time of request made after the State had presented evidence). Conversely, courts in this State have observed that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have <em>not </em>commenced at the time of pretrial hearings, <em>see Joseph v. State, </em>190 Md.App. 275, 288, 988 A.2d 545, 553 (2010) (applying Rule 4-215(e) to request raised at hearing \u201con the eve of trial\u201d); <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 679, 688, 747 A.2d 759, 764 (2000) (same; request was raised immediately before a suppression hearing), or at the defendant\u2019s first appearance on the morning of trial, <em>see Gonzales v. State, </em>408 Md. 515, 537, 970 A.2d 908, 921 (2009) (applying Rule 4-215(e) on defendant\u2019s initial appearance before the trial court the morning of his trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We also have defined \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d in a functional sense. Under this definition, \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun whenever allowing the defendant to discharge or substitute his legal counsel would pose a risk either of disruption of trial procedure or of confusing the jury. In <em>Brown, </em>for example, we cautioned that the right of a defendant to discharge his defense counsel should be limited once trial begins \u201cto prevent undue interference with the administration of justice,\u201d particularly the defendant\u2019s \u201ctactic[s] to delay the proceedings or to confuse the jury.\u201d 342 Md. at 414-15, 676 A.2d at 518.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>With regard to requests to discharge defense counsel that are made during voir dire (such as Hardy\u2019s), we hold that Rule 4-215(e) does not apply because \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have commenced by the time of these requests. Admittedly, no controlling precedent dictates directly this result. Our cases establish clearly that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have <em>not </em>begun before voir dire <em>commences </em>(at pre-trial hearings and at a defendant\u2019s first appearance in court on the morning of his or her trial) -and that they <em>have </em>begun after voir dire <em>concludes </em>(after the State presents evidence and during jury instructions), but the question of whether they have begun at a point <em>during </em>voir dire is one of first impression in this State.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Two considerations inform our conclusion that the proper resolution of this issue is that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d <em>have </em>begun when a request to discharge counsel is made during voir dire. First, voir dire is a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding\u201d under the plain meaning of the phrase. There can be no trial without a trier of fact, and there can be no trier of fact in a jury trial without the jury selection process of voir dire. As such, the voir dire process represents a necessary step in any jury trial, and, therefore, with the beginning of voir dire, meaningful trial proceedings must have begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Second, voir dire is a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding\u201d under the functional definition of the phrase. In situations where Rule 4-215(e) applies, it permits essentially a criminal defendant to discharge defense counsel almost at will. When the process of jury selection begins, however, the soon-to-be members of the jury share the courtroom with the defendant and defense counsel. From this point on, allowing the defendant to change at will his or her representation, as Rule 4-215(e) permits, would risk confusing the prospective jurors, one of the concerns against which <em>Brown </em>warns. For example, jurors simply may become confused by seeing the defendant appear with an attorney one moment and without one the next, or, because defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy may affect the questions and challenges posed during voir dire, jurors may be confused when a defendant\u2019s motion to discharge counsel is granted and defendant embarks on abrupt and apparent change to that strategy. In addition, allowing such a change to defense counsel after the entire venire panel is summoned to the courtroom poses a considerable risk of disruption to the trial proceedings in that courtroom, to the court\u2019s jury assignment system (as it is compelled to work around the court\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s request), and to the court\u2019s administration as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>To avoid the dangers of confusion to the jury and disruption of trial proceedings that <em>Broum </em>counsels against, and in accordance with the plain meaning of the words of the applicable rule, we hold that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun after a trial court has begun the voir dire process in a criminal trial. As such, Rule 4-215(e) does not apply literally here to the court\u2019s consideration of Hardy\u2019s motion to dismiss his trial counsel, which was brought after several voir dire questions had been asked. As noted <em>supra, </em>because Rule 4-215(e) does not apply, we consider next whether the trial court\u2019s consideration of Hardy\u2019s request to discharge counsel was a proper exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">C. <em>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in addressing Hardy\u2019s request to discharge his defense counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">When a defendant makes a request to discharge counsel at a time when Rule 4-215(e) does not apply strictly, \u201c[t]he court must conduct an inquiry to assess whether the defendant\u2019s reason for dismissal of counsel justifies any resulting disruption\u201d and rule on the request exercising broad discretion. <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 428, 676 A.2d at 525. The court\u2019s burden in making this inquiry is to provide the defendant the opportunity to explain his or her reasons for making the request; in other words, the court need not do any more than supply the forum in which the defendant may tender this explanation. <em>See Campbell, </em>385 Md. at 635, 870 A.2d at 228 (stating that \u201cthe trial judge was not required to make any further inquiry\u201d after the defendant made clear his reasons for wanting to dismiss his counsel); <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 430, 676 A.2d at 526 (describing court\u2019s burden as duty to <em>\u201cprovide an opportunity </em>for [the defendant] to explain his [or her] desire to discharge counsel\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>If the court provides this opportunity, how to address the request is left almost entirely to the court\u2019s \u201csound discretion.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 426, 676 A.2d at 524. According to <em>Brown, </em>the court should consider six factors in exercising its discretion in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">(1) the merit of the reason for discharge; (2) the quality of counsel\u2019s representation prior to the request; (3) the disruptive effect, if any, that discharge would have on the proceedings; (4) the timing of the request; (5) the complexity and stage of the proceedings; and (6) any prior requests by the defendant to discharge counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">342 Md. at 428, 676 A.2d at 525. All six of these factors, however, may be considered in a brief exchange between the court and the defendant about the defendant\u2019s reasons for requesting the dismissal of defense counsel. For example, in <em>Campbell, </em>the defendant was allowed to explain at the close of the State\u2019s case why he believed his attorney was not acting in his interest. 385 Md. at 623-24, 870 A.2d at 221. The court then replied \u201cwe are beyond that at this point, sir.... He is representing you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624, 870 A.2d at 221. We found that the trial court considered adequately within this brief exchange the six <em>Brown </em>factors and, as such, exercised properly its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request, <em>id. </em>at 636, 870 A.2d at 228, even though it did not inquire into the reasons for the request beyond the defendant\u2019s brief explanation of them, and did not announce the reasons for its denial of the defendant\u2019s motion beyond the short assertion that the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201chasn\u2019t done anything to not represent you,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 624, 870 A.2d at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">From this principle, it follows that trial courts abuse their discretion when they fail to allow a defendant any opportunity to explain his or her request at all, thus making it impossible to consider the six factors in <em>Brown. </em>In that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>we found that the trial court abused its discretion under just such circumstances. After the close of the State\u2019s case, Brown\u2019s lawyer told the court that Brown wished to dismiss him. <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 429, 676 A.2d at 526. The court asked the lawyer the reasons for the request, to which the lawyer responded \u201cI guess on the advice of his father [who had spoken to him in court that day].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court replied, \u201cWe are in the middle of trial. We will proceed. Go ahead.... You are still counsel....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429-30, 676 A.2d at 526. We held that the court abused its discretion because its inquiry was \u201csuperficial\u201d and did not adequately provide the defendant an opportunity to explain completely his request. <em>Id. </em>at 431, 676 A.2d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In the present case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by handling Hardy\u2019s request to discharge his counsel as it did. Hardy\u2019s main contention is that the judge never asked him directly for an explanation of the reasons underlying his desire to discharge his attorney. Hardy, however, explained those reasons anyway, albeit on his initiative. While <em>Brown </em>states that the court must \u201cconduct an inquiry\u201d into requests like Hardy\u2019s, <em>id. </em>at 428, 676 A.2d at 525, we have held\u2014in <em>Brown </em>itself and elsewhere\u2014that the only burden this places on the court is the duty to <em>provide an opportunity </em>for the defendant to give an explanation. The trial court here carried that burden. It did not order Hardy to silence when he began to give the reasons for his request; rather, it allowed Hardy to explain, as fully as he chose, those reasons before continuing with the trial. That the court did not ask a question that led to this explanation is inconsequential on this record. The purpose of the requirement that the court inquire into the reasons for a request to discharge defense counsel is to elicit precisely the kind of response that Hardy gave here voluntarily. That response having been given as fully as Hardy desired and voluntarily, the trial judge in this case fulfilled his duty to provide Hardy the opportunity to explain his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>As the court did not foreclose Hardy\u2019s opportunity to explain his request to discharge counsel, it committed no reversible error. Although earlier in the proceedings it appeared as though the judge might foreclose such contentions without any consideration whatsoever, the court allowed Hardy to explain his request without interruption. The court, in fact, asked more questions of Hardy and of his counsel to clarify Hardy\u2019s explanation than did the court in <em>Campbell. </em>Unlike the court in <em>Brown, </em>the judge here allowed Hardy to explain his motion without interruption, after which it considered the motion briefly and discussed with Hardy the dangers of proceeding as a self-represented defendant, at which point Hardy (presumably appreciating the wisdom of proceeding with counsel) abandoned his request. Because the court provided Hardy with sufficient opportunity to explain himself, it did not abuse its discretion in addressing Hardy\u2019s motion to dismiss his trial counsel as it did.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which granted Hardy a new trial. Because the intermediate appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>did not address Hardy\u2019s three other claims of trial error, it must, on remand, consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\">.

The court also suggested that the critical factor in determining the point during trial at which the die is cast and a defendant\u2019s right to represent himself or herself should be curtailed is whether there is \" 'danger of disrupting proceedings already in progress\u2019 \u201d at that point. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States ex rel. Maldonado v. Denno, </em>348 F.2d 12, 16 (2d Cir.1965)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\">. The law on this issue among other jurisdictions facing the same or similar issue is in conflict. The State cites a number of federal and state cases in support of the proposition that meaningful trial proceedings begin with the process of selecting a jury. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Walker, </em>142 F.3d 103, 108-09 (2d Cir.1998) (holding meaningful trial proceedings had commenced when a request to discharge counsel was raised after 19 days of voir dire); <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>605 F.2d 1321, 1325 (4th Cir.1979) (noting meaningful trial proceedings had \"consumed one day during which counsel had conducted their voir dire examination\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. El, </em>602 Pa. 126, 977 A.2d 1158, 1163 (2009) (stating that \"proceedings become 'meaningful' as soon as the selection of jurors begins\u201d); <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 727, 644 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2007) (suggesting the typical beginning of meaningful trial proceedings is the beginning of voir dire or the introduction of the courtroom participants before the venire). Hardy, meanwhile, cites an equally formidable list of cases that hold that meaningful trial proceedings begin only after a jury is selected and sworn. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bishop, </em>291 F.3d 1100, 1114 (9th Cir.2002) (holding requests to proceed pro se timely if raised before the jury is selected or empaneled); <em>Chapman, </em>553 F.2d at 887 (holding that a jury must be selected before meaningful trial proceedings begin); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>Applegate v.

Lamar, </em>205 Ariz. 431, 72 P.3d 831, 836 (2003) (finding meaningful trial proceedings begin when the jury is empaneled).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\">. We agree with the State\u2019s suggestion that it is the defendant\u2019s duty to explain fully the reasons for the request after this opportunity has been provided, rather than there being a continuing burden on the trial judge to probe the defendant with questions until the defendant has given a fuller answer. Not only would it be difficult to determine the precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>point at which this proposed mandatory line of questioning should cease, but there is no reason that a defendant with valid cause for dismissing his or her attorney should not be forthcoming with all of his or her reasons for requesting that dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b669-5\">. Hardy contends also that the trial court should have conducted further inquiry into the question of how much time he and defense counsel spent together in preparation for the trial, and of whether that amount of time (in view of the significance and number of charges facing Hardy) was so limited as to render ineffective defense counsel\u2019s assistance to Hardy. In effect, Hardy asks us to mandate that trial courts conduct a sort of \u201ctrial within a trial\u201d if defendants raise claims regarding the alleged ineffective assistance of defense counsel during trial proceedings. We decline to impose any such requirement. To compel these subordinate proceedings during trial would present an undue burden on the court, a certain disruption to the trial process, and a procedural quirk ripe for abuse by defendants seeking to introduce error or delay the conduct of their trials. Moreover, such a requirement would contradict directly our frequently repeated rule \u201cthat a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel generally should be raised in a post-conviction proceeding,\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>394 Md. 184, 199, 905 A.2d 315, 324 (2006), where evidence concerning the effectiveness of counsel's representation is likely to be clearer. Hardy may have grounds to bring a post-conviction action under Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 7-102(a)(4), but he is not entitled to a new trial simply because the court did not consider in greater depth his incipient claim that he was not represented effectively by his defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\">BELL, C.J., GREENE and ADKINS, JJ., Concur and Dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">BELL, C.J., which GREENE, J. joins and ADKINS, J. joins in Part III.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">This case requires this Court to determine when \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings,\u201d as defined and discussed in <em>State v.

In particular, the question is whether \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d begin before the actual trial starts, with or at least during <em>voir dire, </em>before the jury has been empaneled and sworn. The applicability of Maryland Rule 4-215 (2005)\u2014 Waiver of counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014and the need strictly to comply with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>prescription is dependent on the answer to this inquiry. If the <em>voir dire </em>stage of trial is the beginning of \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings,\u201d whether the trial court abused its discretion in responding to a defendant\u2019s communication to the court of his intention to \u201cchang[e] [his] attorney\u201d is the relevant inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the defendant, Wilbert Hardy, voiced his displeasure with counsel, near the beginning of the <em>voir dire </em>process, after only four or five questions had been asked. His basis for displeasure was two-fold. First, he did not feel that his attorney had adequately prepared for his case, or had adequate time to do so. According to the defendant, during the year that counsel had been representing him, she had only spent fifteen minutes speaking to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the defendant felt that his attorney did not \u201cbelieve in [him].\u201d This was prompted by the defendant\u2019s perception that his attorney was continuously advising that, as he put it, he \u201ctake time for something [he] didn\u2019t do.\u201d This resulted in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: See, sir, what you\u2019re saying is basically you\u2019re upset because you believe that her suggestion to you that you take time on this case she\u2019s trying to throw you.

But even if, Rule 4-215 does not apply once <em>voir dire </em>has begun, it is my position that the trial judge here, instead of focusing on the concerns the defendant raised, <em>i.e. </em>whether there was good cause to warrant discharge of his counsel, pursued his own agenda. Essentially rejecting out of hand the complaints the defendant expressed, the trial judge set about to convince the defendant of the competence of his counsel, indeed vouching for her competence and justifying her actions, with the apparent goal, and seemingly the result, of convincing the defendant to keep her as his counsel. In so doing, the trial court stepped outside its role as a neutral arbiter and abused its judicial discretion. Therefore, either way this case is addressed, the trial judge acted improperly.

As a marker for timeliness, as it pertains to Rule 4-215, the <em>Brown </em>Court, drawing from <em>Chapman v.

Nevertheless, it significantly erodes the meaning of that phrase by specifically defining the beginning of <em>voir dire </em>as constituting \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">II. <em>Voir dire is not \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">As the majority acknowledges, if not expressly, implicitly, <em>Brown </em>controls the resolution of this case. There, before the State \u201ccompleted the direct examination of the first witness,\u201d the defendant\u2019s counsel advised the court that his client, Brown, wanted to discharge him, <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 410, 676 A.2d at 516, apparently because Brown\u2019s father felt that his son\u2019s counsel was \u201cunfamiliar with the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial judge immediately denied the request, stating, \u201c[w]e are in the middle of the trial. We will proceed. Go ahead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429, 676 A.2d at 526. This Court granted certiorari to review whether Rule 4-215 applied \u201cto decisions to dismiss counsel made after the trial has begun,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 409, 676 A.2d at 516, and, if it did not, the standard to apply when discharge of counsel is sought after the Rule ceased to have effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The Court held, first, that \u201cthe Rule does not apply after trial proceedings have commenced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It reasoned: the application of Rule 4-215 must be limited in order to \u201cprevent undue interference with the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 676 A.2d at 518. Thus, we opined that courts cannot entertain \u201c \u2018eleventh hour\u2019 requests to discharge counsel as a tactic to delay the proceedings or to confuse the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414-15, 676 A.2d at 518. That would be a likely effect or consequence were Rule 4-215 to \u201cappl[y] throughout the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>trial[;] it would require the court to permit dismissal of counsel\u201d as long as the defendant had a meritorious reason for doing so. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 676 A.2d at 525. This would \u201cincrease the risk of disruption and jury confusion, consequently increasing the risk of mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Brown </em>Court\u2019s reasoning made clear that it wanted to avoid the \u201cunnecessary and cumbersome procedural obstacles\u201d that exercising this Rule \u201cthroughout trial\u201d would create. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 676 A.2d at 524-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The majority holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">\u201cTo avoid the dangers of confusion to the jury and disruption of trial proceedings that <em>Brown </em>counsels against, and in accordance with the plain meaning of the words of the applicable rule, we hold that \u2018meaningful trial proceedings\u2019 have begun after a trial court has begun the voir dire process in a criminal trial. As such, Rule 4-215(e) does not apply literally here to the court\u2019s consideration of Hardy\u2019s motion to dismiss his trial counsel, which was brought after several voir dire questions had been asked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Maj. op. at 628, 4 A.3d at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">While noting that \u201cno controlling precedent dictates directly [its holding] result,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 626, 4 A.3d at 916, its reasoning and both of the \u201cconsiderations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 627-28, 4 A.3d at 916-17, emphasized by the majority to support its holding, depend upon this Court\u2019s analysis, and holding, in <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 676 A.2d 513 (1996). The majority\u2019s analysis of the issue and the path it forges to a conclusion are instructive in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The majority states that: \u201c[t]wo considerations inform [its] conclusion.\u201d Maj. op. at 627, 4 A.3d at 916. Initially, it considers the \u201cplain meaning of the phrase,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings,\u201d and opines that because, \u201c[t]here can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>trial without a trier of fact, and there can be no trier of fact in a jury trial without the jury selection\u201d it is \u201ca necessary step in any jury trial, and, therefore, with the beginning of voir dire, meaningful trial proceedings must have begun.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The majority then turns to what it calls, \u201cthe functional definition of the phrase,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 627, 4 A.3d at 917, invoking what it sees will be a chaotic result if Md. Rule 4-215 is applied during <em>voir dire. </em>The majority notes, in that regard, that <em>Brown </em>concluded that the application of Rule 4-215(e) was limited to avoid confusing the prospective jurors, to decrease the \u201crisk of disruption to the trial proceedings in [the] courtroom, to the court\u2019s jury assignment system ... and to the court\u2019s administration as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the majority asserts that the \u201cjurors simply may become confused by seeing the defendant appear with an attorney one moment and without one the next\u201d and that the \u201ctrial strategy\u201d may change, leaving the jurors again in a state of bewilderment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The concerns anticipated and addressed by the <em>Brown </em>Court are not present here. First, <em>Brown </em>directly contradicts the majority-it was beyond pre-trial; the trial, itself, had begun. The majority\u2019s contentions to the contrary notwithstanding, \u201cthe concerns against which <em>Brown </em>warns,\u201d id.,\u2014 juror confusion and undue interference with trial-simply are not present in this case. Notably, <em>voir dire </em>does not take place \u201cthroughout trial.\u201d It is a pre-trial proceeding. A request during <em>voir dire </em>does not raise Brown-like concerns about juror confusion or an \u201celeventh hour\u201d delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Second, and in any event, I do not accept as accurate the majority\u2019s depiction of a perplexed, easily confused jury. <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 627, 4 A.3d at 917 (\u201cFor example, jurors simply may become confused by seeing the defendant appear with an attorney one moment and without one the next, or, because defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy may affect the questions and challenges posed during voir dire, jurors may be confused when a defendant\u2019s motion to discharge counsel is granted and defendant embarks on abrupt and apparent change to that strategy.\u201d). From the outset, a very basic point must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>made: in order to confuse the jury, there must be a jury. During <em>voir dire, </em>there are only venirepersons, prospective members of the jury; the panel has not yet been whittled down to form the petit jury. It follows, therefore, that, for purposes of discharging counsel, <em>voir dire </em>is not a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding;\u201d while it is critical that the jury not be tainted before it begins to hear a case, <em>see Waters v. State, </em>51 Md. 430, 436 (1879) (\u201cIt is a fundamental principle underlying the trial by jury, that each juror shall so far as it is possible be entirely impartial and unbiased, in order that he may hear the evidence, and decide the matter in controversy uninfluenced by any extraneous considerations whatever. We say, so far as it is possible, for after all, it may not be practicable even by the most rigid rules of exclusion to secure that impartiality which the law in the abstract contemplates\u201d), whether it will be tainted by discharge of counsel is a matter that <em>voir dire </em>will, or could, address. A defendant\u2019s access to effective counsel should not depend on, or take a backseat to, the potential\u2014we have no idea whether, in fact, it will ever become reality\u2014confusion of venirepersons, who may never hear his or her case, or any case, for that matter. <em>Brown </em>mentions only \u201cjury confusion.\u201d Its silence on how discharge of counsel might affect venirepersons speaks volumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Third, as the majority notes, the <em>Brown </em>Court focused on avoiding \u201cundue interference\u201d and tactics to delay trial. <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 412, 676 A.2d at 517; Maj. op. at 625-26, 4 A.3d at 916; <em>see also Sutton v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 412, 435, 776 A.2d 47, 60-61 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>366 Md. 249, 783 A.2d 223 (2001) (\u201cA thorough reading of <em>Brown </em>establishes that the Court was concerned with the possibility of a defendant requesting a discharge of his counsel for no good reason other than for purposes of causing delay and confusion. This could be initiated by a desperate defendant in a last-minute effort to cause delays when he realizes his trial is not going his way. It is precisely this type of bad-faith legal maneuvering, when clearly not based on merit, that ye aim to avoid.\u201d). This is key. It is the bad faith on the part of the defendant, and an intent to abuse the right to substitute counsel or to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number><em>pro se, </em>that is the concern to be addressed. There is no evidence, and the majority provides none, to suggest that the defendant intended, in the slightest, to delay the proceedings or that his request was a tactical means to thwart the progress of trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Dismissing, or allowing the defendant to substitute, counsel for a meritorious reason does not cause undue delay. If the dismissal is meritorious, the delay is due because it is justified. To be sure, discharging or allowing the defendant to substitute counsel or allowing the defendant to proceed <em>pro se </em>could delay trial. The delay is undue only if there is no basis for the discharge request, only if it is unwarranted. If the discharge request is a tactic used to delay trial, then it is properly characterized as such and properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Furthermore, the test the majority adopts to define \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings,\u201d \u201ca necessary step [of] jury trial,\u201d is not helpful. All aspects of trial are necessary for the trial to occur. For instance, if the trial was never placed on the calendar, then \u201cthere can be no trier of fact\u201d and, indeed, no trial. Therefore, taken to its logical conclusion, under the majority\u2019s logic, because scheduling the trial is also a \u201cnecessary step in any jury trial,\u201d it, too, should be considered an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>example of a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding;\u201d under that logic, one would expect every facet of the trial process to be a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding.\u201d Of course, our case law makes clear that the pre-trial stage of trial is not a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding.\u201d <em>See e.g. Fowlkes v. State, </em>311 Md. 586, 591, 536 A.2d 1149, 1152 (1988) (The Court properly applied Rule 4-215, after the defendant expressed, before <em>voir dire, </em>he wanted to \u201cget [a] new attorney.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">As for the \u201cfunctional definition,\u201d Maj. op. at 627, 4 A.3d at 917, adopted by the majority, the decision and analysis in <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>553 F.2d 886 (5th Cir.1977), are instructive. It is the <em>Chapman </em>court, from which the <em>Brown </em>Court adopted the \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d standard. <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 423, 676 A.2d at 522 (\u201cWe agree with the view expressed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>553 F.2d 886 (5th Cir.1977).... Thus we believe the better approach is to assess whether \u2018meaningful trial proceedings have commenced,\u2019 rather than adopting an inflexible rule of <em>per se </em>untimeliness.\u201d). Review of <em>Chapman </em>makes clear that the <em>Brown </em>Court did not intend the <em>voir dire </em>stage of trial to be a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding.\u201d In <em>Chapman, </em>the defendant asked to represent himself, \u201cafter his court appointed attorney [ ] announced [he was] \u2018ready for trial,\u2019 but before the jury [had] been empaneled.\u201d 553 F.2d at 887. The court held that \u201ca demand for self-representation must be honored as timely if made before the jury is selected, absent an affirmative showing that it was a tactic to secure delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This holding, it opined, was \u201csupported\u201d by the Ninth, Second, and District of Columbia Circuits, which also held that the request is \u201ctimely if asserted before the jury is empaneled.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>553 F.2d at 894; <em>see United States v. Price, </em>474 F.2d 1223, 1227 (9th Cir.1973); <em>United States ex rel. Maldonado v. Denno, </em>348 F.2d 12, 16 (2d Cir.1965) (footnote omitted) (\u201cWe hold that if [the defendants] clearly sought to represent themselves, after their cases had been called on the calendar but before the jury had been chosen, they had an unqualified right to have their requests granted. At this stage there was no danger of disrupting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>proceedings already in progress\u201d); <em>Untied States v. Dougherty, </em>473 F.2d 1113, 1119, 1124 (D.C.Cir.1972). Beyond support in other jurisdictions, the <em>Chapman </em>court acknowledged that its holding was grounded on the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ast\">\u201c[i]f there is to be a Rubicon beyond which the defendant has lost his unqualified right to defend pro se, it makes far better sense to locate it at the beginning of defendant\u2019s trial, <em>when the jury is empaneled and sworn, </em>than when defense counsel announces \u2018ready.\u2019 First, the declaration \u2018ready5 at a calendar call bears no functional relation to the pro se right or to the actual beginning of trial; there may be many cases on a court\u2019s docket, and delays as long as the eleven days in this case between \u2018ready\u2019 and trial are not uncommon. Second, a defendant may not appear at calendar call, and his first opportunity directly to address the court regarding his counsel may be the day of his trial. Third, the defendant may acquire disconcerting information about the substance or manner of his counsel\u2019s planned defense only once his counsel begins the voir dire. Fourth, the expense of any delay rises dramatically once the jury is empaneled. Finally, a mid-trial change to a pro se defense may be thought to disrupt the continuity of ongoing proceedings, a danger not present when the defendant asserts his right to defend himself before the jury is sworn. \u201cWhatever significance ought to be placed on empaneling the jury, it would be particularly unfair to ascribe any significance to the declaration of \u2018ready\u2019 under the circumstances of the case at bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">553 F.2d at 894-95 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Like declaring \u201cready,\u201d the moment <em>voir dire </em>begins \u201cbears no functional relation to the pro se right or to the actual beginning of trial.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>To be sure, <em>Chapman </em>was concerned with <em>pro se </em>representation. Its analysis of that issue, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>er, applies as well to the discharge of counsel in favor of a new attorney. Indeed, the reasons announced by the court as militating in favor of permitting <em>pro se </em>representation after counsel has indicated his readiness for trial, but before the jury has been empaneled and sworn, apply as much to the situation where there is a meritorious reason for discharge and substitution of counsel. Moreover, before the jury is empaneled and sworn a number of changes will occur. For example, and most important, many of the venirepersons will not become members of the petit jury. During the course of <em>voir dire, </em>and for various reasons, they will be stricken and removed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">What is also clear from both the <em>Brown </em>and <em>Chapman </em>courts, and overlooked by the majority, is that <em>Brown </em>dealt with a situation that occurred after the actual start of trial and, in the case of <em>Chapman, </em>the court indicated that a motion to discharge counsel was timely until after jury selection had concluded. Nevertheless, in neither case did the court intend to establish a precise moment in time when \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d would begin. The <em>Brown </em>Court invoked the \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d standard in an effort not to \u201cadopt[ ] an inflexible rule of <em>per se </em>untimeliness.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 423, 676 A.2d at 522. The <em>Chapman </em>court, some years before, had opined that \u201cwe have not entered the age of stop-watch jurisprudence.\u201d 553 F.2d at 895. The majority acknowledges that this Court has declined to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>\u201cprecise moment that marks the <em>beginning of </em>\u2018meaningful trial proceedings\u2019\u201d yet, in its analysis and holding, the majority effectively does just that, it demarcates the beginning of <em>voir dire </em>as \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625, 4 A.3d at 915 (\u201c[W]e hold th[e] \u2018meaningful trial proceedings\u2019 have begun after a trial court has begun the voir dire process in a criminal trial.\u201d). Neither justifies the result, and, more important, <em>Brown </em>and the facts belie it.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Logically, \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings,\u201d in the discharge of counsel context, presupposes that trial proceedings have actually begun, but allows for a situation where trial has not begun in such a significant way or to the point where the sides are irretrievably fixed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If a fixed point must be identified, when the jury is empaneled and sworn would be that point. This is after all, the point identified by <em>Chapman, </em>on which <em>Brown </em>relied, and, in a criminal jury trial, when double jeopardy attaches. <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 467, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 1072, 35 L.Ed.2d 425, 433 (1973); <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 479, 91 S.Ct. 547, 554, 27 L.Ed.2d 543, 553 (1971) (\u201cThese considerations have led this Court to conclude that a defendant is placed in jeopardy in a criminal proceeding once the defendant is put to trial before the trier of the facts, whether the trier be a jury or a judge\u201d); <em>Hubbard v. State, </em>395 Md. 73, 90, 909 A.2d 270, 279-80 (2006); <em>State v. Woodson, </em>338 Md. 322, 329, 658 A.2d 272, 276 (1995).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consistency, I believe, is important. Moreover, this point makes more sense than arbitrarily selecting the beginning of <em>voir dire, </em>when trial is but the goal, not a certainty, and, even when it occurs, not all of the venirepersons will remain participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The majority is correct: <em>Brown </em>is the point of reference for determining when in trial proceedings \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d begin. The majority is wrong, however, in its application of <em>Brown. </em>The concerns on which <em>Brown </em>was focused are not presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">III. <em>The trial judge abused his discretion, even if voir dire is a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Even if the majority\u2019s premise that <em>voir dire </em>is the start of \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d were correct, I believe that reversal of the trial court judgment nevertheless is required. It is true that, once the trial judge determines that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun, Md. Rule 4-215 need not be complied with strictly. <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 426, 676 A.2d at 524. In that event, it is the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in addressing the defendant\u2019s request to discharge counsel that is the focus. In that sense, however, the defendant\u2019s right to change counsel still exists, but is subject to a different test. This only means, as <em>Brown </em>makes clear, that the trial judge\u2019s obligations and duties with regard to such requests are not defined by rule. That they exist and must be discharged can not be denied. The difference is that the question whether they have been discharged is judged by whether there has been compliance with the constitutional standard. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461, 1466 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">In <em>Brown, </em>this Court held that, although strict compliance with Md. Rule 4-215 is not necessary once \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d are underway, the trial court\u2019s discretion is not \u201climitless.\u201d 342 Md. at 428, 676 A.2d at 525. It pointed out, in that regard, that the \u201ccourt must conduct an inquiry to assess whether the defendant\u2019s reason for dismissal of counsel justifies any resulting disruption. This inquiry must meet constitutional standards.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 428, 676 A.2d at 525 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>304 U.S. at 464-65, 58 S.Ct. at 1023, 82 L.Ed. at 1466). Then, acknowledging \u201cthat there is little to guide the trial judge in the exercise of this discretion,\u201d we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\u201cin future proceedings, we suggest that the trial judge consider the following factors in deciding whether to permit discharge of counsel during trial: (1) the merit of the reason for discharge; (2) the quality of counsel\u2019s representation prior to the request; (3) the disruptive effect, if any, that discharge would have on the proceedings; (4) the timing of the request; (5) the complexity and stage of the proceedings; and (6) any prior requests by the defendant to discharge counsel. <em>See Sapienza v. Vincent, </em>534 F.2d 1007, 1010 (2d Cir.1976); <em>People v. Cummings, 4 </em>Cal.4th 1233, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1, 57 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>[511] U.S. [1046], 114 S.Ct. 1576, 128 L.Ed.2d 219 (1994); <em>People v.

Generally, the longer the defendant waits to request discharge of counsel, the stronger the rationale must be to warrant counsel\u2019s dismissal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 428-29, 676 A.2d at 525; <em>see also Campbell, </em>385 Md. at 632-33, 870 A.2d at 226 (\u201cIn the exercise of discretion, the judge is required to \u2018conduct an inquiry to assess whether the defendant\u2019s reason for dismissal of counsel justifies any resulting disruption,\u2019 <em>[Brown, </em>342 Md.] at 428, 676 A.2d at 525, through consideration of the ... factors.\u201d). The Court made clear that \u201calthough the trial judge need not engage in a full-scale inquiry pursuant to Rule 4-215, the judge must at least consider the defendant\u2019s reason for requesting dismissal before rendering a decision.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 431, 676 A.2d at 526; <em>see also Campbell, </em>385 Md. at 636, 870 A.2d at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The majority\u2019s take on this issue is particularly disturbing, especially its all but dispositive emphasis on the defendant\u2019s ability and opportunity to state the reasons for desiring discharge and the trial court\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion,\u201d Maj. op. at 628, 4 A.3d at 917, which, under the majority\u2019s formulation, is essentially unreviewable. <em>Id. </em>According to the majority, the \u201ccourt\u2019s burden,\u201d once the defendant expresses dissatisfaction with counsel, is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">\u201cto provide the defendant the opportunity to explain his or her reasons for making the request; in other words, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>court need not do any more than supply the forum in which the defendant may tender this explanation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Once the forum has been provided\u2014and, presumably, the explanation given\u2014it asserts, the \u201crequest is left almost entirely to the court\u2019s \u2018sound discretion.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 629, 4 A.3d at 918 (quoting <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 426, 676 A.2d at 524). To be sure, the majority acknowledges that this Court, in <em>Brown, </em>formulated factors to be used by future courts faced with a discharge issue that has arisen after \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun as a guide for deciding those issues and, indeed, recognizes what we said on the subject, that the \u201ccourt should consider [the] six <em>[Brown </em>] factors in exercising its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>discretion.\u201d Maj. op. at 629, 4 A.3d at 918. Contradictorily, however, it holds that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">\u201ctrial courts abuse their discretion when they fail to allow a defendant any opportunity to explain his or her request at all, thus making it impossible to consider the six factors in <em>Brown.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 629-30, 4 A.3d at 918. Interestingly, it states that these factors \u201cmay be considered in a brief exchange between the court and the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 629, 4 A.3d at 918; significantly, the majority does not, because it cannot, say that the trial court considered those factors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To it, it is sufficient that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>there was an opportunity, however brief, in which they could have been considered and, of course, that the defendant was permitted to explain the basis of his dissatisfaction. In short, the majority holds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the defendant was able to explain his reasons and was not \u201corder[ed] to silence ... before continuing with the trial,\u201d Maj. op. at 630, 4 A.3d at 918-19, thus fulfilling its duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">This is not, and cannot be, the standard. First, it does not comply with our decision in <em>Brown </em>and the requirements it imposed. As we have seen, the Court formulated and set out factors to guide trial courts in their decision-making when faced with late discharge of counsel requests. One of these factors is \u201cthe merit of the reason for discharge.\u201d Why else would factors be formulated and offered for guidance if they were not expected or intended to be used? In addition, we indicated clearly that the exercise of discretion was not \u201climitless\u201d\u2014another reason for factors to guide its exercise. Finally, we indicated, again clearly, that review of the exercise of discretion should be possible. <em>See Brown, </em>342 Md. at 428, 431, 676 A.2d at 525, 526. The majority simply ignores these <em>Brown </em>teachings.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The holding in this case simply does not make sense and it does nothing to protect or facilitate a defendant\u2019s right to effective counsel or to proceed <em>pro se. </em>All it does is permit the court passively to listen to a defendant\u2019s complaint or request without any obligation to consider or address it or its ramifications. This holding effectively instructs the trial courts simply to \u201cprovide a forum\u201d where a defendant may vent, just to allow him or her to explain his or her dissatisfaction with counsel, and nothing more. Other than providing a forum, nothing more is required of the court; it need not, as the trial court did not do in this case, consider the <em>Brown </em>factors or respond in any way to the reasons offered or the complaints made by the defendant. Indeed, all this holding encourages is inaction, not the exercise of discretion. In fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>what the trial court did in this case was the very antithesis of exercising discretion on a request to discharge counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In addition, the majority would subjugate a defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel and, therefore, a fair trial, clearly substantive matters, to judicial convenience and to when a complaint about counsel is made, purely procedural or matters of form. But the right to a fair trial, even when the issue at the center of the controversy is whether counsel is effective, is not subject to curtailment because of timing or judicial convenience. Whenever that issue is properly and timely presented and whenever it is a viable question, a court must address it. <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 431, 676 A.2d at 526. I agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201csuperficial inquiries],\u201d <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 429, 676 A.2d at 525, will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Similar to <em>Brown, </em>the trial judge \u201cdid not determine whether defendant was attempting to assert his right to proceed pro se or asking the court to appoint substitute <em>counsel.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> Brown, </em>342 Md. at 430, 676 A.2d at 526. That Court made clear that the trial court must afford the defendant \u201can opportunity to explain the reasons for his request,\u201d <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 430, 676 A.2d at 526, and more important, rather than implicitly, expressly requiring that the request be considered, and, in context, resolved. <em>Id. </em>at 431, 676 A.2d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">At first glance, <em>Brown </em>may seem more egregious than the case <em>sub judice, </em>because, in <em>Brown, </em>the court did not give the defendant the opportunity to address the court. The situation <em>sub judice </em>is, however, I submit, no less egregious. The inquiry conducted in this case was entirely and especially meaningless. To be meaningful, an inquiry must be more than an academic exercise, it must accomplish more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>provide a rationale to excuse a trial court\u2019s actions or inaction. Instead, it must be such as to recognize and vindicate the serious impact that the subject of the inquiry has on the defendant\u2019s right to counsel and to proceed <em>pro se. See generally Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 833, 95 S.Ct. at 2540, 45 L.Ed.2d at 580 (\u201c[I]t is one thing to hold that every defendant, rich or poor, has the right to the assistance of counsel, and quite another to say that a State may compel a defendant to accept a lawyer he does not want. The value of state-appointed counsel was not unappreciated by the Founders, yet the notion of compulsory counsel was utterly foreign to them.\u201d). Therefore, matters affecting a defendant\u2019s liberty cannot be taken lightly. <em>See generally Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 821, 95 S.Ct. at 2534, 45 L.Ed.2d at 573-74 (\u201cAn unwanted counsel \u2018represents\u2019 the defendant only through a tenuous and unacceptable legal fiction. Unless the accused has acquiesced in such representation, the defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for, in a very real sense, it is not his defense.\u201d). Thus, a trial court\u2019s inquiry in response to a request to discharge can not be a \u201csuperficial inquiry.\u201d Here, to the extent the trial court inquired at all, it was superficial\u2014he made no real attempt to determine the merits of the defendant\u2019s complaints. He was too busy trying to persuade the defendant to keep counsel, and that his reasons for dissatisfaction were not valid ones against a good attorney working in his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><em>Campbell </em>is instructive. There, after the State presented its case-in-chief, the defendant, requested new counsel. 385 Md. at 623-24, 870 A.2d at 221. The trial court denied that request, but only after \u201c[bjalancing the <em>Brown </em>factors against the countervailing considerations of permitting Campbell to discharge counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635, 870 A.2d at 228. This Court held that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d had begun, therefore precluding the need for strict compliance with Rule 4-215. <em>Id. </em>at 634, 870 A.2d at 227. Nevertheless, we recognized that more was required of the trial judge than a simple recognition that Rule 4-215 does not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 632-33, 870 A.2d at 226. Accordingly, in affirming that ruling by the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>we noted how it appropriately had addressed and balanced each of the <em>Brown </em>factors and the impact discharge of counsel would have had on the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 635-36, 870 A.2d at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Here, the majority, like the trial court, failed to apply the <em>Brown </em>factors. The defendant advised the trial court that he was \u201cthinking about changing [his] attorney or something,\u201d proffering two bases for that \u201cthinking.\u201d To the first, that his attorney was unprepared, having spent a very limited amount of time consulting with him about the case, the trial judge expressed disbelief and then, when counsel\u2019s rebuttal did not substantially dispute the defendant\u2019s account, failed to follow up. To the second, the defendant\u2019s belief that counsel did not believe in him and, thus, was urging him to \u201ctake time\u201d for a crime he did not commit, the court rationalized counsel\u2019s actions in urging the plea, stating that she has \u201cgot to ... ethically\u201d ask him to \u201ctake time\u201d for an act the defendant persisted in insisting he did not do. It also vouched for defense counsel\u2019s competence, telling the defendant: \u201cShe\u2019s a good lawyer.... She\u2019s going to work hard for you.... She\u2019s only doing what anybody else does.\u201d This vouching survived <em>voir dire, </em>when the trial court added \u201c[t]o be quite honest ... she\u2019s only giving her ... opinion based on what she has seen me do to people involved in violent offenses with any record. She\u2019s just giving you her ... honest opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> By contrast, the record reflects no comparable attention paid to the factors this Court indicated should be considered. As noted already, the court did not follow up to determine the merits of the defendant\u2019s complaints, nor did it put the request into a time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>sequence. A fair reading of this record is that the court wanted very much to continue with the trial and that it was more concerned with that than with constitutional niceties. In so proceeding and by disregarding, in effect, if not intentionally, <em>Brown, </em>the court erred. The Court of Special Appeals got it right. I would affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Judge GREENE joins the views herein expressed and Judge ADKINS joins Part III of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\">.

As </em>I show, <em>infra, </em>it is not for the defendant\u2019s purpose, to get, as the majority characterizes it, \"a fuller answer,\u201d that the trial court was required to inquire further into the matter of counsel\u2019s preparation, it was, rather, to fulfill its obligation to consider, and, I submit, resolve, whether the defendant's complaint in that regard had merit. <em>See Brown, </em>342 Md. at 431, 676 A.2d at 526 (\"The onus, however, is not on Respondent to interrupt a discussion between the court and his attorney to offer an explanation, but rather the responsibility is on the trial judge to ensure that the reason for requesting dismissal of counsel is explained.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\">. The majority cites, for support, <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. at 426, 676 A.2d at 524. While <em>Brown </em>does stand for this general proposition, this Court later made clear that reviewability of the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion was not simply desirable, but required. Thus, when we addressed the merits of the case under review, we made clear that the court's discretion is not without limit, that the court must conduct an inquiry to determine the merits of the defendant\u2019s request, <em>id. </em>at 428, 676 A.2d at 525, and that, \"although the trial court need not state all its reasons for denying defendant's request to discharge counsel, the better practice is for the trial court to provide a sufficient rationale for its denial of substitution or pro se defense on the record to facilitate appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430 n. 13, 676 A.2d at 526 n. 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b689-6\">. It is clear that the trial court did not consider the <em>Brown </em>factors. The first of them required the trial court to address whether there was merit in the request or complaint. That could only be done by inquiring further when there is or likely will be a conflict on the facts surrounding the issue. To be sure the defendant stated his concern with regard to his counsel\u2019s preparation, to which counsel took some exception. The defendant also stated his concern that his counsel did not believe in him and was seeking to have him plead to an offense he did not commit. On neither occasion did the trial court consider the merits of those complaints, even when, as to the preparation issue, counsel\u2019s rebuttal did not substantially contradict the complaint. As we shall see, the court set about to do something entirely different from the brief the situation dictated, to convince the defendant to stay the course.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The defendant is correct in arguing that the trial court\u2019s inquiry was insufficient and, therefore, should have been more extensive. His point, however, is not, as the majority would have it, that the purpose of the inquiry was to buttress his complaint, rather, it was to determine whether the complaints the defendant raised had merit, something that the <em>Brown </em>court endorsed and indeed indicated should be done. <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 431, 676 A.2d at 526. Nor is the majority correct about the trial court's duty in that regard. <em>Brown </em>made clear that, although Rule 4-215 did not mandate a specific colloquy or litany, the constitutional standard required an inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 676 A.2d at 525. It is not a matter for post-conviction when the challenged action is one required to be done at the time of trial. Moreover, this simply is not a case alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. To the contrary, what is alleged is a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to have the court consider whether he could discharge counsel, which he had a perfect right to pursue, and at the very time that he raised it. Post-conviction will provide no better evidence than that available now. Besides, it is the court\u2019s compliance, or not, with the constitutional standard, as explicated by <em>Brown, </em>that has to be determined; there are no tactical issues or further facts to be developed. <em>Williams v. State, </em>394 Md. 98, 130, 904 A.2d 534, 553 (2006) (citing <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 328, 893 A.2d 1018, 1042 (2006)); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>State, </em>299 Md. 511, 517, 474 A.2d 890, 893 (1984) (citing <em>Harris v. State, </em>295 Md. 329, 337-38, 455 A.2d 979, 983 (1983)). It is, alter all, these extraneous and largely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>covert matters that drive our \"postpone for post-conviction\u201d jurisprudence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\">. Although, here it is likely that the defendant, by asking to discharge counsel, was asking to substitute his counsel, as the <em>Brown </em>Court acknowledged most denied requests for a new counsel, will result in a request to proceed <em>pro se. Brown, </em>342 Md. at 416, 676 A.2d at 519 (\"Frequently, denial of a defendant\u2019s request for substitute counsel leads to a request to defend pro se.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\">. When there is a request to discharge counsel made after \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun, the trial court is called upon to assess whether the balance of factors favor disruption of the trial. The factors do not include evaluation of the competence of counsel, although they do include the meritoriousness of the defendant\u2019s complaint. I believe that it is improper for a trial court, in this context and under the circumstances, to vouch for the defendant\u2019s counsel and his or her litigation tactics. This is especially so when one considers that the trial court could not, for a moment, know what type of client-lawyer relationship had been formed and whether counsel was giving her \"honest opinion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b694-6\">ADKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ApS\">Concurring and Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">I agree with the majority that there should be a bright-line test, and that the commencement of voir dire is the appropriate demarcation for the commencement of \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d in a jury trial. Thus, I join Part IV, A and B, of the Majority opinion. I respectfully dissent, however, from the balance of the Majority opinion for the reasons set forth in Section III of the Dissent of Chief Judge Bell, which I join. I agree with him that even without the dictates of Rule 4-215, the trial court failed to make a proper inquiry about Hardy\u2019s claim that his counsel was inadequate. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 676 A.2d 513 (1996).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
