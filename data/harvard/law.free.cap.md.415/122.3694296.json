Elm Street, </em>404 Md. 658, 948 A.2d 70 (2008). For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">The opinion of the Court of Special Appeals includes the following factual summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">The Elm Street property that is the subject of this litigation consists of 22.196 acres on Epping Forest Road near Annapolis. The property was originally part of a subdivision known as \u201cEpping Forest Section B.\u201d The plat for Epping Forest was recorded in the Anne Arundel County land records in 1926. The 1926 plat showed that the tract was at that time subdivided into approximately 500 small lots. [Today, t]he Elm Street property ... embraces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>150 of the roughly 500 lots shown on the 1926 plat. The original owners of the Epping Forest tract had been Severn Shores, Inc[.]. Seve[r]n Shores, however, defaulted on its mortgage in 1930. Except for five small lots that had been sold out of the original subdivision in 1928 and 1929, the remainder of the property was sold to six separate purchasers. The successors to two of those 1930 purchasers were 1) James L. Smith and 2) Charles A. and Renate I. Miller. Elm Street is now the owner of what had been the Smith property and the Miller property, in all[,] approximately 30% of the original Epping Forest Section B subdivision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">In the years since the 150 lots were recorded in 1926, two pertinent sets of restrictions have been imposed upon the development of the property. The first set of restrictions came in 1952 with the adoption by Anne Arundel County of its first land use regulations, including a zoning code. The Elm Street property is now zoned Rl-Residential. In an Rl-Residential District, the minimum lot size for the building of a residence is 40,000 square feet [ (approximately one acre) ]. As a straight arithmetic calculation, the Elm Street property\u2014the original 150 lots on the 1926 plat\u2014can only accommodate 12 lots of sufficient size to permit the building of a residence [in the Rl-Residential District].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">The second set of restrictions [imposed upon the development of the property] came with the enactment by the Maryland General Assembly in 1984 (by ch. 794 of the Acts of 1984) of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Protection Program. Its provisions are now codified in Maryland Code, Natural Resources Article, \u00a7\u00a7 8-1801 through 8-1817. Section 8-1808(a) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">(a) <em>Local jurisdictions to implement; </em>grants.-\u2014(1) It is the intent of this subtitle that each local jurisdiction shall have primary responsibility for developing and implementing a program, subject to review and approval by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>With respect to the Critical Area Program, we observed in <em>Becker v. Anne Arundel County, </em>174 Md.App. 114, 130, 920 A.2d 1118 (2007):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">The State Critical Area Program provides that its purpose is to establish a resource protection program for the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays and their tributaries. Maryland Code (2000 Repl.Vol. &amp; Supps. 2002-2006), \u00a7 8-1801(b)(l) of the Natural Resources Article (\u201cN.R.\u201d). <em>The program was implemented \u201con a cooperative basis between the State and affected local governments, with local governments establishing and implementing their programs </em>in a consistent and uniform manner subject to State criteria and oversight.\u201d N.R. \u00a7 8-1801 (b)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Lewis v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>377 Md. 382, 391-94, 833 A.2d 563 (2003); <em>White v. North, </em>356 Md. 31, 36-38, 736 A.2d 1072 (1999) (\u201cSection 8-1808(a)(l) requires local governments to have primary responsibility for development of programs to regulate land use in the critical area, \u2018subject to review and approval by the Commission.\u2019 \u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">By 1988, Anne Arundel County had developed its implementing program for the parts of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area lying within its boundaries with the enactment of Anne Arundel County Code (1985, as amended), Article 28, \u00a7\u00a7 1A-102 through 1A-112. The Elm Street property in this case lies within the Critical Area generally and, more specifically, within the \u201cResource Conservation Area\u201d (\u201cRCA\u201d), the most restrictive of the three land use categories in the Critical Area Program. Of particular pertinence to this case is County Code, Article 28, \u00a7 l-A-103(d)(2), which provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">[T]he maximum permitted density in a resource conservation area [RCA] is not more than one dwelling unit per 20 acres.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-9\"><em>Caldes v. Elm Street Dev., </em>No. 79, September Term, 2007, unreported opinion filed January 17, 2008, pp. 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The Board\u2019s majority opinion included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">This property comprises approximately 28 acres of land on Saltworks Creek within the R1 zone and designated as Resource Conservation Area (\u201cRCA\u201d) in the Critical Area. The Petitioner contends that there are 12 lawful building sites (and we agree) on the property and purposes to resubdivide (at a later time) the property into seven lots. This property is significantly impacted by steep slopes, Critical Area buffer and expanded buffer, none of which can be disturbed under the County\u2019s Critical Area Program, Title 1A of the Zoning Regulations. Less than four acres of the property would be disturbed under this development plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">The [Respondent] has requested a variance (BA 86-04V) to exceed the permitted maximum density (one dwelling unit/20 acres) on property within the RCA of the Critical Area (the \u201cdensity variance\u201d). The [Respondent] has also requested variances to permit the construction of dwellings, a road and associated facilities with disturbance to the expanded buffer and steep slopes and to permit forest clearing as well as a variance to extend the time (from 1 year to 3 years) to obtain permits, and (from 2 years to 6 years) to complete construction of a residential subdivision (BA 6-04V) (the \u201cinfrastructure variances\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">The [Respondent\u2019s request to reduce the number of lots on site from 12 to seven appears to follow the tongue in cheek saying, \u201cno good deed goes unpunished\u201d. This proposal has met with harsh opposition from some residents and support from Critical Area Commission and the Office of Planning and Zoning. Even amongst the supporters of the project[,] there is squabbling over whether a variance to the density criteria of Article 28, \u00a7 1A-I03(d)(2), which permits only one dwelling unit for each 20 acres of RCA property, is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">This property contains only 23 acres, all within the RCA. Therefore, only one dwelling unit would be permitted if this property had not been previously subdivided. This proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ty was originally part of the Epping Forest Subdivision plat. The current development of Epping Forest is a charming community, well known for its waterfront cottage ambiance as well as for steep slopes, small lots and narrow streets. This property, along with Epping Forest proper, is nonconforming by today\u2019s standards as it was subdivided in the 1920\u2019s\u2014long before the adoption of the first County land use regulations in 1952. Given this nonconforming scenario, this Board has heard many variance requests for development and redevelopment in this vicinity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">While it appeals to our sense of economy to dispense with this request by simply denying (as did the Administrative Hearing Officer) the request for a density variance, we feel that the variance deserves careful consideration. The [Respondent] desires to reduce the amount of density within the RCA from that permitted by required lot consolidation here. However, the [Respondent] argues that a variance is not necessary (notwithstanding the argument to the contrary, the [Respondent] has requested one). The Critical Area Commission strongly asserts that no such variance is necessary and a variance to the Critical Area criteria should be granted only when an urgent need exists. The Commission contends that the reduction in density does not require relief and the precedence of requiring such a variance should not be established. However, we are convinced from our review of the law that the density variance request should be acted upon and granted to permit seven dwellings on this 28 \u00b1 acre parcel within the RCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">Development within the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area, being that area within 1,000 feet of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, has been the subject of much legislative effort and protection by the General Assembly. Despite several court decisions that sought to lessen the power of the Critical Area Regulations, the General Assembly responded directly to these court decisions and in each case has subsequently strengthened the Critical Area Regulations. The current Critical Area variance criteria are very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>strict. The statute requires the Board to presume that the requested development activity does not conform to the general purpose and intent of the Critical Area Program. <em>See, </em>Maryland Annotated Code, Natural Resource Article, Section 8-1802(d)(2)(i). Additionally, \u201cunwarranted hardship\u201d is defined as \u201cwithout a variance, an applicant would be denied a reasonable and significant use of the <em>entire </em>parcel or lot for which the variance is requested!\u201d] A'm<em>phasis added. </em>To qualify for a variance to the Critical Area criteria, an applicant must meet each and every one of the variance provisions. <em>See, id., </em>Section 8-1808(d)(4)(ii). An applicant must also prove that if the variance were denied, the applicant would be deprived of a use or structure permitted to others in accordance with the Critical Area Program. <em>See, id., </em>Section 8\u20141808(d)(4)(iii). Given these provisions of the State criteria for the grant of a variance, the burden on an applicant seeking a variance is very high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">The State statute requires that local jurisdictions adopt a program to protect the Critical Area. Anne Arundel County\u2019s local Critical Area variance program contains 12 separate criteria. <em>See, </em>Code, Article 3, Board of appeals, Section 2-107. Each of these individual criteria must be met. If the applicant fails to meet just <em>one </em>of these 12 criteria, the variance is <em>required </em>to be denied. Securing the grant of a variance to the Critical Area criteria is not an easy trick\u2014 nor should it be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">The property that is the subject of these appeals is a parcel within the RCA of the Critical Area. This property is a waterfront site and contains steep slopes (lots of them) and forest. The applicant requests variances to increase the density within the RCA to seven total lots on this parcel and to build the road and infrastructure (stormwater management and septic systems). The steep slopes, tidal waters adjacent to the property and the required buffers thereto further impact development. Only a small amount of land along the roadway is outside the steep slopes (See, [Respondent's Exhibit 5). Any access to the \u201cdonut hole\u201d of flatter land in the center of the site would require impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>to the steep slopes. The location of the steep slopes alone would also prevent access to the \u201cSmith lots\u201d without the grant of a variance. These physical characteristics and the actions of the regulations limit the development potential of the site such that variances are required to use the 12 lawful (now seven requested) lots. Without variances, we are convinced that the property could not be developed with residences on the 12 permitted lots or on the seven proposed lots, for which the density variance is requested; and, therefore, there is no question that the [Respondent] would suffer an unwarranted hardship if some variances were not granted. <em>See, id., </em>Section 2-107(b)(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">We find that it is exactly the unique physical conditions of the site (topo, trees and tidal waters) that require a variance to the density criteria also. If the density variance is not granted, the [Respondent] can build 12 homes, but there will be a much high negative impact to the environment. This high negative impact would result in not only an unwarranted hardship to the applicant but to the public\u2019s welfare, in contravention of Section 2-107(e)(2)(iv).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">The [Respondent] has shown that the variances requested are the minimum variance necessary to afford relief to the applicant. <em>See, id., </em>Section 2-107(c)(l). In White, Belvoir Farms, et al., the Court of Appeals established that, despite a profound public interest in preserving and protecting the Chesapeake Bay, property owners would, in all cases, retain an absolute right to the \u2018reasonable and significant use of their property.[\u2019] The Court\u2019s decisions required that administrative agencies should err on the side of property owners. The decisions further examined the concept of \u2018minimum necessary\u2019 and determined that the statutory language should be considered in the context of adhering to the \u2018reasonable and significant use\u2019 standard. With this in mind we find it inconceivable that a development plan that provides for five fewer lots than otherwise permitted, one loop road (at the minimum permitted by County standards), one stormwater outfall and only <em>replacement </em>septic systems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>impacting the buffer that this is not the minimum intrusion into the Critical Area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">The [Respondent]^ request for infrastructure variances would permit the development of seven lots. To ensure that the facts considered by the Board in rendering this decision are not modified, we will impose several conditions on the [Respondent]. The Board will condition the grant of these variances on the development of no more than seven homes on this property. All impervious surfaces associated with those homes, can (and must) be located outside of the buffer and expanded buffer under this plan. This proposal is the minimum when contrasted with the \u201ccurrent\u201d 12 lot development potential. The currently available development contains lots with shapes similar to gerrymandered legislative districts, accessible only by more numerous streets that would impact more steep slopes, more forest and more land within the RCA. We fail to see how more impacts to the sensitive features of this site would be better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">The one loop road with reconfigured lots with homesites in the so-called \u201cdonut hole\u201d of the road out of the waterfront area and several waterfront lots of sufficient size to permit the residences on the flatter portions of the site and outside of the protected buffer areas is the best development plan for this property in our humble, factual analysis. We feel obligated, however, to impose several conditions to ensure that the development plan represents the minimum variances necessary. If any of our imposed conditions are violated or sought to be varied in the future, we would revoke this approval. It is with that warning that we grant these variances and impose conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">The [Respondent] appears honest and forthright and we do not mean to disparage the applicant in any way. However, to ensure that the Protestants and other area residents are not unpleasantly surprised in the future (and they certainly seem concerned that they and we will be the victims of a bait and switch scheme), we will condition the grant of the requested variances on the exact compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>with the site plan as submitted. No changes to the lot layout or infrastructure routes are permitted. If the [Respondent] cries foul at such a condition, we find that the [Respondent] should have been fully prepared to present its plan at the time of the hearing. If it now finds that its plans were inaccurate, the [Respondent] must live with any mistakes. The Board has based its factual determinations faithfully on these plans. With no permitted revisions to the lot layout and infrastructure location, the Board can rely fully on the evidence presented and no unintended (by this Board) result will occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">These variance requests are not the result of actions by the [Respondent] nor do they arise from conditions relating to land use on neighboring properties. <em>See, id., </em>Section 2-107(b)(4)(i) and (ii). The variance requests are directly related to the topographic and site conditions of this property. But for its location adjacent to the water and the steep slopes on site, this property owner would not need to seek the variances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">It is rare, in this Board\u2019s experience, that a [Respondent] comes before this body to argue for a self-imposed limitation to its existing property rights. It is rarer still that the [Respondent] seem to have arrived at this position through largely altruistic reflection. As the instant case consolidates BA 6-04V and BA 86-04V, the Board has held this case open for nearly 16 months during the evidentiary phase in order to allow both the Protestants and the [Respondent] sufficient opportunity to present their cases in main. From this voluminous evidence and during the extensive oral testimony, one undeniable impression emerged; to wit, the [Respondent] has consistently elected the least intrusive, most conservative development option available. Not only does the [Respondent\u2019s plan substantially reduce the number of lots to be developed (from 12 legal lots to seven proposed building sites) but it thoughtfully situates the development away from the most sensitive and fragile areas. Additionally, the [Respondent] has presented a series of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>commonsense conditions that further bind their future actions. While these, and other, conditions may well have been imposed by the Board regardless of the [Respondent]^ suggestion, we find it heartening and telling that the party with the greatest interest in maximizing its flexibility would voluntarily adopt such restrictions. Such good faith is unique and refreshing when encountered. Nothing in either [Respondent\u2019s or Protestants\u2019 evidence dissuades us from accepting this impression as honest and forthright. We further find that the [Respondent\u2019s variance requests now before the Board are consistent with both the [Respondent\u2019s use by right and their readily apparent desire to realize a conscientious outcome to their development intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">As stated above, the Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the Board, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AY7\">I. &amp; II.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Petitioners first argue that, as a matter of law, only one dwelling can be constructed on the property. In the words of Petitioners\u2019 brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">Lest there be any doubt regarding the supremacy of the critical area program and its density limitations, ... [Anne Arundel] County\u2019s critical area law provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">\u00a7 1A-112. Conflict with other law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">Unless pre-empted or otherwise provided by federal or State law, whenever <em>a provision of this title </em>or any element of the County critical area program <em>and any other provision of law </em>... impose contradictory requirements covering the same subject matter, the provision that is more protective of the environment or imposes higher standards of environmental protection or enhancement shall govern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">County Code, Art. 28, \u00a7 1A-112 (emphasis added). The density limitation of one dwelling per 20 acres in the State\u2019s critical area law (COMAR 27.01.02.05 C(4)) and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>County\u2019s critical area law (Art. 28, \u00a7 1A-I03(d)(2)) is clearly \u201ccontradictory\u201d to the 40,000 square foot minimum area in R1 zoning district (Art. 28, \u00a7 2-304). The former control because they are more protective of the environment and impose higher standards of environmental protection and enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">(Emphasis added in brief). The \u201cotherwise provided\u201d exception to \u00a7 1A-112 makes this statute inapplicable to the case at bar, which involves \u201cgrandfathered\u201d lots. It is clear from the legislative and regulatory history of the State and local critical area provisions that certain parcels of land within a Resource Conservation Area are exempt from the \u201cdensity provisions\u201d\u2014 but from no other provisions\u2014of the critical area laws. The legislative history includes a twenty-four page \u201cExplanation of \u2018Grandfathering\u2019 in Relation to the Proposed Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Criteria,\u201d dated October 29, 1995, prepared for the Joint Oversight Committee of the General Assembly by Assistant Attorney General Thomas A. Deming, Counsel to the Department of Natural Resources, in which Mr. Deming states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">.... The Commission\u2019s task, beyond simply acknowledging the concepts of nonconforming use and vested rights, has been to determine the extent to which property owners\u2019 pre-existing expectations can be honored without jeopardizing attainment of goals of the Critical Areas legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">The Commission was informed that a considerable amount of presently undeveloped land in the Critical Area consists of single lots or parcels, held by individuals with the expectation of eventually building homes. Additional undeveloped land in the Critical Area has been subdivided and recorded, although lots have not been sold nor buildings developed. Much of these two types of land would be classed [by the local jurisdiction] in a Resource Conservation Area, and[,] upon program approval!,] will be subject to the development limitation that residential use may not occur at a density greater than one dwelling unit per 20 acres. The Commission decided that[,] even if an individually owned, undeveloped lot or parcel in the Resource <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Conservation Area is less than 20 acres in area, the owner should be permitted to build one dwelling unit on it while complying with provisions of the criteria other than density limitations. However, land that is merely subdivided \u201con paper\u201d will be brought into conformance with all of the criteria, including the density limitation, insofar as possible. In striving for an equitable balance between reasonable private expectations and the achievement of the public goals of the law, the Commission felt that the protections that would be achieved down the line could justify this one-time departure from the policies behind the one in 20 acre density provision for single lots or parcels. However, where \u201cpaper\u201d subdivisions can be brought into conformance with the criteria, they should be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">As noted in a law review article co-authored by the Honorable Solomon Liss, the first Chair of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Areas Commission (the Commission):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">The Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Protection Program was the most controversial of the laws enacted in 1984 to address the restoration of Maryland\u2019s most significant natural resource. This legislation created a Chesapeake Bay Critical Areas Commission (Commission) and authorized the Commission to adopt regulations that establish a resource protection program for the Bay and its tributaries.... Each county, or a municipal corporation with planning and zoning powers, in which any part of the Critical Area is located, is responsible for developing and implementing a local program of resource protection in accordance with the Commission\u2019s regulations. The program of each local jurisdiction will be subject to review and approval by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">.... The most controversial aspect of the criteria is the regulation that limits development in the Resource Conservation Area, one of the three classifications for land use around the Bay, to a density of one dwelling unit per twenty acres.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Solomon Liss &amp; Lee R.

After program approval, local jurisdictions shall permit the continuation, but not necessarily the intensification or expansion, of any use in existence on the date of program approval, unless the use has been abandoned for more than 1 year or is otherwise restricted by existing local ordinances. If any existing use does not conform with the provisions of a local program, its intensification or expansion may be permitted only in accordance with the variance procedures outlined in COMAR 14.15.11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">B. Local jurisdictions shall establish grandfather provisions as part of their local Critical Area Programs. Except as otherwise provided, local jurisdictions shall permit the types of land described in the following subsections to be developed in accordance with density requirements in effect prior to the adoption of the local Critical Area Program notwithstanding the density provisions of this chapter. A local jurisdiction shall permit a single lot or parcel of land that was legally of record on the date of program approval to be developed with a single family dwelling, if a dwelling is not already placed there, notwithstanding that such development may be inconsistent with the density provisions of the approved local program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>(2) Any legal parcel of land, not being part of a recorded or approved subdivision, that was recorded as of December 1, 1985, and land that was subdivided into recorded, legally buildable lots, where the subdivision received the local jurisdiction\u2019s final approval prior to June 1, 1984, provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">(a) The local jurisdiction develops as part of its program, procedures to bring these lands into conformance with the local Critical Area Program insofar as possible, including the consolidation or reconfiguration of lots not individually owned, and these procedures are approved by the Commission, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">(b) If any such land has received a building permit subsequent to December 1, 1985 but prior to local program approval, and is located in a Resource Conservation Area, that land shall be counted by the local jurisdiction against the growth increment permitted in that area under COMAR 14.15.02.06, unless the Commission determines at the time of program approval that steps had been taken to conform the development to the criteria in this subtitle insofar as possible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">(4) Land that was subdivided into recorded, legally build-able lots, where the subdivision received the local jurisdiction\u2019s final approval after December 1,1985, provided that either development of any such land conforms to the criteria in this subtitle, or the area of the land is counted by the local jurisdiction against the growth increment permitted under COMAR 14.15.02.06.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">C. For purposes of implementing this regulation, a local jurisdiction shall have determined, based on land uses and development in existence on December 1, 1985, which land areas fall within the three types of development areas described in COMAR 14.15.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">D. Nothing in this regulation may be interpreted as altering any requirements for development activities set out in COMAR 14.15.03 and 14.15.09 of this subtitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>12 Md.

The Commission\u2019s records also include \u201cA SUMMARY OF THE CHESAPEAKE BAY CRITICAL AREA COMMISSION\u2019S CRITERIA AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES 1984-1988,\u201d prepared by J. Kevin Sullivan in August of 1989. In Appendix B to that document, Mr. Sullivan reports that the Commission approved Anne Arundel County\u2019s Critical Area Program on October 5, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Petitioners nonetheless argue that there are two additional reasons why COMAR\u2019s \u201cgrandfathering\u201d provision is inapplicable: (1) Anne Arundel County has never adopted any grandfathering provision as part of its Critical Area Program, and (2) the property at issue was never subdivided into \u201clegally buildable lots.\u201d There is no merit in any of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Anne Arundel County has adopted grandfathering provisions that are applicable to the property at issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 24, 1986, Anne Arundel County enacted what has become known as the \u201cAntiquated Lots Law.\u201d (Laws of Anne Arundel County B38-86 (1986)). That ordinance, then codified in Article 28, \u00a7 2-101 of the Anne Arundel County Code, in pertinent part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">(c) Except for lots served by public water and sewer, a residential dwelling may not be constructed on a properly recorded lot that was in the same ownership as one or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>adjacent unimproved lots on January 1, 1987, if a building permit has not been applied for by January 1, 1987, unless the adjacent lots are combined to meet or come as close as possible to meeting the area requirements for the residential district in which the lot is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Section 2-101 was repealed on August 11, 2003, when Anne Arundel County enacted what has become known as the \u201cLot Merger Law,\u201d an ordinance \u201cto provide an orderly process for the merger of lots in residential communities that protects the lot owners, subsequent purchase of the lots, owners of other lots in the communities and the Chesapeake Bay critical area[.]\u201d (Laws of Anne Arundel County B37-03 (2003)). That ordinance, then codified in Article 28, \u00a7 2-1A-04 of the Anne Arundel County Code (and now codified in \u00a7 18-4-202 of that code), in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u00a7 2-1A-04. Use and merger of lots of substandard area or dimensions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a dwelling may be constructed on a lot that does not comply with the minimum area or dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which the lot is located, provided that the lot complied with applicable minimum area and dimensional requirements, if any, at the time it was created.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a lot that does not comply with the minimum area of dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which the lot is located in effect at the time an application for a building permit is submitted may not be used for the construction of a dwelling if the lot was contiguous to and under the same ownership as one or more unimproved lots on January 1, 1987.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">(c) A lot described in subsection (b) of this section may be used for the construction of a dwelling if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">(1) the lot is served by public water and sewer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">(2) the lot is merged with the contiguous unimproved lot or lots in order to create a lot that complies with or comes as close as possible to complying with the minimum area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>requirement of the zoning district in which the lot is located, provided that the owner executes and records a lot merger agreement as a condition precedent to receiving a building permit for the dwelling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">As the Board\u2019s majority opinion makes clear, both the Commission and the Anne Arundel County Office of Planning and Zoning support the variances at issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>366 Md. 158, 783 A.2d 169 (2001), this Court stated that \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, 783 A.2d at 177. The Board was entitled to give considerable weight to the opinions expressed by representatives of the agencies responsible for administering the Critical Area programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">From our review of the record, we agree with the Board that the variances at issue create seven \u201cbuildable\u201d parcels that conform to the strict requirements imposed by the applicable statutes, ordinances, and COMAR regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">There is no merit in the argument that the Board should have denied the request for variances submitted in reliance upon \u201cnonconforming substandard lots in an old plat [of lots that were platted pursuant to a] plan [that had been] abandoned.\u201d As the Circuit Court stated in its Memorandum Opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">[T]he doctrine of abandonment does not apply to recorded subdivision lots. There is no precedent in Maryland that validly recorded lots on a recorded subdivision plat are lost by the conveyance of lands not in accordance to the recorded plat. Application of the abandonment doctrine is inappropriate because use is statutorily defined and lots are not within the legal definition of use. The recording of lots is not a use because the recording of lots does not establish a purpose for which a site is employed or will be employed .... Finally, it is counterintuitive that a recorded plat should be deemed abandoned by subsequent lot owners\u2019 disregard for the platted lots rather than by some action or inaction by the county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>We agree with that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Moreover, even if the doctrine of abandonment were applicable to recorded lots, this Court has stated that, \u201cit is well-settled that \u2018the burden of proving abandonment rests on the one who asserts or relies on it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. v. United States, 355 </em>Md. 110, 161, 733 A.2d 1055, 1082 (1999) (quoting its <em>Md. &amp; Pa. R.R. Co. v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Co., </em>224 Md. 34, 40, 166 A.2d 247, 250 (1960)). As Respondent Anne Arundel County argues (in the words of its brief), \u201cevery relevant conveyance references the 1926 plat.... Construction of [a] cottage over lot lines shows an intent to merge the lots [but] a merger of lots does not mandate a conclusion that there was ever an intent to abandon the remaining lots.\u201d Because we agree with that argument, even if we were persuaded that evidence of subsequent conveyances and construction on the property was sufficient to <em>permit </em>the inference that the 1926 plan had been abandoned, we would hold that (1) Petitioners\u2019 evidence was insufficient to <em>require </em>that the Board draw such an inference, and (2) the Board was not clearly erroneous in rejecting \u201cpermissible inferences which might have been drawn from the evidence by another trier of the facts.\u201d <em>Hous. Opportunities Comm\u2019n of Montgomery County v. Lacey, </em>322 Md. 56, 61, 585 A.2d 219, 222 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The Board\u2019s comprehensive opinion, from which we have quoted extensively, does not contain any clearly erroneous findings of fact. As the Board expressly recognized, \u201cthe burden on an applicant seeking a variance is very high.\u201d From our review of the record, we hold that there is no merit in the argument that the variances at issue were granted \u201csimply\u201d because the property could be \u201chypothetically\u201d developed \u201cin a manner that would have a greater environmental impact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; PETITIONERS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Chief Judge BELL joins the judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-12\">.

Elm Street Dev., </em>No. 79, September Term, 2007, filed January 17, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\">. We reject the argument that, to establish grandfather provisions required by the Commission the local jurisdiction must enact an ordinance that includes the words \"grandfather'' and/or \"grandfathering.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">. The Board's majority opinion includes the following discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">Ms. Kathy Shatt, a planner with the Office of Planning and Zoning, reviewed the Petitioner's requests and supports the variances. The site contains about 23 acres of land, and if the variances are approved, less than four acres would be disturbed. The development will have minimal disturbance to the environmentally sensitive area. The topography makes the site very difficult to develop. She has reviewed numerous plans for this property and this plan is the best way to develop the property.... The Petitioner has reduced the number of lots from 12 to seven. The Critical Area Commission does not oppose the variances. The Director of the Office of Planning and Zoning authored a letter dated November 17, 2004 to permit the Petitioner to submit a resubdivision plat for seven lots. The Office of Planning and Zoning will not sign off on the final plat until the Board has rendered a decision on this appeal. The Petitioner is requesting variances to permit disturbance within the expanded buffer, to disturb steep slopes, clear within the expanded buffer and a time extension. The variances are not to create a specific number of lots. If the Board feels a density variance is necessary, the Office of Planning and Zoning will support it. Under the RCA a property owner would receive only one dwelling unit per 20 acres. This property owner has the right to develop 12 lots. Road access could not be obtained without a variance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">Mr. Ren Serey, a representative of the Critical Area Commission, explained that the commission has examined this project for many years. For lots that are grandfathered, the Critical Area Program requires local governments to have procedures in place to minimize impacts. Anne Arundel County submitted proposed policies regarding antiquated lot procedures to the Critical Area Commission. Those policies were accepted. The Commission concluded that the proposed seven lots would minimize the impact to the Critical Area versus the 12 lots that can be developed under the grandfathered lot provisions of the County\u2019s Code. The requested variances for infrastructure and stormwater discharge and the platting of the second and third back-up septic systems within the required buffers are not opposed. However, it is the position of the Commission that it is unnecessary and inappropriate to use the process of density variances to permit the reduction of lots on this property. Mr. Serey noted other resubdivisions in the County that did not require variances and did not meet the density requirements. If an applicant is resubdivid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ing property for fewer lots and those lots will have fewer impacts to the Critical Area than would have been achieved otherwise, then no density variance is necessary.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
