ELDRIDGE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADB\">Retired, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The question before us in this criminal case concerns the prosecuting attorney\u2019s comments, during closing arguments, about the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify in his own behalf. More specifically, the issue is whether the prosecuting attorney\u2019s comments constituted error under Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and Maryland Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, or, instead, were permissible under the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The petitioner, Thomas Marshall, was charged with possession of cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and possession of drug paraphernalia, in violation of Maryland Code (2002, 2009 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-601, 5-602(2), and 5-619 of the Criminal Law Article. A jury in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County found Marshall guilty of possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, but acquitted him of possession of drug paraphernalia. The possession conviction merged into the possession with intent to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>conviction, and Marshall was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment for the greater offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">During the trial, the State presented four witnesses. Two police officers testified about their involvement in the search of a house in Fruitland, in Wicomico County, Maryland, where the defendant was found by the officers. A third witness, an expert in the analysis of controlled dangerous substances, testified that a substance found in the home was cocaine. The State\u2019s final witness qualified as an expert on the identification and valuation of controlled dangerous substances, and he testified with respect to the common practices of narcotics users and dealers. The defense did not present any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">According to the State\u2019s evidence, when police officers executed a no-knock warrant to enter and search the house in Fruitland, the defendant was found in one of the rear bedrooms. He was searched and three bags of cocaine, weighing a total of 8.4 grams, were recovered from his shirt pocket. The defendant also had cash totaling $177 in a pocket of his pants. The police conducted a search of the room where the defendant was discovered and found an additional 2.6 grams of cocaine hidden in one shoe and a digital scale hidden in another shoe. On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned the police officers as to why the warrant authorizing entry into the Fruitland house did not list the defendant as the owner of the premises. Attempting to rebut the State\u2019s argument that the defendant had significant ties to the Fruit-land house, defense counsel introduced a police report, related to a different matter, which indicated that the defendant resided at a separate address. Defense counsel also elicited testimony that the police had been unable to find in the house any of the defendant\u2019s personal effects showing that the defendant resided at the Fruitland address.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The expert who testified regarding the common practices of drug users and dealers stated that the cocaine found in the three bags from the petitioner\u2019s pocket were commonly known as \u201ceight balls,\u201d approximately an eighth of an ounce, with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>value of roughly $130 to $200. The expert noted that the $177 found on the defendant was significant because that amount fell within the expected price range for one bag of cocaine. He also testified that the absence of smoking devices at the Fruitland house indicated that the house was being used to sell cocaine, rather than a place to smoke it. The expert explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201c[W]ith [the cocaine] bagged up in eight ball denominations ready for resale, based on the fact that there was already money in the individual\u2019s pocket that looked like possibly one bag had already been sold, based on the fact that there were no pipes, nothing to indicate the ingestion of any type of drugs, no way to use it, then why have a product on your person if you\u2019re not going to use it. But for resale, oh, yes, it\u2019s there, you\u2019ve got the three bags, you\u2019ve got the money already, you\u2019ve got the scales to weigh it out right in the same room, you have another bag sitting next to the scales in another shoe, it\u2019s all packaged up ready to go for distribution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In his closing argument, defense counsel contended that the State had failed to meet its burden of proof on the distribution charge. Claiming that the State did not show a significant link between the defendant and the house in which he was found, defense counsel maintained that the State had not established that the defendant was distributing cocaine, rather than simply purchasing it. Counsel also argued that the State had not shown that the digital scale, which was a key piece of evidence to show distribution, belonged to the defendant. During his closing argument, counsel for the defense highlighted some of the factors needed, in his view, to prove the distribution charge, and counsel asserted that the State had failed to establish such factors. Defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201cOwnership or possessory interest in the place where the cocaine was found. It\u2019s not his [the defendant\u2019s] house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">\u201cOr indications that the Defendant was participating with others in the mutual use, enjoyment or distribution of cocaine. Mr. Marshall went to the cocaine store. Mr. Marshall purchased cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u201cNow the State says, well, clearly he is a drug dealer because there were no smoking devices, he could have had a pipe or a can or something used to smoke cocaine. Well, again, it\u2019s not a very good idea, particularly in light of all the facts and circumstances that have come out here today, to go to the cocaine store with your pipe and smoke it at the cocaine store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cNow, it\u2019s not his house. Not a target of the warrant. There was not one shred of evidence linking him to that house, other than him standing in aisle four of the cocaine store. There\u2019s no mail, there\u2019s nobody testifying that he stays there, he lives there, that he\u2019s ever been there before. He\u2019s at the cocaine store. He\u2019s purchasing cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\u201cThere are no other factors that the State can rely upon, to say he\u2019s doing anything other than going to Sam\u2019s Club, the cocaine store, and buying that big package of toothpaste where you get six tubes in one, because instead of paying $1.99 for a tube of toothpaste, you get them for $0.68. Because the testimony was from the State\u2019s expert that cocaine addicts will use cocaine as much as they can until it\u2019s gone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The defendant\u2019s attorney on one occasion referred to the defendant Marshall as a \u201ccocaine addict\u201d and stated that the defendant was in the Fruitland house to \u201cpurchase[ ] cocaine.\u201d The prosecuting attorney did not object to this characterization but stated in his rebuttal closing argument that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">\u201cMr. Marshall was not going to the cocaine store. Mr. Marshall works at the cocaine store. I\u2019m not asking you, and don\u2019t think I did ask you, to speculate on anything when I first approached you. However, I think [defense counsel] is asking you to speculate on several things. While the State might not have introduced evidence definitively linking Mr. Marshall to the home, there is no evidence that definitively links or unlinks him to the home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Defense counsel objected to the above portion of the State\u2019s closing arguments and, after both counsel approached the bench, explained to the judge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: He\u2019s shifting the burden, Your Honor. I have no requirement to show that he [the defendant] doesn\u2019t live there. The State has the requirement to show the link.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: I\u2019m just indicating ... there are neutral facts. He kept saying those shoes aren\u2019t his, how do we know the shoes aren\u2019t his, they could be his. There\u2019s no evidence that says it\u2019s not his. There\u2019s no evidence that says it is and there\u2019s no evidence [that] says they aren\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201c[Defense counsel] is testifying or making his own conclusions. I\u2019m simply indicating it could go either way. I\u2019m not burden shifting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: You know where the line is and you know not to cross it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The prosecuting attorney continued to attack the defendant\u2019s position by arguing that defense counsel was testifying on behalf of the defendant, pointing out that counsel</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anr\">\u201cwas testifying and drawing his own conclusions that Mr. Marshall was buying drugs. And I submit to you that there is not a piece of evidence that indicates that Mr. Marshall was there purchasing drugs from someone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">The prosecuting attorney continued (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXi\">\u201c[Defense counsel] himself said that, again testifying for Mr. Marshall, he said he\u2019s a cocaine addict. Now, <em>Mr. Marshall did not take the stand </em>so I ask you to take that with a great deal of caution when [defense counsel] tries to indicate a health problem for Mr. Marshall because there\u2019s no evidence of that whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\">\u201cWhat [defense counsel] is trying to do, he is trying to create doubt in your mind. He\u2019s trying to disguise the facts, make you ignore the facts and shroud what\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>before you. The State has presented ample evidence of Mr. Marshall\u2019s guilt as to felony possession and possession. <em>There is no doubt in my mind to that ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><em>\u201cA </em>very fair way to explain, I believe, reasonable doubt is if you imagine you\u2019re doing a jigsaw puzzle. And it could be a scenic panoramic mountain view, it could be a little boy fishing. But regardless at some point as you\u2019re putting together your jigsaw puzzle, without ever having seen the picture, you will know what the picture is before all the pieces are in place. You will know it\u2019s a mountain, you will know it\u2019s a little boy fishing even though the fish isn\u2019t there or his eye is missing or his hat is missing, you\u2019ll know what the picture is even though you don\u2019t have all the pieces.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cThere are several pieces we don\u2019t have. <em>We don\u2019t have Mr. Marshall\u2019s thoughts </em>but we do have so many other pieces and when you put those pieces together, they spell out guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Following the prosecuting attorney\u2019s rebuttal closing argument, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, stating that \u201c[tjwice during the State\u2019s closing, [the prosecutor] pointed to the fact my client didn\u2019t testify, which I think is absolutely off base.\u201d Defense counsel also pointed out that the prosecuting attorney had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201casserted to the jury that there\u2019s no doubt in his mind that there\u2019s sufficient [evidence], the prosecutor can\u2019t vouch for the witnesses, they can\u2019t vouch for the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion and called the prosecutor\u2019s comments \u201csimply rhetorical flourish,\u201d and not a personal endorsement of a guilty verdict. Regarding the prosecutor\u2019s comments on the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">\u201cI didn\u2019t believe [the prosecutor] was pointedly making reference to the fact that your client [the defendant] didn\u2019t testify. I didn\u2019t hear it myself but apparently ... you [defense counsel] said your client was a drug addict. That wasn\u2019t in the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Defense counsel countered, stating that his comments were a \u201c[reasonable inference from the facts,\u201d but the trial judge was not persuaded and noted that the response of the prosecutor</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alr\">\u201cwas the same thing; he just simply said there was no evidence showing that your client was a drug addict and we can\u2019t get inside the defendant\u2019s mind, which is ... a truism. So your motion for mistrial is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, affirming the judgment in an unreported opinion, held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201cWe hold that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were a satisfactorily tailored \u2018invited response.\u2019 The prosecutor\u2019s comments were in rebuttal of defense counsel\u2019s assertion during his closing argument that appellant was a cocaine addict. That fact, as the trial court noted during the bench conference, was not in evidence. Consequently, the prosecutor was entitled to respond in order to bring the jury back to a \u2018fair and calm consideration of the evidence,\u2019 ... and that is exactly what the prosecutor did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">This Court granted the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>Marshall v. State, </em>404 Md. 658, 948 A.2d 70 (2008). The State did not file a cross petition for a writ of certiorari. The defendant\u2019s petition presented two questions which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">1. Did comments made by the prosecutor regarding the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify constitute a permissible \u201cinvited response\u201d in the context of the closing arguments, or, to the contrary, did the comments violate the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">2. Was defendant deprived of a fair trial because of cumulative, improper remarks made by the prosecutor?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">We shall hold that the prosecuting attorney\u2019s comments did not constitute a permissible \u201cinvited response.\u201d Instead, those comments infringed upon the defendant\u2019s rights under Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and Maryland Code (1974, 2006 RepLVoL), \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Accordingly, we shall reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>and remand the case for a new trial without addressing the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The petitioner, in arguing that his \u201cright to remain silent\u201d was violated by the prosecuting attorney\u2019s comments to the jury referring to petitioner\u2019s decision not to testify, relies on the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>This Court has on several occasions pointed out that the privilege against self-incrimination protected by Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights <em>\u201cgenerally </em>\u201d is <em>\u201cin pari materia\u201d </em>with the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Crosby v. State, </em>366 Md. 518, 527 n. 8, 784 A.2d 1102, 1107 n. 8 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 1325, 152 L.Ed.2d 233 (2002); <em>Choi v. State, </em>316 Md. 529, 535 n. 3, 560 A.2d 1108, 1111 n. 3 (1989); <em>Adkins v. State, </em>316 Md. 1, 6 n. 5, 557 A.2d 203, 205 n. 5 (1989). Nonetheless, as pointed out by Judge Battaglia for this Court in <em>Crosby v. State, supra, </em>366 Md. at 527 n. 8, 784 A.2d at 1107 n. 8, \u201cwe have previously interpreted Maryland\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination to be more comprehensive than that of the federal government.\u201d <em>See also Crosby v. State, supra, </em>366 Md. at 534, 784 A.2d at 1111 (Harrell, J., concurring, and referring to \u201cthe greater protections offered by Art. 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights than the Fifth Amendment\u201d); <em>Hardaway v. State, </em>317 Md. 160, 164-169, 562 A.2d 1234, 1236-1238 (1989) (holding, contrary to federal law, that a jury instruction that no adverse inference should be drawn from a defendant\u2019s election not to testify should not be given over the defendant\u2019s objection); <em>Choi v. State, supra, </em>316 Md. at 535 n. 3, 560 A.2d at 1111 n. 3 (referring to \u201csituations where the privilege under Art. 22 has been viewed differently, and more broadly, than the privilege under the Fifth Amendment\u201d); <em>Allen v. State, </em>183 Md. 603, 39 A.2d 820 (1944); <em>Chesapeake Club v. State, </em>63 Md. 446, 457, 462 (1885).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Although the petitioner, as previously mentioned, relies on both the Fifth Amendment and Maryland self-incrimination law (Article 22 of the Declaration of Rights and \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article), we shall rest our decision, as we have often done in the past, solely upon the Maryland provisions. As Judge Wilner for the Court emphasized in <em>Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 86 n. 11, 741 A.2d 1162, 1188 n. 11 (1999), regarding a decision under Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, our citation and quotation of federal authority is \u201cfor guidance only\u201d and our decision is based entirely on Maryland law. <em>See Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1041, 103 act 3469, 3476, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201, 1214 (1983). <em>See also Ohio v.

State, supra, </em>366 Md. at 527 n. 8, 784 A.2d at 1107, n. 8, quoting <em>Allen v. State, supra, </em>183 Md. at 607, 39 A.2d at 821. <em>See, e.g., Choi v. State, supra, </em>316 Md. at 536, 560 A.2d at 1111 (\u201cThis Court has repeatedly emphasized that the privilege against compelled self-incrimination, under ... Art. 22 of the Declaration of Rights, \u2018must be accorded a liberal construction in favor of the right that it was intended to secure\u2019\u201d); <em>Adkins v. State, supra, </em>316 Md. at 8, 557 A.2d at 206 (same); <em>Ellison v. State, </em>310 Md. 244, 248, 258, 528 A.2d 1271, 1273, 1278 (1987) (\u201cContrary to the view of the court below, [that testimonial privileges, including the privilege against self-incrimination, are disfavored,] the privilege against self-incrimination \u2018must be accorded liberal construction in favor of the right it was intended to secure\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Comes, </em>237 Md. 271, 282, 206 A.2d 124, 130 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Moreover, our cases have long held that a criminal defendant\u2019s rights under Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article preclude comment by a prosecutor on a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify. In fact, as pointed out by Judge Raker for the Court in <em>Smith v. State, </em>367 Md. 348, 353, 787 A.2d 152, 155 (2001),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u201c[c]omment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in a criminal trial was prohibited in Maryland before the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), held that the federal constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination prohibits prosecutorial comment on the accused\u2019s silence or failure to testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\"><em>See Woodson v. State, </em>325 Md. 251, 265, 600 A.2d 420, 426 (1992) (\u201cWell before <em>Griffin, </em>our cases prohibited [the] practice\u201d of \u201ccomment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify\u201d); <em>Veney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>v. State, </em>251 Md. 159, 179, 246 A.2d 608, 620 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 948, 89 S.Ct. 1284, 22 L.Ed.2d 482 (1969) (\u201cIt is clear that in Maryland comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in a state criminal trial was forbidden long prior to <em>Griffin v. California </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Thus, in <em>Smith v. State, </em>169 Md. 474, 182 A. 287 (1936), this Court held that it was improper for the prosecuting attorney to comment upon a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify in his own criminal trial. <em>Smith </em>was a prosecution for the crime of bastardy, and the State\u2019s Attorney noted during his closing argument that \u201cthis defendant has sat here all during the trial and has not denied his fatherhood.\u201d This Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was improper, saying (169 Md. at 476, 182 A. at 288):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\u201cThere can be no question of the impropriety of this remark, as it was susceptible of the inference by the jury that they were to consider the silence of the traverser in the face of the accusation of the prosecuting witness as an indication of his guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Even before the 1936 opinion in <em>Smith v. State, supra, </em>this Court implied that a prosecuting attorney could not comment upon a defendant\u2019s silence when the defendant exercised his right not to testify. In <em>Brashears v. The State, </em>58 Md. 563, 567-569 (1882), and <em>Guy v. State, </em>90 Md. 29, 33-35, 44 A. 997 (1899), the Court decided that, when the defendants took the stand and testified, the prosecuting attorneys <em>could </em>comment on the defendants\u2019 silence as to particular matters. The Court held that the defendants\u2019 decisions to testify waived their rights to have no prosecutorial comments on their silence with regard to particular matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">More recently, in a prosecution against another non-testifying defendant named Smith, for burglary and related offenses involving the theft of, <em>inter alia, </em>leather clothing, the prosecuting attorney stated in closing rebuttal argument to the jury: <em>\u201cWhat explanation </em>has been given to us <em>by the defendant </em>for having the leather goods? Zero, none.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, supra, </em>367 Md. at 352, 787 A.2d at 154, emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>original. This Court, in reversing Smith\u2019s convictions and ordering a new trial, held that (367 Md. at 360, 787 A.2d at 159)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">\u201cthe prosecutor went beyond the permissible comment on the absence of the evidence, and impermissibly commented directly on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Another case disapproving of the prosecuting attorney\u2019s closing argument to the jury, on the ground that it amounted to comment upon the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, is <em>Woodson v. State, supra, </em>325 Md. at 264-267, 600 A.2d at 426-428. In <em>Woodson, </em>the prosecuting attorney during closing rebuttal argument said, while pounding on the witness stand and pointing to the defense trial table, \u201cthey have sat there for 6 days, not here.\u201d 325 Md. at 265, 600 A.2d at 427. The prosecutor also told the jury that the defense had \u201ctried to baffle you with bologna from that trial table and from in front of here today and ... that is not evidence----We gave you evidence.... \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>With regard to these comments by the prosecutor, this Court stated (325 Md. at 267, 600 A.2d at 427):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">\u201cNotwithstanding the trial court\u2019s careful consideration of Woodson\u2019s motions for a mistrial and for a new trial, it is plain that the only person at the defense trial table who could have sat in the witness stand was [the defendant] himself, and that the prosecutorial comment therefore invited attention to the fact that [the defendant] did not testify. By pointing out to the jury that the prosecution \u2018gave you evidence,\u2019 and that [the defendant] did not, the jury may well have gleaned from that sharp contrast that it might infer guilt from [the defendant\u2019s] silence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In the instant case, the two statements by the prosecuting attorney were more direct comments upon the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify than the prosecuting attorneys\u2019 comments in the <em>Smith </em>cases and <em>Woodson. </em>The prosecutor\u2019s statements to the jury that \u201cMr. Marshall did not take the stand\u201d and \u201c[w]e don\u2019t have Mr. Marshall\u2019s thoughts\u201d were used to highlight the fact that the defendant did not testify in an effort to rebut the State\u2019s evidence. The prosecuting attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ney clearly was using the defendant\u2019s silence as support for the State\u2019s case. These comments impinged on the defendant\u2019s rights under Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In this case neither the Court of Special Appeals nor the State took the position that the prosecuting attorney\u2019s statements did not amount to comments upon the defendant\u2019s silence. Instead, the intermediate appellate court decided, and the State in this Court argued, that the challenged statements by the prosecuting attorney were permissible under the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine, or the \u201cfair response\u201d doctrine as it is sometimes called. The Court of Special Appeals held that the prosecuting attorney\u2019s statements, that \u201cMr. Marshall did not take the stand\u201d and that \u201c[w]e don\u2019t have Mr. Marshall\u2019s thoughts,\u201d were appropriate invited responses to defense counsel\u2019s argument that the defendant was a cocaine addict and not a distributor of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">A closely divided Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988), held, in a federal criminal prosecution, that the prosecuting attorney in argument to the jury could comment on the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify because the comment was a \u201cfair response\u201d to defense counsel\u2019s \u201cclosing argument that the Government had not allowed respondent to explain his side of the story.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>485 U.S. at 26, 108 S.Ct. at 866, 99 L.Ed.2d at 27. The Supreme Court held \u201cthat the comment by the prosecutor did not violate respondent\u2019s privilege to be free from compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>(Ibid.). </em>Consequently, under <em>Robinson, </em>a defendant\u2019s <em>Fifth Amendment </em>right to be free of prosecutorial comment upon the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify can be lost because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>defense <em>counsel\u2019s </em>closing argument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">This Court has never decided, or even discussed, whether, under Maryland law, the invited response doctrine is applicable to a prosecutor\u2019s comments to the jury about the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify at his or her criminal trial. The Court has also not addressed the invited response doctrine in the context of Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and/or \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 7Furthermore, we need not decide or further explore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>these matters today. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the invited response doctrine may be applicable under Maryland law to a prosecutor\u2019s comments about the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify, the doctrine would not justify the prosecuting attorney\u2019s comments in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The invited response doctrine has been considered at length in two recent opinions of this Court, <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 969 A.2d 989 (2009), and <em>Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. 148, 950 A.2d 125 (2008). Judge Battaglia for the Court in the <em>Lee </em>case set forth the doctrine and its limitations as follows (405 Md. at 168, 950 A.2d at 137, internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AliQ\">\u201cThe invited response doctrine suggests that where a prosecutorial argument has been made in reasonable response to improper attacks by defense counsel, the unfair prejudice flowing from the two arguments may balance each other out, thus obviating the need for a new trial. <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 157 n. 7, 872 A.2d at 32 n. 7. The doctrine does not grant a prosecutor unbridled discretion to respond to an inappropriate defense argument with improper conduct, but rather, permits the prosecution to respond to improper conduct in order to equalize the positions of both sides and remedy any unfair prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Judge Battaglia continued in <em>Lee </em>(405 Md. at 169, 950 A.2d at 137):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">\u201c[Bjecause the \u2018invited response doctrine\u2019 calls for the prosecutor\u2019s invited response to be considered in context with the defense counsel\u2019s own impropriety, it is not applicable when defense counsel has made no improper argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj2\">In <em>Lee, </em>we held th\u00e1t defense counsel\u2019s argument was not improper and that, therefore, the invited response doctrine was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In <em>Mitchell v. State, supra, </em>408 Md. at 382, 969 A.2d at 997, Judge Greene for the Court, after reviewing general Maryland law concerning permissible closing argument, turned to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>invited response doctrine and reaffirmed the holding in <em>Lee </em>\u201cthat the \u2018invited response\u2019 doctrine applies only when defense counsel first makes an improper argument.\u201d Judge Greene also observed that \u201c[t]his Court has not yet had the opportunity to address an improper argument by defense counsel sufficient to invoke the \u2018invited response\u2019 doctrine.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 383, 969 A.2d at 998. The <em>Mitchell </em>opinion then held (408 Md. at 383-384, 969 A.2d at 998-999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201cBecause it is within the scope of permissible closing argument for counsel to draw inferences from the evidence admitted at trial, which includes the ability to comment on an absence of such evidence, defense counsel\u2019s closing argument was not improper. <em>See Eley v. State, </em>288 Md. 548, 553, 419 A.2d 384, 386-387 (1980) (holding that defense counsel may call attention to the State\u2019s failure to produce evidence); <em>Wise v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 127, 146, 751 A.2d 24, 33 (2000)(recognizing the \u201cright of a defendant to comment upon the failure of the State to produce evidence\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 276, 757 A.2d 811 (2000); <em>Eastman v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 162, 167, 422 A.2d 41, 43 (1980)(noting that \u201cit is not unreasonable to permit the defense to comment upon the State\u2019s shortcomings in producing prosecutorial evidence\u201d).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In the case at bar, the challenged argument by defense counsel was not improper, or, at the very least, not sufficiently improper to justify the prosecutor\u2019s comments upon the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify. The defendant Marshall was charged both with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it and, separately, with simple possession of cocaine. Moreover, the State\u2019s evidence at trial showed that Marshall had cocaine on his person. Except for his presence in the house which was searched, the evidence did not show that Marshall had a connection to the house. The gist of defense counsel\u2019s argument was that Marshall was not a distributor but a user of cocaine and was in the house to purchase cocaine. Counsel was, in effect, arguing that Marshall was guilty of the lesser offense charged but not guilty of the greater offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>While the State seizes upon the word \u201caddict\u201d and argues that there was no evidence that Marshall was a cocaine addict, the word has no significance with respect to guilt or innocence of the charges in this case. Defense counsel, only once referring to Marshall as an addict, was simply arguing that Marshall was a user of cocaine instead of being a distributor. This was a legitimate inference from the State\u2019s evidence. The offense under \u00a7 5-601 (a) of the Criminal Law Article is to \u201cpossess\u201d the controlled dangerous substance. One who is in possession of cocaine, but is not a distributor of cocaine, is likely a user. Defense counsel\u2019s choice at the time of the word \u201caddict\u201d in place of \u201cuser\u201d or \u201cpurchaser\u201d is, in the context of this case, insignificant.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In sum, there was no impropriety in defense counsel\u2019s closing argument sufficient to warrant the prosecutor\u2019s comments on the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.

The State, </em>58 Md. 563, 567 (1882).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-17\">Some of this Court\u2019s opinions applying or discussing Maryland self-incrimination principles cite both Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the statute without suggesting any differences between them. The Court in such cases appears to treat the two provisions as guaranteeing the same rights. <em>See, e.g., Barber </em>v. <em>State, </em>191 Md. 555, 566, 62 A.2d 616, 621 (1948) (\"The privilege against self-incrimination is protected in this State, both by constitutional provision (Art. 22, Declaration of Rights) and by statute ... \u201d). <em>See also Smith v. State, </em>367 Md. 348, 353-54, 787 A.2d 152, 155 (2001); <em>Crosby v. State, </em>366 Md. 518, 528, 784 A.2d 1102, 1107 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 1325, 152 L.Ed.2d 233 (2002); <em>Morales v. State, </em>325 Md. 330, 335, 600 A.2d 851, 853 (1992); <em>Woodson </em>v. <em>State, </em>325 Md. 251, 265, 600 A.2d 420, 426 (1992); <em>King v.

Many other opinions dealing with the privilege, however, rely on Article 22 without citing the statute. <em>See, e.g., Choi </em>v. <em>State, </em>316 Md. 529, 536-537, 560 A.2d 1108, 1111-1112 (1989); <em>Adkins v.

State, </em>285 Md. 261, 265, 401 A.2d 1021, 1023-1024 (1979). Interestingly, the initial case in this Court holding that it is error for the prosecuting attorney, in jury argument, to comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, relied particularly on the statute. <em>Smith v. State, </em>169 Md. 474, 182 A. 287 (1936).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b297-5\">. There is no inconsistency between this Court\u2019s statement that Maryland self-incrimination law is \u201cgenerally <em>in pari materia </em>\u201d with the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Amendment and our holdings that, to some extent, Maryland self-incrimination law grants greater protections to the individual than the Fifth Amendment.

While the Court did address an argument by the defendant that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause was violated, and in this connection cited <em>United States v.
