Respondent noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and argued that (in the words of his brief) \u201cTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT INSTRUCTED THE JURY ON VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER DESPITE THE LACK OF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ANY EVIDENCE OF HOT BLOODED RESPONSE TO LEGALLY ADEQUATE PROVOCATION.\u201d After the Court of Special Appeals exercised its discretion to conduct a \u201cplain error\u201d review of this argument, and vacated the judgment of conviction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this Court granted the State\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. From our review of the record, we are persuaded that (1) Respondent\u2019s argument should be rejected under the \u201cinvited error\u201d doctrine, and (2) there is no merit in the argument that the jurors did not receive <em>any </em>evidence of hot blooded response to legally adequate provocation. We shall therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The murder occurred in a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, on a stairwell leading to the second floor. It was the State\u2019s theory of the case that Respondent and an accomplice attempted to rob the victim, and that it was Respondent who stabbed the victim to death. Respondent made a post-arrest statement, in which he admitted that he followed the victim into the stairwell, but denied that he intended to rob the victim and denied that he stabbed the victim. Respondent told the investigating officers that he went into the stairwell to purchase marijuana from the victim, and that he punched the victim because he was offended by the victim\u2019s utterance of a racial slur, but claimed that the victim had not been robbed or stabbed during the time that both he and the victim were in the stairwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The opening statement of Respondent\u2019s trial counsel included the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">And, you\u2019re going to listen to Mr. Rich\u2019s statement. Mr. Rich is honest and open. What he tells the police is consistent with what you\u2019re going to see on that tape. He tells the police: Yes, I was there. He puts himself there. Yes, I went there to buy drugs, to buy marijuana. And, you\u2019re going to hear that marijuana is found on [the victim]. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>What he said matches the evidence. [The victim] also had a large amount of money on him; almost $500.00. Mr. Rich says: I was there to do a drug deal, to buy marijuana. That matches the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">In his statement, he\u2019s going to tell you that they got into an argument. He got into an argument with [the victim] about whether it was hash or marijuana. Something about the drags caused an argument. It wasn\u2019t just out of the blue. Premeditated murder at a downtown McDonald\u2019s at 10:45 in the morning!?] [P]lanned? I don\u2019t think so. They get to arguing. He said they got into an argument. And, he\u2019s called a derogatory name and he\u2019s spit at. And, he tells the police: I did react to that. I punched him. I plucked him. I had a closed fist. I punched him in the face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">And, you\u2019re going to hear from the medical examiner. It matches the evidence. There\u2019s abrasions and bruising on the face. And, he tells the detectives that he never saw a knife. He doesn\u2019t know what happened. He just left after that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">And, you\u2019re going to hear when Detective Bradshaw tells him\u2014tells him that [the victim] got stabbed. He tells him that [the victim] later died. The shock, the surprise, is genuine in Mr. Rich. He had no idea when he left that McDonald\u2019s that day that he would be sitting here tried for first degree murder. When he left, [the victim] was walking. He was talking. He was yelling. And, you\u2019re going to see it\u2014on the video, [the victim] actually makes it all the way to the top of the stairs before coming back down. [The victim] was alive. Mr. Rich has no blood on his hands. He didn\u2019t know what happened. And, you\u2019re going to hear that shocking surprise in his voice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Respondent\u2019s post-arrest statement was introduced into evidence during the State\u2019s case-in-chief. When the prosecutor \u201crested\u201d the State\u2019s case, Respondent\u2019s trial counsel made \u201ca motion for judgment of acquittal on all charges,\u201d and presented the following argument in support of that motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Mr. Rich is charged with first degree premeditated murder. Even, at this point, looking at all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, the State has not proven that there was any kind of premeditation involved in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">Even assuming that Mr. Rich did the stabbing, we have the argument. We have the provocation. One stab wound and the fact that he was still alive and appeared to be\u2014from\u2014at least from the front, okay to the some of the witnesses, even one of the witnesses testified: Man, you\u2019re okay. You\u2019re okay. I don\u2019t think the State has even shown enough for premeditated murder to go [to] the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The closing argument of Respondent\u2019s trial counsel included the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">Now, what do we know? We know that ... We hear from the [McDonald\u2019s] workers that there\u2019s a commotion up there. There\u2019s yelling. There\u2019s a scuffle. There\u2019s something going on up there____We know this. We agree on this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">Mr. Rich was honest with the police. He went there, and he told them what happened. He didn\u2019t try to make up any lie saying I wasn\u2019t there ... He puts himself there. He puts himself right there. And he puts himself in a fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">He told the detective on the tape, \u2018We got into a fight over hash and marijuana. And he called me an \u201cN\u201d and he spit on me, and I got angry, and I punched him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Respondent\u2019s trial counsel filed a written request titled \u201cPROPOSED JURY INSTRUCTIONS,\u201d that expressly included a request for the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">17. MPJI 4.17 Homicide\u20141st <em>&amp; </em>2nd degree murder</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-13\">18. MPJI 4.17.2 1st, 2nd degree murder, voluntary manslaughter (imperfect self defense)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>19. MPJI 4.17.4 voluntary manslaughter (hot blooded response to legally adequate provocation).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The Circuit Court\u2019s instructions included a \u201cvoluntary manslaughter\u201d instruction that was in substantial compliance with MPJI 4.17.4. Respondent\u2019s trial counsel noted no exceptions to the instructions other than an \u201cexception to the aiding and abetting language as used on the verdict sheet and the charges.\u201d During jury deliberations, the jurors submitted the following question: \u201cIs spitting a legally adequate provocation?\u201d The Circuit Court gave the following answer to that question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">Spitting onto a person\u2019s body may be battery____That the spitter caused offensive physical contact with, in this case, the defendant, that the contact was a result of an intentional or reckless act of the spitter and was not accidental and that the contact was not consented to by the defendant or was not legally justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Respondent\u2019s trial counsel did not note an exception to this answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">The jury found Respondent guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and not guilty of all remaining charges. The Court of Special Appeals reversed Respondent\u2019s conviction on the ground that the evidence presented to the jury was insufficient to generate the issue of whether Respondent acted in \u201chot-blooded response to legally adequate provocation.\u201d The Court noted that, although Respondent specifically requested the instruction and appears to have benefitted from it in that he was convicted of a lesser charge than first-or second-degree murder, \u201cthe instructional error materially affected his right to a fair and impartial trial,\u201d and therefore, warranted a finding of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">We hold that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that the evidence was insufficient to generate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>issue of whether Respondent was guilty of manslaughter. In <em>Starr v. State, </em>405 Md. 293, 951 A.2d 87 (2008), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">It is well settled that \u201cappellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case tried by a jury is predicated on the refusal of the trial court to grant a motion for judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>Lotharp v. State, </em>231 Md. 239, 240, 189 A.2d 652, 653 (1963). A criminal defendant who moves for judgment of acquittal is required by Md. Rule 4-324(a) to \u201cstate with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted[,]\u201d and is not entitled to appellate review of reasons stated for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Lyles, </em>308 Md. 129, 135-36, 517 A.2d 761, 764-65 (1986); <em>Muir v. State, </em>308 Md. 208, 218-19, 517 A.2d 1105, 1110 (1986); <em>Graham v. State, </em>325 Md. 398, 416-17, 601 A.2d 131, 140 (1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 302, 951 A.2d at 92. The \u201crules for preservation of issues have a salutary purpose of preventing unfairness and requiring that all issues be raised in and decided by the trial court, and these rules must be followed in all cases ... The few cases where we have exercised our discretion to review unpreserved issues are cases where prejudicial error was found and the failure to preserve the issue was not a matter of trial tactics.\u201d <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 150, 729 A.2d 910, 919 (1999). It is clear that the tactics employed by Respondent\u2019s trial counsel included the argument that, if Respondent were guilty of any offense, he was only guilty of manslaughter. Under these circumstances, because Respondent was convicted by a jury, he is not entitled to appellate relief on the basis of a \u201csufficiency\u201d argument that is in direct conflict with the argument actually asserted by his trial counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>In the case at bar, because the manslaughter instruction was specifically requested by Respondent\u2019s trial counsel, the doctrine of invited error is applicable to his argument that \u201cthe instructional error materially affected his right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d The \u201cinvited error\u201d doctrine is a \u201cshorthand term for the concept that a defendant who himself invites or creates error cannot obtain a benefit\u2014 mistrial or reversal\u2014from that error.\u201d <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 544, 735 A.2d 1061, 1069 (1999), quoting <em>Allen v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 25, 43, 597 A.2d 489, 498 (1991) <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 396, 601 A.2d 129 (1992). \u201cThe doctrine stems from the common sense view that where a party invites the trial court to commit error, he cannot later cry foul on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The doctrine is applicable to appellate review of jury instructions specifically requested by the criminal defendant\u2019s counsel. <em>Bromley v. State, </em>150 P.3d 1202, 1213 (Wyo.2007); <em>Vanvorst v. State, </em>1 P.3d 1223, 1229 (Wyo.2000). In <em>State v. Studd, </em>137 Wash.2d 533, 973 P.2d 1049 (1999), the Supreme Court of Washington stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">[W]e have also held that \u201c[a] party may not request an instruction and later complain on appeal that the requested instruction was given.\u201d <em>State v. Henderson, </em>114 Wash.2d 867, 870, 792 P.2d 514 (1990) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>State v. Boyer, </em>91 Wash.2d 342, 345, 588 P.2d 1151 (1979)). <em>Henderson </em>also involved erroneous WPIC instructions proposed by a defendant and later complained of, and we held there that \u201ceven if error was committed, <em>of whatever kind, </em>it was at the defendant\u2019s invitation and he is therefore precluded from claiming on appeal that it is reversible error.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>114 Wash.2d at 870, 792 P.2d 514 (emphasis added). <em>Henderson </em>is directly on point. There can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>doubt that this is a strict rule, but we have rejected the opportunity to adopt a more flexible approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">Here, the record is quite clear ... that these defendants requested instructions modeled after WPIC 16.02. Consequently, the doctrine of invited error prevents them from now complaining about the trial court acceding to their request to give a certain instruction ... We reached this conclusion despite the fact that \u201cthe unconstitutional instruction was standard in this state, <em>In re Hagler, </em>97 Wash.2d 818, 819, 650 P.2d 1103 (1982), and had been <em>expressly approved </em>by this court.\u201d <em>Griffith, </em>102 Wash.2d at 104, 683 P.2d 194[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1055-56. (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In <em>State v. Fabricatore, </em>281 Conn. 469, 915 A.2d 872 (2007), the Supreme Court of Connecticut stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">In <em>State v. Duncan, </em>96 Conn.App. 533, 557, 901 A.2d 687, <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Conn. 912, 908 A.2d 540 (2006), the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly had instructed the jury on the elements of alteration of a firearm identification mark or number and the presumptive inference that the jury was permitted to draw. After the court had given its oral instructions to the jury, the prosecutor directed the court\u2019s attention to a discrepancy between the oral charge and the written charge that was to be submitted to the jury on the elements of alteration. <em>Id., </em>at 558, 901 A.2d 687. The court and both counsel agreed that the written charge was incorrect, and, upon reviewing a corrected version of the written charge, \u201c[b]oth the prosecutor and defense counsel stated that they were \u2018satisfied\u2019 with the correction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Appellate Court concluded that the defendant had waived any challenge to the alleged constitutional violation because \u201cthe defendant not only failed to object to the court\u2019s instruction, but also voiced satisfaction with it.... To allow the defendant to seek reversal now that his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to induce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>potentially harmful error, and then ambush the state with that claim on appeal.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">In the present case, defense counsel not only failed to object to the instruction as given or to the state\u2019s original request to charge the jury with the duty to retreat, but clearly expressed his satisfaction with that instruction, and in fact subsequently argued that the instruction as given was proper. Indeed, defense counsel himself addressed the duty to retreat in his own summation. Thus, the defendant accepted the duty to retreat theory presented by the prosecutor, and openly acquiesced at trial, thereby waiving his right to challenge the instruction on appeal. Under this factual situation, we simply cannot conclude that \u201cinjustice [has been] done to either party\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State v. Whitford, supra, </em>260 Conn. [610] 620, 799 A.2d 1034 [ (2002) ]; or that \u201cthe alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial.... \u201d <em>State v. Golding, supra, </em>213 Conn. [233] 240, 567 A.2d 823 [ (1989) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 879-880. (Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">In <em>People v. Robertson, </em>34 Ill.App.3d 762, 340 N.E.2d 213 (1975), the Appellate Court of Illinois, Third District was presented with the very same argument that Respondent has presented in the case at bar: \u201cDefendant argued during the trial that, if the jury did not decide to acquit defendant, evidence of provocation was sufficient to reduce the crime from murder to voluntary manslaughter.... On appeal, defendant contends that the evidence of provocation by the victim was inadequate to support the voluntary manslaughter verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215. While rejecting that argument, the <em>Robertson </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">Defendant is actually complaining that it was error for the court to accede to his request for instructions on voluntary manslaughter. This, to put it mildly, is not the usual stance of a defendant in a criminal appeal. Whether we characterize this issue as involving invited error <em>(People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>Clements, </em>316 Ill. 282, 147 N.E.2d [N.E.] 99 (1925)) or as raising a new theory of defense on appeal that was not raised at trial <em>(People v. Brown, </em>11 Ill.App.3d 67, 296 N.E.2d 77 (2d Dist.1973)), defendant\u2019s contention is without merit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">This precise issue was presented to this court in <em>People v. Curwick </em>(3d Dist.1975), 33 Ill.App.3d 757, 338 N.E.2d 468, where we held that a defendant found guilty of voluntary manslaughter may not contest the sufficiency of the evidence of manslaughter after he requested the manslaughter instruction. Our decision in <em>Curwick </em>is controlling in the case at bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">There is a distinction between a plain error and an invited error. In <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4X\">We explained in <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), that Rule 52(b) review-so-called \u201cplain-error review\u201d\u2014involves four steps, or prongs. First, there must be an error or defect\u2014some sort of \u201c[deviation from a legal rule\u201d\u2014that has not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned, i.e., affirmatively waived, by the appellant. <em>Id., </em>at 732-733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508. Second, the legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute. <em>See id., </em>at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508. Third, the error must have affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means he must demonstrate that it \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Fourth and finally, if the above three prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion to remedy the error\u2014discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error \u201c \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (quoting <em>United States v. Atkinson, </em>297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)).

Perez, </em>116 F.3d 840 (9th Cir.1997), on en banc review of a claim that <em>Olano </em>had overruled the invited error doctrine as the doctrine had been applied to jury instructions specifically requested by the defendant, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">The issue we resolve today is the viability of this circuit\u2019s \u201cinvited error\u201d doctrine following the Supreme court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The three-judge panel (\u201cpanel\u201d) suggested that <em>Olano </em>overruled that doctrine, at least in the context of jury instructions specifically requested by the defendant. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>67 F.3d 1371, 1385 n. 13 (9th Cir.1995). On en banc review, we conclude that <em>Olano </em>limits our application of the invited error doctrine to those rights deemed waived, as opposed to merely forfeited, that is, \u201cknown rights\u201d that have been \u201cintentionally relinquished or abandoned.\u201d <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 733 [113 S.Ct. 1770] (defining waiver).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">We have held repeatedly that where the defendant himself proposes allegedly flawed jury instructions, we deny review under the invited error doctrine ... The doctrine reflects the policy that invited errors \u201care less worthy of consideration than those where the defendant merely fails to object.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">In <em>Olano, </em>the Court provides an extensive framework for plain error review. 507 U.S. at 731-37 [113 S.Ct. 1770]. <em>Olano </em>does not, however, specifically address the concept of invited error. From this omission, the panel concluded that plain error review is appropriate for invited errors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\"><em>Olano </em>lays out a framework to be applied to all instances where defendant\u2019s counsel has failed to properly preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>error for appeal. <em>Olano </em>does not distinguish between errors counsel fails to object to and errors that counsel invites affirmatively. Rule 52(b) does not make this distinction either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\"><em>Perez, </em>67 F.3d at 1385 n. 13. Although <em>Olano </em>does not directly address so-called \u201cinvited error,\u201d it certainly addresses the difference between forfeited and waived rights. 507 U.S. at 732-34 [113 S.Ct. 1770]. Accordingly, we cannot agree that <em>Olano </em>completely overruled our invited error doctrine. Instead, we must reformulate that doctrine to conform to <em>Olano\u2019s </em>discussion of waiver and forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">Forfeiture is the failure to make a timely assertion of a right, whereas waiver is the \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 733 [113 S.Ct. 1770] (quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)). Forfeited rights are reviewable for plain error, while waived rights are not. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf a legal rule was violated during the District Court proceedings, and if the defendant did not waive the rule, then there has been an \u2018error\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 52(b) despite the absence of a timely objection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>507 U.S. at 733-34 [113 S.Ct. 1770],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">Until now, our invited error doctrine has focused solely on whether the defendant induced or caused the error. <em>See Baldwin, </em>987 F.2d at 1437 (citing <em>United States v. Montecalvo, </em>545 F.2d 684, 685 (9th Cir.1976), and <em>Guthrie, </em>931 F.2d at 567). We now recognize, however, that we must also consider whether the defendant intentionally relinquished or abandoned a known right. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 733 [113 S.Ct. 1770]. If the defendant has both invited the error, and relinquished a known right, then the error is waived and therefore unreviewable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">We do not mean to suggest that a defendant may have jury instructions reviewed for plain error merely by claiming he did not know the instructions were flawed. What we are concerned with is evidence in the record that the defendant was aware of, i.e., knew of, the relinquished or abandoned right. For example, in <em>Baldwin, </em>the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine. 987 F.2d at 1436. The court\u2019s proposed instructions left out \u201covert act\u201d as an element of the crime. <em>Id. </em>The government excepted to the instructions because they omitted this requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1437. The defendant\u2019s attorney indicated that he did not believe it was necessary to instruct on the overt act requirement. <em>Id. </em>This scenario is an example of waiver because the record reflects that the defendant was aware of the omitted element and yet relinquished his right to have it submitted to the jury ... Waiver occurred in each of these cases because the defendant considered the controlling law, or omitted element, and, in spite of being aware of the applicable law, proposed or accepted a flawed instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 842-45. (Footnotes and internal citations omitted). (Emphasis supplied). We agree with this analysis. In the case at bar, when Respondent\u2019s trial counsel (1) argued that the issue of voluntary manslaughter was generated by the evidence, and (2) made a specific request for a voluntary manslaughter instruction, that action constituted an intentional waiver of the right to argue on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support the voluntary manslaughter conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">It is well settled that provocative words\u2014even if accompanied by some physical contact\u2014do not constitute adequate provocation to mitigate a murder to a manslaughter.

Moylan, Jr., <em>Criminal Homicide Law, </em>\u00a7 9.11, pp. 180-182 (2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the case at bar, however, the conflicting evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>was sufficient to generate a genuine jury question on the issue of whether Respondent was guilty of voluntary manslaughter.

State, </em>319 Md. 540, 573 A.2d 1317 (1990), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">Mutual combat has been recognized as a possible source of adequate provocation. <em>Carter v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 567, 572, 505 A.2d 545 (1986); <em>Shuck v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 33, 38-40, 349 A.2d 378 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 733 [735] (1976); <em>Whitehead v.

Torc\u00eda, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 159 (14th ed. 1979). The rule of provocation will apply when persons enter into angry and unlawful combat with a mutual intent to fight and, as a result of the effect of the combat, the passion of one of the participants is suddenly elevated to the point where he resorts to the use of deadly force to kill the other solely because of an impulsive response to the passion and without time to consider the consequences of his actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 551-52, 573 A.2d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Prom the evidence presented, the jury was entitled to (1) accept Respondent\u2019s claim that he had been vilified and spat upon by the victim, (2) find that the victim\u2019s conduct was something \u201cthe natural tendency of which is to produce passion in ordinary men and women,\u201d (3) reject Respondent\u2019s claim that his retaliation was limited to punching the victim, and (4) find that Respondent inflicted a single stab wound upon the victim during mutual combat.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">It is clear that the case at bar does not present the hypothetical question of whether a voluntary manslaughter conviction should be reversed on the ground that (1) at the close of all of the evidence, the defense\u2019s argument for a judgment of acquittal as to voluntary manslaughter included an express concern that\u2014even though the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict of guilty on that charge\u2014the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>might \u201ccompromise,\u201d acquitting the defendant of murder but convicting the defendant of manslaughter, (2) the trial court, <em>erroneously </em>finding that the evidence was sufficient, denied that motion, and (3) the defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. While we must leave to another day the issue of whether a voluntary manslaughter conviction must be reversed under those circumstances, we note that in <em>Criminal Homicide Law, </em>Judge Moylan states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">A conviction for manslaughter does not require affirmative proof of non-malice. It simply involves, as a coincidental explanation of why the conviction was not of a higher degree, the non-proof of malice. Non-proof of malice does not necessarily imply proof of non-malice. The confusion between the non-proof of malice and the proof of non-malice is but an instance of what <em>In re Lakeysha P. </em>[106 Md.App. 401, 433, 665 A.2d 264, 279 (1995) ] refers to as \u201cthe semantic fallacy of the false affirmative.\u201d <em>Lakeysha P. </em>described how the semantic fallacy came about[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">If malice and non-malice, indeed, were pointed in opposite directions, there could result an unintended \u201ceye in the hurricane\u201d of guilt. If a jury were unanimously persuaded that the defendant was guilty of an unexcused and unjustified homicide but were in a state of absolute equilibrium as to whether that guilt were mitigated or unmitigated, the result, for one caught in the snare of the false affirmative, would be that the homicidal agent would walk free.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr., <em>Criminal Homicide Law, </em>\u00a7 6.5, pp. 139-140 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">For the reasons stated above, there is no merit in the argument that Respondent is entitled to walk free.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\">. <em>Rich v.

Because Respondent\u2019s presence at the scene of the homicide was established by the restaurant\u2019s surveillance camera, and because of what Respondent said during his post-arrest statement, it was obviously in Respondent\u2019s best interest that voluntary manslaughter be included among the potential verdicts. Under these circumstances, if (1) Respondent\u2019s trial counsel had persuaded the Circuit Court that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>manslaughter charge should not go to the jury, and (2) Respondent had been convicted of second degree murder, Respondent would have a strong \"ineffective assistance\u201d argument for post-conviction relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-7\">. Cases rejecting the argument that the murder defendant was entitled to a manslaughter instruction do not provide support for the argument that an appellate court is required to reverse the voluntary manslaughter conviction of a defendant who (1) was charged with murder, (2) argued that he was entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction, (3) persuaded the Circuit Court to deliver that instruction, and (4) was acquitted of murder, but convicted of voluntary manslaughter by the jury. As the Court of Special Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>It is always a defense to prove that one is less culpable than charged. It is not a defense to prove that one is more culpable than charged. One does not defend against a charge of second-degree murder by proving that one was really guilty of first-degree murder. To prove culpability at a given level, the State is not required to disprove greater culpability[J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">Whenever there is doubt as to the appropriate level of guilt, the defendant, of course, receives the benefit of the doubt and is convicted only at the lower level. A defendant is never, however, entitled to total exculpation simply because there is ambiguity as to his level of guilt. Different levels of culpability are not neatly abutting and mutually exclusive so as to render one necessarily inconsistent with the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-13\"><em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>100 Md.App. 468, 476-78, 641 A.2d 990, 993-995 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
