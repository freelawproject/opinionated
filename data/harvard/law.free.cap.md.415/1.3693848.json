Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 362, 739 A.2d 58, 62 (1999). The Statute authorizes a police officer who has \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that a driver \u201cis or has been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol [or] while impaired by alcohol\u201d to request the driver to submit to a test to determine the driver\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (\u201cBAC\u201d). <em>See </em>\u00a7 16.205.1(b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the driver agrees to the test and the test discloses a BAC of 0.15 or greater, then the Statute provides that the officer is to present to the driver an order of automatic suspension by the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d). <em>See </em>\u00a7 16\u2014205.1(b)(3)(i)\u2014(ii). The Statute permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the driver to request a hearing at the Office of Administrative Hearings to show cause why the driver\u2019s license should not be suspended. At that hearing, the driver may challenge, among other matters, whether the officer had the requisite reasonable grounds to make the request for testing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Adam Leigh Shea, Respondent, was stopped by a police officer who observed him driving while not wearing a seatbelt. During the stop, the officer smelled a moderate odor of alcohol emanating from Respondent\u2019s person. The officer conducted field sobriety tests (the results of which are not reflected in the record) and then arrested Respondent. At the police station, the officer advised Respondent of his rights and the potential penalties under the Statute, and asked him if he wished to take a breath test to ascertain his BAC. Respondent agreed to the test. The test result disclosed a BAC of 0.18. Pursuant to the Statute, the officer presented Respondent with an order of administrative suspension of his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Thereafter, Respondent requested a show cause hearing. At the hearing he argued that: (1) the police officer who detained him lacked the requisite reasonable grounds to request the test; and (2) the test result was invalid. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) rejected the first argument and declined to consider the second, reasoning that the Statute did not permit Respondent to make the latter argument at a show cause hearing. The ALJ ordered the suspension of Respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license for 90 days, and, as the Statute authorized the ALJ to do, promptly ordered the suspension stayed for one year, conditioned upon Respondent\u2019s participation in the Ignition Interlock Program. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-205.1(n)(4)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Respondent sought judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, raising in the petition the arguments he had presented to the ALJ.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Baltimore County reversed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>decision of the AL J because, in the court\u2019s view, the record did not contain substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that the officer had reasonable grounds to request the test. In coming to that determination, the court decided, as a preliminary matter, that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to conduct the field sobriety tests and, consequently, \u201call actions thereafter, [including, presumably, the test request and results,] are legally unsupportable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">We granted the MVA\u2019s petition to review the judgment of the Circuit Court. For the reasons that follow, we reverse that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The facts leading to the suspension of Respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license can be briefly stated. On the night of April 24, 2007, Officer William Phelps of the Baltimore City Police Department stopped the vehicle that Respondent was driving. Officer Phelps\u2019s description of the stop is contained on the MVA Form DR-15A he later completed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He wrote: \u201cDriver observed operating vehicle w/o [meaning \u201cwithout\u201d] seat belt on. After being stopped a moderate odor of a(sic) alcohol beverage was emanating from his person\u2014Driver was given SFST\u2019s [meaning \u201cstandard field sobriety tests\u201d] and placed in custody.\u201d We surmise from our reading of the transcript of the hearing before the ALJ that Respondent was charged with one or more alcohol-related driving offenses, and was found guilty of driving while impaired by alcohol. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1977, 2009 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 21-902 of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">After taking Respondent into custody, Officer Phelps drove him to the police station. There, Officer Phelps asked Respondent to submit to a breath test to determine his BAC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>is required by the Statute, Respondent either read, or had read to him, MVA Form DR-15 \u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d and agreed to take the test.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A test technician for the Baltimore City Police Department performed the test and certified that the test produced a result of 0.18 BAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">When a test registers a BAC higher than .08, subsection (b)(3) of the Statute provides, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">the police officer shall: (i) Confiscate the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license issued by this State; (ii) Acting on behalf of the [Motor Vehicle] Administration, personally serve an order of suspension on the person; (iii) Issue a temporary license to drive; [and] (iv) Inform the person that the temporary license allows the person to continue driving for 45 days if the person is licensed under this title [Vehicle Laws\u2014 Drivers\u2019 Licenses].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The Statute further requires the officer to inform the person of his or her right to challenge the license suspension at an administrative \u201cshow cause\u201d hearing, and to inform the person of the sanctions that \u201cshall be imposed in the event of failure to request a hearing, failure to attend a requested hearing, or upon an adverse finding by the hearing officer[.]\u201d \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3)(v)-(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Subsection (b)(3)(viii)(l)~(3) of the Statute also requires the police officer to send, within 72 hours, a sworn statement to the MVA, setting forth the certification of the officer\u2019s \u201creasonable grounds to believe that the person had been driving or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>attempting to drive a motor vehicle ... while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d The officer must also state if \u201cthe person submitted to the test which indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he person was fully advised of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed, including the fact that a person who ... takes a test that indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing is ineligible for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license under subsection (n)(l) or (2) of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The DR-15A Form contained in the record reflects compliance with those statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\n<em>The show cause hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Respondent exercised his right to request a hearing at the Office of Administrative Hearings, at which he had the opportunity to show cause why his license should not be suspended. He was represented by counsel at that hearing. The ALJ received, without objection from Respondent, the MVA forms that were generated in this case: Form DR-15 \u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d; Form DR-15A \u201cCertification and Order of Suspension\u201d; and Form MSP-33 \u201cNotification to Defendant of Result of Test Alcohol Concentration.\u201d The ALJ found, based on those documents, a prima facie case for suspension of Respondent\u2019s license.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See \u00a7 </em>16-205.1(f)(7)(ii) (providing that \u201c[t]he sworn statement of the police officer and of the test technician or analyst shall be prima facie evidence of ... a test result indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing\u201d); \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2)(A) (providing for the sanc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>tion of a 90-day suspension for a first-time offender with a BAC test result of 0.15 or greater).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Respondent called Officer Phelps to testify solely about the test procedure. Officer Phelps testified that the test technician spent \u201cten or fifteen minutes at most\u201d observing Respondent before administering the breath test. Following that testimony, and with Respondent\u2019s agreement that the officer was no longer needed, the ALJ released the officer from the hearing. Respondent then made a motion that no action be taken because, according to the officer\u2019s testimony, the technician did not follow the procedure set forth in the Regulations of the Toxicologist requiring the tester, before administering the test, to observe for twenty minutes the person who is to be given the breathalyzer test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The ALJ responded that \u201c[t]he only thing I\u2019ve got in the file is a certification from [the testing technician] that the test result was a .18\u201d and \u201c[t]here is no direct evidence that the individual ate or drank anything or did anything at all. He was brought in and he took the test and it was a .18 and it\u2019s confirmed by the report and the test strip.\u201d The ALJ thereafter denied the motion, explaining that \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(f)(7)(i) sets forth the only issues to be determined at a hearing and a challenge to the test technician\u2019s failure to follow the proper procedure does not appear among them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Respondent then argued that due, in part, to the lack of information in the record concerning the results of the field sobriety tests, Officer Phelps failed to state reasonable grounds to request Respondent to submit to the breath test. The ALJ rejected that argument, deciding that Officer Phelps had set forth in Form DR-15A reasonable grounds to believe that Respondent was driving under the influence of alcohol. The ALJ noted, in particular, the officer\u2019s detection of a moderate odor of alcohol emanating from Respondent\u2019s person, the officer\u2019s administration of the field sobriety tests, and his subsequent arrest of Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The ALJ then found prima facie evidence, unrebutted by Respondent, that the test result showed an alcohol concentration of more than 0.15. Consequently, the ALJ ordered the suspension of Respondent\u2019s license for 90 days. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2). After discussing with Respondent the Ignition Interlock Program and receiving his agreement to participate in the program, the ALJ stayed the suspension for one year, conditioned upon Respondent\u2019s participation in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\n<em>Judicial review in the Circuit Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">In his petition for judicial review, Respondent raised two challenges to the decision of the ALJ: (1) whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d finding of the ALJ; and (2) whether the ALJ erred by refusing to entertain Respondent\u2019s challenge to the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>of the breathalyzer test results. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court issued a written Opinion and Order reversing the decision of the ALJ on the ground that \u201cthere was not substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Before addressing the merits of Respondent\u2019s contentions, the Circuit Court noted that \u201cthe administration of field sobriety tests by a police officer during a valid traffic stop constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe conduct of those tests is constitutionally permissible when the officer has reasonable articulable suspicion that the driver is under the influence of alcohol.\u201d Then, turning to the present case, the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">The only fact on which the officer relied in deciding to administer the field sobriety test was the \u201cmoderate\u201d smell of alcohol emanating from [Respondent\u2019s] person. Although this fact combined with other factors could provide reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity, i.e., driving under the influence of alcohol, this fact, standing alone, does not rise to that level. As with bloodshot eyes, a \u201cmoderate\u201d smell of alcohol could result from a variety of non-criminal circumstances. It is not illegal for someone age 21 or older to consume alcohol, and a \u201cmoderate\u201d smell could emanate from consumption of only one alcoholic beverage. Further the mere presence in a restaurant or bar where an alcoholic beverage was spilled on one\u2019s clothing, without any consumption of that beverage having occurred, could also result in a \u201cmoderate\u201d smell of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">In the instant case, the only facts found in the hearing record, on which this court can rely, [are] that [Respondent] was stopped for not wearing a seatbelt, and there was a \u201cmoderate\u201d smell of alcohol emanating from his person. In using a totality of circumstances analysis, this court cannot find that these facts alone rise to the level of reasonable articulable suspicion warranting the administration of a field sobriety test. As such, this court believes that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>not substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Addressing Respondent\u2019s claim that the breathalyzer results were invalid because the tester had not followed protocol, the court determined: \u201cAs this court has found that there was no reasonable articulable suspicion to support the officer\u2019s decision to administer the field sobriety test, all actions thereafter are legally unsupportable.\u201d The MVA argues, Respondent does not disagree, and we accept that, in so ruling, the court, without expressly characterizing it as such, applied the Fourth Amendment doctrines known as \u201cthe fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d and \u201cthe exclusionary rule\u201d to reason that the breathalyzer test results could not be used as a basis for the administrative suspension of Respondent\u2019s driving license. Consequently, the court did not reach the merits of Respondent\u2019s challenge related to the validity of the test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The MVA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, pursuant to Maryland Code (2009 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-305 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. We granted the petition, <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shea, </em>406 Md. 744, 962 A.2d 370 (2008), to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">Does a police officer\u2019s certification that a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage was of sufficient strength to suspect that a motorist was driving while impaired by alcohol, along with subsequent field sobriety tests that led to the driver\u2019s arrest, allow an administrative law judge to find reasonable grounds to request an alcohol content test under Transportation Article \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2), without application of Fourth Amendment standards to evaluate the sufficiency of a police officer\u2019s reasonable grounds?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The MVA requests that we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court because there is substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s decision that Officer Phelps had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe that Respondent drove while alcohol-impaired and, therefore, the officer had the authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>request Respondent to submit to a breath test to determine his BAC. The MVA argues, in particular, that the Circuit Court \u201coverstepped its role upon judicial review\u201d; \u201creached its incorrect result by wrongly dissecting each factor stated by the officer and applying incorrect legal standards to each piece of evidence, rather than properly considering the circumstances as a whole\u201d; and \u201cerred by overturning the ALJ\u2019s decision based upon analysis of a constitutional question [i.e., whether the police officer had reasonable suspicion, under the Fourth Amendment, to conduct the field sobriety tests,] that was neither preserved for [judicial] review nor applicable to the case at hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Respondent refutes the MVA\u2019s arguments, contending that the Circuit Court correctly reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision because there was insufficient evidence that Respondent was driving under the influence of or impaired by alcohol to constitute \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d Respondent notes what he characterizes as the omission of \u201ccritical\u201d information at the hearing before the ALJ. He points out that Officer Phelps did not describe any other physical characteristics, such as bloodshot eyes or slurred speech, suggesting that Respondent had consumed alcohol; Respondent did not admit to drinking any alcohol; and the MVA presented no evidence that Respondent was driving erratically. Moreover, Respondent contends that Officer Phelps\u2019s indication on Form DR-15A that the odor of alcohol on Respondent\u2019s breath was \u201cmoderate\u201d is not proof that Respondent was driving while impaired by alcohol because, as the Circuit Court determined, the odor could have resulted from consumption of a single alcoholic beverage or from an alcoholic beverage spilled on Respondent\u2019s clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Respondent further asserts that the Circuit Court correctly determined that administration of the field sobriety tests was an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment because the only evidence suggesting the need for the tests was the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his person, which is insufficient to establish \u201creasonable articulable suspicion\u201d that Respondent had been driving under the influence of or impaired by alcohol. Respondent does not present further argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ment on this point. We shall assume that he agrees with the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling that all actions following the unlawfully conducted field sobriety tests\u2014his arrest, the officer\u2019s request that he submit to the breath test, the administration of the test, and the test results\u2014were also unlawful under the Fourth Amendment as the tainted \u201cfruits\u201d of the field sobriety tests, and, consequently, evidence of those actions, including the test results, could not provide a lawful basis for the administrative sanction imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Judicial review of administrative decision-making is constrained, as we recently reiterated in <em>Delawter:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\"><em>A </em>court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai\">408 Md. at 256-57, 941 A.2d at 1076 (quoting <em>Aviation Administration v.

We have observed more than once that the purpose of the Statute is \u201cto reduce the incidence of drunk driving and to protect public safety by encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests; the statute [is] not meant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>protect drivers.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

In addition, we have held that, \u201c[g]iven the underlying purpose and plain language of \u00a7 16-205.1 requiring a detention and not an arrest,\u201d the phrase \u201creasonable grounds,\u201d in the Statute equates to \u201ca reasonable articulable suspicion,\u201d as that term is understood in Fourth Amendment parlance. <em>Shepard, </em>399 Md. at 254, 256, 923 A.2d at 107,109-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Notwithstanding our holding in <em>Shepard </em>that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d equates to the Fourth Amendment quantum of suspicion in criminal law that is denominated \u201creasonable articulable suspicion,\u201d we have emphasized that the Statute is not to be viewed as \u201cquasi-criminal,\u201d and the goal of the hearing is not to punish, but \u201cto prevent unscrupulous or incompetent persons from engaging in the licensed activity.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 372-73, 739 A.2d at 67-68 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In addition, we have noted that \u201csubsection (f)(7) [of the Statute] makes paramountly clear that the constitutionality of the stop giving rise to the test request is not one of the issues to be presented at the hearing, nor is the possible exclusion of unconstitutionally seized evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 739 A.2d at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We therefore refused in <em>Richards </em>to engraft the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment onto proceedings conducted under subsection (f) of the Statute.

For this and other reasons discussed in <em>Richards, </em>including that there would be \u201cmarginal\u2014if any\u2014deterrent effect of excluding evidence from administrative license suspension proceedings\u201d and that \u201cproceedings, like those under \u00a7 16.205.1(f) are intended to be informal and summary in nature,\u201d we held \u201cthat the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment should not be extended to proceedings conducted pursuant thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376-77, 739 A.2d at 68.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It follows directly from our holding in <em>Richards, </em>and the rationale underpinning that holding, that the Fourth Amendment fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, like the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, is inapplicable to license suspension proceedings conducted pursuant to the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We turn now to decide whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the ALJ\u2019s final decision that Officer Phelps had reasonable grounds, pursuant to the Statute, to request Respondent to take a test to determine his BAG. Preliminarily, notwithstanding that our role is not to review the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment, but rather to review the decision of the ALJ, <em>see Loyola College, </em>406 Md. at 66-67, 956 A.2d at 173, we must explain why the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Court made several legal errors in reversing the ALJ\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">To begin, the Circuit Court exceeded the bounds of judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision by employing a rationale for reversing that decision that was not advanced by Respondent at the show cause hearing, was not the basis of the ALJ\u2019s final decision, and was not presented to the Circuit Court by Respondent. <em>See Brodie, </em>367 Md. at 4, 785 A.2d at 749. Even more problematic is that the Circuit Court ran directly afoul of <em>Richards </em>by employing a constitutional analysis of Officer Phelps\u2019s conduct preceding and including his request of Respondent to take a test to determine his BAC, and then letting that analysis determine the correctness of the ALJ\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The only relevant question before the Circuit Court was whether there was substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the ALJ\u2019s decision that Officer Phelps had reasonable grounds to request Respondent to take the test. Whether the officer had reasonable suspicion, under a Fourth Amendment analysis, to conduct field sobriety tests is simply irrelevant to whether the officer possessed reasonable grounds to request the breathalyzer test. The court\u2019s misplaced focus on the officer\u2019s compliance with the Fourth Amendment in conducting the field sobriety tests led, in turn, to the court\u2019s flawed conclusion that \u201call actions thereafter are legally unsupportable\u201d and, therefore, the ALJ lacked a substantial basis for deciding that the police officer had reasonable grounds to request the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">As for the final decision of the ALJ, there was substantial evidence to support it. We have said that the test for substantial evidence is \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached,\u201d giving deference to the ALJ\u2019s prerogative to find the facts and draw reasonable inferences from them. <em>Delawter, </em>403 Md. at 256-57, 941 A.2d at 1076 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We also bear in mind that, in determining whether the ALJ had substantial evidence upon which to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>decide whether Officer Phelps had reasonable grounds to request the test, we are guided by <em>Shepard, </em>in which we held that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d means \u201creasonable articulable suspicion.\u201d 399 Md. at 254, 923 A.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Reasonable suspicion is a \u201c \u2018common sense, Nontechnical conception that considers factual and practical aspects of daily life and how reasonable and prudent people act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crosby v. State, </em>408 Md. 490, 507, 970 A.2d 894, 903-04 (2009) (quoting <em>Bost v. State, </em>406 Md. 341, 356, 958 A.2d 356, 365 (2008)). Reasonable suspicion requires less in the way of quantity and quality of evidence than is required for probable cause, <em>see Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301, 308 (1990), \u201cand it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard,\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 274, 122 S.Ct. 744, 751, 151 L.Ed.2d 740, 750 (2002). Nevertheless, reasonable suspicion \u201cembraces something more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch,\u201d and the determination \u201cmust be based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 507, 970 A.2d at 904 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The analysis requires courts to give appropriate deference to the training and experience of the law enforcement officer and to the officer\u2019s ability to make reasonable inferences from his or her observations, based on that training and experience. <em>See id., </em>408 Md. at 508, 970 A.2d at 904; <em>accord Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 266, 122 S.Ct. at 750-51, 151 L.Ed.2d at 749-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The evidence before the ALJ supported the ALJ\u2019s first-level findings that, after stopping Respondent for not wearing a seatbelt, Officer Phelps detected a moderate odor of alcohol emanating from Respondent\u2019s person, the officer then conducted field sobriety tests, and he then took Respondent into custody. The \u201cmoderate odor\u201d of alcohol alone may have been enough to permit Officer Phelps reasonably to suspect that Respondent was driving while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol. We need not decide that question, however, because the ALJ was permitted to infer, as he obviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>did, that Officer Phelps arrested Respondent because his performance on the tests suggested alcohol impairment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Given the low quantum of suspicion necessary for \u201creasonable grounds,\u201d we hold that the administrative record contained substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s final decision that Officer Phelps had the requisite reasonable grounds to request Respondent to take the breathalyzer test. The Circuit Court erred in coming to the contrary conclusion and reversing the final decision of the ALJ on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We have one matter remaining. Because the Circuit Court excluded all evidence that was the product of the field sobriety tests and therefore reversed the ALJ\u2019s final decision on that ground, the court declined to address Respondent\u2019s argument that the ALJ improperly relied upon the results of the breathalyzer test in ordering the sanction of license suspension. We therefore remand the case with instructions to decide that issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

The Statute itself does not contain an exclusionary rule for evidence obtained in violation of it. <em>Shepard, </em>399 Md. at 266-67, 923 A.2d at 114-15. \"[I]n the absence of a statute or a rule promulgated by this Court, the Circuit Court does not have the inherent power to create an exclusionary rule of evidence under a statute that itself does not have an exclusionary rule\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). <em>Thompson v.
