As a result of our holding in <em>Bennett, </em>in 2001, the General Assembly enacted Ch. 286 of the Acts of 2001, an emergency measure \u201cclarifying that the monetary limits on the liability of a local government under the [LGTCA] apply to claims against local governments when named as defendants[.]\u201d Since April 20, 2001, C.J. \u00a7 5-303(a) has, in pertinent part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">(a) <em>Limitation on </em>liability,\u2014(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the liability of a local government may not exceed $200,000 per an individual claim, and $500,000 per total claims that arise from the same occurrence for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions, or liability arising under subsection (b) of this section and indemnification under subsection (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">The terms, \u201cindividual claim,\u201d and \u201csame occurrence,\u201d are not defined in the LGTCA. Appellant argues that, under C.J. \u00a7 5-303(a), Appellee\u2019s Second Amended Complaint asserts only one \u201cindividual claim,\u201d and the alleged contamination of Appellee\u2019s property constitutes the \u201csame occurrence.\u201d Appellee argues that it is entitled to assert an \u201cindividual claim\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>for each day that its property is contaminated, and that claims based upon different levels of pollution on different days are not claims that arise from the \u201csame occurrence.\u201d These arguments present us with an issue of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">In <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 987 A.2d 18 (2010), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature. A court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting statutory language is to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision under scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">To ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, we begin with the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with \u201cforced or subtle interpretations\u201d that limit or extend its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we conf\u00edne strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">Where the words of a statute are ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, or where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme, a court must resolve the ambiguity by searching for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process. In resolving ambiguities, a court considers the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws, its general purpose, and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">In every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 274-76, 987 A.2d at 28-29 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">It is clear that the limitation on liability provision was enacted \u201cfor the purpose of limiting the civil liability of local government.\u201d S. Judicial Proceedings Comm., Summary of Com. Rep., S.B. 287, pg. 3 (Md.1987). The current \u201ccap\u201d amounts resulted from a compromise reached by a Conference Committee convened when \u201cneither house concurred in the other\u2019s proposed amendments to H.B. 253 or S.B. 237[J\u201d <em>Bennett, supra, </em>359 Md. at 378, 754 A.2d at 379. The legislative history includes the following explanation for the cap:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6y\">The $100,000 per occurrence cap has both historic and statutory precedent. Since 1971, Boards of Education that are self-insured have been able to raise immunity for judgments in excess of $100,000. Presently, liability may be limited to $100,000 per occurrence. Further, the State\u2019s liability in action for which the State is self-insured is limited to $50,000 per individual and $100,000 per occurrence. These limits are established by regulations issued by the State Treasurer pursuant to amendments to the State Tort Claims Act effective in 1985. Thus, the cap is consistent with existing law. Considering that local governments will be paying judgments in situations where they could have previously avoided liability, the cap is equitable. The cap is necessary so that local governments can predict exposure for both insurance and budgetary purposes. Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>local governments provide vital services, unlimited recovery prudents [sic] the prospect of severely impeding the provision of such services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Office of the Governor, Governor\u2019s Legislative Office, Briefing Paper H.B. 258/S.B. 237, 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The legislative history also includes the following testimony presented to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee by Maureen Lamb, then Vice President of the Maryland Association of Counties, and Chair of that organization\u2019s Legislative Committee, as well as a member of the Anne Arundel County Council:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">In the Spring of 1985 the Legislative Committee of the Maryland Association of Counties became aware of the problems that local governments were having in purchasing insurance.... In analyzing the situation it was soon realized that the problem was greater than merely a down cycle of the insurance market. Insurance companies were not only raising prices, they were abandoning the business of insuring governments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">S. Judicial Proceedings Committee, Testimony of Maureen Lamb (Feb. 25,1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In <em>Bennett, supra, </em>this Court summarized \u201cthe status of local governmental immunity from suit up to and including the enactment of the LGTCA[.]\u201d 359 Md. at 358-361, 754 A.2d at 368-69. In light of the fact that the LGTCA was enacted at a time when local governments were having problems purchasing insurance, we conclude that the General Assembly intended that courts would use the insurance industry\u2019s definitions of \u201cindividual claim\u201d and \u201csame occurrence\u201d when applying C.J. \u00a7 5-303(a). This conclusion is consistent with <em>Folz v. New Mexico, </em>110 N.M. 457, 797 P.2d 246 (1990) in which, while holding that all injuries resulting from \u201cthe discrete event of one runaway truck\u201d (that collided with several different vehicles) constituted a \u201csingle occurrence\u201d under New Mexico\u2019s Tort Claims Act, the New Mexico Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apy\">[T]he legislature certainly might have used the term \u201csingle occurrence\u201d in a different sense than the one used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the insurance industry. In addition, principles of statutory construction and contract circumstances may lead to differing interpretations of similar terms. The Tort Claims Act is in derogation of plaintiffs\u2019 common-law right to sue the defendants and, therefore, is strictly construed <em>Methola v. County of Eddy, </em>95 N.M. 329, 622 P.2d 234 (1980); <em>see also Holiday Management Co. v. City of Santa Fe, </em>94 N.M. 368, 610 P.2d 1197 (1980) (declining to construe waiver provisions of Tort Claims Act in a manner inconsistent with remedial purpose of common-law abrogation of sovereign immunity). While the limitation of liability may form one of the objectives of both insurance companies and the New Mexico legislature, the Tort Claims Act also embodies a governmental desire to balance with this objective the needs of citizens for compensation and the need to impose duties of reasonable care on public employees. See NMSA 1978, \u00a7 41-4-2 (Repl.Pamp.1989). Nevertheless, when the legislature does not provide an express definition of an essential statutory term, it must be assumed that the legislature was aware of the construction given that term in the judicial decisions of other jurisdictions. <em>Cf. Buzbee v. Donnelly, </em>96 N.M. 692, 699-700, 634 P.2d 1244, 1251-52 (1981) (interpreting undefined statutory term \u201cdirectly negating] ... guilt\u201d in terms of case-law interpretation of the term \u201cdirect evidence\u201d). Cases that determine what constitutes a \u201csingle occurrence\u201d within the financial limitations of a contract for liability insurance are, therefore, of some relevance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 250 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Under C.J. \u00a7 5-303(a), if a local government negligently fails to comply with applicable state and federal regulations pertaining to a particular landfill, and that negligence is the proximate cause of contamination to one or more adjacent properties, each adjacent property owner\u2019s claim for money damages would constitute an \u201cindividual claim,\u201d regardless of how many theories of recovery are asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>In Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, the term \u201cclaim\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\">1.

Continental Ins. Co. </em>[343 Md. 216], 680 A.2d 1082, 1091 (Md.1996). For example, in <em>United Services Automobile Ass\u2019n v. Baggett </em>[209 Cal.App.3d 1387], 258 Cal.Rptr. 52 (Ct.App.1989), the court held that there was a single occurrence when the policyholder negligently struck the decedent\u2019s vehicle immediately before a third vehicle struck both vehicles, killing the decedent who was standing next to her vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 58. If liability is based on the policyholder\u2019s general policy or practice, the tendency is to treat all claims based on that policy as involving one occurrence. <em>See, e.g., Chemstar Corp. [Inc.] v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>41 F.3d 429, 433 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that faulty plaster pitting in 28 separate homes constituted a single occurrence under manufacturer\u2019s liability insurance policy where essential cause of the losses was the manufacturer\u2019s failure to warn which consisted of its failure to mark properly bags in which its product was shipped to ultimate users); <em>Mead Reinsurance v. Granite State Ins. Co., </em>873 F.2d 1185, 1188 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that when insured\u2019s liability must be based on custom or policy, such as municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. 1983, there was necessarily only one occurrence); <em>Transport Ins.

Lee Way Motor Freight, Inc., </em>487 F.Supp. 1325, 1326 (N.D.Tex.1980) (holding that there was one occurrence when all discrimination claims were based on policyholder\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>pattern and practice of discrimination). A few courts have reached contrary results by emphasizing any temporal disparity between the loss inflicting events. For example, in <em>American Indemnity Co. v. McQuaig, </em>435 So.2d 414 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1983), the policyholder fired three shotgun blasts at two deputy sheriffs within a period of less than two minutes. <em>Id. </em>at 415.

While ruling that those deliveries constituted a \u201csingle continuous occurrence,\u201d Judge Weinstein stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">Identifying the deliveries as the single continuous occurrence is well supported by similar resolutions in other cases. In <em>E.B. Michaels v.

Indemnity Insurance Co., </em>7 N.Y.2d 222, 196 N.Y.S.2d 678, 164 N.E.2d 704 (1959) ]). The 200 bucket drops were a single occurrence because</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">the unloading of the heavy steel scrap obviously could not have been accomplished in a single lifting. The cargo was such that continuous liftings over a period of time, in this instance several days, were required to complete the discharge. Unloading the cargo was a unified and continuous function until completion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\"><em>Michaels, </em>472 F.Supp. at 29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">The identical characterization is appropriate to the delivery of Agent Orange. It could not have been accomplished in one batch, because the large quantity purchased necessitated numerous freightcar loads. Continuous shipments over a period of time, in this case months, were required to complete the supply the military needed. Shipment was a uniform, routinized, almost daily function until completion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">Relying in part on Michaels, the court in <em>Unigard Insurance Co. v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., </em>111 Idaho 891, 728 P.2d 780, 782 (Ct.App.1986), applied the \u201cfunctional event\u201d test to a snow clearing operation which separately damaged 98 storage shed doors over four hours. The court found the event to be \u201ccontinuous and repetitive\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>and therefore held it was a single occurrence. <em>Id. </em>728 P.2d at 788. <em>See also Weissblum v.

City Ct., Trial Term, Bronx Co.1961) (following <em>Johnson, </em>damage to 189 light fixtures during repair of 4500 windows held to be one occurrence).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\">Finding a single continuous occurrence is especially apt in cases, like <em>[In re </em>] <em>Agent Orange [Product Liability Litigation, </em>597 F.Supp. 740 (1984) ], of mass deliveries of hazardous products ultimately imposing damage on large numbers of people. In <em>Household Manufacturing, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>slip op., No. 85-C-8519 [1987 WL 6611] (N.D.Ill. Feb. 10, 1987), the court applied New York law to multiple separate deliveries of defective plumbing units. It held that the \u201cnumerous shipments\u201d on a \u201cmass basis\u201d in which \u201cit was anticipated that any defects in the system would affect a large number of persons in the chain of distribution\u201d were a unitary \u201c \u2018continuous and repeated exposure\u2019 to the same conditions.\u201d In <em>American Universal Insurance Co. v. McCloskey Varnish Co., </em>slip op., No. 83-5161 (E.D.Pa. Mar. 19, 1985), the insured had manufactured and sold defective resins over a year-long period to a distributer, who had in turn sold the resins to customers. The court found the practice of supplying the distributor to be a single occurrence, rejecting the view that each shipment or each ultimate injury was a separate occurrence. In <em>Cargill, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>488 F.Supp. 49 (D.Minn.1979), aff'd, 621 F.2d 275 (8th Cir.1980) (per curiam), the manufacturer of a nutrient medium for cultivating erythromycin (a pharmaceutical drug) negligently altered the composition of the \u201cGrits 3500\u201d nutrient. The insurer urged that each sale of the defective Grits 3500 was a separate occurrence. The court held that \u201cthere was but one occurrence, even though numerous production \u2018batches\u2019 of erythromycin were affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53. In <em>Champion International Corp. v.

In <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. The Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>399 F.Supp. 12 (W.D.Pa.1975), the insured manufactured a defective resin-former oil. The court observed that \u201cbecause this manufacturer was dealing in bulk raw materials it is regularly foreseeable that any defect in the product or negligence in its manufacture would affect a large number of divers persons in the chain of distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. One insurer urged a single occurrence, while a second insurer urged multiple occurrences. The court found one accident to have occurred, encompassing all sales of the product. <em>Id. </em>at 21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\">It is apparent that the herbicide deliveries were so numerous, uniform, routinized and regularized, at such steady and frequent intervals, that they merged into one continuous and repeated event.
