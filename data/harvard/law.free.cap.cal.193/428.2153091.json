The decision of the trial court in sustaining the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the petition herein was evidently based upon the fact that the petitioner was not a mutual insurance company organized under the laws of this state and for that reason did not come within the permissive authority given to boards of trustees of school districts to place insurance upon the school property of their respective districts under the provisions of section 1608, subdivision 3, of the Political Code. The said section of said code, as it stood at the time the contract of insurance involved in this proceeding was entered into-, read, in part, as follows: \u201c1608. Boards of School Trustees and city Boards of Education shall have power and it shall be their duties. . . . Third. To furnish repair and insure, and in its discretion rent, the school property of their respective districts, such insurance to be written in any solvent insurance company doing business in this state or in any mutual insurance company organized under the laws of this state.\u201d It would seem that the foregoing provision of the Political Code is susceptible of an interpretation which is at once simple and natural and which is entirely relieved of the labored and involved reasoning insisted upon by the appellant as the proper means of arriving at its meaning.  Boards of Trustees of school districts possess no authority to- place insurance of the school property of their respective districts other than granted</p>\n<p id=\"A99\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>to them by the foregoing section of the Political Code. Its mode is the measure of their power.  It is a cardinal rule applicable to the interpretation of statutes that in order to ascertain the intent of the legislature in enacting the same, recourse must first be had to the language of the statute itself; and that if the words of the enactment given their ordinary and proper signification are reasonably free from ambiguity and uncertainty, the courts will look no further to ascertain its meaning. <em>(Bynan </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>35 Cal. 634; <em>Sharon </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>75 Cal. 1-28 [16 Pac. 345]; <em>Merkley </em>v. <em>Witham, </em>3 Cal. App. 268 [84 Pac. 1015]; <em>King </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>9 Cal. App. 368 [99 Pac. 527]; <em>Sacramento Co. </em>v. <em>Glann, </em>14 Cal. App. 780 [113 Pac. 360]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Union Oil Co., </em>166 Cal. 217 [135 Pac. 966].)  The obvious meaning to be given to the language of said section of the Political Code is this, that boards of school trustees are given power and it is their duty to insure the school property of their respective districts in any solvent insurance company doing business in this state, provided that if they select a mutual insurance company to carry their insurance it must be a mutual insurance company organized under the laws of this state. The question as to whether the mutual insurance company to which the choice of boards of trustees of school districts is thus confined is solvent or insolvent does not arise in this case, for the reason that the petitioner herein does not come within such limitation and was, therefore, not qualified in either event to be awarded this insurance. It follows that the respondent herein in her capacity of county superintendent of schools of San Bernardino County properly refused to approve the petitioner\u2019s warrant for the premium upon its void insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Myers, J., Lawlor, J., Lennon, J., Waste, J., and Seawell, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
