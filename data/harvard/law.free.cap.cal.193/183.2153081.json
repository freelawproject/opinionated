The statute in that regard provides that the \u201csaid notice must be'filed within ten days after notice of entry of the judgment, order or decree, or if the proceedings on motion for a new trial be pending within ten days after notice of decision ' denying said motion, or of other termination thereof.\u201d  We think the proper interpretation of the section permits the filing of the notice at any time after notice of the entry of the judgment, and before the expiration of ten days \u201cafter notice of decision\u201d on motion for a new trial. The notice was given during that period and was sufficient. The respondent should have certified to the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Let a peremptory writ issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
