The petitioner was convicted of the crime of robbery after a prior conviction of a felony. <em>(In re Heath, </em>49 Cal. App. 657 [194 Pac. 68].) The punishment fixed by law is life imprisonment. <em>(In re Heath, supra; </em>secs. 213 and 667, Pen. Code.) The petitioner contends that inasmuch as the indeterminate sentence law does not apply <em>(In re Heath, </em>supra), that it was the duty of the trial court, under section 12 of the Penal Code, to have fixed the term of imprisonment. Section 13 provides that the sentence shall be fixed by the court \u201cwhenever in this code the punishment for a crime is left undetermined between certain limits.\u2019\u2019  In the' case at bar, in view of the fact that the only sentence possible was one for life imprisonment, the sentence and judgment were sufficiently specific. <em>(In re Heath, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
