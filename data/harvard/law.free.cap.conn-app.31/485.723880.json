The named defendant and the defendant James R. DeVito were defaulted for failure to disclose a defense. Darien Asphalt Paving, Inc., and Darien Asphalt Paving, Inc., doing business as F.G.B. Paving and Excavating Company (hereafter referred to as Darien) were permitted to intervene as defendants by virtue of their allegation that a mechanic\u2019s lien they held on the rights of access to the five lots had priority over the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Darien now appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment finding that the mechanic\u2019s lien in question does not encompass the property covered by the mortgage and, therefore, has no priority over it. Darien claims that the trial court (1) improperly extended the scope of its foreclosure judgment to include property interests either not mortgaged to the plaintiff or not included in the plaintiff\u2019s lis pendens, (2) improperly permitted the plaintiff to amend his complaint at trial to allege an easement by way of necessity, and (3) incorrectly found that an easement of necessity existed. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The record reveals the following facts. On March 29, 1989, the plaintiff loaned $750,000 to the defendants Girouard Estates, Inc. (Girouard), and James R. DeVito. As security for repayment of the note, Girou-ard granted the plaintiff a mortgage on five lots in the Girouard Estates subdivision in Norwalk. A mortgage deed was filed on the Norwalk land records on March 29, 1989. Along with the mortgage on the five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>lots, the plaintiff was explicitly granted the \u201cright to pass and repass the roadways\u201d that are shown on two maps recorded in the Norwalk land records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The maps describe the Girouard Estates subdivision, including the five lots mortgaged to the plaintiff, as well as the streets laid out to service the subdivision. Of the five mortgaged lots, three have no independent access to public roads outside the subdivision and, therefore, must gain such access through the roadways shown on the subdivision maps.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Following a default by the defendants Girouard and DeVito on payment of the loan, the plaintiff began an action to foreclose his mortgage on the five lots. The plaintiffs lis pendens, filed on the Norwalk land records on January 4, 1990, described the same five lots listed in his mortgage deed but did not describe any easements appurtenant to the lots. At the time the complaint was filed, Darien was not named as a defendant. The trial court later granted Darien\u2019s motion to be made a party defendant, however, based on Darien\u2019s alleged priority interest in the property mortgaged to the plaintiff by virtue of a mechanic\u2019s lien Darien had recorded before the plaintiff filed the lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">On March 19, 1992, the trial court granted a judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of the plaintiff. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that, while the mortgage deed makes specific reference to the rights of access in which Darien claimed an interest, \u201cthere is no such provision in the mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d Rather, the lien appeared \u201cto have been filed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>whole subdivision with certain lots including those covered by the mortgage excluded.\u201d The court noted that while Darien claimed that the rights of access are an integral part of the fee interest in each of the lots, this very argument defeated its claim. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether Darien\u2019s mechanic\u2019s hen encompassed property covered by the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. Darien claims that the trial court improperly extended the scope of its judgment of strict foreclosure to include property interests either not mortgaged to the plaintiff or not included in the plaintiff\u2019s lis pendens. Darien bases this claim on its contention that the plaintiff is only entitled to foreclose the five lots specifically described in the mortgage deed and the lis pendens. Darien claims that although the lots were explicitly excepted from its mechanic's lien, the rights of access to the lots were not so excepted, and the trial court \u201cpurported to grant strict foreclosure over ways of access or over the roads themselves\u201d without recognizing Darien\u2019s \u201cpriority as to the roads and access and easements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that he never sought to foreclose any interest he held in the roadways and that, contrary to Darien\u2019s assertion, the trial court did not grant the plaintiff strict foreclosure of any property other than the five lots themselves. Darien, in its reply brief, counters that the plaintiff did not pursue direct foreclosure of its rights of access granted in the mortgage deed because the roads were properly liened, and that to avoid the priority of the lien, the plaintiff claimed, instead, an easement of necessity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Some additional background information is necessary to better comprehend the parties\u2019 competing claims. In May, 1988, Girouard conveyed by mortgage deed twenty-six of the subdivision lots, together with roadways shown on map Nos. 10612 and 10613, to Norwalk Savings Society (bank) to secure a $2.5 million loan. That mortgage deed was recorded on May 31, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On March 14, 1989, Darien signed a contract with Girouard to build roads and other improvements in the Girouard Estates subdivision. The work began on March 20, 1989, and ended in August, 1989. Darien recorded its mechanic\u2019s lien on the Norwalk land records on October 13, 1989. The effective date of that lien related back to March 20, 1989.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">When Darien placed its lien on the property, however, Norwalk Savings had a priority interest in twenty-three of the subdivision lots,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as the roadways, by virtue of its previously recorded mortgage deed. On March 23,1989, the bank quitclaimed its interest in the five lots that were later mortgaged by Girouard and DeVito to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In September, 1990, following a default by Girouard and DeVito, the bank instituted an action to foreclose its mortgage. On July 22,1992, the Superior Court in Stamford rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of the bank. Darien was defaulted in that action for failure to disclose a defense, the law days passed, and title to the property became absolute in the bank. As part of the judgment in that action, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ordered that, in accordance with a stipulation between the bank and Darien, the \u201cjudgment entered in that action does not affect access to or the right to pass and re-pass over the roadways for all legal purposes\u201d of the five lots that are the subject of the present action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both parties agree that this stipulation did nothing to diminish the fee interest of the bank in the roads themselves; its only purpose was to \u201cpreserve\u201d whatever interests Darien might have in the rights of access to those roads. Darien did not appeal from that judgment and now concedes that it has no interest in those eighteen lots or the roadways, themselves, absolute title to which is now held by the bank.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Darien intervened in the present action, however, to claim that it still has a viable lien with respect to property covered by the plaintiffs mortgage on the five lots.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because Darien\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was prior in time to the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, the validity of its lien depends on whether the lien properly covers the property covered by the mortgage. To resolve this, we look first to the language of the lien itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Our review indicates that the first page of Darien\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien states that Darien \u201cfurnished material and performed excavation, grading, paving, hauling and other related services in the lateration, improvement and addition to the site, buildings, and structure and site development located at Murray Street and Cranbury Road, being the same premises as appear on Map No. 10612 and Map 10613 in the land records of the Town of Norwalk . . . .\u201d More detailed descriptions of the property are contained in an attached Schedule A.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Schedule A contains metes and bounds descriptions of the Girouard Estates subdivision. A clause following these property descriptions explicitly excepts from the scope of the lien certain of the subdivision lots, including the five lots that were subsequently mortgaged to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the beginning of trial, Darien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>conceded that the lots themselves were excepted from the scope of the lien, and contended only that its lien encompassed certain rights of access to the subdivision roads which were appurtenant to these lots. After the plaintiff was permitted to amend his complaint, however, Darien amended its own position, to make the novel claim that its lien on the plaintiffs rights of access extended to the lots, themselves, because the right to pass and repass the roadways is an integral part of the lots.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At oral argument before this court, however, Darien retreated to its former position, stating that the only interests subject to its mechanic\u2019s lien were the rights of access.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found that \u201c[wjhile the access roads appear on the maps for the whole subdivision and the defendant claims they are an integral part of the fee interest in each of the lots, the exclusion of the numbered lots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>from the land would seem to include the access roads as integral parts of the fee interest. In other words, the very argument made by the defendant to claim the land not as priority applies as well to the excepted lots.\u201d We agree that Darien\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">There is no question that the subdivision improvements that Darien performed were lienable. <em>Pomarico </em>v. <em>Gary Construction, Inc., </em>5 Conn. App. 106, 497 A.2d 70, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 816, 499 A.2d 1336 (1985). There is also no question that Darien could have placed a lien on the <em>entire subdivision, </em>including the five lots in question here, even though the five lots were quitclaimed before Darien actually recorded its lien. Id., 109-10. Such a lien would have attached to all of the lots in the subdivision and would have been prior to any subsequent encumbrances. In <em>Pomarico </em>v. <em>Gary Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 109-10, we noted that \u201c[w]hen General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 was amended in 1974, the mechanic\u2019s lien was extended to encompass claims for materials furnished or services rendered \u2018 \u201cin the improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land . . . .\u201d \u2019 <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>[180 Conn. 545, 553-54, 429 A.2d 796 (1980)].\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The contractor in <em>Pomarico </em>recorded a lien on March 14,1983, covering site development work performed between September, 1982, and January, 1983. A blanket lien had been placed on thirteen lots, some of which had been sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>before the lien was recorded. The trial court determined that the lien was invalid because it failed to conform to the \u201clienable unit\u201d requirement and failed to identify the particular premises against which the lien was claimed. We reversed, holding that the statute, as amended, eliminated the lienable unit requirement and finding that the lien fell \u201cwithin the site development purview of General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 as amended.\u201d Id., 111. Had Darien, like the contractor in <em>Pomar ico, </em>filed a blanket lien on the entire subdivision, there would have been a mechanic\u2019s lien attached to the five lots which was prior in time to the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Darien, instead, explicitly excepted the plaintiff\u2019s five lots from the coverage of its lien. The validity of its lien, therefore, depends on whether it can properly claim an interest in the plaintiff\u2019s property by virtue of a lien covering only the rights of access to the lots. While the language of General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 (a) makes the roadwork Darien performed on the Girou-ard Estates subdivision <em>lienable, </em>\u00a7 49-33 (b) describes specifically the property that may be subject to such a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The plain language of the \u00a7 49-33 (b) specifies that a lien for lot improvements or site development work performed by a contractor is a claim <em>\u201con the .. . lot or </em>. . . <em>on the plot of land\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Elimination of the \u201clienable unit\u201d requirement simply means that it is no longer necessary to lien a particular lot in a subdivision; the whole plot may be liened. Elimination of that requirement did nothing, however, to change the general rule that \u201c[t]he real property against which a mechanic\u2019s lien may be enforced is any property which can be assigned, transferred, mortgaged, or sold under execution as a separate and distinct entity.\u201d 53 Am. Jur. 2d 777, Mechanics\u2019 Liens \u00a7 252 (1970). Rights of access to subdivision roadways fall into none of these categories. By explicitly exclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ing the five lots, Darien removed both the lots and any rights of access appurtenant to them from the scope of its lien.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Those access rights, if they existed at all, were not independently lienable.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Rights of access are, by nature, easements appurtenant to the land. \u201c[A]n easement appurtenant . . . attaches to the land and every part of it.\u201d <em>Murphy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>131 Conn. 292, 306, 40 A.2d 177 (1944). \u201cAn easement appurtenant lives with the land. It is a parasite which cannot exist without a particular parcel of realty. An appurtenant easement is incapable of existence separate and apart from the particular land to which it is annexed. . . . [An easement appurtenant] inheres in the land and cannot exist separate from it nor can it be converted into an easement in gross.\u201d 2 G. Thompson, Real Property (1980) \u00a7 322, pp. 63-64. An appurtenant easement cannot be conveyed by the party entitled to it separate from the land to which it is appurtenant. Id. Further, because of the incorporeal nature of an easement appurtenant, its owner cannot be dis-seized or otherwise ousted of it; he can only be disturbed or obstructed in its enjoyment. <em>Waterbury Trust Co. </em>v. <em>G. L. D. Realty Co., </em>121 Conn. 50, 53, 182 A.2d 466 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Whatever access rights the plaintiff had to roads in the Girouard Estates subdivision were appurtenant to his five lots. We need not decide whether the plaintiff had an express right to pass and repass the subdivision roads by virtue of the quitclaim deed from Girou-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ard, or an implied easement over the roads by reference to maps, or an implied easement of necessity because some of the lots are landlocked. In <em>any </em>case, such an easement cannot be not subject to a mechanic\u2019s lien independent of a lien on the land to which it is appurtenant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The mechanic\u2019s lien filed by Darien explicitly removed from its scope a number of lots in the Girouard Estates subdivision, including the five lots mortgaged to the plaintiff. We strongly agree with Darien that the provisions of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute \u201c \u2018should be liberally construed in order to implement its remedial purpose of furnishing security for one who provides services or materials. . . . Our interpretation, however, may not depart from reasonable compliance with the specific terms of the statute under the guise of liberal construction.\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P.C., </em>217 Conn. 361, 364, 585 A.2d 1210 (1991).\u201d <em>First Constitution Bank </em>v. <em>Harbor Village Limited Partnership, </em>31 Conn App. 15, 18, 622 A.2d 1063 (1992). We therefore conclude that the trial court properly found that the lien in question did not encompass any property covered by the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Because our resolution of this issue is dispositive of Darien\u2019s appeal, we need not address its remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> The mortgage deed describes the property as \u201cLot Nos. 2, 8, 15, 17 and 24, on those certain maps entitled \u2018Subdivision of GIROUARD ESTATES Norwalk Connecticut\u2019 . . . which maps are on file in the Office of the Town Clerk of the City of Norwalk as Map Nos. 10612 and 10613.
