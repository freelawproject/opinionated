We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The following facts are pertinent to this appeal. The plaintiff, Concept Associates, Ltd., filed a timely appeal to the board of tax review of the town of Guilford (board). On March 31, 1992, the board affirmed the challenged assessment. On May 6, 1992, pursuant to Public Acts 1991, No. 91-221, \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Superior Court. The plaintiff\u2019s summons specified as a return date May 28,1992, a Thursday, rather than May 26, 1992, a Tuesday. The complaint was served on the defendants on May 7, 1992, and was filed in the Superior Court on May 14, 1992. On May 28,1992, the defendants filed an appearance in the trial court. On June 26, 1992, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the summons specified a return date of Thursday, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>rather than a return date of Tuesday, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-48.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 2, 1992, the plaintiff filed a motion to amend<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-72.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs motion to amend sought the trial court\u2019s permission to correct the return date from May 28, 1992 to May 26, 1992. The defendants objected to the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss on September 4, 1992. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The plaintiff argues that General Statutes \u00a7 52-72 provides the vehicle by which it can amend its process to reflect the correct return date. The defendants, on the other hand, argue that the plaintiff cannot amend its civil process because the return date had already passed at the time the motion to amend had been filed in the trial court and therefore, the court did not have jurisdiction to consider the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">\u201cStatutory limitations ... for the return of process implement the speedy determination of the issues involved. . . . Such time limitations on the enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>ment of a right, created by statute and not existing at common law, [are] a part of the right and must be met in order to provide a court with jurisdiction to hear the cause of action. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bergin </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>3 Conn. App. 566, 569, 490 A.2d 543, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 806, 494 A.2d 903 (1985). \u201c[A]n improperly specified return date affects the court\u2019s jurisdiction. . . . [An] incorrect return date should not be viewed lightly. The defect of an improper return day is not a minor defect. Rather ... an improper return day is a defect which could not be corrected at all until [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-72 was enacted.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>18 Conn. App. 488, 495-96, 558 A.2d 1029 (1989). \u201c \u2018[I]t is the actual return of the writ to the court which really puts the action before the court and empowers the court to proceed ....\u2019\u201d <em>Arpaia </em>v. <em>Corrone, </em>18 Conn. App. 539, 541, 559 A.2d 719 (1989). Until such time as a proper return is made to the court, that court does not have jurisdiction to consider the matter. Even though a defendant in a civil action may consent to the jurisdiction of the court, that court will still not have the power to proceed with the action until a proper return of process is made to the court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>supra, is misplaced. In <em>Carlson, </em>in upholding the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, this court recognized that \u00a7 52-72 allows for \u201c \u2018a proper amendment to civil process which has been made returnable to the wrong return day. . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., 495. In <em>Carlson, </em>however, the motion to dismiss was filed before the date for return had passed, and there was no indication whether the amendment was filed before or after the return day had passed. That decision, therefore, is not controlling under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In <em>Arpaia </em>v. <em>Corrone, </em>supra, by contrast, this court held that when the return of service is not timely, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>is a defect that cannot be cured by amendment. The rationale for this proposition is that once the date for return has passed there is nothing before the court that can be amended. Id., 540-41. The same rationale applies here. The plaintiff\u2019s summons in this case failed to state a correct return date. Therefore, there was no proceeding before the trial court. The plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the return day was filed after the date for return had passed. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s motion attempted to amend an action that was not properly before the trial court and must fail. The trial court\u2019s dismissal of the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\"> The defendants are the named defendant and the town of Guilford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\"> Public Acts 1991, No. 91-221, \u00a7 4, provides in pertinent part: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of sections 12-118, 12-121aa and 12-121bb of the general statutes, any person, including any lessee of real property whose lease has been recorded as provided in section 47-19 and who is bound under the terms of his lease to pay real property taxes, claiming to be aggrieved by the action of the board of tax review in any town or city with respect to the assessment list for the assessment ye&amp;r commencing October 1,1989, [or] October 1,1990, OR OCTOBER <em>1,1991, </em>may, within two months from the time of such action, make application, in the nature of an appeal therefrom, to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated, which shall be accompanied by a citation to such town or city to appear before said court.
