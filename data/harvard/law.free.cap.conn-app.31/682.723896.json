The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly held that (1) the listing agreement was unenforceable under General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the plaintiff could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>not invoke estoppel to preclude the defendants from relying on General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">This appeal arises from a listing agreement between the plaintiff real estate broker and the defendants regarding real property in Enfield. In November, 1989, the defendants orally agreed to pay the plaintiff a commission if it found a tenant for its property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Later that month, the plaintiff prepared and forwarded a listing agreement to the defendants but the defendants did not sign the agreement at that time. Subsequently, the plaintiff located a tenant, Pace Membership Warehouse, Inc., which entered into a lease with the defendants on November 30, 1989. The defendants did not sign the written listing agreement until January 16, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">On September 16,1991, the plaintiff commenced this action after the defendants failed to pay the full commission specified in the listing agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On February 18, 1992, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, concluding that (1) the listing agreement was unenforceable because it did not satisfy the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b), and (2) the defendants were not estopped from relying on \u00a7 20-325a as a defense. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s first claim implicates the statutory restriction that a broker may not collect a commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>unless there was a valid listing agreement in effect prior to rendering the services in question. Such agreement must \u201c(1) be in writing, (2) contain the names and addresses of all the parties thereto, (3) show the date on which such contract was entered into . . . (^contain the conditions of such contract . . . and (5) be signed by the owner or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner . . . and by the real estate broker or his authorized agent.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b). It is not necessary that the listing agreement be contained in a single document. For separate documents to constitute a valid contract under the statute, however, the documents must collectively satisfy the requirements of the statute and relate to the same listing agreement. <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>189 Conn. 52, 55, 453 A.2d 771 (1983); <em>Boline </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>23 Conn. App. 688, 691, 583 A.2d 945 (1991). The plaintiff argues that the lease to Pace in conjunction with the listing agreement satisfy the statutory requirements. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">In order for a listing agreement to satisfy the statutory mandate and provide a basis of recovery to the broker, the agreement must be in effect at the time the broker\u2019s services are rendered. See <em>Ditchkus Real Estate Co. </em>v. <em>Storm, </em>25 Conn. App. 51, 55-56, 592 A.2d 959, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 905, 593 A.2d 97 (1991); <em>Currie </em>v. <em>Marano, </em>13 Conn. App. 527, 530, 537 A.2d 1036, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 809, 541 A.2d 1238 (1988). Even if the lease and the listing agreement, read together, satisfied the statute, it was necessary that both be in existence when the services were rendered. That was not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">On November 30, 1989, the last date on which the plaintiff rendered its brokerage services, the only document in existence was the lease to Pace. The listing agreement was not signed until January 16, 1990, nearly two months later. Section 20-325a (b) is man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>datory and subject to strict construction. <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Schweir, </em>7 Conn. App. 709, 714, 510 A.2d 215 (1986). Because no listing agreement was in effect when the plaintiff\u2019s services were rendered, the plaintiff is statutorily barred from recovering a commission. \u201c \u2018A broker who does not follow the mandate of the statute does so at his peril.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Thornton Real Estate, Ine. </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>184 Conn. 228, 230-31, 439 A.2d 946 (1981); see also <em>Real Estate Auctions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Senie, </em>28 Conn. App. 563, 570-71, 611 A.2d 452 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The plaintiff next argues that even if it cannot recover because the listing agreement was invalid, the defendant should be estopped from refusing to pay its commission because the facts of the case demonstrate its equitable entitlement thereto. The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Currie </em>v. <em>Marano, </em>supra, is misplaced. In fact, <em>Currie, </em>which is factually similar to the present case, expressly ruled out application of the estoppel doctrine when there was no valid listing agreement. In <em>Currie, </em>the plaintiff was a real estate broker seeking a commission. Following the trial court\u2019s finding that his services had been performed after his listing agreement had expired, he argued that the defendant property owners were equitably estopped from raising the plaintiff\u2019s noncompliance with the listing statute as a defense. Id., 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The <em>Currie </em>court refused to apply estoppel for two reasons. First, a broker is expected to know the laws regulating his profession and when ignorance of those laws is the primary cause of his need for relief, the doctrine of estoppel does not apply. The court concluded that Currie should have been aware of the strict legal prerequisites to obtaining a broker\u2019s commission and it was his ignorance of those prerequisites that was the primary reason he was seeking to apply the doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>of estoppel. Id., 531-32. This is on all fours with the present case. Here, the plaintiff real estate broker should have been aware that the law would not permit it to recover a commission if it failed to have a valid listing agreement signed prior to rendering its services. Second, the <em>Currie </em>court recognized that \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 20-325a has been strictly construed and enforced. . . . The scenario arising most commonly in cases of real estate commission claims, when there has not been compliance with the listing statute, as here, presents a fact pattern in which a real estate owner allegedly reaps the benefits of a broker\u2019s services without paying for them. To allow recovery on . . . the plaintiff\u2019s legal theories in the present case would nullify \u00a7 20-325a and emasculate the state\u2019s real estate sales licensing system.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 531. For the same reasons, we reject the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to employ equitable estoppel in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The plaintiff also attempted to invoke equitable estop-pel in support of its contention that the failure of the defendants to abide by the invalid listing agreement constituted a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b. This claim is controlled by <em>McCutcheon &amp; Burr, Inc. </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>218 Conn. 512, 590 A.2d 438 (1991), in which our Supreme Court enunciated that \u201c[t]he plaintiff\u2019s invocation of equitable principles in support of its CUTPA claim is an attempt to effect an end run around the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b). . . . The plaintiff\u2019s attempt to circumvent the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) by filing a CUTPA claim must ... be denied.\u201d Id., 530; see also <em>Real Estate Auctions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Senie, </em>supra, 573-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>224 Conn. 231, 618 A.2d 501 (1992) is unavailing. <em>Habetz </em>involved General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a), a part of the Home Improvement Act, and is not authority for a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>concerning a real estate broker\u2019s listing agreement. Real estate listing agreements \u201care governed exclusively by \u00a7 20-325a . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McCutcheon &amp; Burr, Inc. </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>supra. Accordingly, analogizing to cases from other areas of law is of little value. See, e.g., <em>William Pitt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>186 Conn. 82, 84, 438 A.2d 1206 (1982) (listing contracts do not fall within the statute of frauds); <em>Goldblatt Associates </em>v. <em>Panza, </em>24 Conn. App. 250, 253, 587 A.2d 433 (1991) (broker cannot recover in quantum meruit); <em>Currie </em>v. <em>Marano, </em>supra, 532 (broker cannot invoke equitable estoppel). Consequently, <em>Habetz </em>is not relevant to a construction of \u00a7 20-325a.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that rendition of a summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, affidavit and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Summary judgment is proper when a plaintiff real estate broker seeks to recover a judgment without a valid listing agreement. See <em>Thornton Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurrred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-10\"> There are two defendants in this case, Spire Realty and Development Corporation (Spire Corporation) and Spire Realty of Enfield Associates Limited Partnership (Spire Enfield). Spire Enfield is a limited partnership formed and organized by Spire Corporation in January, 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b) provides: \u201cNo person, licensed under the provisions of this chapter, shall commence or bring any action in respect of any acts done or services rendered after October 1, 1971, as set forth in subsection (a), unless such acts or services were rendered pursuant to a contract or authorization from the person for whom such acts were done or services rendered.
