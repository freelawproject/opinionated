The defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding self-defense. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 3:45 a.m. on September 24, 1989, a jeep and a red hatchback were traveling on Sherman Avenue in New Haven. The hatchback was driven by Ernest Reid. The defendant occupied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>front passenger seat of the hatchback, and Henry Jackson was in the rear seat behind the defendant. The jeep was driven by Frederick Stuart. Frederick\u2019s brother, Jose Stuart, occupied the front passenger seat of the jeep, and Matthew Taylor was in the rear seat behind the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">As the two vehicles proceeded along Sherman Avenue, they became embroiled in a \u201ccat and mouse\u201d game. Reid drove the hatchback in front of the jeep and then prevented the jeep from passing the hatchback.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">At the intersection of Sherman Avenue and Chapel Street, the jeep stopped near the curb and the hatchback stopped to the left of the jeep. The two vehicles were four to five feet apart. The driver of the jeep rolled down his window and asked Reid if he had a problem. Reid replied that he did not. The driver of the jeep bent forward, and immediately thereafter the defendant produced a handgun and fired two shots at the jeep. As the jeep then pulled forward, the defendant fired two or three more shots, shattering the driver\u2019s side and rear windows of the jeep. The entire incident lasted only a few seconds. Once they were back at Reid\u2019s apartment, Reid asked the defendant what had happened. The defendant told Reid that he thought the driver of the jeep had been reaching for a weapon. As a result of this incident, Frederick Stuart died of a gunshot wound to the head. Taylor sustained a gunshot wound to the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The defendant testified that before the confrontation with the jeep, he had noticed a shotgun between the front seats of the hatchback, near the emergency brake. At some point during the \u201ccat and mouse\u201d game between the vehicles, according to the defendant, Reid pointed the shotgun over the defendant and toward the jeep. After the defendant pushed the shotgun away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>from his face, Reid put the gun back between the front seats. The defendant further testified that, at the intersection of Sherman Avenue and Chapel Street, after the oral exchange between the drivers, the driver of the jeep made a movement, Jackson yelled that the occupants of the jeep had a gun and then gunfire began, at which time the defendant ducked and stayed down for the duration of the gunfire. The defendant stated that he did not possess a weapon or shoot anyone during the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The trial court instructed the jury on self-defense as follows: \u201cThe law provides that a person is justified in using deadly force upon another person to defend himself from what he reasonably believed to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force or the infliction of great bodily harm, provided that the person may only use the degree of force which he reasonably believed to be necessary for the purpose of defending himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u201cA person cannot use what the law calls deadly physical force, that is physical force which can be reasonably expected to [lead] to death or serious physical injuries, unless he reasonably believes that the other person was himself using or about to use deadly physical force or was inflicting, or about to inflict great bodily harm. The key word in the general rule and these important exceptions is \u2018reasonable.'</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u201cFirst of all, the defendant must have a reasonable belief that he is faced with the imminent use of deadly physical force upon him. A reasonable belief is one which a reasonably prudent person in the same circumstances would have. It is not an irrational belief, nor is it a belief that is not justified by all the circumstances existing then and there, nor is it necessarily the belief that the defendant in fact had; it is the belief that a reasonable person would have had under the circumstances. Secondly, acting with that reasonable belief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>the amount and the degree of force which he uses must be reasonable. It must be that degree of force which a reasonable person in the same circumstances would use and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u201cIf the degree of force used is excessive or unreasonable in view of all the circumstances, the defendant is not entitled to the defense of self-defense. Whether the defendant had a belief that Mr. Stuart was about to inflict deadly physical force against him, and if he had that belief, whether it was a reasonable belief, and whether the defendant\u2019s use of deadly physical force was reasonable are all questions of fact for you to decide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s instructions on self-defense is twofold. The defendant contends that the trial court failed to instruct the jury, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (b) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the defendant was required to retreat only if he could do so with complete safety. The defendant also contends that the trial court did not properly instruct the jury, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> regarding the subjective aspect of the self-defense inquiry. We do not agree with either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The defendant did not properly preserve either claim for appellate review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He seeks review, however, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the well established principles for the review of unpreserved constitutional claims set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 232, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because his fundamental right to present a defense includes a proper instruction on the elements of self-defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilchrist, </em>24 Conn. App. 624, 632-33, 591 A.2d 131, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 905, 593 A.2d 131 (1991). Nonetheless, we conclude that the defendant cannot prevail on this claim because he cannot show that \u201cthe alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived [him] of a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The Defendant\u2019s Duty to Retreat</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The defendant correctly points out that the trial court did not instruct the jury on the duty to retreat or the statutory limitations on that duty. See footnote 2, supra. It is well settled, however, that the trial court should adapt its instructions to the issues in the case in order to provide appropriate guidance to the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>207 Conn. 619, 636, 543 A.2d 270 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>19 Conn. App. 609, 618, 563 A.2d 745, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 820, 565 A.2d 540 (1989) (issues not supported by the evidence should not be submitted to the jury). Here, the court properly omitted from its self-defense instructions any mention of the duty to retreat because there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>evidence that the defendant could safely retreat from the vehicle. In fact, the undisputed evidence suggests otherwise, and the state did not claim that retreat was an option available to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the court\u2019s failure to instruct on retreat \u201cleft the jury with no guidance whatsoever, allowing it to substitute its commonplace assumptions for the law,\u201d finds no support in the record. Legal principles concerning the duty to retreat did not play a part in this case, and there is no reason to believe that the jury would have considered that issue on its own. In its instructions on self-defense, the trial court properly chose to focus the jury\u2019s attention on the crux of the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense, namely, that he was justified in using the degree of force that he reasonably believed necessary to defend himself from what he reasonably believed to be the imminent use of physical force. Under these circumstances, the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The Defendant\u2019s Belief Regarding Imminent Attack</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court did not properly instruct the jury on the subjective aspect of his self-defense claim. Specifically, he focuses on the following language in the court\u2019s self-defense instructions, which served to guide the jury in its. evaluation of the defendant\u2019s belief that he was faced with the imminent use of deadly physical force: \u201cA reasonable belief is one which a reasonably prudent person in the same circumstances would have. It is not . . . necessarily the belief that the defendant in fact had; it is the belief that a reasonable person would have had under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u201cThe standard of review to be applied to a claim of an improper instruction on the elements of self-defense is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 204, 562 A.2d 481 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 660, 453 A.2d 427 (1982). The charge is to be read as a whole; sections are not to be judged in isolation from the overall charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>174 Conn. 287, 305, 386 A.2d 243 (1978). The charge is not to be \u2018critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreshaw, </em>214 Conn. 540, 548, 572 A.2d 1006 (1990). The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge as a whole presents the case to the jury in a manner to prevent injustice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Maturo, </em>188 Conn. 591, 599, 452 A.2d 642 (1982). We review the whole charge to determine whether it sufficiently guided the jury to a proper verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>24 Conn. App. 493, 499, 589 A.2d 880 (1991).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hester, </em>28 Conn. App. 469, 472, 612 A.2d 120 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>29 Conn. 262, 272-73, 614 A.2d 1249, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 916, 617 A.2d 171 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">It is settled that a jury\u2019s evaluation of a claim of self-defense has both subjective and objective elements. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>213 Conn. 579, 586 n.7, 569 A.2d 534 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 663; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>25 Conn. App. 456, 464, 595 A.2d 895, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 916, 597 A.2d 339 (1991). \u201cIn evaluating a claim of self-defense, a trier of fact must first examine the danger that a defendant claims he faced. It is clear that here \u2018[t]he statute focuses on the [defendant] claiming self-defense. It focuses on what <em>he </em>reasonably believes under the circumstances . . . .\u2019 (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>[supra].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018The jury must view the situation from the perspective of the defendant. . . . [T]he defendant\u2019s belief [however] ultimately must be found to be reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 389 n.13, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984). In evaluating the defendant\u2019s belief that he was faced with the imminent use of deadly physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>force, the jury must first determine whether the defendant believed that an attack was imminent, and then it must determine whether that belief was reasonable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Before beginning our analysis of the challenged jury instructions, we note that the defendant\u2019s subjective beliefs concerning the danger he faced were not a critical issue in this case. The defendant denied that he used any force during the incident. His alternative claim of self-defense rested on Reid\u2019s testimony that, after the incident, the defendant stated that \u201cthe guy was reaching like he was reaching for a weapon.\u201d Nothing more was offered to assist the jury in determining whether, <em>from the perspective of the defendant, </em>an attack was imminent. It is significant that there was no evidence presented to suggest that the defendant\u2019s perspective would have been any different from that of any other reasonably prudent person. The evidence, for example, did not show \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s intelligence was less than average, that the defendant had previously been the victim of a violent attack [under similar circumstances], and that the defendant was aware of the victim\u2019s propensity for violence\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 463; or that \u201c[t]he victim was a convicted felon, drug user, drinker, and gambler . . . that the victim had been armed with a gun and threatened the defendant in the past, and that the defendant believed him to be a bully and was afraid of him.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Conn. App. 833, 851, 614 A.2d 438 <em>(Lavery, J., </em>dissenting), cert. granted, 224 Conn. 908, 615 A.2d 1048 (1992). While the proper starting point of the jury\u2019s inquiry into the claim of self-defense was whether the defendant believed he was in danger; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra; this subjective inquiry was necessarily undertaken by the jury in this case from the perspective of a defendant whose knowledge of the victim and whose experience in situations of danger was not at all differentiated from those of the average citizen. It is with these peculiar circumstances of this case in mind that we now turn to an examination of the defendant\u2019s remaining challenge to the court\u2019s instructions on self-defense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">While the trial court here did not emphasize the subjective aspect of the self-defense inquiry; compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 466 n.5 and accompanying text; it did explain that part of the inquiry to the jury. The trial court began its self-defense charge by providing the jury with an almost verbatim recitation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a). This language, like that of the statute, sets forth the appropriate subjective-objective test for evaluating the defendant\u2019s belief concerning the danger he was facing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Immediately thereafter, the court provided the jury with additional guidance on the objective part of its inquiry by explaining how the jury would have to determine whether the defendant\u2019s belief was a reasonable one. The court necessarily referenced the objective, reasonable person at this stage of the instructions. In doing so, however, the court did not impermissibly take the jury\u2019s focus away from the defendant claiming self-defense. Rather, it \u201cenabled the jury properly to carry out its duty to examine the evidence both subjectively and objectively, while keeping in mind that the defendant\u2019s conduct must \u2018be judged ultimately against that of a reasonably prudent person.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 466, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>22 Conn. App. 521, 529, 577 A.2d 1120, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 825, 582 A.2d 204 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Finally, the court summarized the jury\u2019s task in evaluating the claim of self-defense as follows: <em>\u201cWhether the defendant had a belief </em>that Mr. Stuart was about to inflict deadly physical force against him, <em>and if he had that belief, whether it was a reasonable belief, </em>and whether the defendant\u2019s use of deadly physical force was reasonable are all questions of fact for you to decide.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language captured precisely the essence of the two part, subjective-objective inquiry required by \u00a7 53a-19 (a) concerning the threat faced by the defendant: first, whether the defendant believed that he faced the imminent use of deadly physical force; second, whether that belief was reasonable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 464. Consequently, rather than replacing the subjective-objective inquiry with one that focused exclusively on the question of whether a reasonable person would have believed that he faced an imminent attack; compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 838, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra; as the starting point of its analysis, the trial court properly focused the jury\u2019s attention on the defendant\u2019s subjective belief about the danger he faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The defendant\u2019s challenge to this aspect of the court\u2019s instructions on self-defense, then, raises only an issue of emphasis. \u201cA party is not entitled to a charge which is beyond criticism in every particular. . . . Rather, a charge is adequate if it is legally correct and presents the case to the jury in a just and fair manner.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) See <em>State </em>v. <em>Knighton, </em>7 Conn. App. 223, 231, 508 A.2d 772 (1986). \u201cWe conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions, as a whole, properly included both the subjective and objective portions of the self-defense test. It properly directed the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s personal belief about the danger he was facing .... This portion of the [defendant\u2019s] claim, therefore, also fails.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In this opinion Foti, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\"> The jury found the defendant guilty of manslaughter in the first degree as a lesser included offense of the charge of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (b) (1) provides in pertinent part that \u201ca person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety ... by retreating . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a) provides in pertinent part that \u201ca person is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force, and he may use such degree of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary for such purpose; except that deadly physical force may not be used unless the actor reasonably believes that such other person is (1) using or about to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\"> Although the defendant submitted a written request to charge on the subject of self-defense, he did not properly preserve his claims for appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>late review because the request to charge did not comply with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 854.

See footnote 7, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\"> We note that the defendant does not challenge that aspect of the trial court\u2019s self-defense instructions pertaining to the jury\u2019s evaluation of the degree of force used by the defendant. The trial court defined the permissible degree of force objectively as \u201cthat degree of force which a reasonable person in the same circumstances would use and no more.\u201d Similar language was recently disapproved by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>28 Conn. App. 833, 614 A.2d 438, cert. granted, 224 Conn. 908, 615 A.2d 1048 (1992), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>25 Conn. App. 456, 595 A.2d 895, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 916, 597 A.2d 339 (1991). The defendant, however, did not offer <em>any </em>subjective evidence regarding his belief concerning the amount of force necessary to repel the attack that he perceived to be imminent. Because the jury could examine this aspect of his claim of self-defense from only an objective point of view, the court\u2019s instruction on the degree of force that could be used under the circumstances necessarily lacked any subjective inquiry. For this reason, much of the analysis undertaken in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, is not directly applicable to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b420-7\">La VERY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ab1\">dissenting.

Our jurisprudence recognizes that a defendant in a criminal trial is entitled as a matter of law to jury instructions on any legitimate claimed theory of defense. \u201cA fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>167 Conn. 80, 83, 355 A.2d 6 (1974). This fundamental constitutional right includes proper jury instructions on the elements of self-defense so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>justified.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 660-61, 443 A.2d 906 (1982). If a defendant asserts a recognized legal defense and the evidence indicates the availability of that defense, such a charge is obligatory and the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to a theory of defense instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>178 Conn. 704, 707-708, 425 A.2d 108 (1979). \u201c \u2018[A] defendant is \u201centitled to have instructions presented relating to any theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>435 F.2d 789, 792 (2d Cir. 1970), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>237 F.2d 466, 474 n.8 (2d Cir. 1956).\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alfonso-Perez, </em>535 F.2d 1362, 1365 (2d Cir. 1976).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986). In this case, the defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to present a defense when the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the law of self-defense in two crucial respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The trial court did not instruct the jury on the self-defense element of retreat. Under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (b) (1) the defendant had a duty to retreat if he could do so with \u201ccomplete safety.\u201d The defendant, in his request to charge, asked the court to instruct the jury that \u201c[i]n order to find that the defendant was justified you must find that the defendant could not avoid the use of such force in complete safety by retreating.\u201d The majority concluded that the omission of any instruction on retreat was within the discretion of the trial court, writing: \u201cHere, the court properly omitted from its self-defense instructions any mention of the duty to retreat because there was no evidence that the defendant could safely retreat from the vehicle. In fact, the undisputed evidence suggests otherwise, and the state did not claim that retreat was an option available to the defendant. . . . Legal principles concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>duty to retreat did not play a part in this case, and there is no reason to believe that the jury would have considered that issue on its own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The majority correctly points out that there was no evidence presented suggesting that the defendant could retreat safely, and that the state did not claim otherwise. The defendant\u2019s inability to retreat in complete safety, however, made it even more imperative that the jury receive instructions on the retreat element. In this case, the defendant claimed that he shot at the victims because he believed that one of them was reaching for a firearm. Vital to his defense was the fact that, if he was in danger in the passenger\u2019s seat of an automobile, he could not retreat in complete safety. The jury should not have been allowed to proceed ignorant of this legal principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Applying the standard based on the state and federal precedent outlined above, I would conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the issue of retreat deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to establish a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The trial court\u2019s use of an objective standard in its jury instructions on the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s belief that he faced imminent attack was reasonable and warranted the use of deadly force in response likewise harmed the defendant\u2019s ability to present a defense. The trial court instructed the jury that it was to evaluate the defendant\u2019s belief that he faced imminent attack in terms of the belief \u201ca reasonably prudent person in the same circumstances would have,\u201d and further that such a belief was \u201c[not] necessarily the belief that the defendant in fact had; it is the belief that a reasonable person would have under the circumstances.\u201d The trial court\u2019s focus on an objective standard was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>25 Conn. App. 456, 595 A.2d 895, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 916, 597 A.2d 339 (1991), this court found a jury charge similar to the one given in this case to be improper. In <em>Williams, </em>the trial court instructed the jury to evaluate the force used by the defendant against the level of force that would be employed by the \u201caverage person of ordinary intelligence.\u201d We relied on well settled law stating that the jury is not to use a purely objective standard in evaluating self-defense. Id., 464; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>213 Conn. 579, 586 n.7, 569 A.2d 534 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 389 n.13, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 663, 453 A.2d 427 (1982); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>28 Conn. App. 833, 851, 614 A.2d 438 <em>(Lavery, J., </em>dissenting), cert. granted, 224 Conn. 908, 615 A.2d 1048 (1992). The jury must view the situation from the perspective of the defendant. The defendant\u2019s belief, however, ultimately must be found to be reasonable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 464. The starting point of the jury\u2019s inquiry into whether reasonable force was used by a defendant is whether the defendant believed that deadly force was necessary to repel an attack. Next, the jury\u2019s inquiry should focus on the question of whether that belief was reasonable. Id. \u201cThe statute focuses on the person . . . claiming self-defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra. In this case, the trial court\u2019s instructions did not properly focus the jury\u2019s initial attention on the defendant\u2019s perspective, but instead on the perspective of a \u201creasonably prudent person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The defendant\u2019s beliefs were important to his self-defense claim. The defendant was a passenger in a motor vehicle that, through no direct action of his, became involved in a highly dangerous passing game. At an intersection, the driver of the other vehicle asked the driver of the car in which the defendant was riding whether he had \u201ca problem,\u201d and then leaned for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ward. The jury heard evidence to the effect that the defendant believed the victim was reaching for a weapon. The law requires that the jury evaluate whether the defendant believed that deadly force was necessary to protect himself and then whether that belief was reasonable. In its focus on a reasonable person standard, the trial court\u2019s instructions could have led the jury to evaluate improperly the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Self-defense was the only defense presented by the defendant in this case. Because the jury instructions on self-defense were incorrect in two critical respects, I believe that defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense was irrevocably hindered and that the error was harmful. I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
