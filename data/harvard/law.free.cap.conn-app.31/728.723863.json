(Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act) and for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to that act. We reverse the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The following procedural history is necessary to resolve this appeal. The pleadings were closed and the matter was claimed to the trial list on June 22, 1989. The case was subsequently referred for trial to Louis I. Gladstone sitting as an attorney trial referee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>heard the evidence in the case. The parties then submitted posthearing briefs to him. The attorney trial referee submitted to the trial court a document labeled \u201cMemorandum of Decision, dated April 3, 1992.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">This document was in the format generally used by the trial courts for the filing of memoranda of decisions and did not set forth in separate and consecutively numbered paragraphs the facts found and the conclusions drawn therefrom as mandated by Practice Book \u00a7 434.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 434 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe report of a committee shall state, in separate and consecutively numbered paragraphs, the facts found and the conclusions drawn therefrom. . . . The committee may accompany his report with a memorandum of decision including such matters as he may deem helpful in the decision of the case . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Upon receipt of the \u201cmemorandum of decision,\u201d the plaintiff wrote to the attorney trial referee calling his attention to the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 428 through 433, and our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 508 A.2d 415 (1986). The plaintiff specifically inquired as to whether the attorney trial referee intended to file a report with the Superior Court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 434. The attorney trial referee responded by letter stating that he had, in his opinion, already complied with the appropriate rules of practice and did not intend to file any additional report. The plaintiff timely filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>a motion to correct pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 438.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion to correct set forth, inter alia, that the attorney trial referee had failed to file a report and that the facts set forth in the motion to correct are fully supported by the record. The attorney trial referee denied the plaintiffs motion to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The plaintiff next filed an objection to the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the attorney trial referee\u2019s report pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 440.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff objected to the acceptance of the report because the attorney trial referee failed to file a report in accordance with the mandate of Practice Book \u00a7 434. The plaintiff asserted that because of the lack of factual findings in the report, the trial court could not fulfill its function to review the attorney trial referee\u2019s factual determinations and to render judgment if appropriate. In addition, the plaintiff also filed an exception to the attorney trial referee\u2019s report pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 439.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This objection set forth the plaintiff\u2019s continuing complaint that the attorney trial referee had failed to file a proper report and that the facts set forth in the motion to correct were admitted or undisputed and material to the decision of the case. The trial court denied both motions and thereupon rendered judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>in accordance with the attorney trial referee\u2019s report. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We must initially determine whether the \u201cmemorandum of decision\u201d filed by the attorney trial referee adequately complied with Practice Book \u00a7 434, which requires the filing of a report setting forth in \u201cseparate and consecutively numbered paragraphs, the facts found and the conclusions drawn therefrom.\u201d We conclude that in this instance there was not sufficient compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Our conclusion does not turn only on the attorney trial referee\u2019s failure to use the format mandated by the rules. We do not exalt form over substance. Rather, our conclusion turns on the fact that a fair reading of the \u201cmemorandum of decision\u201d does not disclose the ultimate facts found by the attorney trial referee and the conclusions drawn therefrom. Thus, the trial court was displaced from its function of \u201crendering] such judgment as the law requires <em>upon the facts in the report as it may be </em>corrected.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 443. Because the \u201cmemorandum of decision\u201d failed to set forth the ultimate facts found, the trial court acted improperly in overruling the objection to the report and in entering judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The trial court is authorized \u201c \u2018to render whatever judgment appropriately follows, as a matter of law, from the facts found by the attorney trial referee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burt\u2019s Spirit Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ridgway, </em>215 Conn. 355, 367, 576 A.2d 1267 (1990); <em>Dills </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>210 Conn. 705, 713, 557 A.2d 517 (1989). In a matter heard before an attorney trial referee, the trial court\u2019s nondelega-ble judicial duty to render judgment turns on its ability to determine the facts found by the attorney trial referee. If the court finds material errors in the attorney trial referee\u2019s factual findings, it may, under those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>circumstances, order further proceedings. Practice Book \u00a7 443;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Dills </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>supra. Thus, where the factual predicate is not clearly set out by proper factual findings and conclusions drawn from the facts so found, the trial court is not able to fulfill its judicial function. <em>Dills </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>supra, 712; <em>Rostenberg-Doern Co. </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>17 Conn. App. 294, 300, 552 A.2d 827 (1989). The attorney trial referee sits only as a fact finder. Where the attorney trial referee\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly set out, he has failed in his function of fact finder. The trial court should have exercised its authority under Practice Book \u00a7 443 to \u201creject the report and refer the matter to the same or another committee for a new trial or revoke the reference and leave the case to be disposed of in court.\u201d By failing to exercise its authority under \u00a7 443, the trial court improperly delegated to the attorney trial referee its nondelegable judicial authority to render judgment. See <em>Rostenberg-Doern Co. </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">We thus conclude that the trial court improperly entered judgment in accordance with the attorney trial referee\u2019s report where the attorney trial referee had failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Having concluded that the trial court improperly rendered judgment without a sufficient factual record, we are faced with determining whether we should dispose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>of this appeal by reversing and remanding for a new trial or whether we may, in the exercise of our discretion, remand the case to the trial court with direction to remand the case to the attorney trial referee who heard the matter to file a report in substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 434. While the defendant posits that we lack authority to adopt the latter alternative, he cites no positive authority for the proposition that we may not do so in the exercise of judicial discretion or pursuant to the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 4183 (10).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">We conclude that we have the authority to require the trial court to remand the case to the attorney trial referee for the preparation of a report that complies with the mandate of Practice Book \u00a7 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Our Supreme Court has held that, under the rubric of the general supervisory powers of that court, it was empowered to order an individual no longer holding judicial office to file a finding necessary to perfect the record on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmieri, </em>143 Conn. 569, 570-71, 124 A.2d 911 (1956). Our Supreme Court has also determined that it had the authority, again under its general supervisory powers, to minimize delay in a remand of a juvenile case for further action by the trial court by ordering that the further proceedings contemplated in the court\u2019s opinion take place within sixty days from the date of the opinion. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-BC), </em>189 Conn. 66, 81, 454 A.2d 1262 (1983). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the general supervisory powers of the appellate courts have been employed in the interests of justice and judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">This court has previously concluded that we have the authority to remand a case to the trial court with direction to remand it to the attorney trial referee for a further factual determination. <em>Pilato </em>v. <em>Kapur, </em>22 Conn. App. 282, 285, 576 A.2d 1315, cert. granted, 216 Conn. 813, 580 A.2d 67 (1990).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Given the time invested by the parties and the court, and the fact that the matter was completely heard by the attorney trial referee, judicial economy and good sense dictate that the attorney trial referee supply the trial court with his factual findings in a proper format to permit the trial court to fulfill its judicial function. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 434 and 443; see also <em>Hassane </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>31 Conn. App. 723, 626 A.2d 1336 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to remand the case to the attorney trial referee who heard the case with direction to file with the trial court a proper report in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 434, and for other proceedings subsequent to the filing of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn addition to the state referees who are appointed pursuant to subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this section, the chief justice may appoint, from qualified mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>bers of the bar of the state, who are electors and residents of this state, as many state referees as he may from time to time deem advisable or necessary. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\"> This memorandum of decision was filed with the trial court on April 8, 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\"> Our rules of practice as they relate to committees are equally applicable to attorney trial referees.
