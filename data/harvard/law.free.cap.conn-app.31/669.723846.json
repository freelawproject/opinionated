We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">On February 28,1992, at approximately 11:30 p.m., two Derby police officers, Salvatore Forsceno and Scott Todd, observed a motor vehicle, operated by the defendant cross the double center line of Main Street in Derby and make an abrupt right turn across two lanes of traffic onto the southbound entrance ramp of Route 8. The officers, who were several car lengths behind the defendant, followed him onto the entrance ramp and across a bridge, where the defendant took the next exit off Route 8 into Shelton. The defendant drove erratically while on the ramp and bridge. The officers were unable to position their vehicle behind the defendant\u2019s vehicle and initiate a motor vehicle stop until they reached the exit ramp in Shelton. Upon subsequent investigation following the motor vehicle stop, the officers determined that the defendant had operated his motor vehicle in Derby under the influence of alcohol and arrested him for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In this appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress because (1) the officers\u2019 \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a had been committed was not sufficient to permit them to make an extraterritorial arrest pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) the officers were not in \u201cimmediate pursuit\u201d of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The defendant asks that we differentiate between an infraction and an offense. He argues that although operating under the influence is unquestionably an offense pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf, the police officers in this case had probable cause to believe only that he had committed an infraction and, therefore, could not make an extraterritorial arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">We have recently stated that the fact that a police officer may not have observed a violation before making an investigative stop is irrelevant because \u201ca reasonable and articulable suspicion can arise from conduct that alone is not criminal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>30 Conn. App. 108, 113, 618 A.2d 1381, cert. granted, 225 Conn. 921, 625 A.2d 824 (1993). \u201c[T]he weaving of a vehicle in its own lane provides reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify an investigative stop to determine if the driver is, in fact, intoxicated or impaired, [and] thereby violating General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.\u201d Id., 113 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In this case, the conduct amply supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the officers had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that justified their making an investigative stop. The defendant drove his motor vehicle across the double center line of Main Street in Derby. He then made an abrupt right turn across two lanes of traffic onto the southbound entrance ramp of Route 8. His erratic driving continued on the ramp and bridge, also within the town limits of Derby. The fact that the conduct observed by the arresting officers within their jurisdiction may have constituted only an infraction is irrelevant. The statute does not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>that the officers establish probable cause to arrest the defendant before they leave their jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The defendant does not claim that police officers may not conduct investigatory stops<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> outside of their own precincts. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kuskowski, </em>200 Conn. 82, 510 A.2d 172 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>29 Conn. App. 207, 614 A.2d 1229, cert. granted, 224 Conn. 914, 915, 617 A.2d 170 (1992). Rather, he claims that pursuant to \u00a7 54-If (c) they may do so only when in \u201cimmediate pursuit\u201d of an offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\u201cWe have previously determined that the arresting officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to make an investigatory stop of the defendant for the defendant\u2019s actions while in the officer\u2019s jurisdiction. The mere fact that the actual stop and arrest occurred [in another town] will not undercut the validity of the arrest. The language of \u00a7 54-If (c) is clear. The requirement of subsection (a), therefore, is that the offense, or the actions that lead to a reasonable and articulable suspicion that an offense has or is about to be committed, occur in the officer\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>supra, 116. As in <em>Harrison, </em>the arresting officers here conducted the investigatory stop that led to the defendant\u2019s arrest on the basis of the defendant\u2019s actions while he was in the officers\u2019 jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">In interpreting the term \u201cimmediate pursuit\u201d as found in \u00a7 54-lf (c), the trial court applied its ordinary meaning of \u201cto follow without delay\u201d and found that the officers were in \u201cimmediate pursuit\u201d of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ant for purposes of the statute. We agree. We are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s contention that the term \u201cimmediate pursuit\u201d in \u00a7 54-If (c) should derive its definition from General Statutes \u00a7 14-283a (a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which concerns high speed chases. The defendant\u2019s alternative claim that the common law doctrine of \u201chot pursuit\u201d should control the definition of \u201cimmediate pursuit\u201d and require either an attempted avoidance of an arrest or an awareness of a pursuit is also without merit. Police officers need not have lights flashing or sirens on to be in immediate pursuit; it suffices if the pursuit is conducted without undue delay and is accomplished at the earliest safe opportunity. No chase is required for \u201cimmediate pursuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The trial court properly found that the investigatory stop satisfied the constitutional requirement of reasonable and articulable suspicion, and that the defendant\u2019s arrest was accomplished pursuant to probable cause. The court therefore properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search or seizure . . . the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal within the time prescribed by law. . . .
