We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>reverse the judgment of the trial court on the first issue because the rebuttal testimony was more prejudicial than probative, and remand the case for a new trial. Consequently, we do not reach the merits of the remaining issues because they are unlikely to be encountered in a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The victim, referred to throughout the trial as Miss Doe, is the defendant\u2019s daughter. On July 2,1988, the victim\u2019s fourteenth birthday, the defendant sexually assaulted her, forcing her to engage in sexual intercourse. The defendant again forced the victim to engage in sexual intercourse on his birthday, July 30, 1988, on an unspecified date in the fall of that year, and again on December 24, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On January 30,1989, at 6:30 a.m., the defendant told his daughter that she was not going to school, and attempted to assault her sexually. The defendant struck the victim in the face, and dragged her into his bedroom. He pushed her backward onto the bed, and tried to unbutton her pants. The victim told the defendant that she had to use the bathroom, got up, and ran downstairs and out'of the house. The defendant pursued her onto the street, calling after her. The victim went to a neighbor\u2019s house where she telephoned her aunt and a friend, and told them about the incident that had just occurred and about previous incidents of sexual abuse involving her father. A gynecological examination of the victim on February 3,1989, revealed medical evidence consistent with the victim\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">During the trial, the victim also testified to a pattern of sexual abuse by her father which began when she was five years old and was interrupted for several years while the defendant was stationed abroad with the army and while he was serving a prison sentence for a previous crime. The defendant denied every allegation of sexual abuse made by his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The following course of events, which took place at the trial, are pertinent to the resolution of this appeal. The victim testified that when she was eight years old she and her father moved to New Britain to stay with D, the defendant\u2019s sister and the victim\u2019s aunt, and with D\u2019s daughter E, the victim\u2019s cousin. The victim told her cousin about the defendant\u2019s previous sexual abuse of her. At trial, the victim testified that the defendant had told her that he used to engage in sexual activity with E, his niece.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">When E testified during the state\u2019s case-in-chief, she said that before the defendant and his second wife, Aileen Busque, were married, she warned Aileen that the defendant had demonstrated a violent tendency in the past, and had engaged in sexual activity with her and the victim. The state sought to allow E to testify about the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of her. During an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury, E described how the defendant had initiated sexual activity with her when she was fourteen, and how that activity had progressed from fondling to oral sex and to intercourse. She told the court that the defendant had threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the sexual activity. E also described an incident in which the defendant had fired a pistol at her and she had been injured by flying glass. The state asked that E be allowed to testify before the jury about the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct with her in order to show that the defendant\u2019s abuse of his niece and daughter showed a common design or plan. The court, following the offer of proof, noted that there was a \u201cstrong similarity\u201d between the activities involving the two girls, but ruled that E\u2019s testimony would be more prejudicial than probative, and did not allow it to go before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">During the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant testified on his own behalf. Following direct examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>tion, he was cross-examined by the state\u2019s attorney. During cross-examination the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney:] [I]sn\u2019t it possible that some of the details that your daughter has testified to, those incidents have occurred during periods of time when you were drinking. And that you don\u2019t remember them because you\u2019ve suffered a blackout?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u201c[The Defendant:] No.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u201cQ. And why isn\u2019t that possible?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u201cA. Because I\u2019m not that kind of person. I mean you could say a lot of things about somebody that drinks, but I don\u2019t go around raping little girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\u201cQ. You\u2019re not that kind of person?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">\u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">\u201cQ. And when you say \u2018that kind of person,\u2019 what do you mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">\u201cA. Kind of person that goes around raping women; I don\u2019t rape women. That\u2019s bad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">Later during the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant, the state\u2019s attorney asked the defendant if he had sexually assaulted his niece, E, and the defendant denied that he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">On the basis of the exchange quoted previously, the state again sought to allow E to testify before the jury regarding the defendant\u2019s prior sexual activity with her. The state asked that E be permitted to testify as a rebuttal witness on the issue of the defendant\u2019s credibility. The court ruled that E would be allowed to testify as to the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct with her, but that the testimony could be considered by the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>only in terms of the defendant\u2019s credibility. The court addressed the jury with a limiting instruction before E testified, reminding the jury that the testimony was being offered only to shed light on the defendant\u2019s credibility. When E took the stand, she testified that the defendant arranged to sleep in the same bedroom with her by fabricating a story about his needing someone else in the room at night because he suffered from nightmares. She went on to describe in graphic detail how the defendant forced her to engage in sexual activity when she was fourteen and fifteen years of age. She described how the activity progressed from fondling to oral sex and to intercourse. E also described physical violence perpetrated against her by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The defendant\u2019s first claim involves two issues. First, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly allowed the state to cross-examine him regarding evidence of prior misconduct not related to veracity. Second, he claims that the trial court improperly allowed the state to introduce extrinsic evidence on rebuttal with respect to the alleged prior misconduct. We decline to review the first issue of the defendant\u2019s claim, but agree with the defendant\u2019s position because the rebuttal evidence was more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The defendant initially claims that the trial court improperly allowed the state to cross-examine him with regard to prior acts of misconduct not related to veracity. We choose not to review this claim because it was not properly preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Our review of the transcript reveals that when defense counsel objected to cross-examination of the defendant about prior misconduct, he did not state that he was objecting because the questions the state asked did not pertain to veracity. Instead, counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>stated that his objection was \u201cbased on the argument we had earlier, Your Honor.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We have carefully examined the earlier argument referred to in the trial transcript. The discussion to which defense counsel referred ensued when he made an oral motion asking the court to define the limits of the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant and rebuttal following his testimony. It appears that defense counsel anticipated that his client would testify about the shooting incident involving the defendant and his niece, and was concerned that if testimony by the defendant about that issue would \u201copen the door\u201d to cross-examination about the defendant\u2019s prior sexual misconduct with E. Properly, the trial court refused to speculate on this issue, and told defense counsel that the state could cross-examine the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ant on anything about which he testified. At no time during this colloquy did the issue of cross-examination regarding prior misconduct not pertaining to veracity, which the defendant raises on appeal, arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Our rules of practice require that when an objection to the admission of evidence is made \u201ccounsel shall state the grounds upon which it is claimed or upon which objection is made, succinctly and in such form as he desires it to go upon the record, before any discussion or argument is had.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 288. We are not bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. \u201cThis court reviews rulings solely on the ground on which the party\u2019s objection is based.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 118, 291 A.2d 750 (1971). \u201cIn objecting to evidence, counsel must properly articulate the basis of the objection so as to apprise the trial court of the precise nature of the objection and its real purpose, in order to form an adequate basis for a reviewable ruling.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 684-85, 469 A.2d 760 (1983), and cases cited therein. \u201c[OJnce the authority and the ground for an objection are stated, our review of the trial court\u2019s ruling is limited to the ground asserted.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The ground for objection here was \u201cthe argument we had earlier.\u201d Even if we view that argument in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s objection, we might conclude that the defendant was objecting because the state was cross-examining beyond the scope of the defendant\u2019s direct testimony, but even that conclusion would be speculative. Because the defendant did not properly preserve the issue of whether the state\u2019s cross-examination was proper, we decline to review that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>In the second part of the defendant\u2019s first claim he asserts that the trial court improperly allowed the jury to consider rebuttal evidence of prior uncharged misconduct. Among other grounds, the defendant argues, as he did in the trial court, that the misconduct evidence was more prejudicial than probative. We conclude that even if our rules of evidence allowed the introduction of E\u2019s testimony, the testimony was clearly more prejudicial than probative. We therefore need not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s other grounds regarding this issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Generally, evidence of prior crimes or misconduct is not admissible due to the prejudicial nature of such evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>159 Conn. 169, 172, 268 A.2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>147 Conn. 589, 599, 164 A.2d 399 (I960). Evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior misconduct may be admitted for certain purposes, such as proving intent, identity, malice, motive or a system of criminal activity. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>213 Conn. 422, 428-29, 468 A.2d 448 (1990). Evidence of prior misconduct will be admitted under these exceptions only if it is relevant to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions, and if the value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\u201d Id., 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We recognize that a trial court has broad discretion in determining whether the probative value of proffered evidence is outweighed by the prejudice that is likely to result from its admission. <em>State </em>v. <em>McGraw, </em>204 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Conn. 441, 449-50, 528 A.2d 821 (1987). We will not overturn the court\u2019s determination of this issue absent an abuse of discretion. Id., 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Our Supreme Court recently analyzed the issue of prejudicial effect versus probative value in <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>224 Conn. 347, 618 A.2d 513 (1993). In that case, the trial court admitted evidence of prior misconduct under the intent exception to the prior misconduct rule. A police officer was permitted to testify that, prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest for narcotics sales, he had observed the defendant engaging in what the officer believed to be the sale of narcotics. While in <em>Baldwin </em>the prior crimes evidence was allowed to show intent, which is an element of the crime charged in that case, in this case the evidence was allowed in order to shed light on the credibility of the defendant as a witness. Credibility, unlike intent in <em>Baldwin, </em>is not an element of the crimes charged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u201cOur analysis begins with the general rule excluding [prior crimes] evidence so as to avoid the danger of prejudice against the defendant which may result from the admission of such evidence. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 28, 425 A.2d 560 (1979).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 356. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s \u2018discretion\u2019 to admit other crimes evidence imports something more than leeway in decision-making. Discretion means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. . . . When assessing the admissibility of \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence, the application of a mechanical test determining that the proffered evidence fits within some class of exception to the rule of nonadmissibility, may obscure sight of the underlying policy of protecting the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>against unfair prejudice. That policy ought not to evaporate through the interstices of the classification. The problem is thus one of balancing the actual relevancy of the \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence in light of the issues and the other evidence available to the prosecution against the degree to which the jury will probably be roused by the evidence. . . . <em>[State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>supra, 435].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 356-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In this case, the defendant was charged with sexual assault on and risk of injury to his daughter, not his niece. The jury, however, heard lengthy and emotional testimony from two victims when the defendant was charged with crimes against only one of them. The second victim was allowed to testify in order to help the jury determine the defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We turn to the test set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, to determine whether the trial court properly determined whether the probative value of E\u2019s testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. We must determine whether the trial court properly balanced the \u201cactual relevancy of the \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence in light of the issues and the other evidence available to the prosecution against the degree to which the jury will probably be roused by the evidence.\u201d Id., 357. Essentially, the state\u2019s argument is that E\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct was admissible because the defendant was untruthful when he denied on cross-examination that he did not abuse E. In order to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility, his niece was permitted to testify in graphic detail about continued acts of sexual abuse perpetrated by the defendant against her. Again, the defendant\u2019s credibility was not an element of the crimes charged. The testimony was pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>sented on rebuttal, after the state had presented the jury with ample evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the defendant was guilty. E\u2019s testimony was very likely to rouse the jury. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the probative value of E\u2019s testimony outweighed the prejudice that could result from the jury\u2019s hearing about serious and disturbing prior uncharged crimes of a nature similar to those charged involving incestuous sexual misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Although we conclude that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct, we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision was harmful. In a case involving an evidentiary ruling, it is the defendant\u2019s burden to show that it is more probable than not that the court\u2019s action affected the result. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>supra, 436-37. We conclude that the defendant has met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">As we have noted, the jury heard testimony about prior, uncharged crimes committed by the defendant against a third party. E\u2019s testimony was more damaging than that of the victim. She described not only sexual abuse, but violence perpetrated against her by the defendant. Despite the curative instructions of the court, it would be difficult for a juror to refrain from seeing the pattern that emerges from the testimony of the defendant\u2019s daughter and niece. The evidence was likely to lead a juror to conclude that the defendant was disposed to commit such crimes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cAny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>improper evidence that may have a tendency to excite the passions, awaken the sympathy, or influence the judgment, of the jury, cannot be considered as harmless.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 437. .</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Because we reverse the judgment of the trial court with regard to the first issue, and because the remaining issues are unlikely to be encountered in a new trial, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is (1) under sixteen years of age . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . .

We went through this in the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-19\">\u201cMr. Weingast: As long as I have a standing objection. I just want that clear for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-20\">\u201cThe Court: I keep telling you, you do, Mr. Weingast.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-21\">\u201cMr. Weingast: Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-22\">Cross-examination by the state resumed, and the defendant denied that he had ever sexually assaulted his niece.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\"> We note that the state, in response to this claim by the defendant, argues that the defendant \u201copened the door\u201d to E's rebuttal testimony by his response on cross-examination that he is not the type of person who rapes little girls and women. We also note that the defendant in his brief claims that he did not \u201copen the door\u201d to the testimony. Because, as we have stated, E\u2019s testimony was more prejudicial than probative, even if its introduction were permitted under our rules of evidence, we decline to analyze this claim in terms of the doctrine of \u201copening the door.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> Our review of the trial transcript reveals that during closing arguments the state, despite the curative instruction to the jury charging them that they could consider E\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct only in relation to the defendant\u2019s credibility, argued to the jury that the state was permitted to recall E to \u201crebut the defendant\u2019s claim that he was not that kind of person.\u201d The state reviewed E\u2019s testimony for the jury. Later, the state said: \u201cTo believe that [the victim] fabricated these things, you\u2019d also have to disregard the testimony of [E], that she had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>an earlier victim of the defendant.\u201d This argument materially connects the charged crime, allegedly committed by the defendant against his daughter, and the uncharged crime, allegedly committed by the defendant against his niece. It is an example of how the jury could be swayed to believe that if the defendant committed the crime previously, he is likely to have done it again.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b156-18\"> We note that when the state, out of the presence of the jury, originally offered E\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct in order to show a common design or plan, the trial court, considering the prejudicial impact of the testimony, remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s the type of evidence that would almost surely guarantee a verdict of guilt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
