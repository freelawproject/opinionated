The district court conducted a frivolity review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and dismissed Coney\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">Coney\u2019s complaint alleges <em>inter alia </em>an Eighth Amendment claim for inadequate medical care and is brought pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 395-397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 2004-05, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Coney\u2019s complaint alleges that the defendants denied him and delayed his medical treatment for various medical conditions, including hemorrhoids and painful and swollen testes and penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Coney began experiencing hemorrhoid problems in 1996. In 1997, successful surgery was performed on Coney\u2019s right testicle. However, in March 1999, Coney began again experiencing hemorrhoids and, in December 1999, Coney had a second hemorrhoid surgery. After this second surgery, Coney began experiencing pain and swelling in his testes and penis. In August 2000, an ultrasound revealed a mass on Coney\u2019s right testicle, which a prison doctor diagnosed as benign prostate hyperplasia. Coney continued to experience pain and swelling and, in August 2002, Coney was referred to a urologist, who recommended surgery. In September 2002, Coney had outpatient testicular exploratory surgery and received aftercare from prison physician\u2019s assistants. Test results indicated that the mass in Coney\u2019s right testicle was not cancerous, and a follow-up examination revealed that Coney had healed well after the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">Coney attached as exhibits to his complaint prison medical records reflecting his treatment history. Coney\u2019s main complaint is that the medical staff delayed or denied him the proper medical treatment. However, Coney\u2019s exhibits reveal that Coney repeatedly saw the medical staff for his medical complaints and that the prison medical staff repeatedly prescribed Coney pain medication, antibiotic therapy, sitz baths and convalescence for his complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">After Coney filed his complaint, the magistrate judge conducted a review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommending, among other things, that Coney\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim against the individual defendants be dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the magistrate judge found that, although Coney had alleged a serious medical need, he had failed to allege deliberate indifference to his medical need. The magistrate judge noted that Coney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>had received three surgeries, as well as medications, diagnostic testing and specialty care and that Coney had not alleged any further medical problems following his last surgery. Therefore, the R &amp; R concluded that Coney had not adequately alleged \u201cthat any defendant acted with a culpable state of mind in denying or delaying medical care, as evidenced by the abundance of care received by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Coney filed objections to the R &amp; R, arguing that his Eighth Amendment claims should not be dismissed because some of the defendants were deliberately indifferent when they delayed or denied him medical treatment, examinations and diagnostic tests. Coney also argued that he should be allowed to amend his complaint with regard to the deliberate indifference issue. However, Coney did not explain how he would amend his complaint to address the flaws raised in the R <em>&amp; </em>R.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The district court adopted the R &amp; R and dismissed Coney\u2019s complaint. Coney filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Coney argues that his complaint alleged sufficient facts to show that the individual defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical problems.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To state an Eighth Amendment claim, the plaintiff must allege both an objectively serious medical need and the subjective intent of deliberate indifference. <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir.2004). We agree with the district court that Coney alleged an objectively serious medical need. Thus, the focus of this appeal is on whether Coney sufficiently alleged the subjective component of deliberate indifference. \u201cTo establish the second element, deliberate indifference to the serious medical need, the prisoner must prove three facts: (1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregard of that risk; and (3) by conduct that is more than mere negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although deliberate indifference can be established by showing \u201cgrossly inadequate care\u201d or \u201cmedical care which is so cursory as to amount to no treatment at all,\u201d allegations of negligence \u201cin diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>McElligott v. Foley, </em>182 F.3d 1248, 1254-55 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, \u201ca simple difference in medical opinion between the prison\u2019s medical staff and the inmate\u201d regarding the course of treatment does not state an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>Harris v. Thigpen, </em>941 F.2d 1495, 1505 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Here, Coney\u2019s complaint alleged at most medical malpractice and not deliberate indifference. Coney\u2019s own allegations establish that he was monitored by prison medical staff regularly, was referred to specialists, received three surgeries and was prescribed pain medications and antibiotics. Coney\u2019s claim rests on his difference of opinion with the prison medical staff over the course of his treatment, which does not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">Coney also argues that the district court\u2019s refusal to allow him to amend his complaint, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), was an abuse of discretion and a violation of due process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Pursuant to Rule 15(a), a party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served. Otherwise a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party, and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Prisoners are afforded \u201cthe same benefit of Rule 15(a) as any other litigant.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1348. The district court, however, need not allow a prisoner to amend his complaint prior to dismissing it under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(n) if the prisoner has failed either to attach a copy of the proposed amendment or to give the court some indication about what the substance of his proposed amendment would be. <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">In his objections to the R &amp; R, Coney asked for leave to amend his complaint, but failed to present any reasons for an amendment. In fact, Coney argued that his complaint was sufficient as drafted. Furthermore, Coney failed to attach a proposed amended complaint or to give to the district court an indication of the substance of his proposed amendment. Accordingly, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed Coney\u2019s complaint without first allowing him to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-10\">. Coney\u2019s complaint raised claims against the United States Bureau of Prisons, the prison warden, Deering Hospital, and various other prison medical staff. The magistrate judge recommended dismissing Coney\u2019s claims against the United States and Deering Hospital because they were not \"individuals\u201d that could be sued pursuant to <em>Bivens. </em>The magistrate judge also recommended dismissing Coney\u2019s Federal Tort Claims Act, conspiracy and state law claims. Coney does not appeal the dismissal of these claims, and we do not address them further. <em>See Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., </em>270 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that issues not raised in the initial brief on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-9\">.
