See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b211-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Jorge Plata-Oceguera pled guilty to one count of reentry of an aggravated felon, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) (2000). Plata-Oceguera appeals, challenging the fifty-four month prison sentence imposed by the district court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Plata-Oceguera first argues that the district court improperly sentenced him to a term exceeding two years under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) (2000). Under \u00a7 1326(a), an alien who illegally returns to the United States after being removed may be imprisoned for up to two years. However, \u00a7 1326(b)(2) provides that if the alien\u2019s \u201cremoval was subsequent to an aggravated felony,\u201d he faces a maximum prison term of twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Plata-Oceguera concedes that the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision, not an element of the offense which must be charged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was called into question by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny and should no longer be considered binding precedent. Although <em>Apprendi </em>expressed some uncertainty regarding the future vitality of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we have subsequently concluded that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi, </em>and remains the law. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">Next, Plata-Oceguera asserts that the district court erred in adopting the findings in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) that a sixteen-level increase in offense level was warranted under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 (2003), because Plata-Oceguera\u2019s 1997 drug conspiracy conviction resulted in a twenty-five month sentence and qualified as an aggravated felony. To the extent that Plata-Oceguera challenges the finding that the length of his 1997 sentence was twenty-five months, we find that he failed to meet his burden of showing that information relied upon by the district court was incorrect. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">We also reject Plata-Oceguera\u2019s argument that the district court miscalculated his guideline range. In determining a sentence, the court must calculate and consider the guideline range, as well as the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cA sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) of the federal sentencing guidelines applies a sixteen-level enhancement if the defendant was previously deported after \u201ca conviction for a felony that is ... a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence exceeded 13 months.\u201d Here, the district court properly calculated Plata-Oceguera\u2019s guideline range to include a sixteen-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) because Plata-Oceguera was previously deported after his 1997 drug trafficking conviction for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>he received a twenty-five month sentence. We therefore find that Plata-Oceguera\u2019s sentence was within the statutory maximum and was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">For these reasons, we affirm Plata-Oceguera\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
