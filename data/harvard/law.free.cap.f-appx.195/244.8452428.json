He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP\u2019s) method of calculating his good-time credits under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Roberts argues that the BOP has incorrectly interpreted \u00a7 3624(b), resulting in the potential loss of 65 days of good-time credits. In <em>Sample v. Morrison, </em>406 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2005), this court rejected the precise arguments that Roberts now advances. The <em>Sample </em>court dismissed the appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, however, concluding that the petition was not ripe for review. <em>Id. </em>at 312. The court concluded that the \u201ctemporally distant and speculative nature\u201d of the claims rendered the \u00a7 2241 petition premature. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">As Roberts concedes, his arguments are foreclosed by <em>Sample. </em>Because Roberts is seeking the same sort of relief found premature in <em>Sample, </em>we dismiss the instant appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
