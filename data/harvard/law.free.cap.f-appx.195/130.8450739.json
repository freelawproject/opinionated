Pankey was sentenced following the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court applied the holding of <em>Booker </em>and sentenced Pankey to fifty-seven months imprisonment. On appeal, Pankey claims her sentence is unreasonable because the district court should have sentenced her below the guideline range to account for the 100-to-l sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine sentences. Moreover, she claims the sentence is greater than necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-21\">Pankey\u2019s challenge to the 100-to-l sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine sentences is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 633-34 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert., filed </em>(No. 05-11659)(June 20, 2006). Moreover, Pankey\u2019s sentence was both within the guideline range of 57-71 months and well within the statutory maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>mum of twenty years imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) (2000). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3558(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (holding that a sentence within the properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>Eura, </em>440 F.3d at 632 (\u201cTo establish the reasonableness of a sentence, a district court need not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Pankey\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
