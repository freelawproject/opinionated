He contends that counsel\u2019s failure to object to three convictions listed in enhancement paragraphs resulted in his being sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment as an habitual offender pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.42(d) (Vernon 2003), within a range of life or 25-99 years of imprisonment, instead of as a first degree felon pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.42(b) (Vernon 2003), within a range of life or 5-99 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Warner has not rebutted the correctness of the finding of the Texas Court of Appeals that he was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 12.42(b) by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). He thus cannot demonstrate prejudice arising from counsel\u2019s failure to object to the enhancement paragraphs. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">Warner also states that, because the state failed to present evidence regarding his prior convictions, his sentence should have been 2-20 years. He does not contend, however, that counsel was ineffective for advising him to plead \u201ctrue,\u201d so he has failed to raise a meritorious ineffective-assistance contention. <em>See Long v. McCotter, </em>792 F.2d 1338, 1342 (5th Cir.1986) (stating that a \u201ctrue\u201d plea \u201cwaive[d] subsequent challenges to the validity of the pri- or eonviction[s] set forth in the charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
