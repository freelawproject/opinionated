The district court sentenced Mata to concurrent terms of 108 months of imprisonment as to each count, five years of supervised release as to count one, and three years of supervised release as to count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Mata argues that the district court plainly erred in imposing a term of supervised release of five years as to count one, and urges this court to reduce that term to three years. Mata did not raise this issue in the district court. Therefore, we will review the district court\u2019s decision for plain error. <em>See United States v. Allison, </em>447 F.3d 402, 405 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">As a person convicted of a class B felony, <em>see </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(2), Mata was subject to a term of supervised release of \u201cnot more than five years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(1). The statute Mata was convicted of violating in count one provides that \u201c[njotwithstanding section 3583 of title 18, any sentence imposed under this subparagraph shall, in the absence of ... a prior conviction, include a term of supervised release of at least 4 years.\u201d \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Mata\u2019s five-year term of supervised release complies with both statutory provisions. Accordingly, the district court committed no error, plain or otherwise, and we AFFIRM the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
