Vander Gore was sentenced to life imprisonment; Johnny Gore was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. On direct appeal, we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Gore, </em>102 Fed.Appx. 292 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). We also denied Johnny Gore\u2019s motion for permission to file a pro se supplemental brief in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the judgments and remanded both cases to this court for further consideration. <em>See Gore v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 958, 125 S.Ct. 1746, 161 L.Ed.2d 597 (2005) (Vander Gore); <em>Gore v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 1181, 125 S.Ct. 1407, 161 L.Ed.2d 177 (2005) (Johnny Gore).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that when a defendant is sentenced under a mandatory guidelines scheme, \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 543 U.S. at 224, 125 S.Ct. 738. Thus, error under the Sixth Amendment occurs when the district court imposes a sentence greater than the maximum permitted based on facts found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">Subsequently, in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005), this court held that a sentence that was imposed under the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory sentencing scheme and was enhanced based on facts found by the court, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>found by a jury or admitted by the defendant, constitutes plain error. That error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and warrants reversal under <em>Booker </em>when the record does not disclose what discretionary sentence the district court would have imposed under an advisory guideline scheme. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-56. We directed sentencing courts to calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider that range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2005), and impose a sentence. If the district court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the court should state its reasons for doing so. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546; <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 459-56 (4th Cir.2006). <em>Hughes </em>also recognized \u201cthat after <em>Booker, </em>there are two potential errors in a sentence imposed pursuant to the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory guidelines regime: a Sixth Amendment error, which Hughes raised, and an error in failing to treat the guidelines as advisory, which Hughes did not raise.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005), we held that treating the guidelines as mandatory, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation, was plain error in light of <em>Booker. White, </em>405 F.3d at 216-17. We declined to presume prejudice in this situation, <em>id. </em>at 217-22, holding that the \u201cprejudice inquiry, therefore, is ... whether after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, ... the judgment was ... substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). To make this showing, a defendant must \u201cdemonstrate, based on the record, that the treatment of the guidelines as mandatory caused the district court to impose a longer sentence than it otherwise would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224. Because \u201cthe record as a whole provide[d] no nonspeculative basis for concluding that the treatment of the guidelines as mandatory \u2018affect[ed] the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed,\u201d \u2019 <em>id. </em>at 223 (quoting <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)), we concluded in <em>White </em>that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and thus affirmed the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 225; <em>see also United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d at 524-25 (finding that defendant faded to demonstrate prejudice from being sentenced under the mandatory sentencing guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Vander Gore (No. 02-4566) was indicted and convicted of participating in a drug trafficking conspiracy involving fifty grams of crack cocaine and five kilograms of cocaine. These amounts correspond to a base offense level of thirty-two. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4). The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) assigned Vander Gore a base offense level of thirty-eight, based on 524.46 grams of crack cocaine and 285.04 kilograms of powder cocaine, resulting in a combined marijuana equivalency of 67,-497.2 grams. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">The PSR also recommended a four-level enhancement for a leadership role in the conspiracy, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), and a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. Therefore, the PSR recommended a total offense level of forty-four. The district court adopted the PSR\u2019s recommendations, including the enhancements by a preponderance of the evidence, and the total offense level of forty-four resulted in Vander Gore\u2019s life sentence. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Absent judicial factfinding concerning the drug weight, as well as the enhancements for Vander Gore\u2019s leadership role and obstruction of justice, Vander Gore\u2019s total offense level would have been thirty-two. Based on a criminal history category of I, the guidelines would have provided for 121-151 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. 1 (sentencing table). Because Vander Gore\u2019s sentence was imposed under the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory sentencing scheme and was enhanced based on facts found by the court, not found by a jury or admitted by Vander Gore, his life sentence constitutes plain error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. Therefore, we vacate Vander Gore\u2019s sentence and remand the case to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The jury convicted Johnny Gore (No. 02-4908) of distribution and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, and the district court sentenced him to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because Johnny Gore had previously been convicted of two prior felony drug convictions, he qualified as a career offender. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), because Gore\u2019s statutory maximum sentence was life imprisonment, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii)(II) (2000), the PSR provided for an offense level of thirty-seven. As a career offender, Johnny Gore\u2019s criminal history category was VI. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Accordingly, Johnny Gore\u2019s range of imprisonment under the then-mandatory guidelines was 360 months to life. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table). Therefore, his 360-month sentence, which was only enhanced based on his prior convictions, did not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">However, even in the absence of Sixth Amendment error, the district court\u2019s treatment of the sentencing guidelines as mandatory was erroneous. <em>See White, </em>405 F.3d at 216-17. We conclude that, in light of Johnny Gore\u2019s attempts to raise the sentencing issue on direct appeal <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and on other occasions, he has preserved the issue. <em>See generally United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415-16 (4th Cir.2006). Therefore, we review to determine whether the error was harmless. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 268, 125 S.Ct. 738 (noting that appellate courts may apply the plain error and harmless error doctrines in determining whether resentencing is required); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (stating that an appellate court may disregard any error that does not affect substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">On harmless error review, the Government bears the burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect Johnny Gore\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Stokes, </em>261 F.3d 496, 499 (4th Cir.2001). The Government has not met this burden, and indeed concedes Johnny Gore should be resentenced under an advisory application of the sentencing guidelines. We vacate Johnny Gore\u2019s sentence and remand his case to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. </em>Furthermore, we deny Johnny Gore\u2019s motions for summary remand, to file exhibits, and to file a pro se supplemental brief, in which he makes the specious argument that his sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>tribute 500 grams or more of cocaine is constitutionally infirm because the conduct was never charged by indictment. The superseding indictment clearly alleged a conspiracy involving, among other controlled substances, five kilograms or more of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In sum, we affirm the convictions of both Vander Gore and Johnny Gore for the reasons set forth in our 2004 opinion addressing these appeals. We vacate both Vander Gore\u2019s and Johnny Gore\u2019s sentences and remand for further proceedings in light of <em>Booker. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\"> Although Johnny Gore sought to file a pro se supplemental brief in his initial direct appeal raising a challenge to the imposition of sentence pursuant to the then-mandatory guidelines claim, that brief was rejected because he was represented by counsel and thus had no independent right to file a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
