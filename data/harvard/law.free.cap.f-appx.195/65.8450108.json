Golphin watched Pryor exit the Acura, enter the bar, return to the Acura accompanied by two men, and retrieve a plastic baggie from the driver\u2019s side door. From inside the unmarked van where he was conducting surveillance, Golphin saw Pryor remove several small bundles and give them to one of the men in exchange for cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Shortly thereafter, Golphin witnessed Pryor lift his shirt, pull a black handgun from his waistline, and put the gun in the trunk. Golphin then saw Pryor retrieve from the trunk a plastic baggie containing objects Golphin believed to be cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d), enter the car, and begin to drive away. Some minutes later, Philadelphia police officers stopped the Acura. As Philadelphia Police Officer Victor DaVilla and Sergeant Paul Brown approached the Acura, DaVilla saw a person in the front passenger seat of the vehicle, later determined to be Appellant Stacey Crittenton, shove an object later determined to be a baggie filled with crack into a passenger-side door compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Police drove Appellants to the police station, impounded the Acura, and searched Appellants. They recovered several hundred dollars in cash from each. Officers also recovered from Crittenton, inter alia: (1) a plastic baggie with the image of a red apple on it containing seven heat-sealed packets later determined to contain heroin, (2) a piece of paper with the word \u201csmaec\u201d on it, (3) a pager, and (4) six red-tinted ziploc packets later determined to contain crack. Police recovered packets of crack and heroin from the Acura\u2019s center console. Police recovered from the trunk: (1) a shopping bag containing a handgun (loaded with one live round in the chamber and seven live rounds in the magazine), (2) a cardboard box containing equipment commonly used in the sale of drugs, (3) baggies containing heroin and quinine, (4) ziploc baggies, (5) twenty-eight glass jars later determined to contain marijuana, and (6) a gas and an electric bill each in the name of Naim Pryor. Five- and-a-half months later, in May 2003, ATF Special Agent Vitzthum searched the Acura again and found a red-apple baggie and a slip of paper with \u201csmaee\u201d and the pager number associated with the pager that had been found on Crittenton\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In May 2003, a grand jury charged Pryor and Crittenton with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, crack, heroin, and marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (count one), and with possession with intent to distribute those same drugs and aiding and abetting such possession in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(c) (counts two to five). The indictment also charged Pryor with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (count six) and charged that Pryor \u201cknowingly used, and carried a firearm ... during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (count seven). App. at 706. Pryor and Crittenton proceeded to jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">In June 2004, the jury found both Pryor and Crittenton guilty on counts one through five. The jury found Pryor guilty on count six. Whether the jury found Pryor guilty on count seven is a matter of dispute in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Crittenton <em>was </em>sentenced in December 2004, one month before the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He appealed his sentence to this court, but we remanded this appeal to the District Court for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. </em>In July 2005, Crittenton was resentenced to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>pervised release, and a $500 special assessment. He timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Pryor was sentenced in January 2005, shortly after <em>Booker </em>was decided, to 120 months\u2019 concurrent imprisonment on counts one to six, five years\u2019 consecutive imprisonment on count seven, six years\u2019 supervised release, and a $400 special assessment. He timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We exercise plenary review of the Government\u2019s argument that Crittenton waived his right to the present appeal. <em>See Gibbs v. Cross, </em>160 F.3d 962, 964 (3d Cir.1998). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in <em>Booker, </em>this court sent notices to appellants in all pending cases requesting response as to whether they wished to challenge both their convictions and sentences or only their sentences. However, no such notice was sent to Crittenton. Instead, Crittenton filed an unopposed motion for summary action and remand for resentencing under <em>Booker </em>before any notice could be issued. In that motion, Crittenton made no comment as to whether or not he intended to challenge his conviction. On May 10, 2005, we entered an order stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">Appellant\u2019s unopposed motion for summary remand is granted. Appellant challenges [his] sentence but not [his] conviction under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>[543 U.S. 220] 125 S.Ct. 738 [160 L.Ed.2d 621] (2005), and we have determined that the sentencing issues Appellant raises are best determined by the District Court in the first instance. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-8\"><em>United States v. Crittenton, </em>No. 04-4717 (3d Cir. May 10, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The Government relies on <em>United States v. Pultrone, </em>241 F.3d 306 (3d Cir. 2001), to support its argument that Crittenton\u2019s failure to present objections to his conviction at the time he filed his motion for summary remand constituted a waiver of any challenge to his conviction. However, unlike Crittenton, Pultrone voluntarily moved to dismiss his own appeal and the case proceeded in this court to full briefing and resolution on the merits of the government\u2019s cross-appeal. <em>United States v. Pultrone, </em>No. 97-1271 (3d Cir. Aug. 19, 1997) (order granting appellant\u2019s request to withdraw appeal); <em>United States v. Pultrone, </em>No. 97-1327, 149 F.3d 1166 (3d Cir. Mar. 9, 1998) (unpublished opinion vacating sentence and remanding); <em>see Pultrone, </em>241 F.3d at 308 (\u201c[B]ecause Pultrone abandoned his appeal, no other aspect of his conviction or sentence was at issue.\u201d). In the present case, Crittenton did not withdraw his appeal, and we did not review the merits of an appeal by either party. <em>United States v. Crittenton, </em>No. 04-4717 (3d Cir. May 10, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">After Crittenton\u2019s motion for summary remand, this court routinely instructed parties that a motion seeking summary remand for resentencing under <em>Booker </em>must state that only the sentence and not the conviction was being challenged. Crittenton did not have the benefit of such notice. Given the confusion surrounding <em>Booker </em>and the fact that this court had no procedure in place for <em>post-Booker </em>review at the time Crittenton filed his motion, we conclude that Crittenton did not waive the present challenge to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">Appellants make three major arguments on appeal. First, Pryor argues that the District Court violated his Fifth Amendment right to be tried only on the grand jury\u2019s charges when the Court instructed the trial jury on a different of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>fense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) than that contained in count seven of the indictment. A constructive amendment occurs where a defendant is deprived of his or her \u201csubstantial right to be tried only on charges presented in an indictment returned by a grand jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Syme, </em>276 F.3d 131, 149 (3d Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Such a \u201cconstructive amendment to the indictment constitutes \u2018a <em>per se </em>violation of the fifth amendment\u2019s grand jury clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The parties agree that we review this constructive amendment issue for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Ordinarily, the defendant must establish that: (1) the court erred and (2) the error was \u201cplain\u201d (i.e., obvious) under the law at the time of review, and (3) the error affected his or her substantial rights. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). However, where the district court erred by constructively amending an indictment, such error is \u201cpresumed prejudicial in the plain error context\u201d and the Government bears the burden of proving the absence of the third element (i.e., the Government must show that the constructive amendment did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights). <em>United States v. Syme, </em>276 F.3d 131, 151, 154 (3d Cir.2002). \u201cAn error affects substantial rights when it is prejudicial and affects the outcome of district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>454 F.3d 187, 193 (3d Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 162, 164 (3d Cir.2005)). Where plain error has affected substantial rights, this court, in its discretion, may award relief in favor of the defendant where the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (citation omitted). We will refer to this discretionary determination as the fourth prong of plain error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">At the time of the alleged offense, \u00a7 924(c)(1)(a) provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, <em>or who, </em>in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall [receive additional punishment].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">(emphasis added). This statute therefore provided for two separate offenses: (1) the \u201cuse\u201d or \u201ccarrying\u201d of a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d a drug-trafficking crime, and (2) the \u201cpossession\u201d of a firearm \u201cin furtherance\u201d of a drug-trafficking crime. In the present case, the Government \u201creadily concedes\u201d the first two prongs of plain error analysis, i.e., \u201cthat the [District [C]ourt erred in instructing the jury on the elements of \u2018possession\u2019 and \u2018in furtherance of,\u2019 rather th[a]n the elements of \u2018use or carry\u2019 and \u2018during and in relation to\u2019\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(a), and that the error was \u201cobvious.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee\u2019s Br. at 25; <em>accord id. </em>at 24 (\u201cThe [District [C]ourt ... mistakenly instructed the jury regarding a separate prong of Section 924(c).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Pryor argues that the error conceded by the Government in the present case is \u201cstructural.\u201d Reply Br. at 6. Where an error is structural, it normally \u201cconstitute[s] per se reversible error even under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>plain error review.\u201d <em>Syme, </em>276 F.3d at 156 n. 10; <em>see Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991). In <em>Syme, </em>this court noted that \u201cit is doubtful that constructive amendments are structural errors\u201d but we failed to decide that question because the Government in that case could not rebut the presumption that the constructive amendment there affected Syme\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 156, 156 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The Government makes two arguments to rebut the presumption that the District Court\u2019s constructive amendment of the grand jury charge affected Pryor\u2019s substantial rights. First, the Government argues that the \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d element of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(a) is always satisfied by a jury finding that the defendant committed the offense \u201cin furtherance\u201d of drug-trafficking (i.e., \u201cin furtherance\u201d is, under any circumstances, a more stringent standard). We have acknowledged that \u201cCongress may well have intended \u2018in furtherance\u2019 to impose a more stringent standard than \u2018in relation to.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Loney, </em>219 F.3d 281, 287 (3d Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Combs, </em>369 F.3d 925, 932 (6th Cir.2004) (noting \u201cin furtherance\u201d standard is a \u201cslightly higher standard\u201d and \u201cencompass[es] the \u2018during and in relation to\u2019 language\u201d). Although we refrain from reaching the question whether the \u201cin furtherance\u201d standard always encompasses the \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d language, in the present case there is no circumstance in which the defendants could have acted \u201cin furtherance\u201d of drug distribution without acting \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d that distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Second, the Government argues that the \u201cuses or carries\u201d element of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(a) is satisfied, under the facts of the present case, by the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant \u201cpossess[ed]\u201d a gun in furtherance of drug trafficking. The District Court instructed the jury that possession includes both actual possession (e.g., holding a gun on one\u2019s person) and constructive possession (e.g., exerting dominion and control over a gun). In <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998), the Supreme Court held that \u201ccarries\u201d includes both actual possession of a firearm on one\u2019s person and constructive possession of a firearm in a vehicle, even if the firearm is in the trunk or a locked glove compartment. <em>Id. </em>at 138-39, 118 S.Ct. 1911. Relying on <em>Muscarello, </em>the Government argues that the jury could not have concluded that Pryor possessed the gun without carrying it because all of the evidence pointed to Pryor\u2019s possession of the gun either on his person or in the trunk of the Acura.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">We agree with the Government that, given the evidence in the record, a jury finding that Pryor possessed the firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime necessarily subsumed a finding that Pryor carried the firearm during and in relation to that crime. For that reason, if the District Court gave proper instructions to the jury about the possession-in-furtherance prong, there was no violation of Pryor\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Pryor argues in his reply brief, however, that the District Court failed to properly instruct the jury. He contends that the District Court did not make entirely clear that \u201ccarrying\u201d a firearm \u201cin relation to\u201d requires \u201cthat the carrying be non-accidental and not a coincidence.\u201d Reply Br. at 12; <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>344 F.3d 365, 371-72 (3d Cir.2003). The District Court instructed, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">To prove that the defendant possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense the Government must prove that the defendant possessed a firearm that further advanced, promoted or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>helped forward one or more of the drug trafficking crimes charged....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">App. at 664. Pryor argues that therefore the jury was instructed that \u201c \u2018in furtherance\u2019 means the firearm had the effect of aiding the offense, whether or not the defendant intended it to do so.... \u201d Reply Br. at 13.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">As in <em>Johnson, </em>where the district court failed to submit the element of materiality to the jury, the District Court\u2019s alleged failure to instruct the jury on the element of intent in the present case may or may not amount to a \u201cstructural error.\u201d <em>See Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 469, 117 S.Ct. 1544. However, \u201cwe need not decide that question because, even assuming that the failure to submit [intent] to the jury \u2018affected substantial rights,\u2019 it does not meet the final requirement\u201d of plain error analysis. <em>Id. </em>We cannot conclude that the forfeited error \u201c \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u2019 \u201d in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544 (quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The evidence that the gun\u2019s presence in the trunk was non-accidental and not a coincidence was overwhelming. <em>See id. </em>at 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544. Pryor argues that accidental presence of the gun is possible because the jury could have credited the testimony of his fiancee that she \u201cdid not know\u201d if Pryor or her brother had put the gun in the trunk, and therefore the jury could have entertained a reasonable doubt as to whether Pryor had any intent to \u201ccarry\u201d the gun \u201cin relation to\u201d the drug distribution offense found by the jury to have occurred \u2014 i.e., given the opportunity to use the gun to protect himself from an attempted robbery, he would not have done so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This argument is far-fetched. On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the District Court\u2019s error \u201cseriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">Appellants\u2019 second major argument on appeal is that the prosecutor committed reversible misconduct by eliciting testimony from Police Detective Gaul, an expert witness, about the relationship between drug dealing and violence that overstepped the District Court\u2019s ruling restricting such testimony, and by making inappropriate statements in summation about this relationship. In response to defense objections about Gaul\u2019s testimony, the Court ruled, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we limit it to the question, in his experience is it common for those who are dealing in drugs to carry weapons? ... [A]sk him that and ask him the answer is yes or no. Let\u2019s ... leave it at that....\u201d App. at 438-39. Because the Appellants failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper questioning of Gaul after the Court\u2019s ruling, we review for plain error. We also review the prosecutor\u2019s summation statement for plain error because there was no objection. <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>ed States v. Moore, </em>375 F.3d 259, 263 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u201cIn order to demonstrate prosecutorial misconduct under a plain error standard, the review must reveal egregious error or a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Brennan, </em>326 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>254 F.3d 454, 458) (quotation marks omitted). We have carefully reviewed the questioning and summation alleged by Appellants to demonstrate misconduct, and conclude that any misconduct arguably therein falls far short of \u201cegregious error\u201d or \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice,\u201d especially in light of the District Court\u2019s curative instruction to the jury to \u201cdisregard ... any inference that there\u2019s any violence in this matter.\u201d App. at 484; <em>see Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 766 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In their third major argument, Appellants contend that the trial court committed plain error in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 704(b) when it allowed Police Detective Gaul to opine on the \u201cpurpose\u201d for which Appellants possessed the controlled substances in the present case. Appellants argue that this testimony impermissibly presented to the jury expert opinion going to an element of the drug distribution charge \u2014 i.e., the defendants\u2019 mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Rule 704(b) states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">No expert witness testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case may state an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged or of a defense thereto. Such ultimate issues are matters for the trier of fact alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">In addition to an expert\u2019s actual testimony, this court held in <em>United States v. Watson, </em>260 F.3d 301 (3d Cir.2001), that \u201cRule 704(b) may [also] be violated [by a] prosecutor\u2019s question [when it] is plainly designed to elicit the expert\u2019s testimony about the mental state of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Many of the statements alleged by Appellants to be reversible plain error explicitly referred to items in evidence as being \u201cconsistent with\u201d drug distribution. Such testimony is not prohibited by Rule 704(b). <em>United States v. Davis, </em>397 F.3d 173, 179 (3d Cir.2005). However, two of Gaul\u2019s statements did not include the words \u201cconsistent with.\u201d First, Gaul stated, \u201cIn my opinion, the narcotics and all the paraphernalia in reference to this investigation shows that the purpose for these are for distribution to sell,\u201d App. at 429. Second, Gaul stated, \u201c[W]hen I form an opinion I take in the factors of the totality of the circumstances and [rubber bands next to drug paraphernalia and drugs are] just one more [of the factors] that form[my] opinion that the drugs were possessed with the purpose for distribution,\u201d App. at 446-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Gaul\u2019s choice of words does not necessarily suggest that he was opining on Appellants\u2019 intent. His statements could equally suggest merely that an array of drugs and paraphernalia such as that found in the present case is consistent with drug distribution. As such, any error in allowing the statement was not \u201cplain,\u201d such that the District Court should have noticed the putative Rule 704(b) problem absent defense counsel\u2019s objection. Similarly, the prosecutor\u2019s questions were not plainly designed to elicit testimony about Appellants\u2019 mental state. <em>See Watson, </em>260 F.3d at 309. Moreover, we conclude that there was no violation of Appellants\u2019 substantial rights because the absence of Gaul\u2019s statements would not have led to a different trial outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\">.
