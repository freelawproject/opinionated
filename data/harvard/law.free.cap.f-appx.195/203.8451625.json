Specifically, Davis alleged that she was denied a promotion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in 2001 based on her membership in a labor union, in violation of the Louisiana Constitution, and was denied the same promotion in 2002 because of her race and gender, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17. The DHH removed the case to federal court. Davis then voluntarily amended her petition, deleting her federal claims, and moved to remand the case to state court. The district court denied the motion to remand, and the case proceeded to trial. After judgement was entered in accordance with a jury verdict in favor of the DHH, Davis appealed the district court\u2019s refusal to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The primary dispute between the parties pertains to the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over Davis\u2019s state law claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a) permits removal of actions of which the United States district courts have original jurisdiction. \u00a7 1441(a); <em>Melder v. Allstate Corp., </em>404 F.3d 328, 335 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s determination of the propriety of removal de novo.\u201d <em>State of Texas v. Walker, </em>142 F.3d 813, 816 (5th Cir.1998). The propriety of removal is determined by looking to the plaintiffs complaint as it existed in state court at the time of removal. <em>Cavallini v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>44 F.3d 256, 264 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">At the time of removal, Davis\u2019s complaint included a federal discrimination claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) and a state law discrimination claim, which alleged a violation of La. Const, art. X \u00a7 10(a)(3). We have held that a federal claim, \u201cthough [later] abandoned, permits a district court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over remaining state claims.\u201d <em>McGowin v. ManPower Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 556, 558 n. 1 (5th Cir.2004); <em>accord Mathis v. Exxon Corp., </em>302 F.3d 448, 452 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (5th Cir.2002)(concluding that abandonment of the federal, jurisdiction-conferring claims did not divest the district court of jurisdiction over supplemental state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>claims); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). The federal district court had supplemental jurisdiction over Davis\u2019s state claim if it formed part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution as Davis\u2019s Title VII claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). Two claims form part of the same case or controversy when they derive from a common nucleus of operative fact. <em>City of Chicago v. Int\u2019l Coll. of Surgeons, </em>522 U.S. 156, 164-66, 118 S.Ct. 523, 139 L.Ed.2d 525 (1997); <em>see State Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. Inc. v. Yates, </em>391 F.3d 577, 579 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Davis\u2019s state law claims are supplemental to her federal claim, and the district court had jurisdiction to hear the case. The state and federal claims derive from a common nucleus of operative fact, as a substantial number of factual issues are common to both claims. <em>See Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co. v. United States, </em>519 F.2d 1184, 1194 (5th Cir.1975); <em>see also Palmer v. Hosp. Auth. of Randolph County, 22 F.3d </em>1559, 1563-64 (11th Cir.1994). Both Davis\u2019s state and federal claims involve evidence of the application process and the qualifications required for the position of Assistant Director of Nursing, the factors that the DHH considered in evaluating applicants for promotion to the position, and the qualifications of other applicants relative to Davis. Facts relating to Davis\u2019s education, period of employment, work experience, and her performance on formal and informal reviews are relevant to both claims. Davis\u2019s claims are so intertwined that they form part of the same case or controversy. <em>See Voelker v. Porsche Cars N. Am., Inc., </em>353 F.3d 516, 522 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u201c[A] district court has discretion to remand a properly removed case to state court when all federal-law claims have been eliminated and only [supplemental] state-law claims remain.\u201d <em>Jones v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>936 F.2d 789, 792 (5th Cir.1991). Davis argues that the district court erred in refusing to remand the case to state court after she dismissed her federal claim. We review the district court\u2019s denial of Davis\u2019s motion to remand for abuse of discretion. <em>Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum Co. v. Dresser Indus., </em>972 F.2d 580, 585 (5th Cir.1992). In determining whether to retain jurisdiction over state claims, a court should consider judicial economy, convenience and fairness to the litigants, and comity with state courts. <em>Id. </em>Given the absence of any complex or novel issues of state law and the significant time and resources then already devoted to this case, the district court did not err in its refusal to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-14\">.
