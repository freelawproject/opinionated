He contends that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Arias\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated advisory guideline range and is presumed reasonable. <em>See United, States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Giving \u201cgreat deference\u201d to such a sentence, and recognizing that the sentencing court considered all the factors for a fair sentence under \u00a7 3553(a), we conclude that Arias has failed to rebut the presumption that his sentence was reasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Arias challenges 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Arias\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Arias contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Arias properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
