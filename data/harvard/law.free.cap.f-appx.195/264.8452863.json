Garcia appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court mistakenly believed that the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory when it sentenced him. In addition, Garcia argues that his sentence is unreasonable and that the enhancement provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The record belies Garcia\u2019s contention that the district court sentenced him believing that the Guidelines were still mandatory. At sentencing, the district court stated that it knew that it was not bound by the Guidelines. Furthermore, there is no indication that the sentence the district court imposed, which was at the low end of the guidelines range of imprisonment, was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, 435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th </em>Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Garcia\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Garcia contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Garcia properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
