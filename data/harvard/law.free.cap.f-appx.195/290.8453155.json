Walker has also filed two motions seeking leave to file supplemental briefs on appeal; those two motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-19\">Walker\u2019s claim that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) required the Bureau of Prisons to award him 54 days of credit, in advance, for each year of imprisonment that the district court imposed is foreclosed. <em>See Moreland v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>431 F.3d 180, 186 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1906, 164 L.Ed.2d 583 (2006). Moreover, Walker\u2019s contention that the application of its interpretation of \u00a7 3624(b) to him violates the Ex Post Facto Clause is without merit. As he admits, the Bureau of Prisons has applied \u00a7 3624(b)(1) consistently since before Walker was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-21\">IFP DENIED; LEAVE TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEFS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
