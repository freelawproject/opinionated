Because we conclude that Diaz\u2019s offense level was improperly enhanced for obstruction of justice, we vacate her sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">On appeal, Diaz raises four assertions of error in the determination of her sentence. She first argues that the district court erred in enhancing her offense level for obstruction of justice and denying her a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. The court\u2019s decision arose from a statement Diaz gave to officers after her arrest, in which she stated that she committed the passport application fraud under the direction of an individual named Jose Luis Rodriguez. The district court concluded that Diaz\u2019s statement regarding Rodriguez was false and that the Government expended significant resources attempting to locate Rodriguez based upon that statement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which supported an enhancement for obstruction of justice and the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">We review a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant obstructed justice for clear error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 560 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire record is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Go., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). The Sentencing Guidelines<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provide for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-17\">\u201c[Pjroviding a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>cantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense\u201d is specifically listed as an example of conduct for which the enhancement is appropriate. USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(g)). A false statement regarding the culpability of a co-defendant is sufficient to support the enhancement. <em>United States v. Kiulin, </em>360 F.3d 456, 460 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to impose the obstruction of justice enhancement was clearly erroneous. Although a district court is given broad discretion in the type of information it may consider at sentencing, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (2000), the information offered by the Government to support the enhancement in this case is insufficient. Significantly, the Government offered no testimony to establish the falsity of Diaz\u2019s statement or the significance of the impairment that the statement caused to the investigation. As the issue of the falsity of Diaz\u2019s statement was disputed, the district court erred in relying on mere proffers from the AUSA to support the enhancement. Because the court\u2019s denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility was based upon its finding that Diaz obstructed justice, this conclusion is also erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Diaz also argues that the district court erred in enhancing her offense level because the children whose identities were used in the fraud scheme were vulnerable victims, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), and in applying a two-level enhancement based on the use of a minor in the commission of the offense, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3B1.4. We have considered Diaz\u2019s arguments and find that the district court properly applied these enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Diaz\u2019s final argument is that her sentence is unreasonable under <em>Booker </em>because the district court failed to consider the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), other than the Guidelines. Because we conclude that the Guidelines range was not properly determined, Diaz\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (sentence resulting from error in construing or applying the Guidelines will be found unreasonable and vacated), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">We therefore vacate Diaz\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-13\">. At sentencing, the Assistant United States Attorney stated that the Government was unable to locate Rodriguez at the place of employment provided by Diaz. On appeal, counsel for Diaz states that, with a single telephone call, he verified Rodriguez\u2019s employment during the relevant time period at the taxicab company identified by Diaz, and obtained other information regarding Rodriguez.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-20\">. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. The district court\u2019s denial of a reduction in Diaz's offense level for acceptance of responsibility naturally followed its conclusion that she obstructed justice. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). While we find that conclusion was erroneous, we express no opinion on whether Diaz is entitled to a reduction in her offense level for acceptance of responsibility on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
