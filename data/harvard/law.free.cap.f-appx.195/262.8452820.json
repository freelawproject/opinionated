He first argues that, because his fraudulently obtained visa had not been revoked at the time he presented it, he did not illegally reenter the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Vanchaik frames his argument as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. A voluntary guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional defects that occurred prior to the plea and precludes consideration of a claim challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Hanyard, </em>762 F.2d 1226, 1229-30 (5th Cir.1985). Accordingly, the argument is waived and the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Vanchaik also argues that his 51-month sentence was unreasonable because he returned to the United States only to shop and he had no intention to remain. This court reviews <em>post-Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). The district court sentenced Vanchaik within a properly calculated guideline range. As such, we infer that the court considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines and presume, absent rebuttal, that Vanchaik\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519; <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we also affirm Vanchaik\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
