For the reasons set forth below, we grant the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Alpha manufactures and sells fabrics and composites for use in thermal insulation and other products. In the spring of 2001, Alpha purchased a facility in North Charleston, South Carolina whose production and maintenance unit employees were represented by UNITE. On April 10, 2001, a UNITE representative informed Alpha that UNITE was the longtime representative of those employees and requested bargaining. Alpha did not respond. On July 2, UNITE filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging, in part, that Alpha was a successor employer obliged to recognize and bargain with the union. <em>See NLRB v. Burns Int\u2019l Sec. Servs., Inc., </em>406 U.S. 272, 278-81, 92 S.Ct. 1571, 32 L.Ed.2d 61 (1972). The charge was withdrawn when Alpha advised the Board that it had \u201celected to recognize and bargain with [UNITE].\u201d J.A.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">Alpha negotiated with UNITE for approximately one year. During this period, the union filed two additional unfair labor practice charges against Alpha, both of which it later withdrew. However, beginning in March 2002, Alpha laid off six employees without notice or bargaining. Despite Alpha\u2019s failure to bargain with UNITE regarding the layoffs, Alpha and UNITE continued negotiations. In July 2002, Alpha granted an unbargained wage increase. At this point, UNITE filed a fourth unfair labor practice charge, and bargaining ceased. In January 2003, UNITE filed yet another charge, this one alleging refusal to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">In March 2003, the Board consolidated the charges and scheduled a hearing. Before the Board, Alpha conceded the challenged actions but argued that it had no legal obligation to negotiate with UNITE because its earlier recognition of the union was invalid. On May 31, 2005, the Board held that Alpha was \u201cprecluded [under \u00a7 10(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(b) (West 1998), and equitable estoppel principles] from challenging either the validity of its prior voluntary recognition of the Union or the appropriateness of the recognized unit.\u201d J.A. 103. The Board now petitions for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">We must uphold the Board\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e) (West 1998); the same is true of its application of the law to the facts, <em>see WXGI, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>243 F.3d 833, 840 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">Equitable estoppel precludes one party from asserting rights \u201che otherwise would have had against another when his own conduct renders assertion of those rights contrary to equity.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Paper Co. v. Schwabedissen Maschinen &amp; Anlagen GMBH, </em>206 F.3d 411, 417-18 (4th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the labor context, equitable estoppel involves four elements: knowledge, intent, mistaken belief, and detrimental reliance. <em>See Red Coats, Inc. &amp; Local 82, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union, </em>328 N.L.R.B. 205, 206 (1999). When, as here, the employer seeks to withdraw recognition from a union, the Board additionally considers whether \u201cthe estopped party, by its actions, has obtained a benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Alpha is equitably estopped from denying the validity of its recognition of the union.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Alpha responded to the July 2001 unfair labor practice charge by unambiguously declaring that it had \u201celected to recognize and bargain with [UNITE].\u201d J.A. 86. Alpha\u2019s knowledge and intent are thus clear. It is equally clear that UNITE relied on this representation to its detriment by withdrawing the original unfair labor practice charge. And, Alpha benefited from its recognition of the union by avoiding a disruptive union organizing campaign or costly litigation. Alpha cannot now challenge its earlier recognition as invalid. As the Board aptly observed, \u201cthe policies of the Act are not served by allowing [Alpha] to use the process of voluntary recognition to gain a benefit, only to cast off this process when it does not achieve what it desires in negotiations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105 (internal quotation marks <em>&amp; </em>alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we grant the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\n<em>PETITION GRANTED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\"> Because we conclude that Alpha is equitably estopped from challenging its voluntary recognition of UNITE, we need not consider whether \u00a7 10(b) applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
