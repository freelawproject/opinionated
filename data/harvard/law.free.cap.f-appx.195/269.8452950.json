She argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Barbosa contends that her plea agreement, which contained a waiver-of-appeal provision, does not bar this appeal because she is challenging the constitutionality of the statute of conviction and her sentence is in excess of the statutory maximum. The Government seeks to enforce the appeal waiver. We assume, <em>arguendo </em>only, that the waiver does not bar the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Barbosa\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Barbosa contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Barbosa properly concedes that her argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but she raises it here to preserve it for further review. Because Barbosa has shown no error in the judgment of the district court, that judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
