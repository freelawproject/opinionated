In 2001, an immigration judge (IJ) ordered Husain removed to Canada pursuant to \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), for having been convicted of an aggravated felony firearms offense. The IJ denied Husain\u2019s motion for reconsideration and, in early 2002, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed without opinion. In late 2002, the BIA denied Husain\u2019s motion to reopen or reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-17\">Husain apparently completed serving his felony-firearms sentence in 2004. On 27 December 2004, Husain filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition seeking judicial review of his removal order. He was removed to Canada in early 2005. In June 2005, the habeas petition was transferred to this court pursuant to the Real ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 106(c), 119 Stat. 231, 311, to be treated as a timely petition for review. <em>See Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>--- U.S. ---, 126 S.Ct. 1055, 163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006). The REAL ID Act provides jurisdiction for this court to review Husain\u2019s constitutional claims and questions of law. <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-21\">Husain, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>contends the IJ violated his due process rights by advising him that he was not entitled to immigration relief, in particular to an adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). Husain further contends the BIA erred by failing to correct the error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>on appeal and abused its discretion by failing to reopen or reconsider its decision. Husain\u2019s appeal to the BIA did not challenge the IJ\u2019s alleged failure to advise him correctly. Accordingly, the BIA did not err by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without considering the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Nor has Husain shown the IJ erred or violated his due process rights by advising him that he was not entitled to immigration relief, in particular relief under \u00a7 1255(a). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(B); <em>see Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 435, 440 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, Husain has not shown the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen or reconsider. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
