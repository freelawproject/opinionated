When the authorities moved to intercept the boat, Melendez and the others tossed bales overboard. The total amount of cocaine recovered exceeded 2,600 kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">At sentencing, the court determined that the applicable guidelines range was 135 to 168 months imprisonment. Melendez moved for a minor-role reduction because he was merely a courier and was not the captain of the boat. The court denied the motion, finding that Melendez was an average participant and the quantity of cocaine exceeded 2,600 kilograms. The court then sentenced Melendez to 135 months imprisonment. Melendez now appeals, challenging the denial of his motion and the court\u2019s alleged failure to articulate specific reasons for its denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s entitlement to a role reduction for clear error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 938 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The defendant has the burden of establishing his role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939; <em>see also United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">A two-level reduction for playing a minor role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) is warranted if the defendant is less culpable than most other participants, but his role could not be described as minimal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3). The district court\u2019s determination concerning a role reduction is premised on a case-by-case factual inquiry. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (backg\u2019d). Minor-role reductions are to be given infrequently. <em>United States v. Costales, </em>5 F.3d 480, 486 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">Two principles guide a district court\u2019s consideration of a possible role reduction. First, the district court must assess whether a defendant is a minor participant in the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 941. Second, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>may assess a defendant\u2019s culpability as compared to other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 944. It is possible that no one involved in the offense was a minor participant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying the minor-role reduction. Melendez was held responsible for the amount of drugs he admitted transporting, and he has not shown that other members of the conspiracy were more culpable than he was. \u201cWhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation [or transportation], a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 942-43. Therefore, the district court properly determined that Melendez was not a minor participant. Moreover, even if Melendez could show that he was less culpable, it is possible than no one was a minor participant. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">We conclude that there was no error in sentencing. The court explained that Melendez was an average participant and that he was being held responsible for the amount of drugs he transported. Such reasons are sufficient to uphold the district court\u2019s findings. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\">. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court is still required to correctly calculate the guidelines range, and the same standards of review apply. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
