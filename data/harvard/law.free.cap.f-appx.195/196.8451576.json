Faulks\u2019 attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues to raise on appeal, but arguing the supervised release statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2000) is unconstitutional under <em>Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that it was improper for the district court to conduct the supervised release revocation hearing prior to Faulks being tried and convicted in state court. In her pro se supplemental brief, Faulks further contends that the Government presented insufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that she engaged in criminal conduct violative of the terms of her supervised release. Because our review of the record discloses no meritorious issues and no error by the district court, we affirm the revocation order and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">We reject Faulks\u2019 constitutional claim as there is no basis in law to support the argument that <em>Booker </em>invalidated the supervised release statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2000), or rendered it unconstitutional. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 258, 125 S.Ct. 738 (enumerating those portions of the Sentencing Reform Act that were still valid, including the supervised release statute); <em>United States v. Huerta-Pimental, </em>445 F.3d 1220, 1224 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that \u201c[bjecause the revocation of supervised release and the subsequent imposition of additional imprisonment is, and always has been, fully discretionary, it is constitutional under <em>Booker </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We also reject Faulks\u2019 assertion that the district court erred in conducting the violation hearing before Faulks was tried in state court. As the district court noted, the supervised release violation hearing was completely separate and distinct from any state court proceeding that may arise, and the court\u2019s findings had no impact or res judicata effect thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">We further reject the contention that the Government\u2019s proof was insufficient to support the district court\u2019s decision. The Government presented the testimony of several women who explained the fraudulent scheme masterminded by Faulks and her role therein. The district court was well within bounds to reject Faulks\u2019 version of events \u2014 as well as her claim that another woman was the true perpetrator of the fraud \u2014 as incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Lastly, though Faulks does not expressly challenge the duration of her sentence, we find the sentence was reasonable. As we recently discussed in <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>\u2014 F.3d \u2014 , 2006 WL 2243586 (4th Cir.2006), we review sentences imposed upon the revocation of supervised release to determine whether the sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d Because Faulks\u2019 sentence was within the applicable statutory maximum, and neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable, we find it was not plainly unreasonable. In imposing this sentence, the district court adequately considered the policies underlying the supervised release statute, the various applicable sentencing factors, and the available sentencing options.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Faulks\u2019 supervised release and imposing a thirty-six-month sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>lieves that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\"> <em>United States v.
