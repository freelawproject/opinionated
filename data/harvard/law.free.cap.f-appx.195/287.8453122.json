He contends that the district court erred in treating his Texas burglary of a habitation conviction as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Rangel-Tovar\u2019s argument has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006); <em>United States v. Valdez-Maltos, </em>443 F.3d 910, 911 (5th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 24, 2006) (06-5473). Further, Rangel-Tovar\u2019s argument that this court did not properly apply the categorical analysis of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), is tantamount to arguing that <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>was wrongly decided. One panel of this court may not ignore the precedent set by a prior panel. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Rangel-Tovar also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of pri- or felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than as elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Rangel-Tovar\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rangel-Tovar contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rangel-Tovar properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
