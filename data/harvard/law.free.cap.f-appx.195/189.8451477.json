On appeal, Myrick argues that the district court erred by refusing to depart from the advisory guidelines range, which takes into account the 100:1 crack to powder cocaine sentencing ratio. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-23\">The district court considered Myrick\u2019s properly calculated sentencing range of 100 to 125 months and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006) and sentenced him to 100 months of imprisonment. After the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). In determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>cable guideline range as well as \u00a7 3553(a). If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Moreover, we have recently considered and rejected a <em>post-Booker </em>challenge to the 100:1 crack to powder cocaine sentencing ratio contained in the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>June 20, 2006 (No. 05-11659). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
