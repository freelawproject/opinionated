Glover appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (\u201cMiddle District Court\u201d), dismissing his petition for failing to follow a court order. We will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order, as the appeal presents no substantial issue. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">Glover filed a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (\u201cD.C. Court\u201d). The petition stated that he was being held in violation of the laws of the United States. As the petition appeared to be a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and as Glover is incarcerated in Pennsylvania, the D.C. Court transferred the petition to the Middle District Court. In an order dated October 19, 2005, the Middle District Court noted that Glover\u2019s petition \u201clack[ed] any semblance of clarity,\u201d dismissed the petition without prejudice, and afforded Glover 15 days in which to file \u201can amended petition that clearly indicates the claims Petitioner is attempting to raise.\u201d Instead of filing an amended petition, Glover filed only an \u201copposition\u201d to the order. The Middle District Court dismissed Glover\u2019s petition on January 3, 2006, and Glover timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-26\">We have reviewed the petition filed by Glover and agree with the District Court that it lacks \u201cany semblance of clarity.\u201d We are unable to discern what Glover\u2019s complaint is, and what relief he seeks. The District Court properly gave Glover an opportunity to refile a clarified, amended petition on proper forms, but he failed to do so. We have considered the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>responses Glover has filed in this Court, but we find no error in the District Court\u2019s decision. We will therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-22\">. We note that Glover filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on March 30, 2006, and filed a document titled \"Order Non Feasance,\u201d which was denied on August 24 2006. Glover has not appealed these denials.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
