The notice of appeal was received in the district court shortly after expiration of the appeal period. Because Hoggard is incarcerated, the notice is considered filed as of the date it was properly delivered to prison officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>for mailing to the court. Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). The record does not conclusively reveal when Hoggard gave the notice of appeal to prison officials for mailing. Accordingly, we remand the case for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to obtain available information from the parties that bears upon this question and to determine whether the filing was timely under Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) and <em>Houston v. Lack. </em>The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
