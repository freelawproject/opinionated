He argues that the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5), is facially unconstitutional and, in the alternative, that the statute is unconstitutional as applied because the factual basis of his plea failed to establish the interstate commerce element.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-20\">Hernandez concedes that his constitutional challenge is foreclosed by circuit precedent, and he raises it only to preserve its further review by the Supreme Court. We have indeed held that \u201cthe constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question,\u201d <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), and, additionally, that the Government need only establish that the firearm was manufactured out of state to satisfy the interstate commerce element of the offense. <em>See United States v. Guidry, </em>406 F.3d 314, 318-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 190, 163 L.Ed.2d 198 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
