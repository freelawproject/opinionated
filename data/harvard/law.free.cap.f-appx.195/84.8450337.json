We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1) (authorizing the appeal of sentences \u201cimposed in violation of law\u201d). <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327-28 (3d Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On April 22, 2005, Dean pleaded guilty to the two indicted offenses of distribution of more than five grams of cocaine base (crack cocaine). App. 6, 8-9; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). A United States Probation Officer subsequently prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR discussed both Dean\u2019s personal background, including a history of drug and alcohol abuse and the fact that his IQ indicated he \u201cfunctions in the borderline range of intelligence,\u201d <em>see </em>PSR HH 71-73, 78, as well as his extensive criminal record, comprised mostly of narcotics convictions, <em>see </em>PSR HH 24-57, and recommended a sentence pursuant to the sentencing guidelines. PSR 1196. According to the PSR, Dean was subject to a base offense level of 32 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. PSR 1113. After a three-point adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, Dean\u2019s adjusted offense level was 29. PSR 1T1\u00cd19-20. However, because he qualified as a Career Offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 due to prior drug trafficking convictions, his offense level ultimately rose to 31. PSR 1f1121-23. With a Criminal History Category of VI, the PSR calculated the guideline range to be 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. PSR 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Dean offered several arguments to the District Court in favor of a sentence shorter than that recommended in the PSR. First, he submitted a sentencing letter and the report and testimony of Dr. Allen Tepper, a psychologist, chronicling in more detail the disadvantages Dean faced in his childhood and adolescence, including a teenaged mother, no contact with his father, an early addiction to drugs and alcohol, and illiteracy resulting from learning disabilities, limited education, and borderline mentally retarded intelligence. Letter 1-3; Report 7-8; App. 12-30. Dean emphasized that his criminal history was almost entirely nonviolent and was in large part due to a longstanding drug addiction for which the criminal justice system had not provided treatment in any of his previous periods of incarceration. Letter 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">Second, Dean maintained that the \u201c100-to-one ratio\u201d for offenses involving powder cocaine versus crack cocaine produced unwarranted sentencing disparities, as repeatedly noted by the Sentencing Commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Letter 5-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">Third, Dean argued that his sentence should not be calculated using the Career Offender provisions, because (i) several years had passed between the convictions qualifying him for Career Offender treatment and the present conviction, App. 37; (n) the purity of the drugs involved here was relatively low, App. 36; and (in) Dean was, he contended, not a \u201cbig drug dealer,\u201d App. 36. Finally, Dean asserted that the fact that he was over forty years old merited leniency. App. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">At a sentencing hearing on October 3, 2005, the District Court judge sentenced Dean to 188 months\u2019 incarceration. App. 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">This Court\u2019s inquiry into the reasonableness of a criminal sentence proceeds in two parts. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329-32 (3d Cir.2006). First, we ask whether the sentencing court gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 329 (citation omitted). While it is not necessary for the sentencing court to \u201cmake findings as to each of the \u00a7 3553 factors if the record makes clear the court took the factors into account in sentencing,\u201d a mere \u201crote statement\u201d of the sentencing factors is insufficient in the event that a party has presented the court with a \u201c \u2018ground of recognized legal merit (provided it has a factual basis).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>429 F.3d 673, 679 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The second step of our inquiry is to ask whether the sentencing court, having considered the relevant factors, reasonably applied them to the circumstances of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 330. A great deal of deference to the sentencing court is appropriate here. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c \u2018[T]he question is not how we ourselves would have resolved the factors identified as relevant by section 3553(a) ... Rather, what we must decide is whether the district judge imposed the sentence he or she did for reasons that are logical and consistent with the factors set forth in section 3553(a).\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>425 F.3d 478, 481 (7th Cir.2005)). It is the party challenging the sentence that bears the burden of showing unreasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The record here reveals that the District Court did give \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. First, as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(4), it calculated the sentencing range established by the guidelines. App. 43 (stating that the guidelines range is 188 to 235 months\u2019 incarceration). The District Court then acknowledged that it was not obligated to impose a sentence within that range. App. 43-44 (\u201cI\u2019m sure based on what you have told me already that you will argue for 188 months or fewer. And I\u2019m prepared to hear whatever you want to say on that front.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The District Court proceeded to consider and then formally reject Dean\u2019s arguments concerning the sentencing disparity for powder and crack cocaine offenses and the application of the Career Offender provisions, reasoning that because of Dean\u2019s lengthy \u201crecord of repeated offenses,\u201d it was appropriate in this case to defer to the policy judgments made by Congress as reflected in the Career Offender sentencing range. App. 43. The District Court continued to tailor the sentence to this particular defendant by sentencing him to the shortest sentence within the guidelines range, because of Dean\u2019s \u201credeeming qualities\u201d and troubled background, and Dr. Tepper\u2019s testimony that Dean functions best \u201cwithin the institutional setting.\u201d App. 50-51. The District Court further noted that he would recommend that the Bureau of Prisons make educational and vocational programs available to Dean, giving him the opportunity to lead a \u201cmeaningful and productive\u201d life upon his release from prison. App. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Having concluded that the District Court did exercise its discretion here, we further find that it exercised its discretion in a reasonable manner, that is, that the sentence was imposed \u201c \u2018for reasons that are logical and consistent with the factors set forth in section 3553(a).\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>425 F.3d at 481).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">For the above reasons, we will affirm the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-14\">. The government\u2019s argument that we lack jurisdiction to review a sentence for unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>sonableness is foreclosed by our opinion in <em>Cooper.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-9\">. The \"100-to-one ratio\u201d is shorthand for the fact that one hundred times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine is required for an equivalent mandatory minimum sentence. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
