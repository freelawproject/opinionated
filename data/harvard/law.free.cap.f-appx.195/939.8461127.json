We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b963-25\">Williams was arrested for sexual abuse of a child. At the time of his arrest, after he had been read and had waived his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Williams stated, \u201cThis is being blown out of proportion. I\u2019ve touched her; she is always teasing me, but I don\u2019t want to incriminate myself.\u201d After he made the statement, the officer that arrested Williams ceased his questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-26\">At trial, the prosecution used Williams\u2019s statement to the arresting officer three times. On each occasion, Williams\u2019s attorney objected and argued that the prosecutor had commented on Williams\u2019s right to remain silent. The trial court overruled each objection and found that Williams\u2019s statement was appropriate as part of his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-27\">On direct appeal, the Florida District Court of Appeals affirmed the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>the statement. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>755 So.2d 714, 717 (Fla.Dist.CtJkpp.1999). On collateral review before the Florida courts, Williams argued that his counsel was ineffective for failure to suppress the incriminating statement before trial. The Florida courts ruled that the claim was procedurally barred because Williams had raised the issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">On federal habeas review, the district court ruled that Williams\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failure to move to suppress the incriminating statement because there was not a reasonable probability that the trial court would have granted the motion. The district court also ruled that the affirmance on direct appeal of the decision to admit the statement was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">\u201cIn examining a federal district court\u2019s denial of a [section] 2254 habeas petition, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Occhicone v. Crosby, </em>455 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal district court may not grant the petition for a writ of habeas corpus of a state prisoner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-8\">... with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-9\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-10\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). \u201cA state-court decision will ... be contrary to [the Supreme Court\u2019s] clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [those] cases.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1519, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). \u201cA state-court decision will also be contrary to [the Supreme Court\u2019s] clearly established precedent if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme Court] and nevertheless arrives at a result different from [that] precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406, 120 S.Ct. at 1519-20. \u201c[W]hen a state-court decision unreasonably applies the law of [the Supreme Court] to the facts of a prisoner\u2019s case, a federal court applying [section] 2254(d)(1) may conclude that the state-court decision falls within that provision\u2019s \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 120 S.Ct. at 1521. The factual determinations of the state court \u201cshall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b964-14\">A defendant has a right to remain silent, and the invocation of that right cannot be used against the defendant. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 611, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2241, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). To avail himself of the right to remain silent, a defendant must make an unequivocal invocation of that right. <em>Coleman v. Singletary, </em>30 F.3d 1420, 1424 (11th Cir.1994); <em>see Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 461-62, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2356, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994). The \u201cprimary protection afforded suspects subject to custodial interrogation is the <em>Miranda </em>warnings themselves.\u201d <em>Davis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>512 U.S. at 460, 114 S.Ct. at 2356. Whether an invocation of the right to silence is unequivocal is determined by an objective inquiry. <em>Medina v. Singletary, </em>59 F.3d 1095, 1101 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Williams argues that his counsel was ineffective for failure to obtain the suppression of Williams\u2019s statement that Williams \u201c[didn\u2019t] want to incriminate [himself].\u201d Williams argues that the statement was an invocation of his right to remain silent and its admission violated his right to due process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Because Williams\u2019s equivocal statement regarding his desire not to incriminate himself could be construed as part of his admission, the determination of the Florida courts that Williams\u2019s statement was not an invocation of his right to remain silent was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. Likewise, Williams\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress Williams\u2019s statement because the statement was admissible. There is no likelihood that a motion to suppress the statement would have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">The denial of Williams\u2019s petition for habeas corpus is</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
