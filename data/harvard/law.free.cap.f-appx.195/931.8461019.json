On appeal, Gutierrez argues that he is entitled to a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) because he was a minor participant in the conspiracy and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>was less culpable than the average participant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">The parties are familiar with the background facts, and we do not recount them here. \u201cThis Court has long and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant if he is less culpable than most other participants, but his role cannot be described as minimal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of [the] role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor ... participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The proponent of the reduction bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. We have held, however, that the allegations of defense counsel at sentencing \u201care an insufficient basis upon which to grant a downward departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Kapelushnik, </em>306 F.3d 1090, 1095 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">After carefully reviewing the record, the sentencing transcript, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude Gutierrez has failed to carry his burden on this issue. Gutierrez\u2019s conduct involved the cultivation and care of well over 10,000 marijuana plants. Other than the allegations made by his counsel at sentencing, he failed to proffer any evidence indicating that his responsibilities at the grow houses were less vital to the enterprise than those of his eo-conspirators, or that he was not acting in equal relationship to the average co-conspirator at the grow houses. We accordingly hold the district court did not clearly err in finding Gutierrez failed to establish he played a minor role in the offense, and we affirm his 80-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
