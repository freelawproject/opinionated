No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">Ramirez-Garcia argues that the district court erred in denying him a minor role reduction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). He asserts that he was less culpable than the other persons found on the drug smuggling boat (which was carrying 4,000 kilograms of cocaine) because he only was a \u201csimple mariner\u201d who had no ownership interest in the smuggled drugs and did not participate in decision-making about the smuggling operation. Ramirez-Garcia also contends that the small compensation he received for his participation \u2014 $100 and the opportunity to receive a bonus upon delivery of the smuggled drugs \u2014 indicates that he played a minor role in the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determinations about a defendant\u2019s role in an offense. <em>United, States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe defendant has the burden of establishing his role by a preponderance of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), \u201c[a] defendant warrants a two-level reduction for playing a minor role in an offense if he is less culpable than most other participants, although his role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">In <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930 (11th Cir.1999), we set out two elements that inform the sentencing court\u2019s determination about a defendant\u2019s role in an offense: (1) the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable; and (2) the defendant\u2019s role as compared to that of other participants in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 940. About the first element, <em>De Varon </em>explains that \u201c[o]nly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. About the second element, <em>De Varon </em>counsels that this relative culpability inquiry includes \u201conly those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. The conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first element is the more important and, in many cases, may end the inquiry. <em>See id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The district court committed no clear error in determining that Ramirez-Garcia\u2019s role in the offense was more than minor. About the first element, Ramirez-Garcia\u2019s sentence was based only on the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing: the 4,000 kilograms of cocaine seized from the boat on which he was found. And in the drug courier context, a large amount of drugs is an important factor in determining the availability of a minor role adjustment. <em>Id. </em>at 943 (\u201c[T]he amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct. ... [W]e do not foreclose the possibility that amount of drugs may be dispositive .... \u201d). About the second element, Ramirez-Garcia was one of only six crew members on the drug smuggling boat, which was carrying over four tons of cocaine. Ramirez-Garcia has failed to show that he was \u201cless culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944 (emphasis in original). We see no clear error in the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a minor role reduction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Ramirez-Garcia next argues that his 97-month sentence was unreasonable under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He asserts that, in determining his sentence, the district court should have considered the small role he played in the offense and his status as a removable alien. Ramirez-Garcia contends that the district court should have reduced his sentence because his immigration status restricted the sentencing options available to the district court. Ramirez-Garcia was sentenced after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker; </em>so we review his sentence for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). A sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is not per se reasonable, <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005); but \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. Reasonableness review is \u201cdeferential.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">We conclude that Ramirez-Garcia\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court sentenced him to the lowest point of his Guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In sentencing Ramirez-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Garcia, the district court noted the section 3553(a) factors, commenting in particular on the destructive effect of drug smuggling, Ramirez-Garcia\u2019s family situation, and his need for educational training. Ramirez-Garcia has failed to meet his burden of showing his sentence was unreasonable in the light of the record and the section 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-5\">. The district court determined that Ramirez-Garcia's Guideline imprisonment range was 135 to 168 months; but, after granting the government\u2019s motion to reduce Ramirez-Garcia\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for substantial assistance, the court determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>that his revised Guideline imprisonment range was 97 to 121 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
