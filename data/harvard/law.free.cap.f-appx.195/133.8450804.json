We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">A jury convicted Charles of possessing more than 50 grams of cocaine base with the intent to distribute, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2006) (Count One), and possessing firearms after having been convicted of a felony, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (West 2000) (Count Three). At sentencing, the district court determined that Charles\u2019 statutory range of imprisonment for Count One was 20 years to life. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Based on Charles\u2019 prior Florida convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer, armed burglary with a deadly weapon, and escaping and resisting an officer with violence, the court concluded that the statutory range for Count Three was 15 years to life. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (West Supp.2006). Grouping the two offenses together and determining that Charles qualified as a career offender, <em>see United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2004), the district court calculated a resulting offense level of 37, which, when combined with a criminal history category of VI, yielded an advisory guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment. After considering this range and the other factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), the district court concluded that the advisory guideline range \u201cprovide[d] an appropriate window in which the Court should enter sentence.\u201d J.A. 339. The district court sentenced Charles to concurrent terms of 360 months imprisonment on Counts One and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">Charles first argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by finding facts about his prior convictions and using those facts to sentence him as a career criminal. We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">Since Charles failed to raise this objection at sentencing, our review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). To establish plain error, Charles must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Even if Charles makes this three-part showing, correction of the error remains within our discretion, which we \u201cshould not exercise ... unless the error \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)) (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Because <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the sentencing guidelines \u201ceffectively advisory,\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, the use of the guidelines no longer \u201cimplicate[s] the Sixth Amendment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738. Stated another way, with the guidelines no longer having the force of law, district courts may find facts determining the proper sentence to impose within the statutory range set by Congress without violating a defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial. <em>See id. </em>at 259, 125 S.Ct. 738. Here, the finding by the jury that Charles possessed more than 50 grams of cocaine base with the intent to distribute authorized a sentence of up to life imprisonment for Count One. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Thus, the district court did not infringe upon Charles\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights by utilizing its own factual findings to select a sentence within the appropriate statutory range for that count. And, even assuming that the district court utilized judicially found facts to impose a sentence beyond the maximum statutorily authorized by the jury verdict with regard to Count Three, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (West 2000) (providing that statutory maximum for \u00a7 922(g) violation is 10 years), that error did not affect Charles\u2019 substantial rights in light of the fact that his Count Three sentence was ordered to run concurrently with the Count One sentence of the same duration. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>326 F.3d 593, 599-600 (4th Cir.2003) (holding that sentence exceeding statutory maximum by at least 20 years did not affect substantial rights because defendant received equal or longer concurrent sentences on other counts).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Charles next contends that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that as an element of the Count Three offense, the Government was required to prove that his civil rights had not been restored following his prior felony convictions. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Charles argues that because all of his prior convictions were Florida convictions and he had completed his terms of imprisonment, he was eligible for restoration of his civil rights. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 940.05 (2005).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Critically, however, \u00a7 940.05 provides for the discretionary, rather than automatic, restoration of a defendant\u2019s civil rights. <em>See United States v. Owens, </em>15 F.3d 995, 997 (11th Cir.1994) (emphasizing that \u201cFlorida courts uniformly have held that the restoration of civil rights to a prisoner upon release from state custody is neither automatic nor <em>pro forma, </em>but is solely within the province of the governor\u2019s discretionary function\u201d). We have held, under similar circumstances, that the fact that the defendant\u2019s civil rights have been restored is an affirmative defense, and the opposite fact is not an element of a \u00a7 922 offense. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>262 F.3d 415, 422-23 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">In <em>Parker, </em>a defendant was charged with knowingly providing ammunition to a convicted felon, see 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(d)(1) (West 2000). For purposes of the decision, we assumed that a Maryland court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>had sentenced the felon had discretionary authority to retroactively suspend entry of his three-year sentence and place him on probation, thereby ending his status as a felon for firearm possession purposes. <em>See Parker, </em>262 F.3d at 421. Importantly, though, we noted that in Maryland there is no period after which restoration of a convicted felon\u2019s civil rights is automatic. <em>See id. </em>at 423. Relying on \u201c[t]he general principle ... that a condition once shown to exist is presumed to continue,\u201d we concluded that the felon\u2019s loss of the right to possess ammunition was properly presumed to have continued absent evidence to the contrary and thus that the government did not have to specifically prove that the felon\u2019s status had not changed when the defendant provided him with the ammunition. <em>Id. </em>We added that the records for the felon\u2019s court of conviction were equally available to the government and the defendant and that we were confident that had the felon\u2019s status changed prior to the transfer of the ammunition, \u201cit would have been brought to our attention.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The same principle requires affirmance here. While Charles\u2019 completion of his terms of imprisonment created the possibility that his right to possess a firearm would be restored, the presumption that his condition would continue relieves the Government of having to prove specifically that his rights were not restored prior to his firearm possession. Had Charles\u2019 right been restored prior to that time, he could have asserted that fact as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Charles\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\"> The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">Any person who has been convicted of a felony may be entitled to the restoration of all the rights of citizenship enjoyed by him or her prior to conviction if the person has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-13\">(1) Received a full pardon from the board of pardons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-14\">(2) Served the maximum term of the sentence imposed upon him or her; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-15\">(3) Been granted his or her final release by the Parole Commission.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
