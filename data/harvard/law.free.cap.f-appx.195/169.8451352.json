Walker brings this appeal asserting that the district court erred by failing to find cause and prejudice sufficient to overcome the procedural default of his claim under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), as it relates to the evidence withheld by the Commonwealth regarding prosecution witness Bianca Taylor (Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">We agree with Walker and, for the reasons set forth below, hold that Walker has established the cause and prejudice necessary to overcome the procedural default of his <em>Brady </em>claim. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for an evidentiary hearing on the merits of his Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Catherine Taylor and her children, Bianca, Monique, and Sidney, lived in University Terrace Apartments with Stanley Beale, the children\u2019s father. (J.A. at 35.) On the evening of November 22, 1996, Stanley Beale was in the kitchen of the Beale apartment when Catherine Taylor, who was in the bedroom with the three children, heard a \u201cboom like noise\u201d in the living room. (J.A. at 36.) According to the testimony at trial, Catherine, Bianca, and Monique left the bedroom and entered the living room. (J.A. at 37.) Catherine and Bianca testified at trial that they saw a man lack in the front door and enter the apartment with a gun, (J.A. at 26, 37.), and that Beale, who was standing in the doorway of the kitchen, answered the intruder by stating, \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d (J.A. at 25, 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">On the night of the incident, Catherine provided police with a detailed description of the height, build, and clothing of the intruder. (J.A. at 489, 844.) Nevertheless, she was unable to identify Walker as the intruder in a photo lineup. (J.A. at 40.) Bianca, on the other hand, attested at trial that she saw Walker shoot her father and recognized him as someone she knew named \u201cTodd.\u201d (J.A. at 27-29.) Bianca identified Walker during a photo lineup and again at trial as \u201cTodd.\u201d (J.A. at 29-30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">Tameria Patterson, a fourteen-year-old girl at the time of the trial, was visiting the home of Karen Randolph in University Terrace Apartments (Randolph apartment) on the night of the murder. (J.A. at 50-51.) At trial, Tameria stated that she saw a man she knew as \u201cTodd\u201d enter the Randolph apartment and say \u201cI shot him.\u201d (J.A. at 52.) During a photo lineup and later at trial, Tameria identified Walker as the person who entered the Randolph apartment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">On August 31, 1998, through September 1,1998, Walker was tried and convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond on charges of capital murder for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the deaths of Stanley Beale and Clarence Threat, on two counts of burglary, and on four counts of using a firearm in the commission of a murder and burglary. (J.A. at 182-84.) Walker received a sentence of life imprisonment for each of the two burglary convictions and a total of eighteen years imprisonment for the firearm convictions. (J.A. at 333C.) In a separate sentencing proceeding, the jury sentenced Walker to death for his capital murder convictions. (J.A. at 333C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">On June 11, 1999, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed Walker\u2019s conviction and death sentence. <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 54, 515 S.E.2d 565, 577 (1999). The United States Supreme Court subsequently denied Walker\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Walker v. Virginia, </em>528 U.S. 1125, 120 S.Ct. 955, 145 L.Ed.2d 829 (2000) .</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The Supreme Court of Virginia dismissed Walker\u2019s habeas corpus petition on March 23, 2001. <em>Walker v. True, </em>No. 615, slip op. at 12 (Va. Mar. 23, 2001); (J.A. at 359.) The state trial court then set Walker\u2019s execution date for August 7, 2001. The federal district court stayed Walker\u2019s execution on July 31, 2001, and granted his motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">On February 1, 2002, Walker filed his federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, along with a discovery motion seeking the police records related to the Beale murder. (J.A. at 388.) On July 26, 2002, the district court dismissed Walker\u2019s petition and denied all outstanding motions. <em>Walker v. True, </em>No. 01-1196-A, slip op. at 55 (E.D.Va. July 26, 2002); (J.A. at 942.) The district court denied Walker\u2019s motion for reconsideration on September 4, 2002, <em>Walker v. True, </em>No. 01-1196-A, slip op. at 1 (E.D.Va. Sept. 4, 2002), and Walker noted his appeal on October 4, 2002. (J.A. at 1001.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">In an unpublished opinion dated May 6, 2003, this court granted Walker\u2019s Certificate of Appealability on, <em>inter alia, </em>his claim that the Commonwealth failed to disclose certain evidence in violation of <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194. <em>Walker v. True, </em>67 Fed.Appx. 758, 762 (4th Cir.2003). The panel then held that Walker failed to establish sufficient cause to undermine the state court\u2019s finding that he knew of the factual basis underlying his Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim at the time of trial and on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Walker subsequently petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari on several bases, including an argument that this court erroneously decided his <em>Brady </em>claim. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated, and remanded for reconsideration of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but not for reconsideration of the <em>Brady </em>claim. <em>Walker v. True, </em>540 U.S. 1013, 124 S.Ct. 567, 157 L.Ed.2d 426 (2003). The district court and this court reconsidered the ineffective assistance claim and again dismissed it. <em>Walker v. True, </em>401 F.3d 574 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Walker once more petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari, rearguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that this court erred in deciding his <em>Brady </em>claim in 2003. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case to this court for reconsideration of the <em>Brady </em>claim in light of the Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Banks v. Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 124 S.Ct. 1256, 157 L.Ed.2d 1166 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">As a general rule, we are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIP\">precluded from reviewing the merits of a claim that was procedurally defaulted under an \u201cindependent and adequate\u201d state procedural rule, \u201cunless the [peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tioner] can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><em>Fisher v. Lee, </em>215 F.3d 438, 455 (4th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). Viewing the facts of the case at bar through the lens of <em>Banks, </em>we will now consider whether Walker has shown the requisite cause and prejudice to overcome the procedural default of his <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">We first consider the cause factor as illustrated by the facts in <em>Banks. </em>In <em>Banks, </em>the petitioner was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. 540 U.S. at 674, 124 S.Ct. 1256. Prior to trial, the State advised Banks\u2019 attorney that it would provide all discovery to which Banks was entitled. <em>Id. </em>Despite this assertion, however, the State withheld evidence that would have allowed Banks to discredit two essential prosecution witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 675, 124 S.Ct. 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Through the course of discovery and an evidentiary hearing authorized by the district court in Banks\u2019 federal habeas proceeding, the evidence revealed that one of the State\u2019s key witnesses was a paid police informant. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, a pretrial transcript revealed that the \u201cother witness\u2019 trial testimony had been intensively coached by prosecutors and law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The district court granted Banks\u2019 petition with respect to his death sentence, but the court of appeals reversed, finding that Banks had documented his claims of prosecutorial misconduct too late and in the wrong forum. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court reversed the lower court\u2019s decision and held that Banks had demonstrated the requisite cause for his failure to raise a <em>Brady </em>claim in state proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The court reached its conclusion by applying the tripartite test announced in <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">(a) prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence; (b) petitioner reasonably relied on the prosecution\u2019s open file policy as fulfilling the prosecution\u2019s duty to disclose such evidence; and (c) the [State] confirmed petitioner\u2019s reliance on the open file policy during state habeas proceedings that petitioner had already received everything known to the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-12\"><em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 692-93, 124 S.Ct. 1256. We now apply the <em>Strickler </em>factors to the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">Walker argues that the first <em>Strickler </em>factor, that the prosecution failed to disclose <em>Brady </em>material, is met in the instant case. We agree. As detailed below, the Commonwealth knew of, but failed to disclose, police reports that contain evidence which challenges the credibility of Bianca Taylor\u2019s alleged eyewitness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">Specifically, in a signed affidavit, Walker\u2019s habeas counsel attested that several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests were sent to the Richmond Police Department, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Commonwealth Attorney, and the Virginia Department of Corrections seeking to obtain any <em>Brady </em>material in the Stanley Beale and Clarence Threat files. (J.A. at 491.) Two days before Walker\u2019s state habeas petition was due, Walker\u2019s counsel received the Beale police reports in response to his requests. (J.A. at 494.) Walker relies on the following of those reports in support of his Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-15\">1. In a Supplementary Offense Report dated November 22, 1996, Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>David Ernst summarized his initial investigation of the murder of Stanley Beale and stated that Bianca Taylor \u201ccould provide no further information\u201d other than describing shots being fired. (J.A. at 537.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">2. In the handwritten notes of Detective Curtis Mullins, dated November 22, 1996, Mullins states that \u201c13 yr. old heard voice and stated that it sounded like Todd and she was positive that it was Todd[ ].\u201d (J.A. at 485, 859.) This note was based on a brief summary of information verbally provided to Mullins by Hickman and Ernst from the night of the murder. (J.A. at 856-57.) Mullins did not personally talk to Bianca until February 1,1997. (J.A. at 857.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">3. On December 16, 1996, Detective Mullins prepared another Supplementary Offense Report. According to the report, \u201c[Bianca] stated that she recognized the voice of the subject as a BM by the name of Todd or Ty.\u201d (J.A. at 489, 866.) This report was based on other officers\u2019 reports. (J.A. at 857.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">4. In Detective James Hickman Sr.\u2019s affidavit, he states that \u201cBianca did not report witnessing the actual shooting of Stanley Beale.\u201d (J.A. at 543A.) Hickman subsequently retracted this affidavit and submitted a second affidavit stating that Bianca \u201cdescribefd] her father\u2019s murderer to me.\u201d (J.A. at 841.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">On June 15, 2000, Ernst signed an affidavit stating that Bianca \u201c \u2018could provide no other information\u2019 ... because of her emotional state.\u201d (J.A. 835.) We therefore will not consider Officer Ernst\u2019s supplemental offense report in making our decision today. The other documents listed above, however, provide compelling evidence suggesting that Bianca never saw the intruder the night of the murder and that she based her identification of Walker solely on the intruder\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">We now turn to consideration of the above-referenced police reports. As noted above, Detective Mullins wrote two reports based on summaries provided by officers who interviewed Bianca the night of the murder. In the first report written on November 22,1996, he states that a \u201c13 yr. old heard voice and stated that it sounded like Todd and she was positive that it was Todd[ ].\u201d (J.A. at 485, 859.) In December of 1996, Detective Mullins wrote in a supplemental police report, \u201c[Bianca] stated that she recognized the voice of the subject as a BM by the name of Todd or Ty.\u201d (J.A. at 489, 866.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Next, an affidavit submitted by Detective Hickman stated that Bianca recognized the murderer\u2019s voice but was unable visually to identify him. (J.A. at 543A.) Hickman subsequently retracted this affidavit and submitted a second affidavit stating that Bianca \u201cdescribe[d] her father\u2019s murderer to me,\u201d (J.A. at 841.) The handwritten notes accompanying his affidavit contain a physical description of the person Bianca knew as \u201cTodd.\u201d (J.A. at 847.) Detective Hickman\u2019s handwritten notes detailing Bianca\u2019s description, however, fail to indicate that she saw \u201cTodd\u201d on the night of the murder. Furthermore, Bianca\u2019s description, unlike Catherine Taylor\u2019s portrayal of the intruder, fails to mention what the intruder was wearing. (J.A. at 844.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">The Commonwealth argues that the autopsy and pre-sentence reports, both of which were provided to Walker, contain the same information found in the withheld police reports. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">The autopsy report, which was received by Walker prior to trial, stated that unnamed \u201cwitnesses inside the home heard the shots but <em>did not witness the shoot</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>ing. </em>\u201d (Supp. J.A. at 7.) (emphasis added). Moreover, the pre-sentence report stated that \u201c[Catherine Taylor] ... and the daughter, Bianca <em>fled into the bathroom. </em>... <em>It was at that time, she heard three shots fired. </em>\u201d (Pet\u2019r Supp.App. 249-50.) (emphasis added). The pre-sentence report also states that Bianca advised Detective Hickman that \u201cshe recognized the voice of the suspect as a black male by the name of \u2018Todd or Ty.\u2019 \u201d (Pet\u2019r Supp.App. 250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The second <em>Strickler </em>factor sets forth a requirement that it was reasonable for the petitioner to rely on the government\u2019s assertion that it fulfilled its duty to disclose all <em>Brady </em>material. <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936. We find that Walker has met this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Simply put, the availability of the autopsy and pre-sentence reports does not satisfy the prosecutor\u2019s duty to disclose the other <em>Brady </em>material to Walker. The withheld reports provide persuasive evidence that Bianca did not see the shooter the night of the murder, whereas the files that were available earlier suggest only that Bianca did not witness the shooting. As such, the withheld documents would have provided substantial evidence impeaching Bianca\u2019s trial testimony that she saw the person who shot her father. (J.A. at 27.) Thus, we find the first <em>Strickler </em>factor met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">We begin our discussion of this factor by noting that Walker\u2019s reliance argument is much stronger than that found in both <em>Strickler </em>and <em>Banks </em>in a notable respect: Walker filed a formal, explicit request for the disclosure of all <em>Brady </em>material. (Supp. J.A. at 32.) In contrast, Banks relied on the prosecutor\u2019s assurances that the prosecutor would, \u201cwithout necessity of motions provide you with all discovery to which you are entitled.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 677, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Likewise, Strickler relied on the prosecution\u2019s \u201copen file policy\u201d and the State assured him that a formal <em>Brady </em>motion was unnecessary. <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 287, 119 S.Ct. 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Although the prosecutor did not respond in writing to Walker\u2019s Motion for Discovery and Inspection, she confirmed in open court that the Commonwealth had \u201cprovided the discovery that we are required to disclose, pursuant to the Rules of the Supreme Court and the statutory provisions that may be provided in the Virginia Code.\u201d (J.A. at 10.) Subsequently, when Walker\u2019s counsel continued to press the issue of disclosure during the motions hearing, the judge reassured him that the Commonwealth is constitutionally required to disclose any <em>Brady </em>material. (J.A. at 11.) Therefore, we find that Walker was reasonable not only in relying on the presumption that the Commonwealth would faithfully perform its duty to disclose, but also in relying on the explicit representation that the prosecution had disclosed all <em>Brady </em>material. <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 698, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (\u201cIt was not incumbent on Banks to prove these representations false[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The contention that documents in Walker\u2019s possession might suggest that Bianca provided contradicting statements at trial does not diminish the reasonableness of Walker\u2019s reliance on the Commonwealth\u2019s representation that it had complied fully with <em>Brady. </em>In <em>Strickler, </em>the Supreme Court held that, even assuming the petitioner knew of the impeaching documents available in the prosecutor\u2019s file, it was reasonable for the petitioner to accept the State\u2019s \u201copen file policy\u201d and believe no additional impeaching evidence existed. 527 U.S. at 285, 119 S.Ct. 1936. We, too, find it was not unreasonable for Walker to assume no additional <em>Brady </em>material existed after the prosecutor told him that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>only such evidence related to the Beale murder was the presence of drugs in the victim\u2019s system. (J.A. at 481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The Commonwealth also argues that it was unreasonable for Walker to rely on the prosecution\u2019s affirmative response since Walker could have reasonably discovered all the information later obtained by his habeas counsel\u2019s FOIA requests. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The actual response to Walker\u2019s habeas counsel\u2019s requests is indicative of the \u201chunt\u201d Walker embarked upon to obtain <em>Brady </em>material. The Attorney General denied outright Walker\u2019s request for the Beale and Threat files. (J.A. at 492.) The police, however, turned over the Beale file. (J.A. at 491.) Nevertheless, when Walker\u2019s habeas counsel followed up on the Threat file, he was informed that releasing the Beale file had been an error and the Attorney General advised the police not to disclose the Threat file. (J.A. at 493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument ignores the well-settled law that the prosecutor had a duty to disclose <em>Brady </em>material to Walker. <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936. It is also violative of due process, as it condones the prosecutor\u2019s ability to conceal documents and requires a defendant to search for <em>Brady </em>material. <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 696, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (\u201cA rule thus declaring prosecutor may hide, defendant must seek, is not tenable in a system constitutionally bound to accord defendants due process.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">In short, the cause analysis focuses on prosecutorial misconduct, not on the defendant\u2019s diligence. Furthermore, <em>Strickler </em>instructs us that the existence of cause ordinarily turns on factors external to the defense which, as in the instant case, impeded defense counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule. <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 283 n. 24, 119 S.Ct. 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The third and final <em>Strickler </em>factor requires that the prosecution confirm the petitioner\u2019s reliance on the State\u2019s disclosure. <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936. We find that Walker has satisfied this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">As a preliminary matter, it bears noting that in <em>Strickler </em>and <em>Banks, </em>the State confirmed the defendant\u2019s reliance during state habeas proceedings. <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 278, 119 S.Ct. 1936; <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 692-93, 124 S.Ct. 1256. Walker, however, received the <em>Brady </em>material before his state habeas proceeding. Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he standard for cause should not vary depending on the timing of a procedural default.\u201d <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 284, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">As already observed, prior to trial, the Commonwealth conveyed to Walker\u2019s counsel that the only <em>Brady </em>material related to the Beale murder was the fact that the victim had drugs in his system. (J.A. at 481.) The Commonwealth later confirmed at a pretrial motions hearing that it had disclosed all <em>Brady </em>materials. (J.A. at 10.) This being the case, it is unnecessary for Walker to establish that the Commonwealth confirmed his reliance again during trial or on appeal. Stated differently, it was reasonable for Walker to assume that the prosecution would comply with a formal <em>Brady </em>motion without the need of constant confirmation. Therefore, we find that Walker has established cause such that he may be entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Although we have found that Walker has established cause, to receive relief in federal court, he must also demonstrate that actual prejudice resulted from his failure to develop facts in state court proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 690-91, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (\u201cBanks would be entitled to an evidentiary hearing in federal court if he could show cause for his failure to develop the facts in state-court proceedings and actual prejudice resulting from that failure.\u201d) (internal quotation marks, alterations and citation omitted). To establish prejudice sufficient to overcome procedural default, the withheld evidence must be material. <em>Id. </em>at 698, 124 S.Ct. 1256; <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 282, 119 S.Ct. 1936. Materiality is satisfied when \u201cfavorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 698, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (quoting <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995)). Under this standard, Walker must demonstrate that there is a \u201creasonable probability of a different result.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In <em>Banks, </em>the Supreme Court found prejudice because the lack of physical or forensic evidence made the witness\u2019 testimony crucial to the prosecution. <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 701, 124 S.Ct. 1256. According to the Court, this was evident by the prosecution\u2019s repeated references to the withheld evidence during the penalty phase to underscore Banks\u2019 propensity to commit violent crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 700, 124 S.Ct. 1256. Although Banks\u2019 trial counsel provided two witnesses to impeach the police informant, the defense witnesses were themselves impeached, a fact the prosecution stressed during its summation. <em>Id. </em>at 702, 124 S.Ct. 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In <em>Strickler, </em>however, the Court did not find the requisite prejudice to overcome default. 527 U.S. at 296, 119 S.Ct. 1936. The testimony of the witness whose impeachment was at issue, \u201cdid not relate to [the petitioner\u2019s] eligibility for the death sentence and was not relied upon by the prosecution at all during its closing argument at the penalty phase.\u201d 527 U.S. at 295, 119 S.Ct. 1936. Furthermore, the Court noted indications that Strickler would have been sentenced to death even if the witness\u2019 testimony had been completely excluded. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 119 S.Ct. 1936. For example, two other eyewitnesses placed petitioner at the mall where the victim was abducted and \u201cconsiderable forensic and other physical evidence linkfed] petitioner to the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293-94, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Here, similar to <em>Banks, </em>and unlike <em>Strickler, </em>the lack of forensic or other eyewitness evidence made Bianca\u2019s testimony crucial to the prosecution and, thus, not cumulative. <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 701, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (stating that the testimony of the police informant, whose informant status was withheld, was \u201ccritical\u201d); <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 292, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (finding that the evidence provided compelling support for the conclusion that the petitioner would have been convicted of capital murder notwithstanding the testimony of witness whose impeachment was in question.) The prosecutor relied heavily on Bianca\u2019s testimony as she made repeated references to Bianca\u2019s identification of Walker as the shooter. Further, the prosecution emphasized to the jury that the case \u201ccomes down to identification and credibility.\u201d (J.A. at 164-65.) The withheld documents could have been used by Walker, therefore, to undermine both Bianca\u2019s ability to properly identify Walker as the shooter and her overall credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Bianca\u2019s testimony was the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the case against Walker on the Beale murder because she was the sole \u201ceyewitness.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 701, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (stating that the police informant\u2019s testimony was the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the prosecution\u2019s penalty-phase case). No one else in the apartment with Bianca was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>able to identify Walker. Moreover, unlike <em>Strickler, </em>the only physical evidence here that linked Walker to the crime was an unfired bullet. (J.A. at 86-92, 106-08, 149-50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Given the dearth of physical evidence and the centrality of Bianca\u2019s testimony, the withheld evidence \u201ccould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555 (footnote omitted). Furthermore, had Walker not been convicted of the murder of Beale, the Threat murder alone would not have been a sufficient basis for a capital murder conviction. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-31(8) (\u201cThe following offenses shall constitute capital murder ... The willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of more that one person within a three-year period.\u201d); <em>see also Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 295, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (finding that the witness at issue \u201cdid not relate to the [the petitioner\u2019s] eligibility for the death sentence.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Without Bianca\u2019s testimony, the only evidence linking Walker to the Beale murder is the uncorroborated testimony of Tameria Patterson that she saw Walker enter the Randolph apartment and say \u201cI shot him.\u201d (J.A. at 52.) This lack of evidence underscores the centrality of Bianca\u2019s testimony. Consequently, we find that Walker has established that actual, significant prejudice resulted from his inability to develop the factual basis of his Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Walker has established sufficient cause and prejudice to overcome the procedural default of his Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim and that an evidentiary hearing on the merits of his Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim is appropriate. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is vacated and this case is remanded for an evidentiary hearing on Walker\u2019s Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b201-11\">GREGORY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYy\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">I concur in the opinion of the Court. I write separately, however, to make two observations. First, I wish to emphasize that <em>Banks v. Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 124 S.Ct. 1256, 157 L.Ed.2d 1166 (2004), enhanced the cause inquiry by making the prosecution\u2019s conduct the central focus. Second, in my view, Walker has satisfied the elements of a <em>Brady </em>claim such that we can remand for a new trial without need of an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">In remanding this ease for reconsideration, the Supreme Court instructed us to consider this case anew in light of <em>Banks. </em>We last considered the question of whether Walker has shown cause and prejudice sufficient to excuse the procedural default of his Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim in 2003. <em>See Walker v. True, </em>67 Fed.Appx. 758 (4th Cir.2003). In that now vacated and withdrawn opinion, we considered only whether Walker had knowledge of the facts underlying his Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim. There, we stated that \u201c[i]f Walker ... was aware or should have been aware that documents had been suppressed when he appealed his conviction, suppression of the documents would not constitute cause for failure to bring a <em>Brady </em>claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 767. However, as made clear in <em>Banks, </em>that is not the end of the cause inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\"><em>Banks </em>revives Walker\u2019s Bianca <em>Brady </em>claim by clarifying that where the cause inquiry is considered, the chief concern is the prosecution\u2019s \u2014 not the defendant\u2019s\u2014 conduct. In <em>Banks, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the State of Texas\u2019s view that the question of cause \u201crevolves around\u201d the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>See Banks, </em>540 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>at 695, 124 S.Ct. 1256. The Court instead stated that \u201cthe cause inquiry ... turns on events or circumstances external to the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696,124 S.Ct. 1256 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see <em>also id. </em>at 675-76, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (\u201cWhen police or prosecutors conceal significant exculpatory or impeaching material in the State\u2019s possession, it is ordinarily incumbent on the State to set the record straight.\u201d). Specifically, in <em>Banks, </em>the State contended that \u201cthe prosecution can lie and conceal and the prisoner still has the burden to ... discover the evidence, so long as the potential existence of a prosecutorial misconduct claim might have been detected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Court did not agree, stating that \u201c[a] rule thus declaring \u2018prosecutor may hide, defendant must seek,\u2019 is not tenable in a system constitutionally bound to accord defendants due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court\u2019s decisions therefore \u201clend no support to the notion that defendants must scavenge for hints of undisclosed <em>Brady </em>material when the prosecution represents that all such material has been disclosed .... [DJefense counsel has no \u2018procedural obligation to assert constitutional error on the basis of mere suspicion that some prosecutorial misstep may have occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695-96, 124 S.Ct. 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Further, in making the prosecution\u2019s conduct the central focus of the cause inquiry, the Court acknowledged the \u201cspecial role played by the American prosecutor in the search for truth in criminal trials.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 696, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (citation omitted). In light of a prosecutor\u2019s truth-finding obligations, the Court concluded that Banks was entitled to rely on the prosecution\u2019s representations. <em>See id. </em>at 698, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (\u201cBanks\u2019s prosecutors represented at trial and in state postconviction proceedings that the State had held nothing back. Moreover, in state postconviction court, the State\u2019s pleading denied that Farr was an informant. It was not incumbent on Banks to prove these representations false; rather, Banks was entitled to treat the prosecutors\u2019 submissions as truthful.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). Likewise, the Court concluded that \u201cit was ... appropriate for Banks to assume that his prosecutors would not stoop to improper litigation conduct to advance prospects for gaining a conviction\u201d by standing silent as a key prosecution witness repeatedly testified untruthfully. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 124 S.Ct. 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The instant case presents facts akin to those in <em>Banks. </em>As in <em>Banks, </em>the prosecution told the defendant <em>and the court </em>that it had disclosed all <em>Brady </em>material although it had in fact withheld the police reports at issue. At trial, the prosecution allowed Bianca to testify in a seemingly untruthful fashion, all the while emphasizing the importance and <em>credibility </em>of her testimony. <em>Cf. Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 675, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (\u201cInstead of correcting the informant\u2019s false statements, the prosecutor told the jury that the witness \u2018ha[d] been open and honest with you in every way,\u2019 and that his testimony was of the \u2018utmost significance\u2019.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). We did not consider these facts the last time we addressed Walker\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In light of <em>Banks, </em>these egregious, affirmative acts of prosecutorial misconduct cannot be ignored simply because Walker overlooked a hint of prosecutorial misconduct. Unlike the police reports themselves, which strongly suggest that Bianca did not see the intruder who shot her father, the PSR only indicates that on <em>one </em>occasion Bianca referred to having recognized Walker\u2019s voice. The PSR does not reveal that on the night of the murder, Bianca never indicated having seen the intruder or that her statement about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>recognizing the intruder\u2019s voice was corroborated on multiple occasions. Therefore, when placed in the context of the prosecution\u2019s representations that it had satisfied its obligations under Brady, its standing by as Bianca seemingly perjured herself, and its repeated assertions that Bianca was a trustworthy witness, the PSR\u2019s single mention of Bianca\u2019s voice identification of Walker provides no more than an inkling of prosecutorial misconduct. Simply put, the solitary reference to Bianca\u2019s hearing of the intruder\u2019s voice could have been disregarded by a defendant inclined to believe \u201cthat his prosecutors would not stoop to improper litigation conduct to advance prospects for gaining a conviction.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 694, 124 S.Ct. 1256. Accordingly, I agree that Walker has shown cause for his procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Finally, I believe that Walker\u2019s showing of cause and prejudice is not merely sufficient to overcome the procedural default, but also to satisfy the second and third elements of a <em>Brady </em>claim. As observed in <em>Banks, </em>a defendant who shows cause and prejudice to excuse a procedural default simultaneously satisfies the second and third elements of a <em>Brady </em>claim\u2014 evidence suppressed by the state and prejudice, respectively. <em>See Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 691, 124 S.Ct. 1256. Without question, the first <em>Brady </em>element \u2014 the suppressed evidence is favorable to the accused \u2014 is satisfied here. <em>See Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (setting forth the elements of a <em>Brady </em>claim). Indeed, the undisclosed reports contain powerful impeachment material, which calls into question the veracity of Bianca\u2019s testimony. Thus, I believe that the conclusion that a <em>Brady </em>violation occurred flows from the finding of cause and prejudice. Accordingly, in lieu of remanding for an evidentiary hearing, I believe we could hold that Walker\u2019s due process rights were violated, grant the writ, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b203-8\">WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AQC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">With all due respect to the majority, I dissent. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Walker has shown cause sufficient to excuse his failure to raise in state<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> court his claim under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In my view, the Presentence Report (PSR) was plainly sufficient to make Walker aware of the factual basis of his <em>Brady </em>claim. I would therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Walker\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition without evaluating whether Walker has shown prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">On or around the night of Beale\u2019s murder, officers, including Officer Mullins and Detective Hickman, interviewed Beale\u2019s daughter Bianca. According to the officers\u2019 notes, reports, and affidavits (collectively \u201creports\u201d), Bianca stated that she recognized her father\u2019s murderer by his voice. (J.A. at 485) (\u201c[Bianca] heard a voice and stated it sounded like [Walker] and she was positive that it was [Walker].\u201d (Mullins\u2019 notes)); 489 (\u201c[Bianca] stated that she recognized the voice of the subject. ...\u201d (Mullins report); 543A (\u201c[Bianca] stated she recognized the voice of the perpetrator.... \u201d (Hickman Aff.)).) Because eyewitnesses to events generally do not describe the people who undertook those events by the sound of their voice, these reports tend to suggest that Bianca did not actually see Walker break into the apartment and kill her father. The prosecution did not share the officers\u2019 reports with Walker despite its pre-trial represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>tation that it had provided Walker all documents it was required to disclose. At Walker\u2019s trial, Bianca testified that: (1) she saw Walker come inside the apartment of her mother and father; (2) she saw that Walker was holding a gun; (3) she yelled at Walker, \u201cmy father don\u2019t know you;\u201d (4) she saw Walker shoot her father; and (5) once the shooting started she ran into the bathroom. (J.A. at 25-29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Approximately four months before trial, Walker\u2019s counsel was given a copy of Beale\u2019s Autopsy Report, which stated that \u201c[witnesses inside the [Beale apartment] heard the shots but did not witness the shooting.\u201d (Supp. J.A. at 7). Counsel did not cross-examine Bianca with respect to the contents of the Autopsy Report. After his conviction, but before his sentencing, the state prepared a PSR, which it gave to Walker. In relevant part, the PSR states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">Bianca Taylor, the victim\u2019s daughter advised police she was talking on the phone with a neighbor.... She further advised police [that the neighbor] stated [to Bianca,] \u201c[Walker and his girlfriend] are coming to talk to you.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the shots began. Bianca Taylor later advised Detective Hickman that she recognized the voice of the suspect. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">(Pet\u2019r Supp.App. at 250.) Despite the fact he was in possession of the Autopsy Report and the PSR, Walker did not raise a <em>Brady </em>claim with respect to the officers\u2019 reports on direct appeal. Instead, Walker first raised his <em>Brady </em>claim in his state habeas corpus petition. The state court concluded that Walker\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim was procedurally defaulted under <em>Slayton v. Parrigan, </em>215 Va. 27, 205 S.E.2d 680, 682 (1974) (holding that state habeas petitioner waives argument on habeas review that \u201ccould have been raised and adjudicated at ... trial and upon ... appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Walker filed a \u00a7 2254 petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, raising, inter alia, his <em>Brady </em>claim. The district court dismissed Walker\u2019s petition, concluding, in relevant part, that the <em>Brady </em>claim was procedurally defaulted and that Walker had not shown cause and prejudice to excuse his default. Judge Gregory granted Walker a Certificate of Appealability on his <em>Brady </em>claim. On the merits, however, the panel unanimously affirmed, concluding that Walker could not show cause for his procedural default because the PSR made Walker aware of \u201cthe factual basis [of his] <em>Brady </em>claim.\u201d <em>See Walker v. True, </em>67 Fed.Appx. 758, 767-68 (4th Cir.2003). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Banks v. Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 124 S.Ct. 1256, 157 L.Ed.2d 1166 (2004). <em>See Walker v. True, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1028, 163 L.Ed.2d 849 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">As he did in his original appeal to this Court, Walker argues that he has shown \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d to overcome the procedural default of his <em>Brady </em>claim. As to cause, he contends that the PSR and Autopsy Report were insufficient to make him aware of the factual basis of his claim because those reports suggested only that Bianca did not see the <em>shooting, </em>not that she did not see the <em>shooter. </em>Virginia argues \u2014 as we held in our original opinion\u2014 that the PSR was sufficient to make Walker aware of the factual basis of his <em>Brady </em>claim. I continue to agree with Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">A federal court conducting habeas review is \u201cprecluded from reviewing the merits of a claim that was procedurally defaulted under an \u2018independent and adequate\u2019 state procedural rule, \u2018unless the [applicant] can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fisher v. Lee, </em>215 F.3d 438, 455 (4th Cir.2000) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991)). Walker does not dispute that the state court applied an adequate and independent procedural rule in finding that his <em>Brady </em>claim was procedurally defaulted. Moreover, he does not argue that failure to consider his <em>Brady </em>claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Instead, he asserts only that \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d exist to excuse the default. We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions respecting cause and prejudice. <em>See Burroughs v. Makowski, </em>411 F.3d 665, 667 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999), the Supreme Court set forth the three requirements for a successful <em>Brady </em>claim: \u201c[1] the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; [2] the evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and [3] prejudice must have ensued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Strickler, </em>the second and third elements of a successful <em>Brady </em>claim overlap with the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d showing that will excuse a petitioner from a procedural default. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 119 S.Ct. 1936; <em>see also Banks, </em>124 S.Ct. at 1274 (\u201cCorresponding to the second <em>Brady </em>component (evidence suppressed by the State), a petitioner shows \u2018cause\u2019 when the reason for his failure to develop facts in state-court proceedings was the State\u2019s suppression of the relevant evidence; coincident with the third <em>Brady </em>component (prejudice), prejudice within the compass of the \u2018cause and prejudice\u2019 requirement exists when the suppressed evidence is \u2018material\u2019 for <em>Brady </em>purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">In <em>Strickler, </em>the defendant had been convicted of capital murder, based, in part, on a witness\u2019s testimony that she had seen the defendant violently abduct the victim. 527 U.S. at 270-73, 119 S.Ct. 1936. Despite the prosecution\u2019s open file policy, notes of the investigating officer and witness \u2014 which revealed that the witness\u2019s memory of the abduction was hazy and that, from what she could remember, she had \u201ctotally [written the abduction] off as a trivial episode of college kids carrying on,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 273-75, 119 S.Ct. 1936 \u2014 were not given to the defendant until after he had filed an unsuccessful direct appeal and state habeas petition. On appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, which raised a <em>Brady </em>claim relating to the witness\u2019s testimony, the Fourth Circuit held that the defendant\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim was procedurally defaulted and that the defendant could not show cause because \u201che should have known [about the police reports] through the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 119 S.Ct. 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The Supreme Court disagreed, holding instead that the defendant had shown cause because: \u201c(a) the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence; (b) petitioner reasonably relied on the prosecution\u2019s open file policy as fulfilling the prosecution\u2019s duty to disclose such evidence; and (c) the state confirmed petitioner\u2019s reliance on the open file policy by asserting during state habeas proceedings that petitioner had already received everything known to [it].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state argued that the defendant\u2019s reliance on its open file policy was not reasonable because (1) counsel was aware that the witness had been interviewed by the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>and (2) counsel could have made a motion for discovery of the files in the state courts, <em>id. </em>at 284-85, 119 S.Ct. 1936 but the Supreme Court disagreed, stating that although the defendant was aware of the witness\u2019s interviews, \u201cit by no means follows that [counsel] would have known that the records pertaining to those interviews ... existed and had been suppressed.... [D]efense counsel [has no] procedural obligation to assert constitutional error on the basis of <em>mere suspicion </em>that prosecutorial misstep may have occurred,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 285-87, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (emphasis added). The Court distinguished those cases in which cause was not found for the failure timely to raise a <em>Brady </em>claim by stating that, in those cases, the petitioner \u201cwas previously aware of the factual basis for his claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 119 S.Ct. 1936. <em>See also McCleskey v.

The prosecutor asked the witness at trial whether he had been promised anything in exchange for his testimony and, despite knowing the truth about the witness\u2019 status, the prosecutor did not correct the record when the witness testified in the negative. <em>Id. </em>In fact, although the prosecutor had an open file policy, he did not disclose this information until after the petitioner had filed an unsuccessful appeal and two state habeas petitions. <em>Id. </em>at 1269. On appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, which raised a <em>Brady </em>claim relating to the witnesses\u2019 testimony, the Fifth Circuit held that Banks\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim was procedurally defaulted because he had failed to develop that claim in his state proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Noting that, as to cause, Banks\u2019s \u201ccase is congruent with <em>Strickler </em>in all ... respects,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1273, the Supreme Court applied <em>Strickler\u2019s </em>three-part cause test, <em>id. </em>(examining whether prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence, whether petitioner reasonably relied on the prosecution\u2019s open file policy, and whether the state confirmed petitioner\u2019s reliance), reiterating <em>Strickler\u2019s </em>admonition that the petitioner\u2019s reliance on the Government\u2019s open file policy is reasonable if he has nothing more than \u201cmere suspicion\u201d of a <em>Brady </em>violation, <em>id. </em>at 1275 (quoting <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 287, 119 S.Ct. 1936). Accordingly, although Banks had suspicions that the witness was well-connected with law enforcement and could have discovered the truth by deposing the witness or the police officer who paid him, Banks\u2019s failure to act on those nascent suspicions did not prevent the Court from finding cause for his failure timely to raise his <em>Brady </em>claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1275-76. Moreover, the Court concluded that the reasonableness of Banks\u2019s reliance on the prosecution\u2019s open file policy was even greater than in <em>Strickler </em>because the <em>Brady </em>mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>rial went directly to the prosecutions\u2019s dealings with the witnesses- \u2014 -in fact, it was the prosecution who coached them- \u2014 -and \u201cit was appropriate for Banks to assume that his prosecutors would not stoop to improper litigation conduct to advance prospects for gaining a conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In my view, even assuming the Autopsy Report implied only that Bianca did not witness the actual <em>shooting </em>\u2014 and not that she did not witness the shooter \u2014 the PSR plainly gave Walker more than a \u201cmere suspicion\u201d that police reports existed suggesting Bianca did not witness the <em>shooter. </em>Accordingly, Walker\u2019s reliance on the prosecutor\u2019s representation that he had disclosed all material he was required to disclose was unreasonable under <em>Strickler </em>and <em>Banks. </em>First, the PSR specifically states that the information contained therein came from officers\u2019 investigation of the Beale murder, a statement that, unlike the facts in <em>Strickler </em>and <em>Banks, </em>indicated to Walker that there were extant documentation of the investigation. Second, and also unlike the facts involved in <em>Strickler </em>and <em>Banks, </em>the PSR detailed the contents of those reports, and actually went so far as to state that \u201cBianca ... advised Detective Hickman that she recognized the voice of the suspect____\u201d (J.A. at 250.) Because, as already explained, eyewitnesses to events generally do not describe the people who undertook those events by deseribing the sound of their voice, the PSR was sufficient to put Walker on notice that there were police reports supporting an inference that Bianca did not see him the night of her father\u2019s murder. Indeed, I find it baffling that the majority can conclude both that \u201cthe withheld reports provide persuasive evidence that Bianca did not see the shooter the night of the murder\u201d because they state that Bianca only recognized the shooter by his voice, <em>ante </em>at 12 (emphasis added), and at the same time that the PSR, <em>which noted the existence of those reports and parroted their relevant substance, </em>somehow failed to give Walker anything more than a mere suspicion of the factual basis of his <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Accordingly, Walker\u2019s awareness of the existence of the alleged <em>Brady </em>material prior to his sentencing removes this ease from the <em>Strickler /Banks </em>framework. Because Walker knew of the existence of the alleged <em>Brady </em>material in time to pursue his <em>Brady </em>claim on direct appeal, there is no reason to relieve him of the consequences of his failure to have done so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">As we concluded in our earlier opinion in this case, \u201c[the PSR], by referencing these undisclosed documents, evidenced the Commonwealth\u2019s suppression of the alleged <em>Brady </em>material. The factual basis for the assertion of Walker\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim, therefore, was available ... before [his] direct appeal.... \u201d <em>Walker, </em>67 Fed.Appx. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>at 767-68. \u201cBecause the [PSR] provided direct evidence that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose the alleged Brady-material, Walker\u2019s reliance on <em>Strickler </em>for the premise that his appellate counsel had no basis to raise a <em>Brady </em>claim is therefore misplaced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 767 n. 6. Because nothing in <em>Banks </em>even arguably undermines this conclusion, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\">. I use the familiar term \"state\u201d in lieu of \"Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\"><em>. </em>The Supreme Court left open the question \u201cwhether any one or two of these factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>would be sufficient to constitute cause.\u201d <em>Strickler v.

He notes that in <em>Banks v. Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 124 S.Ct. 1256, 157 L.Ed.2d 1166 (2004), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that defendants need not \"scavenge for hints of undisclosed <em>Brady </em>material when the prosecution represents that all such material has been disclosed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275. This statement, however, hardly was a new statement of law considering that the Supreme Court in <em>Strickler </em>rejected \"the novel suggestion that conscientious defense counsel have a procedural obligation to assert constitutional error on the basis of mere suspicion that some prosecutorial misstep may have occurred.\u201d <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 286-87, 119 S.Ct. 1936. <em>Banks, </em>in fact, did nothing to alter <em>Strickler\u2019s </em>cause inquiry. <em>See Banks, </em>124 S.Ct. at 1272 (\"Our determination as to 'cause\u2019 for Banks\u2019s failure to develop the facts in state-court proceedings is informed by <em>Strickler.\")', id. </em>at 1272 n. 12 (expressing surprise at the Fifth Circuit\u2019s failure below to refer to <em>Strickler, </em>\"the controlling precedent on the issue of 'cause\u2019 \u201d); <em>id. </em>at 1273 (\"This case is congruent with <em>Strickler </em>in all three [cause factor] respects.\u201d). The only difference with respect to the cause showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>between <em>Banks </em>and <em>Strickler </em>was that \"Banks\u2019s case [was] stronger than was the petitioner\u2019s in <em>Strickler.\" Id. </em>Thus, the Supreme Court in <em>Banks </em>did not alter the cause inquiiy, but instead merely found cause in a case where the facts were slightly more egregious than those in <em>Strickler. </em>It is difficult, then, to comprehend Judge Gregory\u2019s contention that Walker can now show cause \"[i]n light of <em>Banks,\" ante </em>at 24, when he was unable to do so in light of <em>Strickler. Walker v. True, </em>67 Fed.Appx. 758 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b208-15\">. The majority concludes that Walker has shown both cause and prejudice to excuse his procedural default. As discussed, this conclusion means that Walker has satisfied two of the three elements of a successful <em>Brady </em>claim. <em>See Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 282, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (equating the \"cause and prejudice\" showing with the second and third elements of a <em>Brady </em>claim). The majority therefore remands for the district court to determine only whether Walker has shown the third element of a <em>Brady </em>claim; that is, that \u201cthe evidence at issue is favorable to [Walker], either because it is exculpatory or because it is impeaching.\" <em>Id. </em>at 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936. Although the majority strangely refrains from addressing this legal question, its statement that \u201d[t]he withheld reports provide persuasive evidence that Bianca did not see the shooter the night of [her father\u2019s] murder,\" <em>ante </em>at 12, answers this question in the affirmative. In essence, then, as suggested by Judge Gregory's concurrence, the majority opinion results in an inevitable grant of Walker\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
