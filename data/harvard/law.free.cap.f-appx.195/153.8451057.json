In No. 05-7373, Kokoski requests that we find that his criminal conviction was secured by fraud on the court, overturn the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion as untimely, and direct the district court to rule on an outstanding motion to reopen his \u00a7 2255 proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In No. 06-6083, Kokoski requests that we direct the district court to rule on his outstanding motion to be relieved from the district court\u2019s October 2003 order dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons stated be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>low, we deny both petitions for mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>See In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Further, mandamus is a drastic remedy and should be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>See Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>See In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). We conclude that Kokoski\u2019s request that we invalidate his criminal conviction and reverse the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely is not available by way of mandamus. We therefore deny this portion of Kokoski\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">As for Kokoski\u2019s motions to reopen his \u00a7 2255 motion and to be relieved from the operation of a judgment, the district court has denied these motions. Accordingly, any allegations of undue delay in the district court\u2019s action on those motions are now moot. We deny Kokoski\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-18\">.
