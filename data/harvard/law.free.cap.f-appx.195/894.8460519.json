We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of whether the district court erred by finding that appellant had waived his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal. The government concedes the error and requests that we remand for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on this issue. We agree that the district court erred in concluding that Rosero waived his claim, and we accordingly VACATE the district court's denial of Rosero\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and REMAND for the district court to determine whether Rosero\u2019s counsel denied him effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">The instant \u00a7 2255 motion stems from Rosero\u2019s guilty plea to one count of conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii). Rl-1. The district court imposed a sentence of 210 months of imprisonment. In addition, Rosero\u2019s written plea agreement contained a sentence appeal waiver, which provided, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-15\">The defendant ... expressly waives the right to appeal defendant\u2019s sentence, directly or collaterally, on any ground, including the applicability of the \u201csafety valve\u201d provisions contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and USSG \u00a7 5C1.2, except for an upward departure by the sentencing judge, a sentence above the statutory maximum, or a sentence in violation of the law apart from the sentencing guidelines[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">Exh. Folder 1-53 at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-17\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Rosero raised several claims, including that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal of his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rosero indicated that none of the claims mentioned in his \u00a7 2255 motion were raised \u201cprior hereto based on the advi[c]e\u201d of his counsel. Rl-1 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">The government responded that Rosero waived his right to appeal his sentence, either directly or collaterally, on all of the grounds raised in his motion. Specifically, with regard to Rosero\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the government responded that this claim was waived because it did not relate to the validity of the plea or the waiver itself. In reply, Rosero argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that aside from the exceptions set forth in the plea agreement itself, he could collaterally attack his sentence on constitutional grounds in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The district court denied Rosero\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. In its order denying the motion, the district court addressed the sequence of events at Rosero\u2019s change of plea hearing, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-5\">the United States Magistrate Judge reviewed with Rosero the waiver of his right to appeal, directly or collaterally his sentence, and asked whether he had discussed this waiver with his lawyer and if he had any questions about it. Rosero responded affirmatively. The Court also asked if he were agreeing to that provision freely and voluntarily as part of his plea and he said \u2018Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Rl-11 at 2 (citations omitted). In denying the motion, the district court found that Rosero had waived his ineffeetive-assistance-of-counsel claim pursuant to the sentence appeal waiver in the plea agreement. The district court also denied Rosero\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion with respect to all of the other claims, none of which are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Rosero then filed a notice of appeal. We granted a COA on the following issue only: \u201c[w]hether the district court erred by finding that appellant had waived his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal?\u201d Rl-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">The government concedes that, pursuant to our decision in <em>Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788 (11th Cir.2005), the district court erred by finding that Rosero had waived his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal. The government acknowledges that we should remand for the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to establish the content of communications between Rosero and his counsel so that the district court may determine whether counsel complied with his constitutional duties pursuant to <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">A district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding are reviewed <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Whether a defendant ultimately has received ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law reviewed <em>de novo. Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1142 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>the Supreme Court established a two-prong test for adjudicating ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). First, a \u201cmovant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The proper measure of attorney performance is \u201creasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. \u201c[C]ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance\u201d and to have exercised reasonable professional judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. Second, a movant \u201cmust show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. To prove prejudice, a movant must show \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability\u201d that the outcome \u201cwould have been different\u201d but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">In <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>the Supreme Court applied the test set forth in <em>Strickland </em>and reiterated the long-established rule \u201cthat a lawyer who disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.\u201d 528 U.S. at 474-77, 120 S.Ct. at 1035. The Supreme Court further held that, even when a defendant has not specifically instructed his counsel to file an appeal, in order to determine whether counsel performed deficiently, a court must inquire \u201cwhether counsel in fact consulted with the defendant about an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 120 S.Ct. at 1035. \u201cIf so, the attorney has only acted unreasonably if he has ignored the client\u2019s wishes to appeal the case.... If not, the court must further inquire whether the attorney had an affirmative duty to consult.\u201d <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>433 F.3d at 792 (citing <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 478, 120 S.Ct. at 1035). This duty to consult arises when either: \u201c(1) any rational defendant would want to appeal, or (2) [the defendant] reasonably demonstrated an interest in appealing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 480, 120 S.Ct. at 1036). \u201c[T]o show prejudice in these circumstances, a defendant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal, he would have timely appealed.\u201d <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">In <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>we were presented with a case factually and procedurally similar to the instant appeal. In that case, <em>Gomez-Diaz </em>pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement containing a sentence appeal waiver identical to the waiver in the instant case. 433 F.3d at 789-90. <em>Gomez-Diaz </em>did not file a direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>433 F.3d at 790. He filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, wherein he alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his court-appointed counsel failed to file a notice of appeal as he requested. <em>Id. </em>The district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion, without an evidentiary hearing, on the basis that <em>Gomez-Diaz </em>failed to identify any ground for appeal falling within the exceptions listed in the sentence appeal waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 790. We granted a certificate of appealability to address the question of \u201c[w]hether [Gomez-Diaz] was denied effective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to file a timely notice of appeal after appellant allegedly requested counsel to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addressing this issue, we also addressed two subsidiary questions: (1) \u201cwhether [Gomez-Diaz\u2019s] \u00a7 2255 motion states a claim that entitles him to an evidentiary hearing\u201d; and (2) if yes, \u201cwhether <em>[Gomez-Diaz\u2019s] </em>limited appeal waiver precludes the grant of relief unless he can show that he has meritorious grounds for appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">After examining the analytical framework set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>we held that <em>Gomez-Diaz </em>did in fact state a claim sufficient to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing in the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 791-93. Construing <em>Gomez-Diaz\u2019s </em>pleadings liberally, we remanded the case to the district court with instructions to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether <em>Gomez-Diaz\u2019s </em>initial statements were sufficient to trigger a <em>per se </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>duty to appeal, and if not, whether counsel fulfilled his constitutional duty to consult with <em>Gomez-Diaz </em>regarding his desire to appeal. <em>Id. </em>We also held that the reasoning of <em>Flores-Ortega </em>applied \u201cwith equal force\u201d when \u201cthe defendant has waived many, but not all, of his appellate rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Here, as in <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>the district court erred by concluding that Rosero had waived his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In denying Rosero\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim asserted in his \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court found that the claim was barred because it did not relate to the validity of the plea or the waiver itself. As conceded by the government, the district court erred in making this finding in light of the reasoning set forth in <em>Gomez-Diaz. </em>The record in this case is insufficient to determine whether Rosero actually requested that his attorney file an appeal. The record shows that the district court did not address this issue. The inquiry as to whether Rosero actually requested counsel to file an appeal, which has not taken place in this case, is an essential first step in the analysis under <em>Flores-Ortega </em>and <em>Gomez-Diaz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">We vacate and remand to the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing into: (1) whether Rosero, in fact, requested counsel to file a direct appeal to trigger the <em>per se </em>duty to appeal set forth in <em>Flores-Ortega; </em>and (2) if not, whether counsel fulfilled his constitutional duty to consult with Rosero by advising Rosero of the advantages and disadvantages of filing an appeal and making a reasonable effort to comply with Rosero\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-12\">. The district court initially denied Rosero's \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred. Rosero subsequently filed a motion to alter or amend judgment. The district court granted Rosero\u2019s motion to alter or amend judgment and reopened the case so that it could address the merits of the claims in his \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-8\">. The government notes that Rosero fails to discuss <em>Flores-Ortega </em>and <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>and contends that Rosero\u2019s brief instead discusses the merits of several different arguments that hypothetically could have been raised on appeal. The government asserts that these arguments should not be considered and that Rosero has failed to address the narrow question that we have certified for review. While Rosero does not discuss <em>Flores-Ortega </em>and <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>he has maintained that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for not filing a direct appeal despite the sentence appeal waiver in the plea agreement. Rather than asserting the merits of specific arguments, it appears that Rosero cites particular examples of what his counsel could have argued if a direct appeal was filed. As we construe <em>pro se </em>arguments liberally, Rosero has addressed the issue specified in the COA. <em>See Trawinski v. United Technologies, </em>313 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2002) <em>(per curiam) </em>(noting that courts construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
