Presentence reports (\u201cPSRs\u201d) were prepared and later amended at the district court\u2019s direction, recommending that each Defendant be held responsible for forty-nine grams of crack cocaine. Scott\u2019s calculated guideline range was 151-188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Mattison\u2019s calculated guideline range was 135-168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Appellants objected to their sentences on the basis of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) . The district court overruled Appellants\u2019 objections and sentenced Scott and Mattison to 156 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count of conviction, to run concurrently. The court held the sentencing hearings after <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004), <em>vacated, </em>543 U.S. 1097, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005) , issued and stated that, if the guidelines were held to be unconstitutional and not applied, it would impose the same sentence for Mattison and one additional year for Scott. On appeal, Appellants assert that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing them based on drug quantity in excess of that established by the jury verdict. The Government contends that any error was harmless in light of the alternative sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Appellants argue that they should not be held responsible for forty-nine grams of cocaine base, resulting in a base offense level of 30, because the quantity was neither proven beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted. Because Appellants properly preserved these Sixth Amendment claims, this court reviews under the harmless error analysis. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 268, 125 S.Ct. 738. The Government bears the burden in harmless error review of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The district court stated that it would impose non-guidelines alternative sentences that were identical to Mattison\u2019s actual sentence and for Scott, one year higher than his actual sentence. Thus, the Government has met its burden of demonstrating that the constitutional error in this case was harmless. <em>United States v. Shatley, </em>448 F.3d 264, 267 (4th Cir.2006). The district court followed this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>Hammond, </em>its alternative sentences were within the range recommended by the sentencing guidelines, and this court takes the district court at its word when it states that it would impose the sentences articulated under the advisory guideline system. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Accordingly, we affirm Appellants\u2019 sentences and deny their motions to remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
