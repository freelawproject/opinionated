On appeal, Penalver argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level aggravating-role enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), because he was not an organizer or leader of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-19\">The parties are familiar with the background facts, and we do not recount them here. \u201cA district court\u2019s upward adjustment of a defendant\u2019s Guidelines offense level due to his status as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-20\">Under the Guidelines, a four-level increase is applied to the defendant\u2019s offense level if he or she \u201cwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). In making the aggravating-role determination, the district court should consider several factors, including \u201cthe exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4. \u201cThere can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1 \u201crequires the exercise of some authority in the organization, the exertion of some degree of control, influence, or leadership.\u201d <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-21\">After carefully reviewing the record, the sentencing transcript, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude the district court had ample evidence to support its finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Penalver was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants. We accordingly hold the district court did not clearly err in applying a four-level aggravating-role enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), and we affirm Penalver\u2019s 135-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
