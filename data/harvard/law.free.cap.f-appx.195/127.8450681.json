We have reviewed the administrative record and find no error in the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Sharak was firmly resettled and thus ineligible for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi) (2000); <em>Mussie v. INS, </em>172 F.3d 329, 331-32 (4th Cir.1999). As the firm resettlement bar to asylum applies, Sharak is unable to establish any grounds that would warrant reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
