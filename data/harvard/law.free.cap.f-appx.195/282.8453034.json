Alanis challenged the constitutionality of his conviction and sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The errors asserted by Alanis may not be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition unless they arise under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We have held that claims based on <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely </em>do not fall under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Alternatively, Alanis seeks authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2555 motion. Alan-is\u2019s motion incorporated in his brief is denied. <em>See In re Elwood, </em>408 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Alanis\u2019s challenge to the requirements of \u00a7 2241 and \u00a7 2255 under the Suspension Clause has been rejected by this court. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 n. 19 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Alanis\u2019s request for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
