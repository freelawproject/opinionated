Epperson was assigned an offense level of fourteen, criminal history category IV, and sentenced to thirty-three months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Epperson contends his sentence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>unreasonable as the district court improperly accepted the probation officer\u2019s recommendation to apply <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Jl.S(a) (2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). A sentence is unreasonable if based on an error in construing or applying the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 456-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">At sentencing, rather than merely accepting the recommendation of the probation officer, the district court deemed, and Epperson conceded, that the obstruction of justice enhancement authorized by USSG \u00a7 2J1.2 better reflected Epperson\u2019s conduct. However, even if the court had applied a perjury enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2J1.3, Epperson could not establish harm as the guideline range remained unchanged.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude Epperson\u2019s thirty-three month sentence, which was within a properly calculated guidelines range, is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Epperson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\"> The guideline provision for obstruction of justice, like that for perjury, has a base offense level of fourteen. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2J1.2(a); 2J1.3(a). Likewise, both provisions provide for a three-level increase for substantial interference with the administration of justice. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2J1.2(b)(2); 2J1.3(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
