On appeal, Mickens argues the following: (1) the district court erred in granting Reynolds\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss Mickens\u2019s conspiracy claim; (2) the district court abused its discretion in denying Mickens\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint; (3) the district court erred in denying Mickens\u2019s motion for recusal; (4) the district court erred in granting Polk County\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Mickens\u2019s due process claims and ADA perceived disability claim, and (5) the district court erred in denying Mickens\u2019s motion in limine as an untimely motion for summary judgment. After review, we conclude that Mickens\u2019s arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-19\">Mickens also seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s entry of judgment as a matter of law against Mickens at to his ADA psychological examination claim and his First Amendment retaliation claim, as well as the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Polk County as to Mickens\u2019s Title VII race discrimination and retaliation claims. However, because Mickens failed to provide this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>Court with a complete record of the evidentiary proceedings, we are unable to review Mickens\u2019s claims on appeal implicating the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2) (placing burden on appellant to ensure record on appeal contains all transcripts relevant to sufficiency of the evidence issues raised by appellant); <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir.2002) (concluding that <em>pro se </em>appellant must also comply with Rule 10(b)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-16\">. Polk County argues that we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s post-judgment order entering judgment as a matter of law against Mickens as to his ADA psychological examination claim because Mickens did not amend his notice of appeal to include this claim. We disagree. Within thirty days of the district court\u2019s entry of final judgment in favor of Polk County on this claim, Mickens filed a <em>pro se </em>brief with this Court indicating his intent to appeal that order, which was sufficient to confer jurisdiction. <em>See Finch v. City of Vernon, </em>845 F.2d 256, 258-59 (11th Cir.1988) (concluding that court of appeals had jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order granting appellee\u2019s post-judgment motion when, within thirty days, appellants filed a <em>pro se </em>brief with this court clearly indicating their intent to appeal the order). However, as we have noted, we are nonetheless unable to review Micken\u2019s claims with regard to this order because Mickens failed to provide complete transcripts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
