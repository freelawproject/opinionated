According to Marchant, he was wrongfully arrested and suffered physical and emotional injuries after security guards employed by Ruiz Protective Services falsely alerted the El Paso Police Department that he was carrying a gun at the El Paso Public Library. His pleadings in the district court asserted various federal constitutional claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 as well as state tort law claims arising out of this incident. He also alleged that the library\u2019s insurer, American Equity Insurance Company, unreasonably refused to settle his claim. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo, \u201ctaking the actual allegations of the complaint as true, and resolving any ambiguities or doubts regarding the sufficiency of the claim in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Jones v. Alcoa, Inc., </em>339 F.3d 359, 362 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Marchant\u2019s claims, both under \u00a7 1983 and under state law, were required to be filed within the applicable two-year limitations period. <em>See Piotrowski v. City of Houston, 237 </em>F.3d 567, 576 (5th Cir. 2001); Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a) (Vernon Supp.2005). As Mar-chant filed his complaint more than two years after the incident that gave rise to his lawsuit, the district court properly dismissed his \u00a7 1983 and state tort claims as untimely. Thus, we need not reach the parties\u2019 arguments regarding whether the private actors involved could have been acting under color of state law for purposes of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">With respect to Marchant\u2019s claims against American Equity for its refusal to settle with him, Texas law does not recognize a cause of action by a third party for claims of unfair settlement practices. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Watson, </em>876 S.W.2d 145, 149 (Tex.1994). Thus, Marchant failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. We do not address Marchant\u2019s theories under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Education of the Handicapped Act, or the Public Health and Welfare Equal Opportunities Act, because Marchant did not assert them in the district court. <em>See Priester v. Lowndes County, </em>354 F.3d 414, 424 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
