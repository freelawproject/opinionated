Kendrick, </em>this day decided, a condemnation proceeding is deemed by our practice as an action at law. The functions of this court in appeals of actions at law do not embrace a retrial of the facts if the findings, general or special, are supported by substantial competent evidence. Since the state, as appellant, does not argue that the amount of the fee lacks support by competent, substantial evidence we are not at liberty to consider any revision of the amount of the fee. The assignment of error is lacking in merit, as is apparent from the carefully reasoned opinion written by our Chief Justice in the Kendrick case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The challenged judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>Norman K.
