The proviso permitting a deduction of debts from credits shows clearly that the framers of the constitution considered the question of debts and credits, and that they intended to include credits in the term \u201cproperty\u201d, and as such, to compel its taxation.

The constitutional requirement of equality and uniformity only extends to such objects of taxation as the legislature shall determine to be properly subject to the burden. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (7th ed.), p. 742.

Where the legislature has clearly intended to create an exemption, the validity of that act must be assumed. 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), 274. The court admits in the <em>Chamberlin </em>case that it is within the legislative power and jurisdiction to exempt certain classes of property, although they do not strictly come within the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>announced in that case. Page 122 of <em>State ex rel. Chamberlin v. Daniel, </em>17 Wash. 111, 49 Pac. 243. The strict rule of construction applied to statutes does not apply to constitutions. Endlich, Interpretation of Statutes, \u00a7 526. State, county and municipal bonds, and warrants, the highest forms of credits, have long been considered subjects for express exemption from taxation even where, under constitutions, it was expressed that \u201call property, real and personal,\u201d is subject to taxation. <em>State ex rel.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoI\">This action was instituted in the superior court of Lincoln county, and it is in the nature of an action in mandamus to require the assessor of that county to list for taxation purposes, for the year 1908, mortgages, notes, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>counts, moneys, certificates of deposit, tax certificates, judgments, bonds, and warrants. In terms the petition asks for a writ of prohibition to prohibit the assessor from allowing the above-mentioned items to become exempt from taxation; but in effect the relief sought is affirmative and in the nature of mandamus. The assessor demurred to the petition, on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to authorize the issuance of a writ. The demurrer was overruled, and in the absence of further pleading, judgment was entered commanding the assessor to list and assess all the items specified above. The assessor has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">It is urged in support of the demurrer that it was the duty of appellant to refuse to list the items mentioned, by reason of the act of the legislature as found in chapter 18, at page 69 of the session Laws of 1907. Section 1 of that act is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">\u201cThat section 3 of \u2018Chapter x-xxxm of the Laws of 1897, amended June 12, 1901, is hereby amended to read as follows: Sec. 3. Personal property, for the purpose of taxation, shall be construed to embrace and include, without especially defining and enumerating it, all goods, chattels, stocks or estates; all improvements upon lands, the fee of which is still vested in the United States, or in the State of Washington, or in any railroad company or corporation, and all and singular of whatsoever kind, name, nature and description, which the law may define or the courts interpret, declare and hold to be personal property, for the purpose of taxation, and as being subject to the laws and under the jurisdiction of the courts of this state, whether the same be any marine craft, as ships and vessels, or other property holden under the laws and jurisdiction of the courts of this state, be the same at home or abroad: <em>Provided, </em>That the ships or vessels registered in any custom house of the United States within this state, which ships or vessels are used, exclusively in trade between this state and any of the islands, districts, territories, states of the United States, or foreign countries, shall* not be listed for the purpose of or subject to taxation in this state, such vessels not being deemed property within this state: <em>Provided, </em>That mortgages, notes, accounts, moneys, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>certificates of deposit, tax certificates, judgments, state, county, municipal and school district bonds and warrants shall not be considered as property for the purpose of this chapter, and no deduction shall hereafter he allowed on account of an indebtedness owed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">It will be seen that the effect of the closing proviso of the. section is to exempt from taxation the items there enumerated. If, therefore, the statute is a valid one, the appellant did his duty; but if it violates constitutional limitations, the judgment of the court was right. The constitutionality of the statute is the only question involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">It is contended that the act is invalid because of insufficiency of the title. The title is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201cAn act amending an act entitled, \u2018An act to amend section 3, of chapter Lxxxm of the Laws of 1897, relating to revenue and taxation,\u2019 passed the senate and the house June 12, 1901, notwithstanding the veto of the governor, and declaring an emergency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">If it is necessary to pay strict regard to everything contained in this title, then it is singularly involved. Reference to chapter 83 of the Laws of 1897, to which the title refers as the law amended by this act, discloses that it treats of monuments and notices upon mining claims. It is manifest that the reference to the former statute is a pure error, as the two \u00e1cts relate to subjects entirely separate and distinct. This title does however further state the subject as \u201crelating to revenue and taxation,\u201d and the body of the act clearly and succinctly treats of that subject alone. The subject of exemption from taxation treated in the body of the act is included in the general subject specified in the title. We think the erroneous reference to the former statute must be treated as mere surplusage, and inasmuch as without that part of the title there is a clearly stated and single subject which is followed by a clear treatment of that subject in the act itself, the statute becomes an independent one and has the effect of amending any existing statute upon the subject and of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>pealing by implication any previously existing provisions in conflict with it. We therefore hold that the act is not invalid by reason of its title.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">It is further urged that the act violates \u00a7 \u00a7\u25a0 1 and 2 of art. 7 of the state constitution. Section 1 contains, among other things, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201cAll property in the state not exempt under the laws of the United States or under this constitution, shall he taxed in proportion to its value, to be ascertained as provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Section <em>% </em>is in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201cThe legislature shall provide by law a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation on all property in the state, according to its value in money, and shall prescribe such regulations by general law as shall secure a just valuation for taxation of all property, so that every person and corporation shall pay a tax in proportion to the value of his, her or its property: <em>Provided, </em>That a deduction of debts from credits may be authorized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">It is argued that the exemption of the items mentioned in the statute violates the constitutional provision of \u00a7 1 quoted above, which requires that all property in the state shall be taxed except such as is exempt under the laws of the United States or under the constitution of the state. It is contended that credits such as mortgages, notes, and accounts, are property and cannot be excluded by the legislature from the subjects of taxation. The argument assumes that all property in the state cannot be taxed without the taxation of credits Is the assumption correct ? The constitution simply requires \u2014 that all property shall be taxed, but the method of doing it is left to the legislature. If the method devised by the legislature reaches all property in fact, then there is no violation of the constitution. It is possible to assess the same property in different ways any one of which would subject the entire property to the tax. For example, one person may own the fee title to real estate and another may own an easement or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>leasehold therein. All of these ar\u00e9 property, but it cannot be successfully maintained that all of them must be taxed in order to satisfy the constitution. The state taxes the land as an entirety and leaves the owners of the several interests to make such adjustments as they choose. The constitutional requirement that all property shall be taxed is certainly satisfied through a method by which the total of all wealth in the state is once taxed. Double taxation should be avoided as far as possible, and in any event the constitution should not be so construed as to require it. In an effort to tax all property it is, however, difficult to avoid double taxation in some particulars. The complexity of established business methods is such that property appears and then reappears in representative forms. The actual property of a corporation reappears in the hands of its stockholders in the shape of corporate stock. That the taxation of the corporate property and also of its capital stock amounts to double taxation was recognized by this court in <em>Lewiston Water fy Power Co. v. Asotin County, </em>24 Wash. 371, 64 Pac. 544. The court observed in that case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">\u201cBut, as we have seen, the assessment of the capital stock of a domestic corporation which has all its property in which the capital stock is invested already assessed is duplicate taxation, and this latter result will not be inferred without specific legislation. It may be further observed that \u00a7 1676, Bal. Code, in providing the method for the assessment of domestic corporations such as this, does not contemplate duplicate taxation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">See, also, <em>Ridpath v. Spokane County, </em>23 Wash. 436, 63 Pac. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">All the provisions of the constitution on the subject of taxation cannot be fully and literally met. For purposes of present consideration these provisions may be stated as follows: \u201cAll property\u201d shall be taxed. The assessment shall be \u201cuniform and equal,\u201d and a \u201cjust valuation\u201d shall be placed upon all property, so that every person shall pay a tax in proportion to the value. No method of taxation in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>results can fully accomplish all that the constitution declares shall he done. As near an approach to a full compliance as is reasonably possible is all that can be expected of the legislature. One requirement of the constitution is as mandatory in its nature as another. It is just as imperative that taxa--tion shall be uniform and equal upon all property as it is that all property shall be taxed. It is manifest that a system which subjects some property to double taxation is not uniform and equal. Any method which can be devised by the legislature must necessarily be defective in some particulars and must fail to meet with exactness every standard set by the constitution. Any method adopted by the legislature which reason\u2014 ably comprehends the taxation of all property once in some form, and which seeks to accomplish uniformity by avoiding double taxation as far as possible, should receive judicial sanction, for the reason that the constitutional provisions are harmonized by such a method as fully as complete harmony thereunder can be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">It will be seen that the items specified by the statute of 1907 which shall not be considered as property for the pur \u2014 \u2022 poses of assessment and taxation, may all be classified as \u201ccredits,\u201d except the item of \u201cmoneys.\u201d So far as credits are \u2014 concerned, if it is demonstrable that the total wealth of the state can be once taxed without the taxation of credits in any form, we think the constitution is satisfied without the taxation of credits. The multiplicity of credits does not add to the property wealth of the state. If A buys of B a piece of real estate and agrees, by promissory note or otherwise, to pay $5,000 therefor, there is as a result in the hands of B a credit in the amount of $5,000, but there is not thereby created $5,000 more property or wealth. By the transaction the land has passed from B into the possession and control of A and is taxable the same as if it had remained with B. The credit in the hands of B is a matter of no value or consequence, except for the prospect or faith that A will in the future deliver to B $5,000 in actual money or other prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>erty. That money or property that may in the future come to B is still in the hands of A or some one else from whom A will procure it; and it is meanwhile taxable at some place, wherever it may be, no matter who possesses it or controls it, whether within or without this state. The credit in the hands of B is simply the right to demand the delivery of $5,000\u2019 worth of property at some time in the future. To tax both this right and the property which it represents is clearly double taxation. .</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">A similar illustration applies to a loan of money. At this \u201e point it is proper to remark that we think moneys cannot properly be classified with credits as is done in the statute of 1907. Money in practical commercial operations possesses such value by way of immediate purchasing or exchange \u2014 powers as in effect robs it of a mere representative character and clothes it with the dignity of property having intrinsic value. We therefore think that the proviso in question must \u2014be held to be inoperative so far as money is concerned, since to exempt it from taxation would amount to a palpable effort to avoid the taxation of all property. Becurring now to the illustration as to a credit created by the loan of money,, we will suppose that A borrows from B $5,000 in cash. A, instead of B, becomes the possessor of the money, and either it or its equivalent in other property which it purchases for A becomtes taxable in the latter\u2019s hands. To tax the money \u2014 in A\u2019s hands and also the mere right which B has to call upon A for its repayment is clearly double taxation. These\u2019 illustrations it is believed should apply to all credits. Credits are in effect the mere legal right with which one is clothed to demand the delivery of money or other property in the future, and until such transfer of possession is made, that property is-taxed wherever it may be. Thus the total actual property or \u2014- wealth of the state may be once taxed without the taxation-of credits, and the constitutional requirement is thereby fully-met.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>In <em>People v. Hibernia Bank, </em>51 Cal. 243, 21 Am. Rep. 704, it was held, under constitutional provisions similar to ours, that credits are not property subject to taxation, within the meaning of the constitution which provides for the uniform taxation of all property in the state in proportion to its value. It is not necessary in order to sustain our statute of 1907 that it should be held, as was done in California, that the legislature cannot, in its discretion provide for the taxation of credits. It is sufficient to say that the omission of credits from a scheme of taxation does not violate the requirement that all actual property shall be taxed. It is argued that <em>State ex rel. Chamberlain v. Daniel, </em>17 Wash. 111, 49 Pac. 243, is decisive of this controversy in favor of respondent. The act there under consideration exempted from taxation in the hands of each person $500 of personal property and $500 of improvements upon land. It will be seen that the act exempted actual property, and its enforcement would have deducted a large amount from, the aggregate of the actual property wealth of the state as not taxable, thus plainly violating the requirement that all property shall be taxed. We have seen that the statute under discussion in the case at bar does not prevent the taxation of the total wealth of the state once, but it does prevent double taxation by way of assessing credits. The case cited is therefore not in point upon the question presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">It is urged that the makers of our constitution must have intended to declare that credits are property which must be taxed, from the fact that \u00a7 2 of art. 7, <em>supra, </em>provides that \u201ca deduction of debts from credits may be authorized.\u201d It is insisted that the above words are a clear constitutional recognition of credits as property.\u2019 If, however, we should recognize the argument as forcible and should undertake to adopt it, we should at once be met with the requirement in the same section that all taxation shall be uniform and equal. We have seen that the taxation of credits violates uniformity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>equality and effects double taxation. The great and principal subject treated in the section is that of uniformity and equality of taxation. It overshadows everything else, and whatever else is mentioned in the section is merely incidental to the main subject. Having reference to the main subject, it cannot be held that uniformity can be preserved if the constitution means that credits <em>must </em>be taxed. It is our duty to adopt such construction as will most nearly harmonize all provisions in the section, with the evident chief purpose sought to be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"APl\">With the mere policy of the statute, the courts have nothing to do, except in so far as the same may throw light upon the legislative intention. It may be stated in this connection, as a matter of common knowledge, that one of the most fruitful sources of inequality in taxation is the attempt to tax credits. Laws for that purpose can never be effectively enforced. Efforts to conceal the existence of the credits are so successful that a few honest persons pay the taxes and the large majority of holders do not. Moreover, in practical experience,the tax is not really paid by the holders of the credit, but it is paid by his debtor. When mortgages are taxed, the mortgagee seldom pays the tax, but the burden thereof is imposed upon the mortgagor by way of increased rates of interest or otherwise, and the same may be said as to increased rates of interest imposed upon borrowers generally. Such results cannot well be avoided, and doubtless the legislature had such considerations in mind as supporting the policy of this law. It was no doubt believed that all the wealth of the state can be once taxed without the taxation of credits, and that with the constitutional requirement as to taxation of all property thus satisfied, uniformity and equality can be the better effected and the abuses above mentioned largely corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">We therefore think, for the foregoing reasons, that the statute is not unconstitutional, except in so far as it attempts to exempt moneys from taxation. That, however, does not invalidate the other provisions, as has been often held. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>general demurrer was properly overruled, inasmuch as a cause of action was stated so far as listing of moneys is concerned, but the judgment should be modified so as to command the respondent to list all moneys for taxation, and further provide that all credit items mentioned in the statute of 1907 shall be excluded from the assessment lists. It is so ordered, and the cause is remanded with instructions to so proceed. The appellant shall recover the costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Rudkin, Dunbar, Crow, and Mount, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b217-5\">Fullerton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUy\">(dissenting) \u2014 I am compelled to dissent both from the conclusion and judgment in this case. The decision is rested, as I understand it, on three propositions: (1) that credits are not property; (2) that to tax credits violates the principle of equality and uniformity in taxation required by the constitution; and (3) that credits are taxed by the taxation of the tangible property of the state. As the questions decided are important, I feel justified in briefly stating the grounds of my dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">(1) The constitutional provisions on the subject of taxation appropriate to the questions before the court are set out in the majority opinion, and need not be reproduced here. A reading of them makes it at once manifest that it was the purpose and intent of the framers of the constitution, as well as that of the people who adopted it, to require for the purposes of revenue the taxation of all private property in the state, of whatsoever kind or nature, equally and uniformly, in proportion to its value in money. The language is explicit. It admits of no limitation or construction. \u201cAll property\u201d is. named, and the only exception provided for is that a deduction of debts from credits may be authorized. The questions, therefore naturally arise what is meant by the word \u201cproperty\u201d and in what sense was the word used in the constitution ?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">That mortgages, notes, accounts, moneys, certificates of deposit, tax certificates, judgments, state, county, municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and school district bonds and warrants, are property in the general and popular sense of that term hardly admits of doubt. They are so termed and considered by all English-speaking people, by all law writers, and by the entire commercial world. They are held by the courts to be protected against spoliation and theft by the statutes which make it a crime to despoil or steal personal property. The question of ownership and title to them is daily the subject of controversy in the civil courts. They are daily the subject of barter and sale in all the marts of commerce. They have value in money, and constitute and make up the most satisfactory character of wealth that mankind possesses. In fine, they have all the attributes of property. These propositions are matters of common knowledge, and citations of authorities are not necessary to establish them.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">That the word \u201cproperty\u201d was used in the constitution in its general sense seems to me also to be free from doubt. It is a cardinal rule of construction that the language of a state constitution, more than that of any other written instrument, is to be taken in\u2019 its general and popular sense. The reason for the rule lies in the fact that its makers are the people who: adopt it. Its language is their language, and its words have meaning as they commonly understand them. When, therefore, words are used which have both a general and a technical sense the former must prevail over the latter, unless the very nature of the subject-matter indicates, or the context suggests, that the technical sense was intended. In the sentence on which the word \u201cproperty\u201d is used in the constitutional provision quoted there is no attempt at definition. It is used without connection with any sentence or phrase which limits its meaning. Nor is there elsewhere any limitation upon its meaning. Indeed, there is no reason for concluding that the word was used other than in its general sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">That the makers of the constitution had the right to provide for the taxation of credits, if they so desired, I think will be conceded. It will be conceded also that this could be done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>by the use of general terms. Therefore, it being true that the obligations here enumerated are \u201cproperty\u201d in the general sense of that term, and it being true that the constitution makers used the term \u201cproperty\u201d in its general sense, it must follow that the constitution requires the taxation of these obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">But there is another reason more potent to my mind than even the foregoing, which shows that the framers of the constitution intended to provide for the taxation of credits by the use of the general term \u201cproperty.\u201d They authorized the legislature, when providing the method of taxation, to allow a deduction of debts from credits. Clearly, if it had not been understood that credits were property and taxable as such, this deduction would not have been authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">(2) Does the taxation of credits violate the principle of equality and uniformity in taxation required by the constitution? The affirmative argument is, that to tax these 'obligations is double taxation. Thus it is said that if A loans B $5,000, and takes B\u2019s obligation to repay that sum, it is double taxation to tax the obligation in A\u2019s hand and the money in B\u2019s. But if this be true, and the obligation be property, I cannot understand how the rule of uniformity and equality is advanced by exempting the obligation. It seems to me that this but further confuses the matter. It cannot be said that the obligation is doubly assessed. If any property is doubly assessed it is the money, and to exempt the obligation exempts the wrong thing. But it is not sound for another reason. When A, the money loaner, loans to B, the borrower, $5,000, and takes his obligation to repay the loan, A\u2019s wealth is not thereby decreased $5,000, nor is B\u2019s wealth increased $5,000. The parties have only made an exchange of wealth, and each has exactly the same amount of wealth he had before. If, therefore, each paid taxes on $5,000 before the exchange, in justice and equity each ought to pay taxes on a like amount thereafter. The law as it heretofore existed, however, seems to have made A pay, after the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>change, on $5,000 and B on $10,000. To correct the evil the legislature relieves A entirely, still leaving B to pay on double the amount he possesses. This to my mind is not equality and uniformity in taxation. Nor do I think any law can equalize taxes which exempts from taxation the creditor class. The burden of double taxation never falls upon them. It falls in every instance upon the property-holding debtor class, since it is the debtor who does not have the absolute interest in the property he possesses. Laws which allow the debtor to deduct from the assessed value of his property debts in good faith owing by him have, for that reason, a sense of equity, but there is no sense of equity or justice in exempting from taxation money and credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">(3) Finally, it is said that credits are taxed in other forms of property, and for that reason their exemption from taxation as credits is justified. The argument in support of this proposition is that credits are but representations of interests in the tangible property of the state, and that when the tangible property of the state is taxed all the wealth within the state is taxed. But I must dissent from this proposition also. It assumes, what is obviously not the fact, that there is no wealth in credits independent of tangible property. Suppose that tomorrow a person should come into this state from some other state bringing with him .stocks and bonds to the value of a million dollars of some solvent railroad corporation whose lines do not touch this state, would any one say that he had brought no wealth into the state, or that the wealth of the state had not been increased? Or, would any one say that these stocks and bonds were taxed by the taxation of the tangible property of the state? Obviously not. How then can it be said that the wealth of the state is taxed by the taxation of its tangible property? It is no answer to say that these bonds are taxed by the taxation of the railroad in another state. This does not satisfy our own laws which require that all property within the state b\u00e9 taxed. Nor does it satisfy the justice of the matter. So long as this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>property is within the state it requires the care and protection of the laws of the state, and it is only right that it should contribute its proportionate share to the maintenance of the state. Furthermore, if credits be property in any form, they must be taxed as property. The constitution does not recognize vicarious taxation. The requirement that all property must be taxed means that it must be taxed directly, in the form it presents itself when the assessment lists are made up, not in the form, of substitutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Again, it is suggested in this connection, and it is a common argument used in support of laws of this character, that credits escape taxation in the major part through the dishonesty of their holders, and that, when they are found, the tax is paid by the debtors in the way of increased interest. But this does not appear to me to argue in favor of the exemption of credits. If the laws are so lax as to permit credits to escape taxation, the remedy is to reform the law, not to exempt credits. It will not do to say that no tax law can be framed that will reach credits. This is no place to point out remedies, but when the law places the premium upon honesty instead of upon dishonesty in these matters, the evil will disappear. But, supposing it be true that a goodly part of the credits of the state will escape the assessor under the best framed law, is it not better that the part that can be reached be taxed than that all be allowed to escape? No one pretends that the assessor reaches all of the tangible personal property in the state, yet I have never heal\u2019d this given as a reason for the exemption from taxation of all tangible personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The claim that the borrower pays the taxes on credits in the way of interest is only true in a general sense. It is true in the sense that the renter pays the taxes on rented land in the way of rents, that the builder pays the taxes on the manufacturing plants when he pays the cost of the building material, that the consumer pays the tax on the products he consumes when he pays the price of the consumed products, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>but it is true in no other sense. The rate of interest is regulated-by law in this state, and it is this law that governs interest rates. Experience has shown that it is only by law \u201c'that the exaction of excessive and exorbitant interest can be prevented. It is never done by freeing money and credits from taxation. Nor is interest lessened to any material extent thereby. This is so because freedom from taxation is \u2014only one, and a minor one, of the many conditions that regulate rates of interest. The maximum rate allowed by law is always exacted if the demand for money at the time justifies it, regardless of other conditions, and the fact that credits are or are not taxed is hardly considered as an element when determining whether the maximum rate shall be exacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">But these latter considerations are beside the question. If the constitution declares that notes, accounts, moneys, certificates of deposit, and the like, are property and taxable as such, the legislature is without power to exempt them from taxation, and any statute attempting so to do is void. I believe it has so declared, and for that reason I think the judg- \u25a0 ment of the lower court should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
