If drafts were accepted and delivered on Sunday, they were void between the parties, but if they were falsely dated as of another day, and came into the hands of an- innocent holder, who took them for val\u00fae without notice, and in the due course of trade, the acceptor was estopped from setting up that defence in a suit against him by such holder. But if the contract of purchase was \u25a0on Sunday, then it was not in the due course of trade, and the holder would not be protected.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b242-9\"><em>(a1.) </em>The acceptances sued on in this case were dated on Saturday, and the evidence in this record fails to show either that the holder was present at their execution, or that he knew they were executed on Sunday, or that they assigned to him and . that he became their owner on that day,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>(&amp;,) The charge contained in the fourth ground of the motion for new \u201ctrial was literally correct, as far as it wei}t.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-5\">(c.) The charge contained in the fifth ground of the motion, while substantially correct, would have been more accurate, after instructing the jury that, if the transfer of the papers sued on was not finally completed on the Sabbath day, but was afterwardaconsummated on another day, then it would, tor all purposes, be valid, and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, if the court had omitted the latter clause of the charge, namely, \u201c unless some other good defence was established by the evidence, under the law, as the court will explain.\u2019' In the connection in which it occurred, this charge Was not sufficiently explicit or guarded.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-6\">2. The evidence in this record fails to show that the defendant paid the firm from whom he bought goods, or their assignees in bankruptcy, or the holder of the draft, for the goods purchasvd, and for which the acceptances sued on- were made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-7\">(o.) it appears that tfie assignees, under an order of the court, had a settlement with the holder of the draft for the effects traced to hie hands, including these papers; that in such settlement he was allowed to retain these papers, and upon accounting for other effects that had come into his hands, to which the assignees were entitled, he was discharged from all suits seeking to render him liable on account of his dealings with the bankrupts, it being provided that he might retain \u201cany collaterals which he might have uncollected, until he collects his full unsettled balance \u201d due from the bankrupts to him, after satisfying claims that he proved against them in the bankrupt court. It was conceded that neither the holder nor the acceptor could settle with the assignees unless the other settled with them, and it was not denied that the acceptor was cognizant of all that transpired in relation to this settlement, and it does -not appear that he objected or set up any opposition to it until long after its const umatidn:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-8\"><em>Held, </em>that when this arrangement was completed, the jurisdiction of the bankrupt court over the subject was at an end, and the parties, in relation to the paper, occupied the same position as they would have done had it never been administered or disposed of in that court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-9\">(6.) If the jury found that the holder was a <em>bona fide </em>holder of these acceptances, then this law -should have been given them in charge, as applicable to these particular issues, instead of the charge given, as excepted to in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth grounds of the motion for new trial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-10\">(c.) It is immaterial what was the motive of the defendant in making tibe arrangement for a settlement of the matters i-n bankruptcy, or what induced him to submit to the'judgmentthen rendered, unless he was misled by the fraudulent representations or practices of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>party thereby benefited, or unless he was so situated as that, by the exercise of diligence, he could not have obtained accurate knowledge of the facts which, in its absence, influenced him to act.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-4\">3. Testimony to the effect that the holder of the paper sued on was the uncle of one of the bankrupt firm from whom he obtained it, was admissible, as tending to show fraud in the dealings between the holder and the firm.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-5\">4. The allowing of the re-introduction of a witness after both sides had closed their case, and after some argument and the intervention of a night, was a matter of discretion with which this court will not interfere, unless it is made manifest that the party objecting suffered serious detriment therefrom.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-6\">(a.) The evidence rejected, as complained of in the ninth ground of the motion for a new trial, should have been admitted, both as tending to corroborate a witness for the plaintiff whose testimony had been attacked, and also as bearing upon the question on what day the holder became the owner of the 'acceptances.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-7\">5. One who is a party to the record, when offered to testify in his own favor with respect to the contract or cause of action in issue or on trial, is incompetent, if the other party thereto is dead.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-8\">6. The pursuit of one\u2019s ordinary avocations on Sunday is an indictable offence, and a party is not bound to testify to such facts against himself; nor should he'be subjected to injury for availing himself of the privilege of refusing to answer questions which might have a tendency either to criminate him or subject him to penalty.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-9\"><em>(a.) </em>The other depositions relating to bankruptcy were irrelevant to any issues made by the pleadings as they then stood, and if admissible under any circumstances, their rejection worked no injury, as the date of the dealings in bankruptcy was admitted.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b244-10\">June 1, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-11\">Contracts.

Ball was a special partner of West <em>&amp; </em>Edwards up to January 1st, 1875. He was uncle to Edwards. In 1875, he kept his office in our store adjoining our office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-11\">Do not know whether the bills sued on bear the proper date. I first saw them November 28th, 1875. Shelton Edwards had them. It was Sunday morning, in the office of W., E. <em>&amp; </em>Co., and myself, Edwards, Ball and two or three others were present. I was sitting at the desk writing a letter, and my attention was called by Mr. Edwards saying to me that he wanted to settle with Mr. Ball by transferring Mr. Powers\u2019s notes and others to Ball instead of ours, and Mr. Ball said he preferred to receive them from my hands, and I handed them to him, Ball, taking a memorandum of the papers, and I asked him if that made us \u201c even,\u201d and he said it did. I gave him Powers\u2019s notes and others and took up notes that he held against the firm. Those notes he gave to me. I was sitting at the desk and took up a pen and was about cancelling them, when Edwards said, \u201c No; don\u2019t do that,\u201d and I took them and placed them in a drawer of the desk. These notes were placed in a drawer of this desk, and when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the firm went into bankruptcy, it was carried to Judge Lochrane\u2019s office up stairs; this drawer slipped out and these notes fell out, and that is the last I saw of them. That was after the bankruptcy. I knew this was a full and final settlement with Colonel Ball, because I took a memorandum and knew the amounts, and it \u201cwas understood and accepted as full and final. Had no other transaction with Ball from that time until the bankruptcy. Edwards left that day for Savannah at half-past one o\u2019clock. He returned on the following Tuesday. Do not know who he brought back with him. I heard Colonel Ball say he had settled with the assignees. He told me so. I do not know as (hese notes were mentioned. He met me; there was an effort being made to settle all these matters, and he told me that he had settled with the assignees, and he supposed they could bring Mr. Powers to a settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-4\">That was some time in February or March, 1876, after the assignees were appointed. Do not know how long after. Think it was after the failure of the effort to get a composition in bankruptcy. Don\u2019t remember how long after. It was in the spring, not far, I think, from the 1st of April. Powers was not present. The notes were not mentioned, but Ball said he had settled the Powers matter with the assignees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">I was examined by interrogatories in this case before, on November 1 Oth, 1877. Said nothing about this then. No question was asked about it by the counsel, and I'did not volunteer any information.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\"><em>E. P. </em>Ilowell:\u2014I do not know where the answer to the bill filed by the assignees against Henry R. Powers is. It is not in my possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">Don\u2019t remember that, in the settlement the assignees made with Powers, Ball was settled with as between himself and Powers. Ball was no party to it. That is my recollection. I was Powers\u2019s attorney. Cannot remember that Ball 'had any attorney there to settle anything. So far as I know, he was not settled with at that time. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>was a settlement made in which all parties settled, which failed. It was not approved by the court, and it failed. Rowers and myself discussed whether or not those notes could be got rid of on account of being a Sunday transaction, at the time of the last settlement between Ball and Powers and the assignees. It was known that these notes were outstanding and lad to be defended. Don\u2019t remember Edwards being at the settlement between Powers and the assignees and his being in possession of any bills of exchange of Henry Powers. They had so many settlements, I don\u2019t remember what took place. Edwards was with us sometimes, but I don\u2019t remember any one time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">I can\u2019t state the contents of Powers\u2019s answer to the bill. It denied all the charges of fraud made in the bill and set forth that the goods were transferred in the course of trade in good faith. It was sworn to. It denied all the allegations in the bill. Powers\u2019s settlement with the assignees had nothing to do with the answer. The answer denied that he got as much as was charged by the bill. It set up that these notes were in the possession of Ball. The court made an order in the case; whether verbal or written, I do not remember. The order was on the bill. There was another order, but I don\u2019t remember what it was. It is my impression that under that order he was to turn tho goods over to the receiver, or the money. Q. \u201cWas it done ?\u201d A. \u201cWe settled it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">In his answer, Powers set up that these notes were received in good faith by him and transferred to innocent parties who had no notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-7\">Powers gave some other notes in liquidation of his indebtedness to W., E. &amp; Co. that were transferred to the Citizens\u2019 Bank and elsewhere. Powers was ordered to turn over the goods, etc., or in default to go to jail. He didn\u2019t take the case to the Supreme Court. He concluded it was best to settle rather than go to jail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-8\"><em>P. L. </em>Mynatt:\u2014As attorney in this matter, I had a <em>sub \u25a0 foena duces tecum </em>served on Judge Hopkins to bring into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>court a paper which was reported to me to be a settlement. In answer, he appeared in court, and had the paper, which he declined to produce, saying it was left in his hands by Edwards, his client. Judge Clark required him to produce it in court, and it was introduced for Powers on the trial of this case. It was a settlement between Francis and Dodd and Colonel Ball, and it was written by Judge McOay, who was Ball\u2019s counsel. I was representing the assignees, and they had a claim against Ball and one against Powers, and were trying to make a settlement, but I did not see it until it was brought into court under this subpeena. \u2022 I was absent at the time of the settlement. As I remember, it was a settlement, either wholly or in part, between Ball and the assignees. I cannot say it included these notes, but my recollection is, it gave the assignees the right to collect them. The paper produced by Judge Hopkins was not copied in the record when this case went to the Supreme Court. I discovered this, I think, in the argument there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-5\"><em>A. J. West, </em>recalled:\u2014The indebtedness by West, Edwards &amp; Co. to Ball, for which these notes of Powers were given, was $28,500.00. I never saw the notes of Powers any more after they were given Ball.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-6\">Our firm had owed Ball $28,000.00 from eight to twelve months. The other $500.00 was gotten, I think, some time in the fall. We didn\u2019t pay all the . debt with this $10,-000.00 of Powers\u2019s acceptances; we gave others. We may have given another acceptance of Powers for $4,500.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-7\">I did not hear the conversation between Ball and Edwards at the time of the transfer of these notes sued on. Edwards came to me and said he wanted to settle with Col. Ball; that he was going to Savannah, and preferred to settle that day, and said, here are the Powers notes and others, amounting to our indebtedness and interest, and he said that he was going to give them to Col. Ball; and Ball said he preferred to receive them from my hands, and I handed them to him. There was no reason given for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>preference. This was Sunday morning about ten o\u2019clock, Knew Edwards\u2019s character.

He has as much as $12,000.00 in money of the proceeds.

Said collaterals were received from Ball during the latter part of the months of October and November, 1875. On Sunday, November 28th, 1875, the drafts and notes of Powers for $5,000 each, for sixty and ninety days, and others, were tendered by A. J. West to J. M. Ball in payment of the borrowed money. After talking over the matter, Ball was undecided about receiving the same, and requested a delay of a few days to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>termine the matter, as he was more inclined <em>to take them </em>as collateral security, substituted for the others then in our hands, and I granted the time requested. During this conference, Mr. West was occupying a desk at some distance from us engaged in writing, and suddenly appeared at the desk where myself and Ball were talking, and where all the papers referred to were lying, and at that time took up his pen and made a move to cancel the notes of W\u00e9st, E. &amp; Oo. for the borrowed money, $28,500. Observing the same, I called him to stop, and told him that Ball had asked the privilege of delaying this matter for a few days. I then took all the notes and collaterals, including Powers\u2019s for $10,000, and enclosed them in an envelope, and marked Ball\u2019s name on it, and placed it in a private drawer in a desk in the office of W,, E. &amp;. Co. After a few days, I took the package and handed it to Ball, with the understanding that the drafts of Powers and others should be received by him as collateral security substituted in the place of the collaterals withdrawn. This delivery was made Monday, December 6th, 1875, W., E. &amp; Oo. having faMed on Saturday, December 4. No part of this borrowed money had been paid up to that time. I did tell Powers' that Ball had settled with the assignees, and he made a fair and honorable settlement with them, and the same can be substantiated by the honorable judge of your present court, Mr. George Hillyer, John L. Hopkins and Judge McCay ; and after they had made this settlement, the assignees falsified their words and refused to have the same confirmed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-5\"><em>Green T.

Francis, my associate, has been dead about six months.. I had charge of all the books of the firm. I sold them to a' paper man for about four dollars. Have' not heard of them since. I think \u2022 I signed the papers seeking permission of the bankrupt court to settle with Powers and with Ball (ex: hibited to him). The settlements were not carried out. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Judge Erskine refused to let us make them. My recollection is, without making a settlement with Powers, we could not settle with Ball, and without settling with Ball, we could not settle with Powers. I signed the affidavit to the bill against Powers, in Fulton superior court. Think the other signature is that of Francis. The bill of particulars attached came from the books of the concern. The statement in the bill that Powers admitted having $12,000.00 in money from the proceeds of the goods, etc., is, I think, the truth, to the best of my recollection. He didn\u2019t want to pay the bills twice. Whatever he paid us he wanted to be relieved from paying Ball.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\">We had a claim against Ball for a large amount; perhaps $25,000 or $30,000, that he was indebted to W., E- <em>&amp; </em>Co. by reason of his taking their goods and notes and collaterals, and insisted on its payment. We were insisting on payment from Ball at the same time that we were insisting on payment from Powers. I think we sued Ball in the city court in two suits. We were negotiating for a settlement with both at the same time. I think there was a settlement signed up with Ball at one time, after this last case with Hubbard. My recollection is that Ball was allowed to prove some $2,000 or $5,000; and he came in and got credit for it. Judge Hopkins represented him in some way, and I think in that settlement is where he was allowed to come in and prove his claim. I can\u2019t say exactly whether this was after we got the $10,000 from Powers. We took the goods Hubbard held and sold them, and got altogether, in cash and goods, some $10,000 or $11,000 from Powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-6\">\u25a0 ' Powers never asked me for that money to be paid over to'him, or insisted that we had his money.

Pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ers did not pay xis the $12,000 and the goods' besides. Our estimate was'that we got $3,500 or $4,000 in goods. The books showing th\u00e9 sales went with the other books. I can\u2019t state' what the order of J udge Underwood was under Avhich Powers was about to go to jail, whether it was for him to produce all his books, and whether he declined. I can\u2019t tell whether he made the settlement the day he was called on to make the showing or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">The settlement with Ball I testified to as being made had reference, I believe, to the rolling-mill store.

That is what he told me,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-7\">(10.) Because the court erred in the following charge: \u201c If you belieye from the evidence that the plaintiff, Ball, told the defendant, Powers, or had communicated to him through another person, that he had settled with the assignees of W., E. &amp; Co., and had transferred the papers sued on in this case to them, and that he, Powers, would now have to settle with the assignees; and if he did thereupon settle with the assignees and paid them in money or goods, or both, an amount equal in value to the amount then due on these acceptances, and that he did this on the faith of this statement of Ball\u2019s to him, then Ball could not recover against him in this action, and you would find for the defendant on that plea; and this would be true, whether Ball had in point of fact made such a settlement with the assignees or not.\u201d\u2014Said charge being erroneous; (1.) Because there is no evidence on which to base it. (2.) Because it fails to present the view urged by plaintiffs that there was other indebtedness sought to be collected by said assignees from said Powers, largely in excess of the amount due on the acceptances in question, either partially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>or wholly, to make the settlement with the assignees, put in evidence by him. (3.) Because said charge should have been qualified, so as to state that the defendant would not be entirely relieved unless he paid an amount equal in value to said acceptances, entirely on the faith of the statement of Ball to him. (4.) Because this charge is contrary to law, in that defendant could only set up by way of defense, based on said alleged statement and settlement, such damage as he had sustained by reason of such statement. (5.) Because said charge is otherwise illegal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">(11.) Because the court erred in the following charge: \u201c But if Ball did not make such a statement to him, or if he did, if Powers was not thereby induced to make the settlement with the assignees, but was influenced entirely by other considerations, then, if such settlement had not in point of fact been made between Ball and the assignees, Ball would not thereby be deprived of his right to recover on the acceptances sued on.\u201d\u2014Said charge being erroneous because: (1.) Even if Powers was not entirely influenced by other considerations to make the alleged settlement, yet the effect of such other considerations might be to, at least partially, reduce the amount plaintiff would be entitled to recover: the true rule being that only to the extent defendant was damaged by the alleged statement of Ball could such statement be available as a defence. (2.) In that such charge is otherwise illegal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">(12.) Because the court erred in the following charge: \u201c If Ball did make such a statement, but was mistaken about it, or it was not in point of fact true, and Powers, on the faith of it, as already explained, paid money or goods, or both, to the assignees, of less value than the amount then due to these acceptances, then you could only find for the plaintiff the difference between the amount then due on the acceptances, and the money and goods paid to the assignees in the settlement.\u201d\u2014Said charge being erroneous because: (1.) To have the effect stated, the alleged payment must have been made entirely on the faith of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>'alleged statement, and not influenced partly or wholly by other considerations, the true rule of law being as stated in ground 11th above. (2.) There was no evidence on which to' base said charge. (3.)

The papers show from their date that they were made on a working-day, to-wit, on Saturday. There is undoubtedly testimony to the effect that there was a conversation between West, Edwards <em>&amp; </em>Co. and Ball on Sunday as to the transfer of these papers. The evidence fails to show either that Ball was present at their execution, or that he knew they were executed on Sunday, or that they were assigned to him, and that he became their.owner on that day. Defendant\u2019s own witness, A. J. West, while he shows that there were some negotiations in reference to the matter on Sunday, does.not leave it at all doubtful that the. transfer was not.consummated on that day, but thqit its comnletion was postponed to another and a later day. The law governing this question was settled, when this case was formerly before this court, and is conclusive as to any question which may now be presented on that particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>subject. 62 <em>Ga., </em>757. It was then held that, if the paper was accepted and delivered on Sunday, it was void between the parties, but if it was falsely dated as of another day and came to the hands of an innocent holder, who took it for value, without notice, in the due course of trade, the acceptor was estopped from setting up that defence in a suit against him by such holder. It was further held that, if Ball\u2019s contract of purchase whs on Sunday, then it was notin the due course of trade, and he would not be protected. The evidence fails to show, as we think, the -two facts which render this defence to the suit available. As before remarked, the drafts and acceptances do not show on their face that they were made on Sunday, but on a different day, nor does it appear that Ball had any notice that they were falsely dated, or that he became the holder of them in virtue of any contract that was consummated on Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The 4th ground of the motion for a new trial sets forth a portion of the charge given on this subject, and as far as that goes, it&gt; is literally correct and in strict accordance with what was ruled when the case was here before.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The charge contained in the 5th ground of the motion, and to which the plaintiffs except, while substantially correct, would have been more accurate if, after instructing the jury that if the transfer of the papers sued on was not finally completed on the Sabbath day, but was after-wards consummated on another day, then it would, for all purposes, be valid, and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, had the latter clause thereof been omitted, namely, \u201c unless some other good defence is established by the evidence, under the law, as the court will explain.\u201d Coming, as it did, immediately after the instructions embodied in the 4th ground of the motion, We do not think it sufficiently explicit or guarded in its terfns. The jury might have been led to infer that there was another defence in the case which would justify them in finding against, fhe <em>Inna fide </em>holder of paper transferred in the fair and usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>course of trade for value, and without notice of any infirmity or illegality in its consideration; that such an application of the charge was outside of the intention of the court we are well aware, but we cannot be satisfied that the jury were equally well apprised of that fact. Reference to cases cited on the brief of counsel will establish the principle Fere announced, and need not be repeated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> On the other main question made by the record, we are of opinion that the defendant utterly failed to show that he either paid West, Edwards &amp; Co., or their assignees in bankruptcy, or Ball, for the goods purchased, and for which the acceptances sued on were made. On the contrary, the evidence shows that the acceptor has not settled for such goods, but that he still owes for a large balance of the same, an amount probably enough to cover the entire indebtedness of which they are the evidence. It is clear that he purchased goods from West, Edwards &amp; Go., and that those purchases amounted, in the aggregate, to some $24,000.00; that he paid neither West, Edwards &amp; Co. nor Ball any part of that sum, and that, by an arrangement with the assignees in bankruptcy, he turned over to them of that amount some twelve thousand dollars in goods and money. It also appears that the assignees, under the order of court, had a settlement with Ball for the effects traced into his hands, including these papers; that in that settlement Ball was allowed to retain these papers, and, upon accounting for other effects that had come into his hands to which the assignees were entitled, he was discharged from all suits seeking to render him liable on account of his dealings with the bankrupts. In that settlement, it was further provided that Ball might retain \u201c any collaterals he may have uncollected, until he collects his full unsettled balance \u201d due from the bankrupts to him, after satisfying claims that he proved against them in the bankrupt court, and that these papers sued on were among the collaterals then in his hands, and a suit, was tl en pend* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ing against the acceptor in favor of Ball for their collection. It was a conceded point that Ball could not settle with the assignees unless Powers, the acceptor, also settled with-them, nor could he make the settlement unless Ball likewise settled with them. It is not denied that he was cognizant of all that'transpired in relation to this settlement between the assignees and Ball, and it does not appear that he ever objected or set up any opposition to it until long after it was consummated, or that he ever claimed the right to retain possession of the balance of the goods, or the proceeds arising therefrom in his hands, without accounting to Ball for them until some time after this whole controversy was wound up, and the rights of the parties to it finally adjusted and established. When this arrangement was completed, the jurisdiction of the bankrupt court over the subject was at an end, and the parties in relation to the paper occupied the same' position as they would have done had it never been administered or disposed of in that court. Sargent <em>et al. vs. </em>Helton <em>et </em>al., and Traer <em>et al. vs. </em>Clews, recently decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, 115 U. S. Rep., pp. 848 and 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">If the jury found that Ball was a <em>bona fide </em>holder of these acceptances, then this law should-have been given them in charge as applicable to these particular issues, instead of the charge given, which is set forth and excepted to in the 10th, 11th and 12th grounds of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial. It is perfectly immaterial what was the motive of the defendant for making this arrangement for a settlement of the bankruptcy matters with, that court, or what induced him to submit to the judgment, then rendered, unless he was misled by the fraudulent representations or practices of a party thereby benefited, or\u2019 unless he was so situated that by the exercise of diligence-he. could not have obtained accurate knowledge of the facts which, in its absence, influenced him to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> Testimony to the effect that Ball was the uncle of Shelton Edwards may have been competent to show fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>in the dealings between Ball and the firm of which he was a member, so far as that fraud, if any was alleged and' set up- and existed, affected the rights of defendant in the dealings between himself, Ball and that firm. Relationship is, undter such circumstances, a badge of fraud; but under the pleadings, it is extremely doubtful, to say the least, whether any issue was presented to which such testimony was pertinent. That dou'bt may have rendered it competent, and the plaintiffs take nothing by the 6th ground of the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> So of the 8th ground of the m-otton for a new trial. The admission of the witness, re-introduced, after both sides had closed their case, and after some argument and the intervention of a night, was a matter within the discretion of the court, which we cannot undertake to control, unless it was manifestly shown that the party objecting suffered seriousd'etriment therefrom. \"\u2022 .</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\"><bracketnum>5.</bracketnum> In view of the serious attack that had been made upon the character and credibilify of the witness, Edwards, and of the further fact that the plaintiffs denied that Ball ,-liad been settled with and received a transfer of the paper on Sunday, we think the evidence ruled.out by the court, and which ruling is complained of in the 9th ground of the motion for new trial, that Edwards went to Savannah on' that day for the purpose of making arrangements to settle with Ball the indebtedness of West, Edwards <em>&amp; </em>Company to him, and to enable that firm to procure assistance from him, by which they could carry on their business, should have been admitted, not only because it had a tendency to corroborate Edwards\u2019s testimony, but also had a bearing upon One of the main questions in the case, to-wit, as to the day on- which Ball became th^ owner of the acceptances.. \u2022\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">' This disposes of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of exceptions, and leads to the conclusion that they should have had a new trial, not only because of the above errors in the charges and rulings of the court, but because of the want of evidence to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>port the finding, at least as to the two main grounds of the defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><bracketnum>6.</bracketnum> This brings us to the defendant\u2019s bills of exception <em>pendente lite </em>and cross-bill, in which the only errors alleged', not already anticipated and ruled upon in what has been said on the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of exceptions, are, first, in ruling out certain depositions bf Jas. M. Ball, which were offered with a view to show that he had refused to answer interrogatories propounded to obtain information as to his actions on Sunday in reference to the papers sued on, and other questions in relation to the bankruptcy of West, Edwards &amp; Company, and his dealings with them immediately preceding it. Secondly, the exclusion of Powers\u2019s testimony, on the ground that Ball, the other party to the transactions inquired about, was then dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\"><bracketnum>7.</bracketnum> We think there was no error in refusing to permit Powers to testify. Questions raised by this assignment are well settled by the repeated rulings of this court, all of Which were fully reviewed in <em>Flournoy &amp; Epping vs. Wooten, ex'r, </em>71 <em>Ga. </em>Rep., 168. With the conclusion reached in that case we are fully satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\"><bracketnum>8.</bracketnum> The pursuit of one\u2019s ordinary avocations on Sunday is an indictable offense, as was held when this case was here before, and we know of no r\u00fcle that will subject a party to injury for availing himself of the privilege of refusing to answer questions which may have a tendency to either criminate or subject him to penalties. A party is Hot bound to accuse himself either directly or indirectly. This principle is as old as <em>Magna Uharta </em>and is embodied in all our constitutions, both state and federal. Of what worth would the protection be if a party availing himself of it incurred detriment or loss by so doing. See authorities cited on brief of counsel for plaintiffs in error, as well as those cited by the defendant in error, and in addition <em>Higdon et al. vs. Heard, </em>14 <em>Ga., </em>255, 258 ; <em>Gravett vs. State, </em>74 <em>Id., </em>191.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The other depositions relating to bankruptcy were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>irrelevant to any issues made by the pleadings as they stood; and although the evidence might have been competent in a case where the date of the dealings with bankrupts was material, yet there was no question in this case as to that date. That fact was admitted. The rejection of the evidence, even if admissible under any -circumstances, worked no hurt to the defendant. There is nothing in these bills of exception to require or authorize a reversal of the j udgment rendered on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">On the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of exceptions we order the judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
