But the acceptance would pass the title; and that, as the draft had never been accepted,' the plaintiff still claimed title to the flour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\">- -B. Dub swore that the flour was bought on 45 days\u2019 credit. The plaintiff generally sent out a note with the bill of lading. \u201c I never signed the note until after examining the flour. I did not examine this flour. In two or three days after the arrival of the flour, I made an assignment to J. 0.

The flour had been ordered by brokers for Dub &amp; Company, .with this direction, \u201c Ship, as soon as you can, 45 days\u2019 draft, B. Dub <em>&amp; </em>Company,\u201d the flour in question. Dub &amp; Company assigned it to Mathewson, as their assignee, without returning the draft signed, it being sent with the bill of lading and an invoice stating the terms as 45 days\u2019 acceptance. On law and facts, the case was referred to the judge, who held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, and this court concurs with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The assignee took only the assignors\u2019 title. The assignors, Dub <em>&amp; </em>Company, had no title until the terms were fulfilled, which, through their agents, the brokers, they had made. Upon the signing and return of the draft, the sale was consummated and the title passed, and not before.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Benjamin on Sales, Corbin\u2019s Ed., 1884, page-343, citing 15 Gray, 229; 123 Mass., 143; 126 <em>hi, </em>482 and other cases.

What a fraud on honesty it would be to allow such a transaction as this! To pass title before the goods were paid for by draft accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ing to contract, and thus enable the purchaser, in the teeth of his own contract, to assign property not his to pay his debts, would be to shock the moral sense of all men and shake all confidence in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
