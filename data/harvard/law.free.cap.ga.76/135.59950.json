The most material questions respecting the legal sufficiency of the assignment, as to the omission from the schedule required by the act of 1881 of valuable assets, and as to the effect of a general clause, conveying to the assignee all property of the assignor, which for any cause was omitted from the schedule, are identical with those made in the case of <em>Turnipseed et al. vs. Schaefer et al., </em>and to that extent are controlled by the decision therein rendered.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b159-7\">2. Whether or not, under the general mercantile and commercial law, an insolvent corporation is capable of making a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, either with or without giving preference and priority of payment to certain of them, yet under the provisions of the act of 1881, it may do so.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b159-8\">3. While in March, 1885, the general rule was that creditors without a lien could not invoke the remedial aid of a court of equity until their claims were reduced to judgment, yet special circumstances might exist rendering the rule inapplicable, and some of these circumstances exist in this case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b159-9\">(a.) The fact of provision being made to carry on the business by the aid of goods procured for that purpose, and which have not been paid for, raises a presumption, though not a conclusive one, of an intention on the part of the parties to the transaction to delay, hinder and defraud such creditors as were not favored and preferred by the deed, and it has the appearance of an arrangement to coerce them into an advantageous settlement.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b159-10\">(6.) The complainants were not parties to the mortgages, and would have no right at law to intervene and prevent their foreclosure and enforcement; and the setting aside of the assignment would leave the creditors without remedy to enforce their rights and contest the mortgages alleged to have been made in aid of the assignment, unless equitable relief were granted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b159-11\"><em>(c.) </em>An injunction should be granted and \u00e1 receiver appointed.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b159-12\">May 1, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-13\">Debtor and Creditor.

Spiro, secretary and treasurer, and these officer's, except DeGive, continued unchanged up to the time said corporation failed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Said Haiman had previously owned and operated the works merged into this corporation, and at said meeting of May 30th, said directors agreed to receive from said Haiman his said works at the price of $150,000, and to assume all of his liabilities; to pay him $35,000 in cash and to issue to him $115,000 in stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">On June 2d, 1882, the directors met and accepted Haiman\u2019s conveyance, and issued to him $115,000 of stock, and issued to the rest of themselves the $35,000 as above shown. They ostensibly paid Haiman this $35,000 in cash, but in fact no money or thing of value passed, or was paid into said corporation by said stockholders on any of these subscriptions, and the whole transaction, as to the cash, was simply colorable. The property so received was not worth over $120,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">Haiman\u2019s liabilities were then out of all proportion to the property and business conveyed to the corporation.

His \u201cquick\u201d assets were not over $99,000, and by this transaction these parties were simply aiding Haiman to avert an impending crisis, and said $150,000 was not <em>Iona fide </em>paid up. $29,919.97 of the assets so conveyed by Haiman were composed of his patents and the good will of his then embarrassed business. The patents were not worth over $5,000; the goodwill was worth nothing. It was not such an asset as could be received in payment of a stock subscription. The whole transaction was fraudulent; was done to relieve Haiman of his individual debts and all of the subscribers from paying in their stock subscriptions, and was calculated to mislead and deceive those with whom they should deal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-7\">Said stockholders and directors are each liable for the $30,000 discrepancy in said stock subscription, and the same is assets of the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-8\">The result of this was that the corporation was always in straitened circumstances, and needed working capital. In December, 1883, it was compelled to bond its fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>assets for $60,000 by mortgage of date January 1st, 1884, to said Hill and Romare, trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">The first year the business earned an ostensible profit'of $10,562.85.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">The second fiscal year, ending April 30, 1884, eleven months only, involved a loss of $4,414.78.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-7\">This reduced the ostensible profit to $5,918.07.

It alleged that Haiman, in 1876, began the plow business in Atlanta, and from that time up to the end of the fiscal year ending 30th May, 1882, made profits aggregating over $150,000.00. At this time, he greatly enlarged and improved his plant uby the erection of buildings and the purchase of machinery,\u201d the expense of which exceeded his expectations, leaving him without sufficient capital to utilize his business to its fullest extent. \u00a3\u00a3 Thereupon he conceived the idea of organizing a corporation with a stock first equal to the net value of his assets, but with the privilege of increasing the stock, his plan being to pay for the first stock with his assets, but to distribute a portion of it around among suitable persons who, when convinced of the merit of the enterprise, would join him in disposing of additional stock, the money to be derived from the sale of this additional stock to be used for the purpose of filling the buildings with machinery to their full capacity, and for the purpose of providing a cash capital with which to operate the buildings and machinery to their fullest extent. He selected a number of gentlemen of standing in the community, such as Jno. Fitten, Donald Bain, Chas. Beermann, L. DeGive and others, but Chas. Beermann and L.

No crisis was impending, and business was profitable- The assets conveyed by Haiman amounted to $252,496.17. (These are itemized in the answer.)

The patents, estimated from profits derived by Haiman from their use, were worth $35,000.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-7\">It denied the liability of the stockholders and directors for any alleged discrepancy in the value of the property received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-8\">It denied that the profit on hand 30th April, 1884, was reduced by 9th June, 1884, but alleged it was increased from $1,500.00 to $2,000.00. It admitted the dividend of June 9th, 1884, but denied that the carrying of increase in value of realty was done to cover shortage and prevent the books showing an impairment. This was done 30th April, 1884. It denied any deterioration in the value of realty at that time, but averred an increase justifying the above. No money' was drawn on the dividend from the corporation, but the same was applied as a credit on-the accounts of Haiman and Landauer, which were overdrawn. These overdrafts were created by their salaries being too small for them to live on, and by their gratuitous assumption of certain accounts to the corporation, for sales by Haiman, which had proved uncollectible, and by the assumption of $1.130.00 commissions for negotiating the company\u2019s bonds. Another item in the overdraft is this: On the 22d September, 1884, \u201c Haiman and Landauer negotiated the purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>of certain mines in Mexico for certain parties here in Atlanta. (Haiman and Landauer were interested in said purchase to the amount just mentioned,\u2014Haiman $476.00, Landauer $272.00.)

He wished to save from destruction one of the finest industries in the south, if possible. He wished also to save, by judicious and wise management, some remnant of the property of the company, after the payment of all its debts, for the stockholders.\u201d He realized that through his standing With the banks of the city of Atlanta, who held $23,500 of the company\u2019s bonds, he could delay precipitate action on their part, and could control other creditors residing in the city, and was confident that, with the help of the book-keeper and other employ\u00e9s, he could conduct the business. On March 13th, 1885, he took possession of all the assets of the company of every sort, and has remained in possession ever .since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-7\">On the first day of his administration, the book-keeper notified him that the debts of Deer, Mansur &amp; Oo. .and L. A. Gray \u201c were not specifically described in the schedule,\u201d though on the books of the company. Defendant has since collected the latter. \u201c On the third day of his administration, Mr. Haiman, the president of the company, called his attention to the fact that he was in possession, as assignee, of one mule and dray, one buggy and harness, and. of one bundle of natents in the drawer of the safe, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>these items were not specifically described in. the schedule.\u201d About the same time, Haiman notified him of the. consignment account. Defendant has been using. this property and the patents, and collecting on the accounts. Defendant has been running the business as assignee and receiver. From March 13th to April 20th, he has sold $24,513.69 of goods, \u201c and yet the stock assigned to this defendant is so large that, to the casual observer, it does not see that it is diminished.\u201d Defendant denied knowledge of the condition of the company, or of large purchases by it before the assignment, but believed the business prosperous. He denied that he refused to show the books; stated that he instructed the book-keeper to refer all inquiries to his attorney, Henry Jackson. Since his receivership, he has shown the books to all inquirers; before that, he referred them to his counsel, but don\u2019t remember that any inquiry was made. He denied that he was acting under Haiman\u2019s advice or direction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-5\">While he has had no large experience as a manufacturer of iron, \u201c that a long experience in successful, business-life enables him to satisfactorily discharge all the duties incumbent upon him.\u201d He admitted that he was a foreigner and the Belgian consul at Atlanta, Georgia. The assignment was withheld from record until the 7th day after its execution, under the advice of defendant\u2019s counsel, with whom it was left, and said attorney was to show said paper, except the list of creditors and debtors, to attorneys representing creditors; said attorney stated he would use discretion as to exhibiting the same, so as to prevent precipitate action until the. largest creditors could examine for themselves, and denies that he withheld it for any other purpose. He denies that the company.was insolvent when it assigned, and asserts it is solvent and will pay dollar for. dollar, if properly managed; asserts the right of a corporation, under the laws of Georgia, to prefer, and says that, subject to the preferences made, the assets .are a trust fund to pay debts. Admits that the mortgages were made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>preferred creditors. Denies that the mortgages and assignment are void, as not describing debts preferred. Denies that the schedule was incomplete. Sets up that it is impossible to describe assets minutely in an assignment of this sort. Denies that the company owned any interest in the Southern Cotton Tie Works. Mule and dray were turned over to the assignee under the deed, and are in his possession. He denies that the works had been \u201c stocking up \u201d preparatory to assigning and preferring favorite creditors, and denies knowledge of purchases. He ceased to be a stockholder or director on November 10th, 1884. Since then had not been at the works or consulted the officers until just before assignment, and knew nothing of its financial condition. It is true defendant is not an expert in manufacturing iron, is a creditor by mortgage, and desires the preferred creditors paid, but denies that he refuses to show the books and assignment, or to give information to creditors. Says he is honest, has large business experience, and can carry on the business with assistance and proper employ\u00e9s. He has the confidence of all the moneyed institutions of this community, and of the people thereof, and thus situated, can certainly make the assets yield as much as, if not more than, any other person. Has resided in Atlanta twenty-five years. He is solvent, and much interested, under the charges in the bill, in making the assets pay the debts. Denies that mortgages or assignment were made in bad faith, or to hinder and delay creditors. Denies that the business was run at a loss for three or four months prior to assignment, but assertsit was run at a fair profit. This defendant is unable to perceive how the appointment of a receiver will prevent bills of costs and fees, and says same is a most expensive way of winding up estates. He admits that his subscription to the stock of The Southern Agricultural Works was substantially as stated by complainants, except that he gave his check on a.solvent bank to the. secretary and treasurer in payment thereof, who handed it to Haiman in part pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ment of the $35,0,00 due him. Defendant \u201c was abundantly able to make said check good, had he been called upon to do so.\u201d Haiman accepted same in payment, and afterwards returned the same to defendant, the facts being as follows: Haiman had come to Atlanta and organized the plow business; by reason of enlargement of his plant, and an underestimate of its cost, he found himself obliged to raise and invest more money, in order to utilize the same. Under the advice of friends, he determined to follow the usual plan and turn his works into a stock company, and by sale of stock raise the money. He sold his business and works to the company for its original stock as charged. Defendant says they were worth fully $150,000; that patents and good will were valuable, and were assessed too low. Haiman came to defendant and asked him to take stock in the company; he was impressed with theunterprise, but by reason of other investments unableNo do much. Haiman offered to \u201c carry him\u201d for any stock he Would take until he (DeGive) should determine whether or not he would invest permanently therein. Under these circumstances, he subscribed $5,000, gave his check as aforesaid, and the same was returned to him by Haiman, as aforesaid, under this arrangement. Defen'dant thinks Mr. Beermanii subscribed in the same way. The other subscribers were the parties who expected to actively run the business and owned it all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\">Landauer is Haiman\u2019s brother-in-law, Keller his nephew, and Spiro is Landauer\u2019s nephew. Within thirty days, he transferred to Haiman $4,000^ of this stock, leaving the defendant the owner of $1,000\". Denies entering into any combination with Haiman, or any one else, to relieve Haiman from paying debts, or to relieve himself, TIaiman or other subscribers from payihg for stock, or to avert a crisis. He denies all liability as stockholder or director on any account, and denies undervalue of property turned in by Haiman, or the receipt by defendant of any dividend. The depression in the iron business began about the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>company was Organized, \u201c and from that time until the present has continued, reaching its lowest point shortly previous to the assignment.\u201d He admits that the company did not have sufficient cash to carry on the business, and therefore bonded itself for $60,000. \u201c The small amount of surplus capital in the city of Atlanta had a material influence in preventing thejsale of stock here,\u201d but it was thought that an 8 per cent, bond could be disposed of elsewhere. \u201c But the company failed even in this, and could only negotiate them to the amount of $36,500. It would thus seem that defendant\u2019s name, as a stockholder and director, had proved utterly useless to the company in enabling it either to sell its stock or its bonds.\u201d In April, 1884, $4,040.45 was added to the surplus fund for increase of realty m and other profits,\u201d .without reference to a contemplated dividend. On June 9th, 1884f a nine per cent, dividend was declared. Haiman and Landauer had overdrawn their accounts respectively $9,871.77 and $5,248.08-This should not have been done. This defendant protested and voted against the dividend, but it was claimed that they had large families and salaries were too low. They had no resources outside of business, and insisted the surplus justified it, and that it was best to declare a dividend, which would be paid by crediting their accounts. Defendant never received the dividend so declared. Only $117 was paid in money.

Eespondent alleges that he is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>most suitable person to make the assets available; that if continued in charge of the trust, his other business arrangements are such as to enable him to give his undivided attention and time to the discharge of the duties devolving upon him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">\u201c And having thus fully answered, this defendant submits the issues made, with perfect confidence, to the decision of the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\">Charles Beermann answered the bill, alleging, in brief, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-7\">In 1882, he learned from Haiman of the contemplated corporation that was to be organized on the basis of the net value of said Haiman\u2019s assets, \u201c with the privilege of an increase, after said organization, by the sale of stock to outsiders, the plan being to sell to outsiders to such an extent\u201d as was necessary to raise enough money to utilize Haiman\u2019s plant. He agreed to aid in the organization, and to that end subscribed $5,000 to the stock. Respondent believes Haiman\u2019s property was worth, net, the $150,000 at which it was received. Haiman agreed to \u201c carry\u201d respondent for his subscription until he could settle for it. He at once paid him a par), of the amount, and afterwards sold him the balance of said stock. He acted in good faith. .Haiman and Landauer\u2019s salaries were fixed at much less than they were worth. The increase in the value of realty, carried to the surplus account in'April, 1884, defendant knew nothing of until in June, 1884; but it was done <em>Iona fide, </em>and not in contemplation of a dividend. He never doubted the solvency of the company. On June 9th, 1884, the dividend was declared, instead of increasing salaries of Haiman and Landauer. These salaries were too small. These parties, otherwise frugal, were lavish with their immediate relatives, and defendant yielded to declaration of the dividend, believing they would be more frugal in spending dividends than salaries. Defendant did not hope for any early increase of capital by sale of stock, and was anxious to increase by saving profits. He drew no part of said dividend. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Denies abandoning business to Haiman and associates,States institution of suit and crippling thereby of credit, as answered by The Southern Agricultural Works, and it was deemed necessary to assign.

They adopted the answer of The Southern Agricultural Works. They denied fraudulent or negligent conduct. The assets received from Haiman were worth $150,-000 net. When the dividend was declared, it had been earned. For a long time defendants had been overtaxed, because capital was not sufficient to carry on business. Just prior to assignment, a suit against the company was filed, with the result stated in the company\u2019s answer, and they felt unable, under this pressure, to go on, and the assignment was made as the best thing for creditors and all concerned.

They sold to The Southern Agricultural Works on the faith of reports of mercantile agencies, showing its solvency, and on the belief that it Avas solvent. Two of them stated that they were influenced in selling by statements of the president,\u2014one in May, 1884, showing a surplus of assets over liabilities of $175,000, the other about September, 1884, showing works* $150,000, stock $80,000, accounts $35,000, debts $95,000, of which $36,500 were bonds secured on works and due at long time. One of these stated that Landauer, the vice-president, also stated that the works were' in a prosperous condition in May, 1884, and making money. The purchases made Avere in excess of the needs of the company, and they were not prepared with machinery to manufacture some of them. One witness stated that he found that they over-bought to defraud creditors. <em>A, </em>considerable amount of goods was shipped in February, and the bulk of the personalty was bought within sixty days before the assignment, when the company must have known that it was insolvent; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>some of complainants\u2019 goods were received at a time when it must have contemplated making the mortgages of March 11,1885; shipments being made between the last of January \u00e1nd the 20th of February. There was delivered to the company from the Western and Atlantic Railroad, on March 9, 1885, one car-load of slab steel, and on March 10, one car-load of bolts and one car-load of whiffletrees and bolts. Three witnesses stated that Haiman, the president of the company, told them that he made the assignment to avoid paying a note of $2,300 on which the company was sued; and a fourth stated that Haiman told him that this was one of the reasons for assigning. Several witnesses stated that a proposition for settlement was formulated on behalf of the unsecured creditors, looking to DeGive\u2019s displacement, but Haiman declined to accede to any proposition which would take the business from his (Haiman\u2019s) control and management, and said he would never consent to any receiver being appointed who would not let him manage the company, and that heffid not mean to be deprived of control of its affairs. One witness testified that Haiman said that if they did exclude him, he would start a rival business. He admitted that the values attached to the manufactured articles in the assignment were at selling prices, and did not deny that prices affixed to materials therein exceeded their cost. Several applications were made to DeGive to see the company\u2019s books and papers, but were refused, as well as any information, without consulting his attorney. One witness so stated; another said that DeGive refused to allow him to see the books; a third said that he applied to Haiman, who referred him to DeGive, who referred him to lpis attorney, and the latter said he did not have the books, and witness could not get the books until a receiver was appointed, . and under order of the court. One witness, a representative of one of the complainants, admitted that he 'had said that the business could only be wound up by a disinter- . ested receiver; and another admitted that he had said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the business ought to be run, so as to use up material on' hand; but both denied acquiescing in the control by DeGive. A Avitness, Avho examined the books of the company, stated that they shoAved the following, among other facts: A comparison of the ledger accounts receivable Avith the schedule filed in the office of the clerk of the superior court with the deed of assignment, shows that the following items have been omitted therefrom, representing amounts due the company:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-4\">Live and carriage stock..............................$ 320 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">M.

Beermann surrendered his remaining 10 shares to Haiman 26th May, 1884, and DeGive surrendered his remaining 10 shares to Beermann 10th October, 1884, though the stock was not transferred on the books \u2022then; Spiro transferred all of his stock but five shares to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Haiman, 9th April, 1884, arid owned only five shares when elected a director, in November, 1884. Haiman re-transferred 10 shares to Spiro 10th March, 1885.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">In round numbers, the purchases of merchandise were as follows: In 1882-3, $174,500; in 1883-4, $156,000 ; in 1884-5 (toMarch 12), $179,000. Purchases for four months preceding failure largely exceeded those in corresponding months in previous years, while sales were less. Valuation put on machinery at time of organization was $39,462.25 ; on March 12, 1885, it was $53,544.29. No allowances were credited for wear and tear, though charges were made for work done and material furnished for old and new machinery. Numerous articles in inventory are scheduled at prices without regular discount to trade off. If this were done, it would reduce prices in inventory about $20,000. All material worked up and ready for market, is inventoried at selling prices.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">. A number of affidavits as to value of the assets were introduced by complainants. The witnesses estimated the realty, including the buildings,at from $37,500 to $45,000; and two witnesses stated that the machinery would not sell for more than fifty per cent, of cost prices. The land was assessed for city taxes in 1884-5 at $15,000, and the whole taxable property was returned for state and county taxation at $60,000. Such property had depreciated by reason of the .financial crisis and the failure of similar enterprises in Atlanta.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">The affidavits on behalf of the defendants showed, in brief, as follows: \u25a0 It is not true that the company bought more than it had capacity to manufacture. The company delayed purchasing in 1884-5 because of unsettled market. The entire purchase of steel in 1884-5 was less than for previous seasons, and owing to its not coming in promptly, the company could not fill a considerable number of orders. The comparative statement of sales and purchases for corresponding months of 1882-3-4 is not correct. The purchases for 1882-3 were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>$149,203.19; in 1883-4, $148,844.74; in 1884-5, $143,-720.68. The purchases in November and December, 188.3, and January and February, 1884, were less than those in corresponding months in 1884-5, because of heavy purchases which were made in thte'spring dnd summer of 1888, and because stock was less at beginning of season of 1884-5 than in preceding years. The assignment was not made to avoid the suit against the company. Landauer testified that he told Bailey (a witness for complainants), and showed him by items, that merchandise in assignment schedule was estimated with discount off, plus freight, and manufactured goods at cost, with freight and labor added, and not at selling prices; that dividends were not paid according to stock held, but as stockholders wanted them paid; $1,500 worth of goods were stopped <em>in transitu </em>by one of complainants, and the company owes that much less than the account sued on. The assignment was not made to hinder or delay creditors; and the suit against the company did not cause the assignment, except as it may have affected the credit of the company. Spiro, the secretary and treasurer, denied that the assignee refused Caldwell (a witness for complainants) access to the books, but referred him to his (the assignee\u2019s) attorney; also stated that D. Keller owned more than ten shares of stock when elected director; that the machinery account shows only cost and additions to machinery, and $8,917.40 expended upon same has not been entered upon said account; that he failed to show Bailey annual statements, because he could not find them; that the merchandise account does not show all merchandise, because not balanced at time of assignment; that up to a few days before assignment, corporation could have bought unlimited stock convertible into cash; that it frequently cancelled accepted orders, and declined solicited ones; and that malleables must be ordered some two months before they are received; also that the resolution authorizing the making of mortgages and assignment was unanimously passed, and that he, Beermann and Keller acted as direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ors -with the full knowledge of the stockholders ; and all of the stockholders, within twenty-four hours after the execution of the mortgages and assignment, ratified them. The day after the assignment, the assignee employed Henry Jackson, Esq., as his attorney. Mr. Jackson advised that the assignment be left with him, and that all inquiries as to it or the books be referred to him, and that the deed be not recorded until the arrival-of the larger creditors, as attorneys might garnish debts in other states and persons might, by colored statements to creditors, precipitate litigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">\u2022 In the affidavit of Mr. Jackson' occur the following statements :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">\u201cDeponent stated he would exhibit to attorneys repre-. senting creditors the assignment, except the list of creditors and debtors, and would present the entire paper to the creditors when they arrived.\u201d Also that he gave the assignment freely to creditors for inspection, and furnish them with a private office; that he offered to have Haiman and h'is attorney and DeGive meet them; that the deponent does not recollect that any creditor, or representative of a creditor, asked him to let them see the books; that the books were not at his office; but had he been requested, he would have permitted the inspection of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-7\">Haiman made affidavit, in brief, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">The letter to Ridgely (referred to in affidavits for complainants) was written six weeks after deponent left home,, and did not pretend to be accurate.' He denies that the-purchases were made in bad faith, or in order to fail. He' denies that they lacked machinery to cut slab steel inte different shapes. He denies that he declined to have a receiver appointed because he wanted to control the business,; but says he did so because he thought the creditors\u2019 proposition unfair, and he had no right to consent to the appointment of a receiver. The creditors told him that, if he did not give security to pay 100 cents on the dollar, or pay <em>75 </em>.cents cash, they would litigate regardless of consequences; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>that assets ought to pay 100 cents easily. This took place in presence of Messrs. Bailey, Schuyler and others representing more than one-half of complainants. Deponent sought to give complainants all information, and they have distorted his statements; he denies that he ever said assignment was made to defeat claim of the Silver Mining Company. Did say that it had been partly the immediate cause thereof. Knows nothing of statements made to R. G. Dun. or any one else, and they are inaccurate. Also that on March 13, 18S5, he sent a circular to the creditors, informing them of the assignment and its terms; that the footings in the schedule attached to the assignment are with discounts off; that he handed Bailey (representing one of complainants) a circular and told him that merchandise and materials footed up about $120,000 ; that all of the directors were present at the meeting of March 11, and voted unanimously for the mortgages and assignment; and that they owned all the stock.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMl\">\u25a0 The book-keeper made affidavit that on the books entries were made showing assignment to DeGive at 9 a. m. on March 13,1885, and other entries were continued under him as assignee, and the assignee had managed the business ever since; that the amount of purchases cannot be made up, as done by the witness for the complainants, and the amounts stated by him were not correct; that he, as book-keeper, took off the amounts from ledger for the schedule of assignment; that an-account of Deer. Mansur &amp; Co., of St. Louis, Mo., $3,491.02, L. A. Gray, Waynesboro. Georgia, ,$18.65, were omitted by error, and not intentionally, and he had received no instructions as to putting in or leaving out said accounts. The consignment account, $6,113.25, was left out of schedule, as same was usually, and should have been included in inventory of stock. It was for machinery on consignment, and he thought those attending to the taking up of the inventory of stock would include said account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">DeGive made affidavit that as assignee and temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>receiver, he had to order divers goods stopped <em>in transitu </em>by sellers to Southern Agricultural Works in order to carry on business; that in regard to the language testified to by Mr. Caldwell in his affidavit, as used by deponent, as to his being appointed receiver, it isolates and thus misrepresents it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-5\">Other affidavits went to show that for tw'o or three days before the recording of the assignment, creditors had access to it and had copies of all except the lists of creditors and assets; that five or six days after the execution of the assignment, they paid a copyist to make copies of the list of third and fourth classes of creditors, and expressed themselves satisfied; and that during the time the assignment was being recorded, every facility was afforded for its examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-6\">A number of affidavits were introduced by defendants-on the subject of values of the property. They estimated the real estate as worth from $80 to $100 per front foot, the frontage being 513-J- feet, or, in bulk estimate, the land was valued at from $40,000 to $50,000; the buildings at from $50,000 to $64,060.75; and the machinery at from $52,000 to $61,809.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-7\">Upon the hearing, on the 23d May, 1885, the chancellor refused the injunction and receiver prayed for, but restrained DeGive, assignee, from paying out the money or disposing of the property until his judgment might be reviewed by the Supreme Court.

Here, as there, valuable assets, belonging to this alleged insolvent corporation, were left out of the schedule required to be annexed under the act of 1881 to the deed or instrument of assignment at the time it was executed, and here, as there, this deed contained a general clause, conveying to the assignee all property of the assignor, which for any cause was omitted from the schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> Notwithstanding, there are many cases to that effect, we cannot agree with counsel for the complainants, who argued the case with such learning and signal ability, that an insolvent corporation is incapable of making a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, either with or without provisions giving preferences and priority of payment to certain named creditors. The cases relied on go upon general principles of the mercantile and commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>law, and in the absence of statutory provisions like those contained in the act of 1881, under which this assignment is claimed to have been made, may possibly be correct, although there are others to the contrary, and especially the case of <em>McCallie </em>&amp; <em>Jones vs. Walton et al., </em>assignees, 37 <em>Ga., </em>613, in which Harris, J., broadly says, \u201c In Georgia no statute prevents an assignment by an existing corporation.\u201d The above cited act of our legislature in express terms gives the right by name to such corporations, and provides by whom and in what manner the schedules annexed to the assignment are to be sworn to. The briefs of counsel for both sides will furnish the authorities upon the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> Another question made and argued with much ability and force by the learned and indefatigable counsel for th\u00bf repondents is, that the complainants, who are creditors without any lien, have no right to invoke the remedial aid of a court of equity until their claims are reduced to judgment ; .and tha\u2019t such was generally the rule at the time this conveyance was executed is undeniably true; but that special circumstances may exist rendering the rule inapplicable is equally true, and wo find that some of those circumstances do exist in this case: such, for instance, as tho insolvency of the debtor, who, it is alleged, has fraudulently transferred his property to one who is in complicity with him in the fraud, and who is rapidly disposing of the property, or where the property is obtained by fraudulent representations with which the assignee is connected. <em>Cohen vs. Meyers, Cohen </em>&amp;c <em>Co. et al., </em>42 <em>Ga., </em>46; <em>Cohen &amp; Co. et al. vs. Morris &amp;c Co. et al., </em>70 <em>Ga., </em>313. And when to these circumstances is added the further fact that large supplies of goods were obtained with a view of making the very assignment in question, to enable the assignee to carry on the business of the party making the assignment for an indefinite period of time, and that these goods are embraced not only in the deed of assignment, but likewise in mortgages cotemporaneously executed to certain! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of the-creditors preferred by the conveyance, including the assignee himself, to aid, as charged, any defects existing therein which might .render it void, and thus prevent the accomplishment of the scheme entered into by the parties, we think a strong case is made for the interposition of equity by an injunction and the appointment of a receiver, whether the complainants' had reduced their demands to judgment or not. The fact of provision being made to carry on the business, by the aid of goods procured for that purpose, and which have not been paid for, raises a presumption, though, perhaps, not a conclusive one, of an intention on the part of the parties to the transaction to delay, hinder and defraud such creditors as are not favor\u00e9d and preferred by the deed. This looks like an arrangement to coerce them to a disadvantageous settlement and compel them to submit to such terms as their debtors may see proper to dictate. In support of these positions, see authorities cited in brief of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">But of what avail would it be to declare the assignment void, as we have done, for its want of conformity to law, if the parties holding these mortgages wer\u00e9 allowed to proceed to foreclose them at law, although it might turn out, upon a full hearing of the case, that they were made in aid of this void assignment and with a view to hinder and delay the creditors of the assignor and mortgagors '? The complainants are not parties to th\u00e9se mortgages, and would have no right to intervene to prevent their foreclosure and enforcement at law. Code, \u00a73965, and citations. So they would, in that event, be without any remedy to redress their wrongs and enforce their rights unless a court of equity should open its doors and invite them to enter. The- issues, formed by the facts, as they are presented at this preliminary hearing, must be submitted for determination by the court qu the final trial; and as the assignment has been declared void, and the property in dispute is to be preserved until it can be finally disposed of by a full decree, settling the rights and priorities of the parties as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>they existed at the time of exhibiting this bill, an injunction must issue and a receiver be appointed as prayed, or upon such other conditions as may appear to be equitable and proper under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
