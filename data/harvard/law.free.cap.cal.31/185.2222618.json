J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">This action was commenced in the District Court of the Twelfth Judicial District, in and for the City and County of San Francisco, in July, 1862, against the defendants, composing the firm of Redington &amp; Co., to restrain them from preparing and offering for sale and selling an article manufactured by them in imitation of an article alleged by the plaintiff to have been invented and composed by him, bearing the name of \u201cFish\u2019s Infallible Hair Restorative,\u201d and from preparing and offering for sale and selling any article bearing that name; and also to restrain them <em>from </em>counterfeiting and simulating his trade marks, etc. And further, the plaintiff sought to obtain a decree requiring the defendants to account for the profit by them realized from sales of the imitated or genuine article, and a judgment for damages on account of the wrongs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>an'd injuries which he alleged he had sustained by the infringement of his right by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The defendants appeared and answered, after which the cause was submitted to a referee, duly appointed, who heard the evidence and reported a judgment in defendants\u2019 favor. The plaintiff moved for a new trial, which being denied, he appealed from both the judgment and order overruling the motion for a new trial. The only question open to review arises upon the pleadings in the case, upon which the plaintiff moved for judgment at the opening of the trial, and upon which he has maintained throughout to be entitled to judgment. The pleadings were verified. The stating part of the complaint reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201c And plaintiff further shows that heretofore, to wit: in the year 1855, at said city and county, he, the plaintiff, invented, manufactured and made an article for the restoring and strengthening of the human hair, to be used upon the head and hair, and gave it the name by which it was and is known, of \u2018 Fish\u2019s Infallible Hair Restorative.\u2019 And plaintiff further shows that he is now, and for a long time has been, and at the time of and before the committing of the grievances hereinafter mentioned, was the manufacturer of said article, which he has for a long time offered for sale and sold in glass bottles labelled with his own proper labels, devices and trade marks, and in wrappers or circulars, all of which were composed, invented and adopted by this plaintiff for that purpose, specimens or copies of which labels, devices and trade marks and wrappers or circulars, are hereto annexed, and form part of this complaint marked Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 and Exhibit \u2018B\u2019\u2014the first being a copy of the .label and the second a copy of the wrapper or circular.

all of which will more fully appear by reference to the exhibits hereto annexed and hereinbefore referred to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u201c And plaintiff further shows that said imitations and counterfeits are calculated to deceive the purchasers and consumers of plaintiff\u2019s said article, and the public in general, and actually have misled, and do still mislead many of them to buy and purchase the articles offered for sale and sold by the defendants, in the belief that it is the article manufactured by this plaintiff, greatly to the diminution and damage of the business and profits of this plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u201c And the plaintiff further shows that the article so prepared and put up and sold by the defendants in imitation of the plaintiff\u2019s article is of a greatly inferior article, and that, by reason of the premises, the general esteem and reputation of the said article manufactured by the plaintiff has been injured greatly, to the diminution and damage of the business and profit of this plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">\u201c And plaintiff further shows that the defendants for a long time past have caused, and do still cause, an advertisement, a copy of which is hereto annexed and made part of this complaint, marked Exhibit \u2018E,\u2019 to be published in the \u2018 Daily Herald and Mirror,\u2019 and various other newspapers published in said City and County of San Francisco, and like advertisements in many other newspapers throughout the State of California ;

yet the defendants have heretofore refused, and do still refuse, so to do, but threaten to continue to do as they have heretofore done, and as they are hereinbefore alleged to have done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">\u201c And the plaintiff further shows that, by reason of the premises, he has been injured and sustained damage to the amount of ten thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\"><em>\u201c </em>And plaintiff further shows that he is without any adequate remedy at law for the grievances, wrongs, injuries and frauds so practiced upon him by the defendants as aforesaid, and is entirely remediless, without the equitable interposition of the Courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The defendants\u2019 answer reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">\u201c Now comes the said defendants, by-, their attorneys, and for'answer to the complaint in said case made say: They deny -that in the year 1855, or at any other time, at said city and county, or elsewhere, the plaintiff invented, manufac-tured and made an article for the restoring and strengthening of the human hair, to be used upon the head and hair, and gave it the name by which it was and is known, of \u2018 Fish\u2019s Infallible Hair Restorative.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">\u201c They deny that the .plaintiff is now, and for a long time has been, and at the time of and before the alleged. com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>mitting of the alleged grievance in the said complaint mentioned, was the manufacturer of said article, which he has for a long time offered for sale and sold, in glass bottles, labelled with his own proper labels, devices and trade marks, and in wrappers or circulars, all of which were composed, invented and adopted by the plaintiff for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201c They deny that the specimens or copies of said alleged labels, devices and trade marks, and wrappers or circulars, annexed to said complaint and marked respectively, \u2018 Exhibit A\u2019 and \u2018 Exhibit B,\u2019 are specimens or copies of plaintiff\u2019s labels, devices, trade marks, wrappers or circulars, or of any of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">\u201c They deny that, by reason of plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, and lopg experience, and great care, in his said business of manufacturing and making, and the good and useful quality of said article, the same became and was, at and before the time of the grievances in said complaint alleged, widely known in the community as a valuable and useful article, and acquired a high reputation as such, and commanded and still commands, as a valuable and useful article, an extensive sale at the said City and County of San Francisco and throughout the State of California, which is and for the last five years has been a source of great profit to the plaintiff. They deny that the said article is known to the public by plaintiff\u2019s own proper devices, trade marks, labels, and wrappers or circulars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">\u201c They deny that plaintiff had the long and quiet use and enjoyment of said name, devices, trade marks, labels, and wrappers or circulars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201c They deny that notwithstanding said alleged long and quiet use and enjoyment, defendants, well knowing the premises, but wilfully, wrongfully and unlawfully disregarding the rights of the plaintiff therein, thereafter, to wit: on or about the month of March, in the year 1860, wilfully, wrongfully, unlawfully and fraudulently prepared and offered for sale, and sold, and always since have, and do still and now offer for sale, and do sell at the said city and county and elsewhere throughout said State of California, an article in imitation of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>tiff\u2019s article, which, with intent to deceive and defraud the plaintiff, they have put up, or caused to be put up in similar packages, to wit, in glass bottles, labelled with nearly similar labels, devices and trade marks, and with nearly similar wrappers or circulars, copies of which are annexed to said complaint, and marked respectively, \u2018Exhibit C,\u2019 and \u2018Exhibit D;\u2019 and they deny that either \u2018 Exhibit G \u2019 or \u2018 Exhibit D \u2019 is spurious. They deny that said last mentioned and alleged nearly similar labels, devices, trade marks and labels, and wrappers or circulars are fraudulent, counterfeit and spurious imitations of the plaintiff\u2019s labels, devices, trade marks and wrappers or circulars, or of any of them, of are imitations, and or that the defendants have, and at all times when selling or preparing any of said alleged imitations of said article, have had full knowledge, and are and have been advised and informed that the said alleged imitated labels, devices, trade marks, and wrappers or circulars, are and have been pirated and simulated, and fraudulent counterfeits of the labels, devices, trade .marks, and wrajipers or circulars, invented, composed and adopted by plaintiff, as aforesaid, in said complaint alleged. And defendants say, that if any such advice or information was ever given them by anybody, that it is false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201c Defendants deny that said alleged imitations and counterfeits are calculated to deceive the purchasers and consumers of plaintiff\u2019s said article and the public in general, and actually have misled, and still do mislead, many of them to buy and purchase the article offered for sale and sold by the defendants, in the belief that it is the article manufactured by the plaintiff, greatly to the diminution and' damage of the business and profits of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201c And defendants deny that the article alleged to be so prepared, put up and sold by them, in imitation of the plaintiff\u2019s article, is of greatly inferior quality, and that by reason of the premises the general esteem and reputation of the said article manufactured by the plaintiff has been injured, greatly to the diminution and damage of the business and profits of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u201c They deny that they have for a long time past caused, and do still cause, an advertisement, a copy of which is annexed to said complaint, marked \u2018 Exhibit E,\u2019 to be published in the \u2018 Daily Herald and Mirror,\u2019 and various other newspapers published in said City and County of San Francisco, and like advertisements in many other newspapers throughout the State of California, or in any of them, all or any of which actings, doings, advertisements and publications are contrary to equity and greatly injure and damage said plaintiff. They admit that they have caused said \u2018 Exhibit E \u2019 to be published, and aver that, by reason of the matters and things hereinafter to be stated, they had a right so to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">\u201c They deny that they have shipped, and still do ship, large quantities of said imitation so alleged to be prepared and put up by them, to be carried and offered for sale and sold out of this State, to the great diminution and damage of the business and profits of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">\u201c Defendants deny that, although before the commencement of this action plaintiff repeatedly requested the defendants to desist from preparing, making, putting up, offering for sale and selling said alleged imitation, and from simulating, counterfeiting, and infringing the plaintiff\u2019s labels, devices, trade marks, wrappers or circulars, and from publishing or causing to be published in the newspapers of this State, or any of them, the advertisements in said complaint referred to, or any similar one, and from shipping any of said alleged imitations, and conveying and offering the same for sale, and selling the same out of this State; yet the defendants have hitherto refused, and still refuse, so to do, but threaten to continue to do as they have heretofore done, and as they are hereinbefore in said complaint alleged to have done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">\u201c And defendants deny that, by reason of the premises, plaintiff has been injured and sustained damage to the amount of $10,000 or to any other amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\"><em>\u201c </em>They deny that plaintiff is without any adequate remedy at law, for the grievances, wrongs, injuries and fraud practiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>upon plaintiff by defendants. And they say they have practiced no grievance, wrong, injury or fraud upon the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\"><em>\u201c </em>And for a further and separate answer defendants say that they have no interest in the article known as \u2018 Fish\u2019s Infallible Hair Resorative,\u2019 except as commission merchants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201c They further say, on information and belief, which information they believe to be true, and so charge the fact to be . that one N. Mills, heretofore, to wit, in the year 1857, at said city and county, composed, invented, created, made, established and adopted said labels, trade marks, devices, wrappers and circulars, and that they belonged to him, and that he had the right to use, or assign, or sell the same, and to make, use, or sell, or assign said \u2018 Fish\u2019s Infallible Hair Restorative.\u2019 And they aver that whatever connection they have had with said trade marks, labels, devices, wrappers, or circulars, or said \u2018 Fish\u2019s Infallible Hair Restorative,\u2019 has been under due and legal authority from, by, or under said Mills, and in no other way or manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">\u201c Wherefore they pray judgment in their favor and for costs of suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The material facts of the complaint stated conjunctively, except the allegation that by reason of the premises the plaintiff has been injured and sustained damage in the sum of ten thousand dollars, are undertaken to be answered by the defendants denying them as a whole, as conjunctively stated, as will be seen by placing any one aggregated statement of facts in the complaint in juxtaposition with the answer made thereto. This mode of answering is in violation of the principles of common law pleading, and not less so of the statute which provides that the defendants\u2019 answer to a verified complaint shall contain a specific denial <em>to each </em>allegation of the complaint controverted, or a denial thereof according to the defendant\u2019s information and belief. Those interested and who have any doubt on the subject will find the following authorities worthy of careful examination: <em>Blankman </em>v. <em>Vallejo, </em>15 Cal. 638; <em>Kuhland </em>v. <em>Sedgwick, </em>17 Cal. 123; <em>Caulfield </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Sanders, 17 Cal. 569; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Scott, 25 </em>Cal. 195; <em>Landers </em>v. <em>Bolton, </em>26 Cal. 417; <em>Busenius </em>v. <em>Coffee, </em>14 Cal. 91; <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Tartar, </em>14 Cal. 508; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>6 How. Pr. R. 159; <em>Salinger </em>v. <em>Luck, </em>7 How. Pr. R. 430; <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>16 How. Pr. R. 467; <em>Sherman </em>v. N. Y. <em>Central Mills, </em>1 Abbott, 187; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>16 Barb. 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">At the time the pleadings in this case were prepared and. filed, the sixty-fifth section of the Practice Act provided that every material allegation of the complaint not specifically controverted by the answer should, for the purposes of the action, be taken as true. As the pleadings stood, the trial should have been confined to the ascertainment of the damage which the plaintiff had sustained, if any, and to an accounting as prayed for by the plaintiff. And it would now seem to follow from the condition of the case upon the pleadings that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded to be tried again, provided the plaintiff may desire to insist upon a recovery of damages and for an accounting. But as the defendants supposed they had by their answer put at issue the material allegations of the complaint, and were sustained in their view of this question by the referee and also by the Court, we deem it proper in the exercise of our discretion, in order that substantial justice may be done between the parties, to suggest to the Court below to allow the defendants to amend their answer so as to put at issue the material facts of the complaint, if they can and may deem it proper to do so. We are of opinion, however, that this indulgence should be granted only upon terms that the defendants pay the costs of the reference and trial and all proceedings subsequent, as well as the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The judgment is hereby reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings, and a new trial if the answer is so amended as to require it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
