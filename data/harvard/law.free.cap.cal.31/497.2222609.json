It must be a certified copy of the judgment as entered in the minutes of the Court. What the judgment must be is prescribed in section four hundred and sixty-two. By that section, as we held in <em>Ex parte Ring, </em>28 Cal. 247, the judgment is required to state the offense of which the defendant has been convicted and the punishment imposed or adjudged by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The process under which the petitioner is held does not respond to the calls of the statute. It does not purport to be a certified copy of the judgment, if any, which was rendered against the defendant. On the contrary, it is a document addressed to the Sheriff of the County of Calaveras, and issued by the Clerk of the Court, in which a brief history of the action and the proceedings therein is given, compiled apparently by the Clerk from the records of the Court. Regarded as a final process, it is wholly unauthorized by the statute, and therefore has no -validity as such. The petitioner is entitled to be discharged, and I therefore concur in the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
