Neither Bliss nor O\u2019Connell were defendants in this action. The evidence further tended to show that Reese placed substantial fences around the premises after thus being placed in possession, and that after his death in May, 1863, plaintiff, as his executor, succeeded to his possession, and that neither Reese nor plaintiff had any house on the land, but their possession was such as they acquired by fencing and exercising control over the larid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence also tended to prove that the last of November, 1863, defendants Bliss and O\u2019Connell went on to the land, took possession, and erected a small cabin on it, and a small slaughter house for butchering, and removed a part of the fence, and that within a day or two thereafter, and on the 28th of November, the plaintiff and his attorney, and two or three others, went to the land to retake possession of it, and found Gough, an. employ\u00e9 of Bliss and O\u2019Connell, on the land, and that they asked Gough who had done it, and he replied he had done it all at the request of Bliss and O\u2019Connell ; and that plaintiff\u2019s attorney then told Gough that they had come to retake possession of the land and rebuild the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>fences, and would do so if not forcibly resisted; that they did not wish to get shot nor to shoot anybody, but would take possession and hold it if there was no danger of personal violence; and that Gough answered that Bliss and O\u2019Connell would resist any attempt on their part to retake possession, by force, and by every means in their power. It was then agreed between Gough, McMinn, and his attorney, that they would meet Bliss and O\u2019Connell at the office of Mr. Sharp the next day, to see what was to be done. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence further tended to show that the parties met at Mr. Sharp\u2019s office the next day, and McMinn\u2019s attorney stated to Bliss the previous conversation with Gough, and also told Bliss that if there was to be no forcible resistance they would retake possession and keep possession, and that they had come to meet him and learn what kind of opposition they might expect, as they wished to avoid personal violence; and that Bliss replied that he and O\u2019Connell intended to keep and maintain their possession of the premises by force, and at all hazards. The evidence did not tend to prove that any further attempt was made by plaintiff to get possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-6\">The Act of December 23d, 1863, referred to in the opinion of the Court, is entitled \u201c An Act providing for the transfer of cases, on the first day of January next, to the Courts established by the present Constitution.\u201d The second section of the Act contained the following clause : \u201cAnd in all appeals in said actions of forcible entry and detainer, now pending in or hereafter appealed to. said County Court, which shall on the first day of January next be pending and undetermined therein, the same shall be. heard, tried, and determined in all respects as if no appeal had been taken, and the same had been transferred under and in conformity with the provisions of this Act.\u201d- Under the old Constitution actions of forcible entry and. detainer were required to be commenced in Justices\u2019 Courts, but the amended Constitution which went into effect January 1st, 1864, gave the County Courts original jurisdiction in these actions. The former part of section two, not quoted, provided for the transfer of actions of forcible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>entry and detainer pending in-Justices\u2019 Courts on the first day of January, 1864, to the County Courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-6\">Mahoney, Gough, and several others were made defendants along with Bliss and O\u2019Connell, but plaintiff recovered judgment in the County Court against Bliss and O\u2019Connell only, and they appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-7\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-8\"><em>T. I. Bergin, </em>for Appellants, argued that the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act was penal as well as remedial, and that a mere unlawful entry was not sufficient to justify a conviction, but there must be a forcible entry with a strong hand, with unusual weapons, or with menace of life or limb; and cited <em>Janson </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>29 Cal. 214; and 4 Black. 148. He also argued that the repeal of the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act, which took effect January 1st, 1864, operated as a release and extinguishment of the cause of action, and left the Court no power to proceed and try the same; and cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Frisbie, </em>26 Cal. 139; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>The Justices of the City of London, </em>3 Burr, 1,456; <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>13 How. U. S., 429; and <em>Yeaton </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>5 Cranch, 281.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-9\"><em>E. W. F. Sloan, </em>for Respondent, argued that that part of the Transfer Act of December 23d, 1863, which related to forcible entries and detainers might be regarded as incorporated with and forming a saving clause in the Act repealing the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act, as both related to the same thing; and cited <em>Talbot </em>v. <em>Leeman, </em>1 Cranch, 35; <em>Church </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>3 Mass. 17. He also argued that in order to constitute forcible entry and detainer it was not necessary that violence against person or property should be resorted to, but that if the party dispossessed had reason to believe from anything said that he could not regain possession without forcible resistance, the action could be maintained ; and cited <em>Childress </em>v. <em>Black, </em>9 Yerger, 320; <em>Blumfield </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>4 Bibb, 388; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Van Nostrand, </em>9 Wend. 52.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b126-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>By the Court, Shafter, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">This is an action of forcible entry and detainer. The case passed from the Justice\u2019s Court to the County Court on appeal taken by defendants on the 31st of December, 1863. At the January term of the County Court, 1864, the defendants moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the statutes under which it was brought had been repealed. The motion was denied. The case was tried at the September term, 1864, and comes here on the appeal of the defendants from the judgment and the order overruling their motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The Act of April 27th, 1863, (Acts 1863, p. 655, Secs. 15, 16,) repealed all Acts previously passed relating to forcible entries and unlawful detainers, the repeal to take effect on the 1st day of January, 1864. The right of the plaintiff to the summary remedy of forcible entry and detainer, being of statute origin, would have terminated on the 1st day of January, 1864, had not the Legislature repealed the repealing clause, so far as pending cases were concerned, by the Transfer Act of December 23d, 3 863. (Acts 1863-4, p. 1.) This Act and the Act of April 27tb, 1863, both took effect at the same time\u2014January 1st, 1864\u2014and are clearly in <em>pari materia. </em>The provisions of the Transfer Act are, in our judgment, wholly irreconcilable with the idea that the Legislature conserved judicial, cognizance over the cases referred to for no other purpose than that they might be formally dismissed on motion. The provision is that the cases \u201c shall be tried and determined\u201d in the County Courts the same as though they had been brought there in the first instance.. So far, the case is with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The first count of the complaint charges \u201c a forcible entry with a multitude of people,\u201d and a \u201c forcible and unlawful detainer.\u201d In a complaint so framed, the forcible entry is the gist of the action, the averment of forcible detainer not being stated as an independent ground of relief, but as a mere continuation or consequence of the first act. <em>(Preston </em>v. <em>Kehoe, </em>15 Cal. 318; <em>Thompson </em>v. Smith, 28 Cal. 532.) There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>no evidence in the case tending to prove a forcible entry, that is, an entry with strong hand with unusual weapons, or with menace of life or limb. <em>(Polack </em>v. <em>McGrath, 25 </em>Cal. 58.) The second count charges an unlawful entry and forcible detainer, but there is no evidence in the record tending to prove a forcible detainer within the rule settled in the case last referred to. There was here no actual exhibition of force when the plaintiff\u2019s agent went to the land for the purpose of re-entering upon it, nor was there any evidence either of present ability or disposition to use it. The defendant Cough uttered no menace, but, in answer to a question, suggested what Bliss and O\u2019Connell would do if a re-entry should be attempted. The interview seems to have been conducted in an amicable spirit, and ended in a formal adjournment to the next day, and to a place three fourths of a mile from the lot in controversy, for the purpose of seeing Bliss and O\u2019Connell \u201cas to what was to be done.\u201d It appears that the parties met in pursuance of this adjournment, and that Bliss being interrogated upon the point, \u201c answered and said that he and O\u2019Connell intended to keep and maintain possession of the premises by force, and at all hazards.\u201d It appears that Loyd, at whose office this parley took place, \u201c then stepped forward and remarked that Bliss and O\u2019Connell intended to maintain their possession until they were put out by lawto which remark Bliss made no reply. This interview was by convention\u2014it was not on the land, but remote from it\u2014it was, apparently, diplomatic in conception, and the dialogue between'the parties seems to have been diplomatically conducted. Each party manoeuvred for a position. We consider the case of <em>Polack </em>v. <em>McGrath et al. </em>stronger on the facts than this.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Mr. Chief Justice Currey expressed no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
