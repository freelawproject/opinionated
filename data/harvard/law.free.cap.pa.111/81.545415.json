A purchaser of land from an assignee in bankruptcy, subject to a mortgage given by the bankrupt, takes, as respects the bankrupt, his equity of redemption and nothing more. If he afterwards purchases the mortgage and sells the land under a judgment recovered on the mortgage, and he himself becomes the purchaser, the wife\u2019s right of dower is divested by the sale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b95-13\">2. A mortgage does not necessarily merge or become extinct by being united in the same person with the fee. When a person becomes entitled to an estate subject to a charge for his own benefit, he may take the estate and keep up the charge. The question in such case is upon the intention, actual or presumed, of the persons in whom the estates are united.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b95-14\">3.

General relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-15\">The defendant admitted the allegations made in the first, second and third paragraphs of plaintiff\u2019s bill, but denied that the plaintiff was entitled to dower in said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-16\">The plaintiff then filed an amended bill, alleging:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-17\">1. On the 1st of October, 1874, James Bryar executed two mortgages on the seven acres of land mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s bill filed in this case, one to Thomas McClintock for the sum of $3,000, the other to Ed. R. James for the sum of $2,000. Both of these mortgages were recorded. The mortgage to Ed. R. James was foreclosed and judgment entered thereon the 12th day of April, 1878, for $2,355.81; the one to McClintock was foreclosed and judgment entered thereon the 12th day of April, 1878, for $3,533.75, in Court of Common Pleas, No. 1, of Allegheny county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-18\">2. The said James Brjmr was, on the 8th' of January, 1877, decreed and adjudged a bankrupt upon the petition of his creditors, in District Court of United States, Western District of Pennsylvania; and Robert Arthurs was, on the 8th day of February, 1877, chosen assignee of his estate by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>creditors, at a meeting called for that purpose ; and the register in bankruptcy, by virtue of the authority vested in him, by his deed of assignment bearing date the day of \u2022 , 1877, conveyed to said assignee the said seven acres <em>(inter alia) </em>as the property of said James Bryar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">3. Upon the petition of the said Robert'Arthurs, assignee, the said District Court of the United States did, on the 19th day of May, 1877, order and direct the sale of said seven acres divested of all, liens \u2014 and subsequently, did order and direct that the same should be sold, divested of all liens, or subject only to the first mortgages, amounting to about six thousand dollars, as the assignee might deem to the interest of said estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">4. After due and legal notice by advertisement, the said assignee, Robert Arthurs, did as directed by said court, expose the said before-described piece of laud with the buildings, and subject to the first mortgages, viz., the said two mortgages mentioned in paragraph first of this bill, to public sale, and did then and there sell the same (subject only to the payment of-said mortgages) to the said Thomas Campbell, the defendant, for the sum of three thousand five hundred dollars ; and said assignee made return of said sale to said district court, which was, on May 21st, 1878, confirmed absolutely, and said assignee ordered to make and deliver to said Thomas Campbell, the purchaser, a deed for the same, subject to the payment of said mortgages, as by reference to the records of said court will more fully appear. And-in pursuance of said order and sale, the said Robert Arthurs, assignee as aforesaid, did,\u2019 on the 22d day of May, 1878, execute a deed to-said Thomas Campbell for the aforesaid seven acres of land, subject to the payment of the aforesaid-two mortgages; said deed is reoorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Allegheny county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">5. After the confirmation of said sale to said Campbell, and the execution by said Robert. Arthurs, assignee as aforesaid, of the aforesaid deed to said Thomas Campbell for said seven acres, viz.: On the 7th of June, 1878, Wm. B. Rodgers, as the attorney of said Thomas Campbell, purchased the judgments obtained on the aforesaid two mortgages, with money furnished him by said Thomas Campbell for that purpose, and had them assigned to himself. Afterwards, to wit: On the 15th of August, 1879, an <em>al. levari </em>facias, at No. 277 September Term, 1879 (at the instance of said W. B. Rodgers, as attorney of said Thomas Campbell), was issued against said James Bryar on said judgment No, 204 June Term, 1878, by virtue of which the sheriff of Allegheny county exposed to public sale the said seven acres of land, and sold the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to W. B. Rodgers for $50, and' executed, acknowledged in open court, and delivered to said purchaser his official deed therefor, which deed is duly entered in said Court of Common Pleas, No. 1, in Sheriff\u2019s Deed Docket 8, p. 604.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-4\">6. The said W. B. Rogers bought said seven acres of land at the sheriff\u2019s sale aforesaid, as attorney for said Thomas Campbell, and for his benefit, and after the execution of said sheriff\u2019s deed to said W. B. Rodgers, he the said W. B. Rodgers, by his deed dated November 18th, 1881, recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Allegheny county, conveyed said land to said Thomas Campbell, the respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">Your oratrix, therefore, in addition to the relief prayed for in the original bill, asks the court to decree that the sheriff\u2019s sale aforesaid to said W. B. Rodgers, did not divest her dower in said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">The defendant \u25a0 answered the plaintiff\u2019s amended bill as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">1. I believe the statements of paragraphs 1,- 2 and 3 to be true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-8\">2. Robert Arthurs, assignee of James Biyar, in compliance with the orders of court, exposed the seven acre tract to public sale, free from all liens, except the first mortgages on said tract made to Edward R. James and Thomas McClintock, and sold the same to me at said sale, free from all liens, except the said two mortgages, and upon return of sale made, the same was confirmed, and a deed therefor made to me according to the'terms of sale. I expressly deny that I ever agreed to pay said mortgages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-9\">3. Judgments having been obtained on said mortgages, the tract therein described was advertised at sheriff\u2019s sale, and in order to protect myself I furnished Wm. B. Rodgers nearly all the money required, and he purchased said judgments and had them assigned to himself, and subsequently the said tract was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, and purchased by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-10\">. 4.

R. James for $2,000, and each payable in two years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">That on the 8th of January, 1877, the said James Bryar, on petition of his creditors, was adjudged a bankrupt by the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and on the 8th day of February, 1877, Robert Arthurs was duly chosen assignee of his estate, to whom on the 24th day of February, 1877, the Register in Bankruptcy, by his deed of assignment, convejmd all the estate of said James Bryar, bankrupt, including the said mortgaged premises, being the unsold portion of said seven acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-10\">That on petition of said assignee, the said District Court of the United States, by its order dated June 2d, 1877, and its further order dated November 24th, 1877, directed the said land, <em>inter </em>alia, to be sold by the assignee for cash, free from liens, or subject to the liens of the mortgages aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-11\">That on the 30th day of March, 1878, pending said order of sale in bankruptcy, writs of <em>scire facias </em>were issued on said mortgages of E.

B. Rodgers, Esq., the attorney of said Thomas Campbell, caused to be issued an alias writ of <em>levari facias </em>to No. 277, September Term, 1879, on said judgment obtained on the mortgage of E. R. James, by virtue of which the sheriff of Allegheny County, on the 6th day of September, 1879, sold the said premises for $50.00 to the said W. B. Rodgers, who purchased the same for the benefit of his client, the defendant, and said sheriff on the 20th day of September, 1879, made, acknowledged and deliv\u25a0ered his deed for the same to said purchaser, who by his deed dated November 18th, 1881, conveyed the same to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">The question presented for the decision of the Master in this case is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArB\">\u25a0 Is the plaintiff, Jane Bryar, on the foregoing facts, entitled to dower in the undivided one half of the unsold portion of the seven acres of land described in the bill, which was acquired by her deceased husband by the deed of John McElroy to S. B. McElroy and himself?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-10\">The defendant became the owner of the unsold portion of said seven acres of land, subject to .the paym'ent of the mortgages of E. R. James and Thomas McClintock, in May, 1878, by virtue of a sale in bankruptcy, and a deed from the assignee, conveying all the right, title and interest of the plaintiff\u2019s husband,- James Bryar, since deceased. In June following he became the owner of \u25a0 the judgments which had been obtained on said mortgages, through a purchase made by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>attorney. In September following, (1878,) he went into possession of said land, under and by virtue of his deed from the assignee in bankruptcy. In August, 1879, after being in possession, as owner, for about eleven months, he caused an <em>alias lev. fa. </em>to be issued on the judgment obtained on the mortgage of E. R. James to No. 277, September Term, 1879, in the Court of Common Pleas No. 1, of said county, upon which writ the said property was sold by the sheriff to defendant\u2019s attorney, who received the sheriffs deed therefor, about September 20th, 1879, and afterwards conveyed the property to his client, the defendant. There is no doubt that the defendant was the real purchaser both of the land at the sheriff\u2019s \u25a0sale and of the judgment on which it was sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\">Under the decision in the case of Lazear <em>v. </em>Porter, 6 Norris, 513, the purchaser of real estate at a sale in bankruptcy takes subject to the right of dower of the' bankrupt\u2019s wife. The defendant, therefore, by his purchase at the sale in bankruptcy, took said land subject to the plaintiff\u2019s right of dower, as well as subject, by the terms of sale, to the payment of said mortgages. By the death of her husband, in August, 1881,. her right of dower became a vested estate in dower, unless the sheriffs sale in September, 1879, had divested her right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">It is undoubtedly the law in our state that a judicial sale \u2022on a valid lien divests dower. Did; then, the judgment \u25a0obtained on said mortgage of E. R. James retain its validity as a lien, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant voluntarily purchased the same after having previously purchased the land subject to the payment of said mortgage ? If it did, then the sale by the sheriff conveyed a good title to the land, divested of the plaintiff\u2019s right of dower.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">The Master finds this question determined by the Supreme Court in the case of James Bryar and Jane Bryar, his wife, in right of said. Jane Bryar <em>v. </em>John W. Beckett, William B. Rodgers and Thomas Campbell, at No. 184, October and November Term, 1881: 30 Pitts. L. J., old series, p. 12. In that case were involved the essential facts of this case. It was virtually between the same parties, concerned the same land, and involved the question of law above stated, which was determined adversely to the plaintiff, the Supreme Court, in effect, deciding that the said judgment was a valid lien in the hands of its purchaser, the defendant, and that the sheriff\u2019s sale thereon conveyed to him a good title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">The Master is bound by this decision and is therefore of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to dower as claimed, and that the bill should be dismissed; and as required by his order of appointment, he respectfully suggests the following form of decree, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>And now , this cause came on to be heard at this term, on bill, answer, amended bill, answer to amended bill, testimony and the report of the Master, and exceptions thereto, and having been argued by counsel, upon consideration thereof by the court, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the bill of plaintiff be dismissed, and that she pay the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">The plaintiff and the defendant excepted to the report of the Master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">The court filed no opinion on the exceptions but dismissed them and entered the following decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">And now, 20th Eeb., 1885, this cause came on to be heard on bill, answer, replication, Master\u2019s report and exceptions thereto, and was argued by counsel, whereupon it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the bill be dismissed at the plaintiff\u2019s costs, and the Master\u2019s fee is fixed at. fifty dollars by consent of counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVR\">The plaintiff thereupon took this appeal assigning for error the overruling of her exceptions to the Master\u2019s report and the decree of the court dismissing her bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-9\"><em>S.

So we contend here that when Campbell paid off these mortgages he did that which, by the terms of the sale, it was his duty to do. They constituted part of his bid, and he had no legal right to use them for the purpose of divesting an estate subject to which he purchased the property. The same doctrine enunciated in Hansell <em>v. </em>Lutz, 8 Harris, 284.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Thomas M. </em>Marshall, <em>(-Imbrie </em>and <em>Wm.

This was subject to the legal title of the mortgagees, E.'R. James and Thomas McClintock. The counsel of Wm. Campbell found that two outstanding charges existed against the property, one the mortgages, the other the contingent dower right of Jane Bryar. W. B. Rodgers purchased in his own name the mortgages and proceeded to sell the property. The mortgages were kept afoot for the- express purpose of perfecting the equitable title purchased at the bankrupt sale. Was this a legal exercise of power? The plaintiff in error contends first, that Campbell agreed to pay these mortgages as a part of his bid. This no fact sustains. There was no personal duty or obligation of payment. It was discretionary with him whether he should stand on the equity of redemption which he had purchased, or go farther and perfect his equity into a legal title. It requires neither argument nor citation of authority to sustain this position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">The plaintiff in error further contends that the purchase of the mortgages of E. R. James and Thomas McClintock worked a merger by operation of law. It is true.no authority is cited for this position, because none exists. There are two answers to this claim.

Mc-r Clintock and the other to E. R. James. Subsequently, said Campbell by his attorney, purchased said mortgages and the judgments which had been obtained thereon, issued a writ of <em>levari facias </em>on one of them by virtue of which the land was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale for $50, and on November 18th, 1881, the attorney conveyed the title acquired at the sheriff\u2019s sale to Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">By the purchase at the assignee\u2019s sale Campbell obtained Bryar\u2019s equity of redemption, and as respects him nothing more. He bought the land subject to the mortgages, and there is no way that he could hold the land under that purchase and' compel Bryar to pay the whole or a part of the debt. His bid was in addition to the debts secured by the mortgages. He contracted no personal liability, and was at liberty to suffer the mortgagees to cause the land to be sold at judicial sale, in which case he could have bought it himself. But when he chose to hold the equity of redemption, and purchased the debt he freed Bryar from liability for its payment, and can collect no part thereof out .of Bryar\u2019s other property, if he has any: Dollar Savings Bank <em>v. </em>Burns, 87 Pa. St. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">A sheriff\u2019s sale of land on a judgment divests the dower of the debtor\u2019s wife. And if necessary for the payment \u2022 of a decedent\u2019s debts to sell real estate, the sale thereof by order of court for that purpose divests the widow\u2019s dower or estate under the intestate laws. Mortgages are commonly called securities for payment of money, or performance of contract. They are our highest form of securities; in some respects more than a lien, for they are formal pledges of the land. Therefore, no part of mortgaged land is exempted from sale in satisfaction of the mortgage by virtue of the statute exempting \u201cproperty to the value of three hundred dollars \u201c from levy and sale on execution, issued upon any judgment obtained upon contract.\u201d Gangwere\u2019s Appeal, 36 Pa. St. 466. And the statute which provides that the \u201c widow or children of any decedent, dying within this commonwealth, may retain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>either real or personal property belonging to said estate to the value of three hundred dollars, and the same shall not be sold, but suffered to remain for the use of the widow and family,\u201d has no force against a mortgage given by the decedent in his lifetime: Nerpel\u2019s Appeal, 91 Id. 334. A first mortgage is unaffected by a sheriff\u2019s sale upon a subsequent lien ; the purchaser at such sale buys the equity of redemption.' The mortgagee, like a purchaser, is not prejudiced by a secret equity, or title, of which he had no knowledge or notice, and where there were no circumstances to put him on inquiry. \u2022When Bryar\u2019s land was sold by the assignee, be was bankrupt, his whole estate was liable for his debts, and after that sale he had no equitable interest in the land. His wife, under the laws of this commonwealth, had no estate in his land that could stand against his creditors. The sale by the assignee in bankruptcy did not divest her dower, but she had no equity to prevent a sheriff\u2019s sale on a judgment against^her husband. Campbell acquired the title of the mortgagees and their right of possession, and had he not been in possession, he could have recovered in ejectment. The sheriff\u2019s sale is unimpeached for fraud \u2014 it evidences that the land was worth no more than the mortgage debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">A mortgage does not necessarity merge or become extinct by being united in the same person with the fee. When a person becomes entitled to an estate subject to a cjiarge for his own benefit, he may take the estate and keep up the charge. The question in such case is upon the intention, actual or presumed, of the persons in whom the estates are united: Moore <em>v. </em>Harrisburg Bank, 8 Watts, 138. Campbell had an interest in preserving the mortgages until after .foreclosure and sale, for the purchaser at such sale would take as good title as the mortgagor appeared to have. If the mortgagee had no knowledge of an adverse title he had a right to perfect his title if he could, but he was not bound to buy the property if another should bid a larger sum than he cared to pay. The question is not whether he could purchase the mortgage'and use it to compel the debtor to pay-it, but whether he can use it to protect himself against adverse claims which could not avail against the mortgagee, or any one holding under him. At the sheriff\u2019s sale upon the judgment on the mortgage, all persons were as free to bid as if there had been no sale by the assignee, and the purchaser took title under the mortgagee. It was said by the late Chief Justice that Campbell, unless he expressly or by necessary implication agreed to pay the mortgages, had an undoubted right to secure his own title by purchasing them and proceeding to perfect his title under them: Bryar and Wife <em>v. </em>Beckett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>et al., </em>13 Pitts. L. J., N. S. 12. In that case the present appellant and appellee were the parties really interested, and the plaintiff claimed to recover on an equitable title, of which the mortgagees had no knowledge. The judgment was entered against the plaintiff because the sheriff\u2019s sale vested the title in Campbell. In this action the plaintiff claims dower in part of the tract which was not included in her equitable title, and her counsel has made a very ingenious argument in support of her claim, but we are not convinced that the controling principle in the recent decision should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b106-6\">Sterrett and Clark, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"AP_\">dissent upon the ground that the purchase by Campbell at the assignee\u2019s sale, being subject, not only to the lien of the mortgages, but to the widow\u2019s dower also, he could not, after the assignment to him of the former, use them as a means of defeating the latter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
