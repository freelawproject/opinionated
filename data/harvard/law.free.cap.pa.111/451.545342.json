This agreement was produced by the defendant, Schaeffer; it was dated February 24th, 1877, and executed under seal of the parties individually; the consideration was $1,500, of which $250 was paid at the execution; the balance was to be paid on or before April 1st, 1877 ; the quantity of land was said to be 170 acres, more or less; 20 acres were to be re-conveyed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Sharer, reserving the mineral rights. On March 31st, 1877, a supplemental agreement was entered into by the same parties, also individually, by which the time for the delivery of the deed was extended to April 20tb, 1877, and it was provided that the tract should be surveyed and payment made at the rate of $9 per acre for the number of acres so found. It was not disputed that the reason of the delay and for this supplemental agreement was the suspicious character of the warrant and letters-patent in Sharer\u2019s title which made it doubtful whether the \u201c old mine \u201d was really on his farm. The evidence fails to show that Sharer made any attempt, to comply with the terms of the supplemental agreement, although the defendants\u2019 attorney was ready to make payment upon such compliance. No deed was ever delivered to either of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">At the date of this agreement, February 24th, 1877, John T. Fowler, the defendant in error, held certain judgments against Christian Sharer in the Court of Common Pleas, of Centre county, aggregating $522.01, which were subsisting liens on the property sold to Arms &amp; Schaeffer under the agreement of February 27th, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\">Fowler agreed with Sharer that he would accept an order on Arms &amp; Schaeffer, who owed him the balance of the purchase money on said property, and would credit him with the proceeds on the judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-8\">The defendant offered to prove that the plaintiff was not a <em>bona fide </em>holder of the draft for value; that the consideration for the acceptance of the order in question failed between the original parties; that Fowlev had notice at the drawing and acceptance that the draft was only a part payment of purchase money of land sold by the drawer to George H. Arms and John H. Schaeffer as tenants in common, and that the sale of the land fell through on account of defects in Sharer\u2019s title; that Fowler was not a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value of the draft, and that therefore the draft became of no value in the hands of Fowler who had knowledge of the transactions, and took the draft subject to the equities.

In a suit by the indorsee of a bill against the acceptor, the question whether the plaintiff was a <em>bona fide </em>holder without notice should be left to the jury: Boggs <em>v. </em>Lancaster Bank, 7 W. &amp; S., 381; Barnett <em>v. </em>Offerman, 7 Watts, 130; Swain <em>v. </em>Ettling, 8 Casey, 436; Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>Muirheid, 4 Harris, 117; s. c. 9 Id., 237.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-6\">It is submitted, therefore, that the plaintiff in error was clearly entitled to offer proof showing that he received nothing for his liability, and that the defendant in error gave nothing for his title, and that the evidence in the case required the submission of the question of consideration to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-7\">Fowler took the draft without giving value for it, but only as collateral security for the debt of the drawer, and with knowledge of the dealings between Sharer, Schaeffer and Arms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-8\">The mere acceptance from a debtor of his own note or the note of a third person, in ease of an antecedent indebtedness, is not a payment of the indebtedness.

On the 24th o'f February, 1877, Christian Sharer entered into a written agreement with George H. Arms and John H. Schaeffer to sell, and upon full payment of the purchase money convey, by a good and sufficient deed to the said Arms and Schaffer a certain tract of land therein described. It also appears from the evidence that John T. Fowler, the plaintiff below, held certain judgments against Sharer which were a lien on the land embraced in the above mentioned agreement. By an arrangement between Sharer and Fowler the latter agreed to accept an order on Arms &amp; Schaeffer, and apply the proceeds to the judgments. Accordingly an order was drawn by Sharer in favor of Fowler, in the sum of five hundred and twenty-two dollars and ninety-one cents, and accepted by George H. Arms for Arms &amp; Schaeffer. This acceptance is the subject of the present suit. There is no dispute as to the fact that this order was drawn on account of the purchase money due from the acceptors to the drawer, and the question now is as to the power of Arms to accept for Schaeffer. It was a mistake in the court below to assume that the joint purchase of the land made the defendants partners in the legal acceptation of that term, or that this fact gave the one power to indorse for both. There was some evidence that they were partners in the mining operation conducted on the property, but as to the land itself they were but tenants in common, and their status as such was conclusively fixed by the articles of agreement. It follows, that since the order was for purchase money, the power of Arms to accept as he did should have been proved by some evidence of a direct warrant, whether in writing or parol, from Schaeffer, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>jury ought not to have been permitted to infer such power on the hypothesis of a partnership. Again: if this paper was taken by Fowler, not as payment on his judgment, but merely as collateral, and to be applied only when collected, it was subject to all the equities that existed between the drawer and the acceptors at the time it was drawn. Under circumstances.such as here stated the order must be regarded only as a pledge or deposit for the security of an antecedent debt, and must, under our Pennsylvania authorities, be regarded as having.passed to the holder without consideration, hence subject to any lawful set-off or defence to which Arms &amp; Schaeffer were entitled as against Sharer at the time it was accepted. The Pennsylvania cases cited by the defendant in error, as opposed to what is here stated, are not in point. They will be found on examination to support a rule about which there is no dispute, and one having no applicability to the case in hand; that is, that the maker of accommodation paper cannot set up want of consideration as a defence against it in the hands of one to whom it has been pledged as collateral security for an antecedent debt. But the- reason given for this doctrine is stated by Mr. Chief Justice Black, in Lord <em>v. </em>The Ocean Bank, 8 Har., 324, to be because accommodation paper is a loan of the maker\u2019s credit without restriction as to the manner of its use. In this very case, however, we have from this same learned Chief Justice the following statement: \u201c It has been ruled in several cases that one to whom a negotiable instrument has been indorsed for a preexisting debt, who has given no other consideration for it, is not a holder for value. The maker, it is said, may aver any ground of defence against the indorsee of such note which would have been competent against the payee.\u201d The order before us was not accepted as a matter of accommodation, but in consideration of what was then supposed to be a debt due to Sharer, and if by reason of the worthlessness of his title to the land which he covenanted to convey to the acceptors the consideration has failed, that order is as worthless in the hands of the plaintiff'as if it were still in the possession of Sharer. By reason of the mistakes thus pointed out, we feel ourselves constrained to sustain the several assignments of error, and send the case back for a re-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The judgment of the court below is reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
