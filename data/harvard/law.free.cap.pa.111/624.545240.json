Reynolds and Wm. Thorp, dated 21st of September, 1877, was put in evidence. This paper stated that $12,000 of .the bonds belonged to William Reynolds and $8,000 to William Thorp.

That the bonds in controversy are negotiable securities, and if they were negotiated to the plaintiff for a loan of money made by him to Thorp at the time, and that he had no knowledge that any'other than Thorp claimed property in them, then he is a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value in the usual course of business, and the verdict should be for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-12\">Answer \u2014 This point is affirmed, but there is evidence that $6,500 of the bonds were not negotiated to the plaintiff for the Thorp loan, if the evidence of Mr. Thorp is believed, and you will note whether there is any evidence contradictory to Mr. Thorp\u2019s evidence upon that point. (Tenth assignment of error.).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-13\">In the general charge the court instructed the jury, <em>inter alia </em>: This is an action of replevin, and the plaintiff being the actor in a replevin suit, must show his title to these bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>He must show to the satisfaction of the jury h\u00f3w he became possessed of them, and why he claims them. He has introduced evidence to this effect: that on April 20th, 1878, he loaned William Thorp $6.60-0. upon an agreement that when he left the presence of Dr. Gibson, he would in a few days deposit in the First National Bank of Meadville $9,000 of Shenango <em>&amp; </em>Allegheny Railroad bonds. You will bear in mind that when this loan was made and note given to Dr. Gibson by William Thorp, it was done in Mercer County, and according to the statement of Dr. Gibson, Mr. Thorp was to deposit $9,000 in the First National Bank of Meadville. Bear in mind that no specification of bonds or number was made at that time. The- 3d of May, afterwards. Dr. Gibson received a letter wherein the cashier told him, certified to him, that Mr. Thorp, in obedience to their former agreement, had deposited in the bank $9,000. In that letter no other description is given by the depositee. Up to this time Dr. Gibson had not seen any bond, or known anything about their number or their value. Thus matters rested until after Mr. Thorp failed in 1879, [when Dr. Gibson comes to the depositee, namely, this bank, to find out about his -bonds. He finds a package which purports to be bonds, upon which his name is endorsed. It is not given to him, because he has not this letter or certificate of deposit sent by the bank. He does not get possession of these bonds until he gets possession by the sheriff in the bringing of this suit. To be sure, at one time in the bank, in April, 1880, the examiner is understood as handing him the bonds, but he did not take possession, and not until April, 1880, did he even know the number of the bonds; at all events, he did not take the numbers of the bonds until after that time, after the bank had been in the hands of a provisional receiver.] (Twelfth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-6\">[He claims those bonds which he found in that package when Mr. Young was provisional receiver, and the bonds which he looked over when he took the numbers, just prior to bringing the action of replevin, as the. same bonds which Mr. Thorp put into possession of the bank as collateral security for the $6,600 loan.

The admission of the Berringer papers, made long prior to the hj'pothecation of the bonds to Gibson (Berringer not being a party defendant), and Gibson not having notice at the time of any <em>mala fides </em>on the part of Thorp, it is claimed was erroneous, and should not have been admitted. They were not part of the <em>res </em>gestee, and of themselves insufficient to defeat or in any way affect the right of the plaintiff to the possession of the bonds under his certificate of May 3d, 1878, at the time of his instituting this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b645-8\">2. The defendant, by virtue of his special plea filed in this case, cannot be permitted to controvert its own certificate and say that after it had received the bonds of plaintiff, it allowed some unknown person to change them. The plea is <em>non eepit in modo et forma, </em>and property in <em>alio </em>may be pleaded, but such plea must be sustained by indisputable evidence. The defendant interposing it must connect himself satisfactorily therewith or the verdict should be against him, and hence it was error to admit the testimony of Wm. Thorp and others to controvert the bank\u2019s own certificate that it had received the bonds on special deposit, supplemented as it was by the fact that the amount of bonds corresponding in amount, and indorsed with the name of Dr. Wm. Gibson, were found in its vaults. As between Mr. Gibson and the bank it mattered not whether these very bonds had been formerly hypothecated to Berringer, or whether Mr. Thorp had other bonds at the time of the Gibson loan. The fact that Mr. Gibson was the <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value of $9,000 Shenango &amp; Allegheny Railroad bonds, without notice of any <em>mala fides, </em>on May 23d, 1878, entitled him to hold them against any other person. The possession of the bank was his possession. This was settled by the court in the case of Gibson <em>v. </em>Lenhart, 5 Out., 522, and the admission of all evidence to. the contrary by the learned court below is claimed to be error.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-9\"><em>John J.

The question is not whether any bonds were pledged to plaintiff, or whether he has a right of action against the bank, but whether these particular bonds were pledged as bis security, as provided for in his agreement with Thorp. The defendant proved satisfactorily that these bonds were not pledged to plaintiff, and he therefore never had title to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b646-7\">In an action of replevin evidence that another owns the property or has a right superior to the plaintiff will defeat his \u2022action: Seibert <em>v. </em>McHenry, 6 W., 303; Quincy <em>v. </em>Hall, 1 Pick., 360. The charge of the court is to be considered as a whole, not judged by fragments separated from the context. It contains no statement not justified by the fitcts, and does not assume to control the action of the jury. On the contrary, the jury is instructed to find for the plaintiff or for the defendant according to the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b646-8\">\u201c It is not error for the court to comment on the evidence; nor to express an opinion on the weight thereof, if the facts are left to the jury\u201d: Bonner <em>v. </em>Herrick, 3 Out., 220.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b646-9\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"ALv-\">delivered the opinion of the court March 15th, 1886.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">It was held when this case was here upon a former writ of error (Gibson <em>v. </em>Lenhart, 101 Penn. St., Rep. 522) that the plaintiff was a <em>bond fide </em>holder for value of the $9,000 of bonds of the Shenango &amp; Allegheny Railroad Company in controversy, and that the possession of the bank was his possession; in other words, that the delivery of the bonds to the bank for the plaintiff was a delivery to him, as the bonds were negotiable and passed by delivery, it would seem clear that the plaintiff\u2019s title thereto was good against all the world. That his case miscarried in the court below was manifestly due to errors upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">The defendant was the bank having custody of the bonds, or, to speak accurately, the receiver appointed by the government to take charge of the assets of the bank after its failure. We have the admission of the bank in the shape of its certificate, signed by its duly constituted officers, that they held for account of the plaintiff $9,000 of the bonds of this company. It also appeared that said bonds were in an envelope with the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tiff\u2019s name indorsed thereon; that upon one occasion the coupons were cut off by a bank officer and. the proceeds (1315) placed back in the envelope, which sum the receiver after-wards paid to the plaintiff. The defence now set up is that a portion of these bonds had been previously pledged by Thorp to one Berringer as security for a loan made by the latter to Thorp and Reynolds, and a considerable amount of evidence was received under objection to prove this fact. We are of opinion that all this evidence should have been excluded. There was neither allegation nor proof of any <em>malafides on </em>the part of the plaintiff; nor that he had- any knowledge of such pledge when he made his loan upon the faith of the bonds. Under such circumstances his title was good, and it will not do for the bank now to set up that the bonds in the package are not the original bonds pledged to the plaintiff. If they are the same bonds the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and the bank is estopped from alleging that they have been changed in the bundles. We are of opinion that all of the evidence referred to in the first nine specifications of error should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s fourth point should have been affirmed without qualification. There was also plain error in that portion of the charge embraced in the twelfth assignment, in which the learned judge instructed the jury that the plaintiff never had the possession of the bonds until they were delivered to him by the sheriff upon the writ of replevin. On the contrary, he had the legal possession of them all the time after they had been delivered to the bank, for the possession of the bank was his possession. So much was distinctly said in 101 Penn. St. Rep., at page 529. The remaining assignments of error relate to portions of the charge referring to the evidence alluded to. As all this will be excluded on the next trial, a further discussion of it is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">We do not pass upon Beringer\u2019s rights. He is no party to this record, and the judgment does not bind him. It is a question now between the plaintiff and the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
