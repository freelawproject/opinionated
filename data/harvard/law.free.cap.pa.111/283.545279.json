McKinley, 'seal!</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-12\">A. J. McKinley entered into possession under this agreement and mined coal thereunder until the latter part of 1879, when he associated James L. Orr with him, and together they worked, the mine until January 15th, 1880, when McKinley assigned all his interest in the lease to Orr, who then took exclusive possession and proceeded without delay to improve the works. The improvements were large and valuable, the cost of the same being from $10,000 to $12,000. Peters lived near the mine and took\u2019an active interest in all that was going on about the same. He was frequently on the ground and knew that Orr was working the mine, and on several occasions expressed his satisfaction that such was the case. Orr paid to Peters rent or royalty for the coal mined and received from him receipts therefor, acknowledging the payments by Orr, not as agent, but as principal. Lawrence never executed the <em>agreement </em>to lease. There was never any lease made. Neither did Lawrence ever receive any of the royalties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-13\">Orr continued in possession until March 10th, 1882, when the defendant Peters with a force of men took possession of the mine and works, during the temporary absence of Orr, and declared the lease forfeited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-14\">This suit was then brought to recover for the injury sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-15\">The plaintiff made the following offer of evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-16\">\u201c Plaintiff\u2019s counsel propose now to offer evidence tending to show the improvements made by both the legal and equitable plaintiff in the premises, the eviction thereform of the equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>plaintiff and tbe damage suffered by him. \u2022 Further, to - show that- the period in which said improvements were made extended over two years without objection on the part of said Lawrence, and with the approbation of the said Peters, and that said improvements were large and valuable and notorious; the cost of the same being from $10,000 to $12,000. Which was objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel as incompetent and irrelevant under the form of action and pleadings, and because there was not sufficient evidence to be submitted to the jury to charge Chester B. Lawrence in this case. The objection was sustained and bill sealed for the plaintiffs. (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\">The Court charged the jury: \u201c Under the evidence your verdict should be for the defendants.\u201d Which was excepted to and a bill sealed.

Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AA2\">The defendants, as tenants in common, owned the land on which the coal was mined. This fact, however, of itself, did not authorize Peters to enter into an agreement which would bind his co-tenant to sell to the plaintiff the unmined coal on the land. Peters had no authority either written or verbal from Lawrence to make the agreement in question. Not only did Peters 'make the agreement in the absence of authority from Lawrence, but the latter refused to sign it and never ratified it by receiving any portion of the royalty paid or otherwise. The learned Judge- was clearly right in instructing the jury to find for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Judgment affirmed. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
