Johnson, and was thirty-three feet wide for its entire length, except a - portion over part of the lands of said bank and the said George R. Johnson, where it was forty-five feet \u2022wide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>They further set forth in their petition \u201cthat they desire to be allowed to construct on said route a double track railroad, with the necessary switches, sidings, chutes, machinery, fixtures and appurtenances; and that all of said land so as hereinbefore described, and in said annexed plan marked and set forth, is necessary for said double track railroad, and the necessary switches, sidings, chutes, machinery, fixtures and appurtenances.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">\u201cThey therefore pray this honorable court to file and enter of record this, their petition, and thereupon to appoint six disinterested and judicious men, resident in said county, to view said route and premises and examine the same; and to make report in writing, according to the provisions of the Acts of Assembly in such cases made and provided, to this court, whether the railroad asked is necessary for public or private use, as well as the damages which will be sustained by the owners of intervening lands.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">The said Pittsburgh National Bank of Commerce is shown in the petition and on the plan to be the owner of the principal portion of the lands over which the road passes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">April 14th, 1882, George R. Johnson filed exceptions to the petition and appointment of viewers, alleging that the land described in the petition as belonging to him, is the identical land now in the occupancy and use of petitioners under a lease from him, granting them a right of way for transporting their coal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">April 15th, 1882, George R. Johnson filed his answer to said petition, setting forth at length the matters briefly mentioned in his said exception. On the same day the Western Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and .Dumb filed its answer, averring its incorporation as a public charitable institution, the gift and conveyance of its ground to said institution, and its necessity for the purpose of its incorporation, and denying the right of petitioners to take it for the use of said road, and showing wherein it would be injured by such appropriation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-9\">April 24th,. 1882, viewers were appointed in accordance with the prayer of the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-10\">October 7th, 1882, report of viewers filed in favor of the road as surveyed by petitioners and described in the petition and <em>fixing the width as set forth </em>therein, and assessing damages to all the intervening landowners except the Western Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, as to which they reported that an agreement had been made between it and the petitioners in respect to the land taken,.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-11\">October 22d, 1882, exceptions filed by George R.

Johnson appealed from said report to the Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">December 31st, 1884, the Pittsburgh National Bank of Commerce filed an exception to said proceedings and the report of the viewers, and joined in the exception filed thereto by George R. Johnson, alleging that the ground appropriated by the petitioners, and reported to court by the viewers for the purposes of said road, exceeded twenty feet in width, and was in excess of the quantity which the petitioners could legally take.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-8\">No answers or exceptions were filed by any of the landowners other than those above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-9\">January 8th, 1885, petition of George R.

Lazear </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0u\">The Lateral Railroad Act of May 5th, 1832, (P. L., 501) governing proceedings in such cases, expressly provided in its 3d section that such railroads \u201c <em>shall not exceed in breadth twenty </em>feet,\u201d and none of the supplements of the Act authorizes the appropriation of any greater width.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-13\">Our exceptions are not too late. An appeal was formerly confined to the assessment of damages: Horner\u2019s Road, 37 Penna. St., 333; Boyd <em>v. </em>Negley, 40 Ib., 377, and now, since the passage of the Supplemental Act of February 17th, 1871, (P. L., 56) it extends to the further inquiry of the necessity of the road. Nothing else, however, comes within the scope of an appeal. It does not, therefore, touch the question of the regularity of the proceedings, which is the province of exceptions. No limitation for filing these is named in the Act, and as the exceptions of the plaintiff in error in this case involve a question of jurisdiction, they could have been filed in any stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-14\">And certiorari is the proper remedy for errors in overrul ing exceptions: Hall\u2019s Appeal, 56 Pa. St., 238.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>George Shiras, Jr. </em>(S. <em>Shoyer, Jr., </em>with him), for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMq\">The proceedings in this case were instituted under the provisions of the act of April 18th, 1865, (P. L., 64), which authorizes the construction of a \u201c single or double track railroad, with the necessary sidings, wharves, chutes, machinery, fixtures and appurtenances for the transfer and delivery of .... coal.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-4\">Our construction of the act of 1865 is that it was found by experience that the twenty feet authorized by the act of 1832 was insufficient for the profitable carrying on of said railroad ; and as it was not practicable to fix by statute any definite width, the legislature left the width to be fixed by viewers, according to the circumstances of each case; that the increased Avidth authorized does not merely, as argued, refer to sidings.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-5\">Mr. Justice Green</author>\n<p id=\"AuH\">delivered the opinion of the court, January 4th, 1886.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We feel obliged to say in this case that both under the act of 5th of May, 1832, and its supplement of April 18th, 1865, lateral railroads cannot be built of greater width than tAventy feet. Of course, under the act of 1865, if a greater Avidth than that is necessary for the construction of sidings, wharves, chutes, etc., mentioned in that act, such additional width could be used for those specific purposes. In that event the special additional structures, together with the quantity of ground requisite for the purpose,' should be carefully described in the petition and order, so that they may appear on the record. Both the original act and the supplement authorized the construction of double track roads, and hence no inference of additional width can be drawn from the fact that double track roads are authorized by the supplement. As a greater Avidth than twenty feet is-expressly prohibited by the original act of 1832, the Avidth becomes a jurisdictional fact, Avliich may be taken advantage of at any stage of the proceedings. We think, also, that as damages are to be assessed in the same manner as under the act of 1849, the number of viewers should be seven instead of six.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The judgment of the court beloAv is reversed, and the petition, order, and all -proceedings are dismissed and set aside, at the cost of the defendants in error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
