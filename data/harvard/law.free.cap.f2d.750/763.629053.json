Richardson (hereinafter Richardson) appeals from the order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>district court denying his application for attorney\u2019s, fees against defendant/intervenor, Air Line Pilots Association International (hereinafter ALPA) under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">We must decide whether, in an action brought against an employer, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (hereinafter ADEA) permits the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees from an intervenor who has not violated the ADEA. We affirm. The ADEA does not provide for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees from a non-employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">\n<em>PERTINENT FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Richardson was employed by Alaska Airlines, Inc. (hereinafter Alaska) as a flight captain and assistant chief pilot until he reached his sixtieth birthday in October, 1978. A person over the age of sixty cannot fly as a captain or as a first officer under 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.383(c). Richardson filed this action against Alaska claiming that his employer had violated the ADEA by forcing him to retire at age sixty instead of permitting him to continue working as an' assistant chief pilot or as a \u201csecond officer.\u201d The person who serves as a second officer for Alaska does not perform pilot duties. Second officers employed by Alaska are represented by the ALPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">In its answer, Alaska denied violating the ADEA and raised numerous affirmative defenses including the claim that the relief sought \u201cwould be contrary to the interests of flight officers with less seniority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Richardson and Alaska Airlines reached a settlement on April 2, 1982, which was incorporated into a proposed consent decree. ALPA was not made a party to this action by Richardson or Alaska and did not participate in the settlement discussions. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, a copy of the proposed consent decree was served on ALPA so that it would have an opportunity to express its views to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">On May 13, ALPA moved to intervene to oppose the motion for entry of the proposed consent decree which had been filed jointly by Richardson and Alaska. ALPA alleged that it was entitled to intervene because the proposed consent decree affected the interest of ALPA members by diminishing their seniority rights, subjected present second officers to the threat of being furloughed or laid off, and violated provisions of its collective bargaining agreement with Alaska. ALPA also asserted many of the defenses originally raised by Alaska\u2019s answer to Richardson\u2019s - complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">The district court granted ALPA\u2019s motion to intervene to contest the fairness of the consent decree. Richardson and Alaska did not oppose intervention. ALPA asked the district court to disapprove the proposed consent decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing on October 1, 1982, concerning ALPA\u2019s objections to the fairness of the proposed consent decree, the district court, on November 1, 1982, signed the consent decree after it was modified to require that the working conditions of all pilots who continued working for Alaska after the age of sixty, including Richardson, be subject to subsequent negotiations between the union and the airline.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">The consent decree provides for the payment of Richardson\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-14\">Alaska shall pay an agreed sum to [Richardson\u2019s counsel] which sum shall constitute the final settlement of any claim Plaintiff and/or his attorneys may have under law to recover from Alaska fees and/or costs related to this action and shall hereafter bar any action, claim or demand from such fees and/or costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">On November 11, 1982, Richardson filed an application seeking payment of $6,395.21 \u201cattorneys' fees and costs incurred as a result of ALPA\u2019s intervention in opposition to entry of the consent decree between Alaska Airlines, Inc. and plaintiff.\u201d In his points and authorities filed in support of this application, Richardson con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>tended that as a prevailing party, he was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs as prayed because ALPA became a party defendant when it chose to intervene and oppose entry of the consent decree. The district court denied Richardson\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on June 21, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">\n<em>DISPOSITIVE ISSUE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AkV\">Richardson contends that as a prevailing party in this action, he is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs he incurred in successfully opposing ALPA\u2019s opposition to the entry of the proposed consent decree. Because we have concluded that the ADEA\u2019s authorization for the award of attorney\u2019s fees is directed against employers who have violated the statute, we do not reach his remaining contentions that (1) ALPA was a defendant in this action and that (2) the ADEA does not bar an award of attorney\u2019s fees against a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">\n<em>ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES UNDER THE ADEA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ALQ\">The American Rule denies attorney\u2019s fees to a litigant in federal court in the absence of contract, applicable statute, or other exceptional circumstances. <em>Matter of Sparkman, </em>703 F.2d 1097, 1099 (9th Cir.1983). This court has stated previously that any exceptions to the American Rule will be narrowly circumscribed. <em>MillerWohl Co. v. Commissioner of Labor and Industry, </em>694 F.2d 203, 204 (9th Cir.1982). Our restraint is compelled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975). In <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service, </em>the Supreme Court instructed us as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">It is true that under some, if not most, of the statutes providing for the allowance of reasonable fees, Congress has opted to rely heavily on private enforcement to implement public policy and to allow counsel fees so as to encourage private litigation____ But congressional utilization of the private-attorney-general concept can in no sense be construed as a grant of authority to the Judiciary to jettison the traditional rule against non-statutory allowances to the prevailing party and to award attorney\u2019s fees whenever the courts deem the public policy furthered by a particular statute important enough to warrant the award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">Our task then is to determine if the ADEA expressly provides for attorney\u2019s fees and costs against a party to an action who is not an employer of, and who has not discriminated against the plaintiff-employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">The ADEA does not expressly provide for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Instead, the ADEA incorporates the remedial provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (hereinafter FLSA). Section 626(b) of the ADEA, in pertinent part provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-14\">The provisions of this chapter shall be enforced in accordance with the powers, remedies, and procedures provided in sections 211(b), 216 (except for subsection (a) thereof), and 217 of this title, and subsection (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">Congress had provided for the award of attorney\u2019s fees under the FLSA under specific circumstances. Section 216(b) in pertinent part provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-17\">Any <em>employer </em>who <em>violates </em>the provisions of section 206 or section 207 [of the FLSA] shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages. Any <em>employer </em>who violates the provision of section 215(a)(3) of this title shall be liable for such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate ... An action to recover the liability prescribed in either of the preceding sentences may be maintained <em>against any employer ... The court in such action shall, in addition to any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number><em>judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorneys fee to be paid by the defendant, and costs of the action.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) (1982). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The issue presented to us is of first impression. No other court has been called upon.to determine the intent of Congress concerning the award of attorney\u2019s fees under the ADEA against a non-employer. The legislative history of the ADEA offers no clue as to the scope of the attorney\u2019s fees provision of the FLSA when applied to ADEA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The FLSA narrowly limits the power of the district court to award attorney\u2019s fees. As set forth above, the statute allows such recovery from \u201cany employer who violates\u201d the ADEA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) (1982). Within the same paragraph, the word \u201cdefendant\u201d is used to describe the party who may be liable for the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Taken in context, the word defendant refers to the employer against whom the charge of violation has been brought. Context is an important tool in discerning the meaning of a word in a statute. <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>412 U.S. 346, 356, 93 S.Ct. 2008, 2015, 36 L.Ed.2d 941 <em>on remand </em>485 F.2d 248, <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 931, 94 S.Ct. 2642, 41 L.Ed.2d 234 (1973). If Congress wishes to expand attorney\u2019s fee awards as against non-employers under the ADEA, it is free to do so. \u201cArguments centering on the inequities caused by the absence of fee-shifting are properly addressed to the Congress and not to the courts.\u201d <em>Kennedy v. Whitehurst, </em>690 F.2d 951, 953 (D.C.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">In the matter before us, the ALPA was not acting as Richardson\u2019s employer. No claim has been made by Richardson that ALPA violated any provisions of the ADEA. Thus, the policy considerations which underlie the shifting of the duty to the employer to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of an employee who has been subjected to age discrimination are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">Imposing a fee award would only punish ALPA for performing an act it was under a duty to do. Under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>(1982) and the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), unions are given the right to act as exclusive representatives for all members in the bargaining unit. This right carries with it a corresponding duty to represent all members fairly. <em>Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co., </em>323 U.S. 192, 202-03, 65 S.Ct. 226, 232, 89 L.Ed. 173 (1944). The parties recognized ALPA\u2019s interests in the settlement\u2019s terms by serving the union with a copy of the proper decree so that it could express its views to the court. ALPA intervened in this matter on behalf of its membership because the decree was modified to reflect ALPA\u2019s concerns. The proposed decree appeared unfairly to affect seniority and other rights protected by its collective bargaining agreement with Alaska.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">The ADEA makes no provision for the award of attorney\u2019s fees to a non-employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">Richardson argues that he is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees as a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d We are directed to cases decided under Title II and Title VII of The Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000a <em>et seq.; </em>2000e <em>et seq. </em>and The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 in support of this proposition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each of these statutes provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d A person bringing an action under any of these statutes may recover attorney\u2019s fees, if he is the prevailing party against any named defendant, whether or not such person is an employer. A defendant (other than United States) who prevails in such actions may also be awarded attorney\u2019s fees against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">In enacting the ADEA in 1967, Congress did not use the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in providing for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Instead, Congress limited the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the successful plaintiff-employee. A prevailing <em>employer </em>may not recover attorney\u2019s fees in an action under the FLSA or the ADEA. The civil rights statutes relied upon by Richardson demonstrate that Congress has used the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d when its object is to permit the award of attorney\u2019s fees to a successful plaintiff or <em>defendant. </em>The fact that Congress did not employ the \u201cprevailing party\u201d terminology used in The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976 indicates an intention to impose the additional burden of paying attorney\u2019s fees only on <em>employers </em>who violate the statute. Congress chose its words carefully to foreclose the possibility of the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by an employer who has successfully defended himself against an accusation of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\">.
