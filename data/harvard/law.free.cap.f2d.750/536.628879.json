(Baggott), for services rendered to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">There is no dispute as to the following relevant chronology. The underlying bankruptcy proceeding commenced March 4, 1981 with an involuntary Chapter 11 creditor\u2019s petition in bankruptcy against Georgetown of Kettering, Inc. (Georgetown). The petition was filed by the Imperial Management Company (Imperial), through its attorney, Horace W. Baggott.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Georgetown was a rental property owned by G.W.F. Investments Ltd. (G.W.F.), one of several partnerships formed by Frederick E. Gagel (Gagel), Steven Williams (Williams), and Garrett H. Frey (Frey) for the purpose of acquiring and operating rental properties. Gagel was also president of Imperial.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">G.W.F. was the sole general partner in four limited partnerships thus formed. Each of those partnerships had also been subjected to involuntary creditor\u2019s petitions. A further involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed by Gagel against G.W.F. itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Previous to the Gagel/Imperial involuntary bankruptcy petition against Georgetown, appellant Hunter Savings Association (Hunter Savings) had foreclosed various notes held against Georgetown and co-makers which totalled $5,150,000.00. These notes were secured by three mortgages against the apartment complex which formed Georgetown\u2019s principal asset. When the Chapter 11 proceeding was instituted, the foreclosure action was removed to the bankruptcy court. On September 2, 1981, Hunter Savings was granted judgment on the notes. <em>Hunter Savings Association v. Georgetown of Kettering, Ltd., </em>14 B.R. 72 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1981). Baggott appeared for Georgetown in that adversary proceeding, <em>see </em>14 B.R. at 73, in which the bankruptcy court stayed the judgment pending the resolution of the Chapter 11 proceedings. 14 B.R. at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">Baggott has represented Gagel in each of the latter\u2019s many roles in this exceedingly intricate litigation. Gagel filed the schedules on behalf of the debtor Georgetown listing himself as Georgetown\u2019s largest unsecured creditor and his company, Imperial, as the second largest. Gagel\u2019s personal and Imperial\u2019s unsecured claims amounted to $907,000.00, which was in excess of 90% of all the scheduled unsecured claims. Both claims were ultimately disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">On March 10, 1981, in the G.W.F. bankruptcy matter (to which Hunter Savings was not a party) G.W.F.\u2019s petition to employ Baggott as counsel was granted. At this point, Baggott represented Imperial (of which Gagel was president) and Gagel as unsecured creditors in the Georgetown bankruptcy. Also in the Georgetown bankruptcy, Baggott further represented Gagel as a partner in G.W.F., which owned Georgetown. In the adversary proceeding on the foreclosed mortgage notes brought by Hunter Savings against Georgetown, Baggott represented Georgetown, the debt- or. In the separate G.W.F. Bankruptcy, Baggott represented Gagel as the creditor who initiated the bankruptcy. Baggott also represented Gagel as a partner in G.W.F., which owned Georgetown and, upon the March 10, 1981 order approving the petition, Baggott also represented the Debtor, G.W.F.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>In the Georgetown case (from which this appeal proceeds), Gagel, Frey, and Hunter Savings proposed separate plans of reorganization. Gagel, through G.W.F., submitted two such plans. Ultimately, on January 25,1982, the Hunter Savings plan was approved (largely as a result of agreement between Frey<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Hunter Savings). The Hunter Savings plan released all co-makers of the Georgetown notes, including Gagel, Frey and the Williams estate, in return for title to the Georgetown real estate. \u201cNon-insider\u201d unsecured claims under $2,000.00 would receive 100% and those over $2,000.00 would receive $2,000.00 or 50% of their total claim, at the creditor\u2019s option. Under the arrangement, Hunter Savings assumed the administrative expenses of the estate. Because Frey\u2019s attorneys had withdrawn their claims for fees and expenses, the only anticipated administrative expense was the $766.13 fee of the attorney employed by a creditor\u2019s committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">On March 5, 1982, some five weeks subsequent to the confirmation of the Hunter Savings plan, Baggott filed a petition for fees in the amount of $22,100.00 for its representation of the debtor in possession. On March 8, Baggott filed a motion for appointment as attorney for the debtor in possession to be entered <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to March 3, 1981. On March 15, 1982, without notice to Frey or Hunter, the bankruptcy court entered an order appointing Baggott as attorney for the debtor in possession <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to March 3, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">On March 16, 1982, Frey filed an objection to the Baggott appointment, which was followed, on June 18, 1982, by the objection of Hunter Savings. A hearing on the fee petition was conducted on June 22, 1982 and the parties were directed to file memoranda. Baggott did not file a timely memorandum, but Hunter Savings did. The bank joined Baggott\u2019s failure to comply with 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 329(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bankruptcy Rules 215 and 219,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Interim Bankrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>cy Rule 2006,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as issues in conjunction with the appointment of Baggott and the application for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">On January 5, 1983, the bankruptcy court noted that Baggott had failed to comply with the applicable statutes and rules and <em>sua sponte </em>granted Baggott two weeks to conform. On January 24, 1983, Baggott filed a statement purporting to bring the application and appointment into compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">On February 18, 1983, the bankruptcy court allowed Baggott\u2019s application for fees (in reduced amount of $13,965.00) whereupon an appeal was taken to the district court. 28 B.R. 120. The district court affirmed and there followed this timely appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 34 B.R. 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">Hunter Savings has asserted that the award of fees to Baggott was improper because of inherent conflicts of interest in Baggott\u2019s representation in this case, as well as the law firm\u2019s failure to satisfy other requirements of the bankruptcy statute and rules. Section 329(a) requires the applicant attorney to file a statement of compensation paid or contracted for in connection with the case. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 329(a). Under Bankruptcy Rule 219(b), the statement must be filed \u201con or before the first date set for the first meeting of creditors\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>At the time Baggott\u2019s <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order was granted, no \u00a7 329(a) statement had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">A more serious failure of compliance has been noted with respect to the conflict of interest provisions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 327(c) prohibits the attorney for the debtor from representing a creditor in the case (although by its terms the statute does not preclude representation of a creditor <em>prior </em>to appointment as counsel to debtor). <em>See also </em>Rule 215(c). As noted above, throughout the proceedings Baggott represented all of Gagel\u2019s interests, including Gagel as the debtor in possession and as an unsecured creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The district and bankruptcy courts recognized that Baggott\u2019s representations posed conflicts of interest problems, but held that <em>Cle-Ware Industries, Inc. v. Sokolsky, </em>493 F.2d 863 (6th Cir.1974), did not require disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In <em>Cle-Ware, </em>this circuit was confronted with a local civil rule in the Northern District of Ohio which mandated separate attorneys for the debtor and debtor in possession. At the time, the Northern District of Ohio was the only jurisdiction with such a rule. The Sixth Circuit disapproved the rule stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">This court strongly disapproves the practice of appointing separate counsel as attorney for the debtor-in-possession and at the same time compensating another attorney at the expense of the bankrupt estate in his capacity as counsel for the debtor for services rendered after the filing of a petition for a plan of arrangement. Hereafter we will not approve this procedure as a general practice in the Sixth Circuit. Only in exceptional circumstances, which we do not now foresee, will this procedure be allowed by this court. The debtor and the debtor-in-possession is one and the same person, although \u201cwearing two hats.\u201d We see no valid reason why, as a general rule, his legal representation in both capacities should not be limited to one attorney or one set of attorneys. In the ordinary situation, as in the instant case, there is no actual or potential conflict of interest requiring or justifying payment for services of separate attorneys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">While the lower court in this case correctly identified the needless waste of time and expense as the rationale of the <em>CleWare </em>holding, the district court overlooked a substantive distinction. Here Gagel, and hence his attorney, advanced the <em>inherently </em>conflicting interests of creditor and debt- or in possession. Section 327(c) does not abide such conflicting employment. The fact that Gagel\u2019s creditor interest was subsequently disallowed does not serve to obviate the conflict, as suggested by the district court, but rather enhances the conflict. <em>See </em>Advisory Note to Rule 215(c) (\u201cif there is a question as to the validity or amount of a general creditor\u2019s claim, his attorney would be subject to a disqualifying interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">Because an <em>actual </em>conflict of interest existed, Baggott\u2019s application for compensation should have been denied. <em>See Woods v. City National Bank &amp; Trust, </em>312 U.S. 262, 269, 61 S.Ct. 493, 497, 85 L.Ed. 820 (1941):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-14\">[T]he incidence of a particular conflict of interest can seldom be measured with any degree of certainty. The bankruptcy court need not speculate as to whether the result of the conflict was to delay action where speed was essential, to close the record of past transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>where publicity and investigation were needed, to compromise claims by inattention where vigilant assertion was necessary, or otherwise to dilute the undivided loyalty owed to those whom the claimant purported to represent. Where an actual conflict of interest exists, no more need be shown in this type of case to support a denial of compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Accordingly, even had Baggott been able to sustain its burden to demonstrate the propriety of the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appointment, an issue on which this court expresses no conclusion, the compensation would be denied as a result of the conflict of interest. Consistent with this analysis, the district court award of fees from the estate is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-13\">.

If the attorney or accountant represents or holds no interest adverse to the estate in the matters upon which he is to be engaged, and his employment is in the best interest of the estate, the court may authorize his employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the court may authorize the employment of an attorney or accountant who has been employed by the bankrupt when such employment is in the best interest of the estate. The employment of any attorney or accountant shall be only for the purposes specified in the order, but the court may authorize a general retainer of an attorney when necessity therefor is shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-15\">(b) Employment of an Attorney or Accountant with Adverse Interest.
