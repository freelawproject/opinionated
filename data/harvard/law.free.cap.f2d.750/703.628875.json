For reversal appellant argues that the district court erred in (1) giving a verdict director instruction which confused and misled the jury and which was contrary to the law, (2) refusing to give a circumstantial evidence instruction, (3) limiting cross-examination about the female worker\u2019s shoplifting conviction and prior drug use, (4) refusing to admit evidence concerning MoPac\u2019s Senior Transition Program, (5) refusing to grant a mistrial after a juror disclosed during trial that he had been accused of sexual harassment, (6) refusing to admit into evidence appellant\u2019s deposition testimony, (7) taking judicial notice of an EEOC regulation on strict liability and presenting it to the jury as law, (8) admitting handwritten notes and an investigation report, (9) refusing to admit into evidence appellant\u2019s opinion testimony concerning the ultimate factual issue, and (10) refusing to allow appellant to argue or comment on certain admitted evidence. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Appellant was 60 years old when he retired in April 1982 from the position of Superintendent of the St. Louis Terminal Division for MoPac. He claims that he was forced to resign because of his age. MoPac alleges that appellant was terminated because he sexually harassed a subordinate.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Appellant began working for MoPac in 1943 and worked his way up through the ranks to Superintendent of the St. Louis Terminal Division. Appellant had the ultimate authority to transfer, promote, and terminate the Division\u2019s 2,000 employees and personally participated in the hiring of all Division employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Appellant hired Diana Austin as a laborer in July 1980 and assigned her to the Division\u2019s Dupo, Illinois, train yard. From January 1981 to October 1981, Austin contacted appellant monthly by telephone concerning a transfer to a clerk\u2019s position. Following a telephone conversation on October 6, 1981, appellant visited Austin\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The events which took place at Austin\u2019s home are disputed. Appellant testified that he stood inside the door and talked to Austin for five to eight minutes regarding her complaint about her union chairman. Austin testified that appellant discussed the transfer to the clerk\u2019s position and following the conversation made sexual advances to her. He allegedly embraced her, kissed her, and attempted to put his hand under her sweater and to lead her into the bedroom. Austin resisted and appellant left.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Austin discussed the incident with her boyfriend, Joe Klaus, and her sister, Deborah Converse. Converse testified that she observed appellant holding Austin and that she answered the telephone when appellant later called Austin about the job. Klaus called appellant\u2019s house twice on the day of the incident and also contacted an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">On October 8, 1981, Austin complained about the incident to her supervisor, Mike Middleton, to her union secretary, and to top union officials in her local. Middleton reported the alleged incident to his supervisor, Ben Wiggans, who reported the complaint to appellant. Appellant denied the incident and instructed Wiggans to discuss the matter with Austin.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Wiggans went to the Dupo train yard and talked with Austin, who told Wiggans about the alleged sexual harassment. Following Wiggans\u2019 conversation with Austin on October 8, 1981, appellant instructed Wiggans to give Austin the clerk\u2019s position. Austin began work as a clerk the following Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">Approximately one month later, a MoPac supervisor reported the incident to Arthur Shoener, MoPac\u2019s General Manager in Little Rock, Arkansas, and appellant\u2019s immediate supervisor. Shoener, assisted by a MoPac special agent, was authorized by K.D. Hestes, MoPac\u2019s Assistant Vice President of Operations, to conduct an investigation of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Shoener interviewed Wiggans, Middleton, Austin, Converse, Klaus, and appellant. Shoener took notes during the interviews and later added to them. He also prepared a typewritten investigative report, which was submitted to Hestes and J.W. Gessner, President of MoPac. After consulting with Mark Hennelly, MoPac\u2019s Senior Vice President of Law, Hestes and Gessner decided to remove appellant from the position of superintendent and keep him on the active payroll until his sixtieth birthday, at which time he could retire with an officer\u2019s pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Appellant\u2019s position was subsequently filled by a thirty-two year old man, who had been superintendent of MoPac\u2019s Palestine, Texas, Division for the previous four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">On April 22, 1982, appellant filed a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He subsequently initiated this lawsuit on August 11, 1982. A jury trial commenced on September 14, 1983, and ended on September 20, 1983. The jury returned a verdict for MoPac and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\n<em>Motions in Limine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion in granting MoPac\u2019s motion in limine which prevented appellant from cross-examining Diana Austin on her responses on her Initial Contact Interview Form completed in 1979. Austin stated on this pre-employment form that she had not been convicted of a violation of the law other than a minor traffic offense when in fact she had been convicted of the crime of retail theft under $150.00 one year earlier in 1978. Austin admitted during the deposition that she had answered \u201cno\u201d to the question of conviction because she believed that the shoplifting conviction had been expunged and appellant\u2019s secretary told her to answer that query in the negative. Appellant argues that the district court\u2019s granting of the motion in limine effectively eliminated the credibility of MoPac\u2019s key witness from consideration by the jury and thus the district court in effect directed a verdict in favor of MoPac.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">We need not decide whether the evidence was admissible for impeachment purposes under Fed.R.Evid. 609(a) which prohibits the admission of conviction evidence unless the crime is \u201cpunishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year\u201d or \u201cinvolves dishonesty or false statement\u201d because the district court properly excluded the evidence under 608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Fed.R.Evid. 608(b) grants the district court discretion to permit a witness to be cross-examined on specific instances of conduct probative of a witness\u2019 character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. The district court held that the alleged falsification of the application was not probative of Austin\u2019s truthfulness because the falsification occurred two years before the sexual harassment incident and Austin subsequently admitted the conviction on a MoPac employment application completed in 1980 and in the deposition. Further, Austin stated that she had answered \u201cno\u201d on the first application because she had mistakenly thought the conviction was to be expunged from her record and because appellant\u2019s secretary had said that this was correct in light of the expungement. The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that this evidence was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Appellant next argues that the district court abused its discretion in granting defendant\u2019s motion in limine which prevented appellant from cross-examining Austin and her boyfriend concerning their use of marijuana two or three years before the sexual harassment incident. Appellant argues that the testimony of these two witnesses as to the periods during which they had smoked marijuana together was in conflict, that MoPac knew of Austin\u2019s use of marijuana, and that this evidence was related to pretext because prior drug use would indicate unreliability and untruthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that \u201cillegal drug use or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>transactions, without more, do not show untruthfulness.\u201d <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>577 F.2d 38, 41-42 (8th Cir.1978). The district court under Rule 608(b) may determine if evidence is probative of truthfulness and under Rule 403 may exclude evidence, even though probative, if the probative value is outweighed by the prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Appellant next argues that the district court abused its discretion in granting MoPac\u2019s motion in limine which prevented appellant from introducing evidence concerning MoPac\u2019s Senior Transition Program (STP). This program was initiated about one year after appellant resigned. Appellant argues that this program, which ostensibly was a voluntary retirement program, was actually a means of forcing out older employees and replacing them with younger employees, at a substantial savings to MoPac. Appellant argues that the STP is discriminatory and that this evidence is probative to show circumstantially that he too was the subject of discrimination. Appellant advised that he would offer 39 STP exhibits and call several witnesses. MoPac indicated that it would call numerous witnesses and introduce many exhibits because 197 persons had gone through the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The district court held that the evidence concerning the STP would result in extensive evidence on collateral issues and that the slight probative value of the proposed evidence justified its exclusion under Fed.R.Evid. 403. The court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AtA\">\n<em>Denial of a Motion for Mistrial Because of Juror Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for mistrial after a juror admitted that he had lied during voir dire. The juror, on the second day of trial, advised the district court that he \u201chad had a sexual discrimination complaint filed against him\u201d and as a result he had very \u201cstrong emotions\u201d about sexual harassment and some \u201cdefinite feelings\u201d concerning \u201csex discrimination in general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Appellant initially sought a mistrial, which was denied. Appellant, however, (contrary to his position on appeal) expressly agreed to the juror remaining on the jury and opposed having the juror replaced by the alternate. Appellant may not on appeal object to potential juror bias when he opposed a remedy which would have eliminated the bias. <em>Delgado v. United States, </em>403 F.2d 208, 209 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 966, 89 S.Ct. 1320, 22 L.Ed.2d 568 (1968); <em>see United States v. Verkuilen, </em>690 F.2d 648, 658 (7th Cir.1982). Moreover, the juror in question was, under the circumstances, probably biased in favor of appellant, rather than against him. The district court did not commit error.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">\n<em>Rejection of Deposition Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aa2d\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in refusing to admit into evidence the deposition of MoPac\u2019s managing agent, Arthur Shoener. The district court sustained MoPac\u2019s objection because Shoener was to be called later in the trial. Appellant argues that the deposition should have been admitted as an admission of a party opponent to show the inconsistency of Austin\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">The district court erred in excluding the testimony of Shoener. Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">(2) The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership or association or governmental agency which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arp\">Whether an individual has the status of managing agent depends on several factors, including whether the interests of the individual \u201care identified with those of his principal and on the nature of his functions, responsibilities and authority____\u201d <em>Terry v. Modern Woodmen, </em>57 F.R.D. 141, 143 (W.D.Mo.1972), <em>citing Tomingas v. Douglas Aircraft Co., </em>45 F.R.D. 94 (S.D.N.Y. 1968). At the time of the deposition Shoen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>er was a general manager for MoPac and had responsibility for 56,000 employees and 4,300 miles of track. Shoener had \u201csufficient power and discretion to be classified a 'managing agent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colonial Capital Co. v. General Motors Corp., </em>29 F.R.D. 514, 518 (D.Conn.1961). Therefore, his deposition was admissible under Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The district court, however, did not commit reversible error. Federal appellate courts have held that the exclusion of deposition evidence is harmless if the material matters covered in the deposition are covered, or could have been covered, at trial. \u201cEven if the deposition was properly admissible under [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 32(a)(2) [pertaining to \u201cmanaging agents\u201d], we believe that any possible error was not prejudicial and was in fact harmless. The deposition contains no information that [the witness\u2019] live testimony could not supply.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Chevron Chemical Co., </em>679 F.2d 463, 466 (5th Cir.1982); <em>see Fenstermacher v. Philadelphia National Bank, </em>493 F.2d 333, 338 (3d Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\n<em>Admission of Shoener\u2019s Handwritten Notes and Internal Investigative Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in admitting into evidence, as business records, handwritten notes and an investigative report prepared by Shoener, based on his observations and conversations with appellant, Austin, MoPac staff, and others because (1) the notes and report were not contemporaneously prepared, (2) the investigation report was prepared for use in litigation or an adversary proceeding, and (3) the statements contained therein were clearly hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit. The record does not support appellant\u2019s assertion that these documents are hearsay. MoPac offered the documents to demonstrate that MoPac had conducted an investigation and to disclose the information that MoPac had relied on in making its decision. The records were not offered to prove the truthfulness of the statements contained therein. <em>See Moore v. Sears Roebuck and Company, </em>683 F.2d 1321, 1322 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Even if we accept appellant\u2019s argument that the records are hearsay, they are admissible under the business records exception. MoPac had a written policy requiring that in an investigation of sexual harassment the conversations of those interviewed \u201cshould be documented through written memoranda.\u201d Shoener was directed to conduct an investigation and to prepare such memoranda. Shoener took handwritten notes during the interviews and added to them shortly after the interviews. The typewritten report was prepared from the notes. Only six or seven days elapsed from the beginning of the investigation to the completion of the report. The notes and report were prepared nine months before any complaint or suit had been filed and the notes and report were maintained at the MoPac office. Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). <em>See Gibbs v. State Farm Mutual Insurance Co., </em>544 F.2d 423, 428 (9th Cir.1976); <em>Smith v. Universal Service, Inc., </em>454 F.2d 154, 157-58 (5th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">\n<em>Judicial Notice of an EEOC Regulation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">Appellant argues that the court erred (1) in taking judicial notice of an EEOC regulation on sexual harassment, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.11<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because violation of an EEOC regulation was not an issue in this case and (2) in incorrectly presenting the regulation as having the force of law and as imposing strict liability on an employer for the sexual harassment of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">Appellant\u2019s arguments are without merit. The district court may take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>judicial notice of the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507 (1982) (Federal Register maybe judicially noticed); <em>Wei v. Robinson, </em>246 F.2d 739, 743 (7th Cir.1957) (Code of Federal Regulations and the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed); <em>Kempe v. United States, </em>151 F.2d 680, 684 (8th Cir.1945). MoPac offered the regulation to show that MoPac could be liable for the action of its employees who sexually harass other employees. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Appellant\u2019s other point of error is that the district court described the regulation to the jury as having the force of law and as imposing strict liability on employers. Appellant is correct in his assertions that EEOC regulations do not have the force of law, <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 141, 97 S.Ct. 401, 410, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976), and that the employer is not strictly liable for all types of sexual harassment. <em>Katz v. Dole, </em>709 F.2d 251, 255 (4th Cir.1983); <em>Henson v. City of Dundee, </em>682 F.2d 897, 909-10 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Bundy v. Jackson, </em>641 F.2d 934, 943 (D.C. Cir.1981). This case, however, involves \u201cquid pro quo\u201d sexual harassment, <em>i.e., </em>a supervisor allegedly requested sexual favors in exchange for job benefits. <em>Henson v. City of Dundee, </em>682 F.2d at 908 n. 18. Many cases have held that \u201cquid pro quo\u201d sexual harassment violates Title VII and that the employer is strictly liable. <em>Katz v. Dole, </em>709 F.2d at 255 n. 6; <em>Henson v. City of Dundee, </em>682 F.2d at 910; <em>Bundy v. Jackson, </em>641 F.2d at 943; <em>Miller v. Bank of America, </em>600 F.2d 211, 213 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>Barnes v. Costle, </em>561 F.2d 983, 993 (D.C.Cir.1977). Therefore, the district court did not misstate the law on sexual harassment as it pertains to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">\n<em>Refusal to Permit Witness to Testify on the Ultimate Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in refusing to permit appellant\u2019s witness J.D. Boling to testify that he believed appellant\u2019s age was a factor in his termination while permitting Shoener and Hestes to testify. The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence. <em>Bohannon v. Pegelow, </em>652 F.2d 729, 732 (7th Cir.1981). Fed.R.Evid. 701(a) permits a lay witness to give opinion testimony only if his opinion is rationally based on his perception. Boling had been Assistant Superintendent under appellant for fifteen years, but he had no firsthand knowledge of the factors involved in MoPac\u2019s decision to remove appellant. Shoener and Hestes on the other hand were not asked to give opinion testimony but were asked to testify as to what they did, <em>i.e., </em>whether they considered appellant\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">\n<em>Denial of Argument Concerning a Photograph</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in prohibiting comment and argument on a photograph of Austin\u2019s living room, which showed a wall-mounted picture of Zig-Zag paper<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and could suggest the possible use of marijuana. The district court-prohibited any reference to the possible use of marijuana as having no probative value on the issue of truthfulness. The court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"AoX\">\n<em>Verdict Director Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Appellant argues that the verdict director instruction misled and confused the jury because it misstated the law, did not address material issues in the case, contained facts that had no factual or legal basis, and was biased in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">The law in this and other circuits is clear on the standard of appellate review of jury instructions. Instructions must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u201cread as a whole and considered in light of the entire charge.\u201d <em>Tribble v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>669 F.2d 1193, 1197 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1080, 103 S.Ct. 1767, 76 L.Ed.2d 342 (1983); <em>King v. State Farm Life Insurance Co., </em>448 F.2d 597, 600, 601 (8th Cir.1971). When the charge is considered as a whole, it should state the \u201cgoverning law fairly and correctly\u201d and should not be \u201cinflammatory or unfair or prejudicial\u201d to either the plaintiff or the defendant. <em>Hartman v. United States, </em>538 F.2d 1336, 1346 (8th Cir.1976). \u201cWhere the instructions, considered as a whole, adequately and sufficiently state the generally applicable law, the fact that the instructions are technically imperfect or are not a model of clarity does not render the charge erroneous.\u201d <em>Tribble v. Westinghouse, </em>669 F.2d at 1197; <em>see Garnatz v. Stifel, Nicholaus &amp; Co., </em>559 F.2d 1357, 1362 (8th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 951, 98 S.Ct. 1578, 55 L.Ed.2d 801 (1978). Each of the deficiencies claimed by appellant will be reviewed against this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Appellant argues first that the district court erred in requiring him to prove as part of his prima facie case that he had complied with MoPac\u2019s rules and regulations. Appellant argues that the plaintiff need not anticipate and refute the employer\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons in order to establish his prima facie case. Appellant argues that such proof is inconsistent with the prima facie case set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) <em>(McDonnell Douglas). </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The indirect method of proof of discrimination approved by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1095, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) <em>(Burdine), </em>is but one way of establishing a case of employment discrimination. <em>Halsell v. Kimberly Clark Corp., </em>683 F.2d 285, 290 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1205, 103 S.Ct. 1194, 75 L.Ed.2d 438 (1983). <em>\u201cMcDonnell-Douglas </em>was never intended to be rigid, mechanized or ritualistic. Rather it is merely a sensible orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination.\u201d <em>United States Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">In <em>Halsell v. Kimberly Clark Corp., </em>683 F.2d at 290, this court adopted the First Circuit\u2019s modification of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Burdine </em>formulas for discriminatory discharge claims set forth in <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1003, 1013-14 (1st Cir.1979). In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, the plaintiff must \u201cprove that he [or she] was in the protected age group, that he [or she] was performing his [or her] job at a level that met [the] employer\u2019s legitimate expectations, that he [or she] was nevertheless fired, and that [the] employer sought someone to perform the same work after he [or she] left.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1014. Unlike hiring eases in which the issue is whether the plaintiff was qualified for the job, the issue in discharge cases is whether the plaintiff was satisfactorily performing the job. As noted by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Douglas v. Anderson, </em>656 F.2d 528, 533 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1981), \u201c[t]he issue of satisfactory job performance permeates the prima facie case as well as the rebuttal and pretext issues. In establishing a prima facie case, [the plaintiff] need only produce substantial evidence of satisfactory job performance sufficient to create a jury question on this issue.\u201d Thus, consistent with <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Burdine, </em>we hold that in order to establish a prima facie case, the plaintiff need only prove that \u201che [or she] was doing his [or her] job well enough to rule out the possibility that he [or she] was fired for inadequate job performance.\u201d <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d at 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">For this reason, we hold that the district court erred in instructing the jury that appellant was required to prove compliance with MoPac\u2019s rules and regulations in order to establish a prima facie case. As discussed above, appellant produced substantial evidence that he had performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>satisfactorily as superintendent, at least until the incident in question in October 1981. This evidence was sufficient to establish a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Appellant argues that this instruction error mandates reversal because the jury could have improperly found that appellant did not prove compliance with MoPac\u2019s rules and regulations and thus failed to establish a prima facie case. Ordinarily such an instruction error would be grounds for reversal. However, we think the instruction error was harmless in this case. In the present case, the evidence that appellant was discharged for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is very strong and undermines any inference of discrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> MoPac introduced uncontradicted evidence that it had received a complaint that appellant had sexually harassed a subordinate and that it had conducted an investigation of the complaint. Appellant attempted to demonstrate pretext by attacking the credibility of the complaining employee and by showing minor inconsistencies in the statements of MoPac\u2019s witnesses. None of appellant\u2019s evidence, even if accepted as true, establishes that MoPac discharged appellant because of his age. In the present case, we are concerned not with whether MoPac was correct in its determination that appellant sexually harassed a subordinate, but only with whether this was the real reason for the termination and not a pretext for age discrimination. <em>Douglas v. Anderson, </em>656 F.2d at 533 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Appellant next argues that the court failed to submit to the jury all the reasons offered by MoPac to justify appellant\u2019s termination. Specifically, the instruction did not include an alleged theft of cedar posts and a grain spill as reasons for termination. Appellant argues that the inclusion of these reasons would have permitted the jury to find that all of the reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">The employer in an ADEA case must articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, which is specific and clear enough for the employee to address, <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 255, 101 S.Ct. at 1094; <em>Halsell v. Kimberly Clark Corp., </em>683 F.2d at 292, and legally sufficient to justify a judgment for the employer, <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 255, 101 S.Ct. 1094. The employer must demonstrate reasonable factors other than age for discharge. <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d at 1011. The jury, in order to find for the defendant, must find that the articulated reasons are not pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">In the present case appellant may not complain of error when his proposed instruction (No. 19) did not list the grain spill or theft as reasons for termination. In addition, appellant did not specifically object to the exclusion of these factors from the district court\u2019s instruction. Fed.R.Civ.P. 51; <em>Goodman v. Heublein, Inc., </em>645 F.2d 127, 131 (2d Cir.1981). Furthermore, even if appellant had properly preserved this issue for review, there is no error because MoPac offered only one reason for appellant\u2019s termination. This reason \u2014 the sexual harassment of a subordinate \u2014 was the subject of the investigation, was stated in the service letter and was articulated at trial. The theft of cedar posts and the grain spill incidents occurred in 1974 (seven years before the sexual harassment complaint) and MoPac took no disciplinary action against appellant. Evidence of these incidents was offered by MoPac to impeach appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">Appellant next argues that the district court erred in stating that the reason offered by MoPac for termination was a good faith belief that plaintiff had sexually harassed an employee under appellant\u2019s supervision. Appellant argues that the district court in effect made a preliminary finding that MoPac had a good faith belief and took from the jury the task of deciding if MoPac articulated a legitimate, non-dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>criminatory reason. As a result appellant argues that he could not establish pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">An employer in an ADEA case must produce evidence that its action was based upon \u201creasonable factors other than age\u201d or \u201cgood cause.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(1), (3); <em>Halsell v. Kimberly Clark Corp., </em>683 F.2d at 291; <em>Smith v. Farah Manufacturing Co., </em>650 F.2d 64, 67-68 (5th Cir.1981). It is not \u201cenough to offer vague, general averments of good faith \u2014 a plaintiff cannot be expected to disprove a defendant\u2019s reasons unless they have been articulated with some specificity.\u201d <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d at 1012-13 n. 5. The employer, however, \u201cneed not persuade the [trier of fact] that the proffered reason in fact justified the discharge because the issue is not whether the reason articulated by the employer warranted the discharge but whether the employer acted for a non-discriminatory reason.\u201d <em>Halsell v. Kimberly Clark Corp., </em>683 F.2d at 291; <em>see Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">We have found no cases which specifically address the question whether an employer\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d for discharge in an ADEA case may be based on \u201cgood faith\u201d alone. We do not decide this issue because the resolution of the question is not essential to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The district court\u2019s instructions read as a whole in the context of this case are not prejudicially erroneous. MoPac presented substantial evidence that appellant was discharged for reasons other than age and that MoPac\u2019s action was not based on \u201cgood faith belief\u201d alone. MoPac conducted a rather detailed investigation, prepared a formal investigation report, and sought advice from MoPac\u2019s legal staff. MoPac therefore had a reasonable basis for its action. MoPac did not have to prove that appellant in fact sexually harassed an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Appellant next argues that the instruction was erroneous because it was written in the negative, was unbalanced in favor of the defendant, and incorrectly gave the impression that plaintiff\u2019s task was an onerous one. We have carefully reviewed the instructions and find these arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">\n<em>Circumstantial Evidence Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in refusing its proposed jury instruction on circumstantial evidence. Appellant asserts that this instruction was necessary because a key element in appellant\u2019s case was the motivation of MoPac, which could only be proven by circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-15\">Appellant cites no authority and we have found none for the proposition that a court in a civil case must give a circumstantial evidence instruction if requested to do so. <em>Movible Offshore Co. v. Ousley, </em>346 F.2d 870, 874 (5th Cir.1965). The district court instructed the jury that it was to consider all the evidence presented by both parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-16\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-14\">.
