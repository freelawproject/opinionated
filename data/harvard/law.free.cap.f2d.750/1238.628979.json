We find no merit in his contentions, and we affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-8\">Petitioner was convicted in a bifurcated jury trial in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Virginia, in January 1980 of the capital murder of five year old Harvey Barton during the commission of an armed robbery, and the capital murder of Judy Barton, Harvey\u2019s mother, during the commission of or subsequent to rape,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as several other non-capital crimes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the penalty stage of the bifurcated trial, the jury recommended death for both capital murders, and the state trial court imposed sentence accordingly. On direct appeal the Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed Briley\u2019s convictions and sentences, <em>(James Dyral) Briley v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 563, 273 S.E.2d 57 (1980), and Briley did not seek certiorari from the United States Supreme Court. Petitioner filed for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on March 5, 1981; the district court dismissed that petition. This Circuit on appeal stayed execution and remanded with instructions to retain jurisdiction and hold the case in abeyance pending completion of petitioner\u2019s state habeas corpus proceedings, instituted on March 16, 1981. Our stay has heretofore remained in effect. The state circuit court dismissed all but two of petitioner\u2019s numerous collateral claims without a hearing, and rejected the remaining two, including an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, following an evidentiary hearing. The Virginia Supreme Court, in an unpublished opinion refusing Briley\u2019s petition to appeal, found no error in the rulings below, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, 460 U.S. 1103, 103 S.Ct. 1804, 76 L.Ed.2d 367 (1983). Petitioner filed on June 3, 1983 the amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus which is the subject of this appeal. The district court, pursuant to an extensive magistrate\u2019s opinion, dismissed that petition on June 22, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-13\">We need not recount the facts of these brutal murders on the evening of October 19, 1979, involving James Briley, his brothers Linwood<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Anthony, and their sixteen year old accomplice Duncan Eric Meekins, as this background is fully discussed in the opinion of the Virginia Supreme Court. <em>See </em>273 S.E.2d at 58-60. Petitioner did not testify at trial, and the Commonwealth relied principally on the testimony of Meekins, who had entered into a plea bargain with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-14\">On this appeal, petitioner presents multiple claims of error in three categories:</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-15\">1) constitutionality of jury instructions and other procedures at the penalty stage of the bifurcated trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>2) exclusion of prospective jurors on the basis of inability to impose the death penalty; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">3) ineffective assistance of counsel. We shall consider these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">Analysis of petitioner\u2019s first claim requires a brief review of the Virginia capital sentencing statute. Once a defendant has been found guilty at the first stage of a bifurcated trial of one or more of the classes of capital murder enumerated in Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-31, the trial proceeds to the penalty stage. Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3. Virginia law requires that the jury at the penalty stage find either of two specific aggravating circumstances proven beyond a reasonable doubt before the death penalty can be imposed. These aggravating circumstances are:</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">a) \u201cthat there is a probability [based upon consideration of the defendant\u2019s past criminal record] that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society;\u201d or</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-9\">b) \u201cthat his conduct in committing the offense ... was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2(1). <em>See also </em>Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4C, D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">If one or both of these circumstances are present, the jury must still decide whether to recommend the death penalty. Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2(2). In doing so, the jury is required to consider \u201cthe evidence in mitigation of the offense,\u201d as stated on the statutory jury verdict forms. Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4D. The Virginia Supreme Court has held that, notwithstanding a showing of aggravating circumstances, the jury is at liberty under the capital sentencing statute to recommend life imprisonment. <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 248 S.E.2d 135, 150 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967, 99 S.Ct. 2419, 60 L.Ed.2d 1074 (1979). A list of five non-exclusive mitigating circumstances appears in the statute,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but the defense is permitted to introduce any evidence relevant to the penalty decision, including \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the offense, the history and background of the defendant, and any other facts in mitigation of the offense.\u201d Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-15\">At the penalty stage of Briley\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth presented two witnesses, a former police officer and a state records custodian, who testified concerning James Briley\u2019s prior convictions for armed robbery and attempted shooting of a police officer, and Briley\u2019s record while in prison. The defense offered one witness, Briley\u2019s parole officer, who testified that Briley had a good employment record following his release from prison in August 1979, and had appeared before a state judge for a parole hearing on the day of the Barton murders. The trial judge then instructed the jury, stating the aggravating circumstances and explaining the statutory jury verdict forms for each capital murder. Fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>lowing instructions and closing arguments by the Commonwealth and defense, the jury retired. After three quarters of an hour, the jury returned its verdicts, fixing Briley\u2019s punishment for both capital murders at death. The court polled the jury, and each juror affirmed that he or she had found both aggravating circumstances to exist and agreed with the verdicts for both offenses. At no time during trial was any objection taken by the defense to the form of the instructions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">Petitioner\u2019s initial claim is that the instructions given by the trial judge to the jury at the penalty stage of the trial were constitutionally flawed because they failed to inform the jury adequately of its option to recommend life imprisonment and its obligation to consider mitigating circumstances. We find, however, that the instructions as given, reprinted in full at Appendix A of this opinion, present no constitutional error, and therefore reject petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">A. Petitioner focuses on a single phrase in the instructions as the foundation of his claim that the jury was not informed adequately of the option to recommend life imprisonment. After presenting the two aggravating circumstances for the first time, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-7\">\u201cIf you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proven beyond a reasonable doubt either of the two alternatives, then <em>you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at death; </em>or if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified, then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at life imprisonment.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">Standing alone, the mandatory \u201cshall\u201d would pose constitutional difficulties, suggesting to a jury that a finding of an aggravating circumstance required imposition of the death penalty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No statute or instruction may strip from the jury its power of life. Mandatory death sentences are unconstitutional, condemned by the Supreme Court in <em>Roberts v. Louisiana, </em>428 U.S. 325, 96 S.Ct. 3001, 49 L.Ed.2d 974 (1976) and <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976) as violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because of their \u201clack of focus on the circumstances of the particular offense and the character and propensities of the offender,\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>428 U.S. at 333, 96 S.Ct. at 3006 (opinion of Stewart, Powell and Stevens, JJ.). It is clear that a sentencing jury must be allowed, in all but the rarest kind of capital cases, to consider as a mitigating factor \u201cany aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2964, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (opinion of Burger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>C.J.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See also Bell v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 637, 642, 98 S.Ct. 2977, 2980, 57 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1978) (opinion of Burger, C.J.). A capital sentencing system which allowed the jury to consider only aggravating circumstances would be barred under <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976), because of its similarity to the mandatory laws held unconstitutional in <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Roberts. Jurek, </em>428 U.S. at 271, 96 S.Ct. at 2956 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">In reviewing these instructions, however, we bear in mind that \u201ca single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\u201d <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973). Reviewing courts must resist the temptation to read jury instructions myopically. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Henderson v. Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 154, 97 S.Ct. 1730, 1736, 52 L.Ed.2d 203 (1977), the \u201cburden of demonstrating that an erroneous instruction was so prejudicial that it will support a collateral attack on the constitutional validity of a state court\u2019s judgment is even greater than the showing required to establish plain error on direct appeal.\u201d The governing standard is that stated in <em>Cupp, </em>\u201cwhether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process,\u201d 414 U.S. at 147, 94 S.Ct. at 400, and not merely whether the instruction is \u201cundesirable, erroneous, or even \u2018universally condemned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 94 S.Ct. at 400. We note also that \u201c[i]t is the rare case in which an improper instruction will justify reversal of a criminal conviction when no objection has been made in the trial court.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>431 U.S. at 154, 97 S.Ct. at 1736. <em>See also United States v. McCaskill, </em>676 F.2d 995, 1002 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1018, 103 S.Ct. 381, 74 L.Ed.2d 513 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-12\">Taken as a whole, the instructions leave no doubt that the jury was free to recommend life imprisonment. Immediately after the language in question, the trial judge instructed the jury that \u201cif you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified,\u201d life imprisonment should be imposed. <em>All the evidence, </em>we believe, necessarily means that the jury was to consider the evidence presented in mitigation as well as that in aggravation in reaching its decision. A contrary interpretation, in which inquiry ceased after the finding of an aggravating circumstance, would have rendered the presentation of the case in mitigation by the defense inexplicable to the jury, as the evidence was irrelevant to either of the statutory aggravating circumstances. Our view finds further support in the trial judge\u2019s reading of the statutory jury verdict forms for each of the capital murders, which contained the phrases \u201chaving considered the evidence in mitigation of the offense\u201d and \u201chaving considered all the evidence in aggravation and mitigation of such offense.\u201d This language is mandated by Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-264.-4D and was also embodied in the written verdict forms upon which the jury rendered its sentencing decision for each murder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>Thus, the jury was instructed no less than five times to consider \u201call the evidence,\u201d the evidence in \u201cmitigation,\u201d or both, in arriving at its verdicts. The instructions leave the definite impression that the jury was to take into account such evidence as was presented in mitigation and to exercise discretion in reaching a verdict on sentencing, rather than automatically imposing the death sentence upon finding an aggravating circumstance. Petitioner\u2019s contention falls far short of satisfying the standard of <em>Cupp </em>and <em>Henderson </em>for reversal on collateral review, that \u201cthe ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">B. Petitioner contends that the trial judge\u2019s failure to offer a fuller explanation of the concept of mitigation renders the sentences unconstitutional. We disagree. The Supreme Court has never attempted to prescribe the precise form that state jury instructions must take. <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) requires that a jury be given guidance in reaching the sentencing decision, 428 U.S. at 192-93, 96 S.Ct. at 2934 (opinion of Stewart, Powell and Stevens, JJ.). This condition is satisfied, however, where there exists a \u201ccarefully drafted statute\u201d and \u201cthe sentencing authority is required to specify the factors it relied upon in reaching its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 96 S.Ct. at 2935. Here, the jury\u2019s discretion was channeled by the necessity of finding at least one of the specific aggravating circumstances before capital punishment could be considered. Although the trial judge did not instruct the jury on any of the non-exclusive statutory mitigating circumstances, the defense had not sought such an instruction nor offered any evidence to justify it. Moreover, under <em>Hutchins v. Garrison, </em>724 F.2d 1425, 1436-37 (4th Cir.1983), the propriety of such an instruction was purely a matter of state law and not cognizable by a federal court on habeas review. Instructing on the specific mitigating circumstances might even have been harmful to Briley in certain respects. For example, referring to the \u201cno significant history of prior criminal activity\u201d circumstance, Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4B(i), would only have served to focus still further attention on Briley\u2019s substantial record of serious offenses, including armed robbery and attempted murder of a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">Petitioner\u2019s inadequate guidance claim rests on several decisions of the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits, <em>see Westbrook v. Zant, </em>704 F.2d 1487, 1503 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Goodwin v. Balkcom, </em>684 F.2d 794, 801-03 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1098, 103 S.Ct. 1798, 76 L.Ed.2d 364 (1983); <em>Spivey v. Zant, </em>661 F.2d 464, 471-72 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>458 U.S. 1111, 102 S.Ct. 3495, 73 L.Ed.2d 1374 (1982); <em>Chenault v. Stynchcombe, </em>581 F.2d 444, 448 (5th Cir. 1978), which evidence a willingness to engage in detailed scrutiny of state jury instructions on collateral review. <em>Spivey, </em>for example, mandates that the state judge in most cases \u201cclearly and explicitly instruct the jury about mitigating circumstances and the option to recommend against death; in order to do so, the judge will normally tell the jury what a mitigating circumstance is and what its function is in the jury\u2019s sentencing deliberations.\u201d 661 F.2d at 471. All the cases upon which petitioner relies, however, were decided prior to <em>Zant v. Stephens, </em>462 U.S. 862, 103 S.Ct. 2733, 77 L.Ed.2d 235 (1983), in which the Supreme Court ruled that \u201cthe Constitution does not require a State to adopt specific standards for instructing the jury in its consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 2750. <em>See also id </em>at 2742 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">Under <em>Zant, </em>\u201c[wjhat is important at the selection stage is an <em>individualized </em>determination on the basis .of the character of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>the individual and the circumstances of the crime,\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 2743-44 (emphasis in original), and the \u201cabsence of legislative or court-imposed standards to govern the jury in weighing the significance\u201d of the various factors is not dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 2744. It is inappropriate for the federal courts on collateral review to go beyond the correction of fundamental errors implicating due process rights and attempt to prescribe the particular form which state jury instructions on mitigation must take, becoming mired in the nuances of definition and technicalities of draftsmanship. We hold that the instructions given here satisfied the essential requirements of due process under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, in that they did not render the death sentence in any way mandatory or preclude consideration of any relevant mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">C. Next, petitioner contends that the aggravating circumstance of conduct \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman,\u201d Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2(1), has not been sufficiently defined by the Virginia Supreme Court or explained by the trial court\u2019s instructions so as to \u201cgenuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty,\u201d as required by <em>Zant v. Stephens, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2742-43. He relies upon <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980), which reversed a death sentence where the Georgia courts had applied so broad and vague a construction of a statutory \u201cvileness\u201d aggravating circumstance as to allow the death penalty to be imposed in virtually any murder case. 446 U.S. at 428-29, 432-33, 100 S.Ct. at 1764-65, 1766-67 (opinion of Stewart, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-8\">Petitioner\u2019s case is different from <em>Godfrey. </em>Petitioner\u2019s conduct was found to fit all three \u201cvileness\u201d subcategories of \u201ctorture,\u201d \u201cdepravity of mind,\u201d and \u201caggravated battery,\u201d while only the \u201cdepravity of mind\u201d subeategory was potentially applicable to the defendant in <em>Godfrey. See </em>446 U.S. at 432-33, 100 S.Ct. at 1766-67. Furthermore, petitioner was not sentenced to death solely on the basis of a finding of the \u201cvileness\u201d circumstance alone, as in <em>Godfrey, </em>but also on the basis of the alternative aggravating circumstance of future dangerousness, a \u201cprobability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d Va.Code \u00a7 19.-2-264.2(1). The constitutionality of this alternative ground is beyond question, as an identical provision in the Texas capital sentencing statute was upheld in <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 272-74, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 2956-57, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (opinion of Stewart, Powell and Stevens, JJ.). Thus, even if the \u201cvileness\u201d circumstance were somehow unconstitutionally applied,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which we do not suggest, we would not be required to vacate the death sentence under <em>Zant v. Stephens, </em>which holds that \u201ca death sentence supported by at least one valid aggravating circumstance need not be set aside ... simply because another aggravating circumstance is \u2018invalid\u2019 in the sense that it is insufficient by itself to support the death penalty.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 103 S.Ct. at 2746. We have recently dealt with and rejected a similar challenge to a \u201cvileness\u201d instruction in <em>(Linwood E.) Briley v. Bass, </em>742 F.2d 155, 165-66 (4th Cir.1984), and we find petitioner\u2019s claim no more persuasive.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>D. Petitioner\u2019s final contention concerning the sentencing procedures is that the jury verdict forms were unconstitutionally ambiguous, in that they stated the two aggravating circumstances conjunctively or in the alternative, employing the term \u201cand/or.\u201d Supposedly, the jury was thereby permitted to return a verdict which was not unanimous on a particular aggravating circumstance. The prosecutor\u2019s argument suggesting the propriety of a nonunanimous verdict on the two circumstances, petitioner argues, compounded this error. Since the jury was polled after the verdicts were rendered, however, and each juror affirmed that both aggravating circumstances were present beyond a reasonable doubt, any error is moot, as we recognized in rejecting a similar claim in <em>(Linwood E.) Briley v. Bass, 142, </em>F.2d at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">Petitioner\u2019s second category of issues relates to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of two prospective jurors whose reservations about the death penalty allegedly did not rise to the level of opposition required for exclusion under <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968). We find, however, that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding both jurors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\"><em>Witherspoon </em>holds that a juror may not be excluded merely because of conscientious scruples about capital punishment, if he is willing to <em>\u201cconsider </em>all of the penalties provided by state law,\u201d and is not \u201cirrevocably committed, before the trial has begun, to vote against the penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings.\u201d 391 U.S. at 522 <em>&amp; </em>n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1777 &amp; n. 21 (emphasis in original). A state is not barred from excluding jurors who have made it \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d that they would automatically vote against the imposition of the death penalty without regard to the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 522 n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1777 n. 21. In <em>Keeten v. Garrison, </em>742 F.2d 129, 135 (4th Cir.1984), we ruled that the question of whether a juror should be stricken under <em>Witherspoon </em>is \u201ccommitted to the trial court\u2019s discretion,\u201d and will only be reversed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See also (Linwood E.) Briley v. Booker, </em>746 F.2d 225, 227 (4th Cir.1984). This is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Patton v. Yount, </em>- U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984), which holds that juror impartiality is a question of historical fact, due a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) where there is \u201cfair support in the record.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2891-93. The Court recognized that it is not unusual on <em>voir dire </em>examination for the testimony of jurors to be ambiguous or even contradictory, and that the trial judge \u201cis best suited to determine competency to serve impartially.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2893. It is equally reasonable, where some statements by a juror are equivocal and others demonstrate an unwillingness to impose the death penalty in any case, to rely on the trial court\u2019s discretion in determining which responses best manifested the juror\u2019s true opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-12\">One of the jurors in question, Ms. Joyce Candies, asserted that she did not believe in the death penalty. Asked whether she would \u201chang the jury\u201d rather than impose the death penalty, she was initially uncertain, but finally responded that she would. Furthermore, in response to defense counsel\u2019s questions about whether she could not impose the death penalty regardless of the circumstances or the \u201coverwhelming\u201d evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>dence, Candies stated, \u201cThis is the way I feel right now,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t think I could.\u201d We find that the evidence was plainly sufficient to justify the exclusion of Candies under the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">The other juror, Ms. Mary Revere, also stated that she did not believe in the death penalty on \u201cconscientious\u201d grounds. The court asked whether, if she were \u201cabsolutely positive\u201d that the imposition of the death penalty was proper in this case, she would \u201chang the jury\u201d before surrendering a conscientious scruple, and she twice responded, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d When asked by defense counsel whether there was no way she could impose the death sentence no matter how bad a particular case, Revere answered, \u201cWell, I say rather than the death sentence, I don\u2019t say turn him out, but punish him.\u201d There was thus ample reason to believe that this juror would not vote to impose the death penalty in any circumstance, and we find that her exclusion was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">Petitioner also contends that the exclusion of any venire member because of his or her attitude toward the death penalty is unconstitutional because it produces a conviction-prone jury. We rejected an identical argument in <em>Keeten, </em>742 F.2d at 133-34, and that decision is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-8\">We turn finally to petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at both the guilt and penalty stages of the trial. The conduct of petitioner\u2019s trial co-counsel, Mr. Hayes and Mr. Turner, has been extensively reviewed by both the Virginia state courts on collateral attack, with the benefit of an evidentiary hearing, and by the magistrate at the district court proceedings below, and none of these reviewing authorities have found counsel to have been inadequate to their task. Nevertheless, we have undertaken our own review of the record in light of the numerous allegations of ineffective assistance presented by petitioner, and we find those allegations meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"AGL\"><em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), provides the framework for analysis of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Attorneys are held to an objective standard of \u201creasonably effective assistance\u201d under \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65. The Court in <em>Strickland </em>emphasized that \u201c[\u00a1Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential,\u201d and that \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d viewing the case as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct rather than in hindsight, and recognizing counsel\u2019s discretion in the shaping of trial strategy. <em>Id. </em>at 2065-66. Furthermore, prejudice to the defense must be present for reversal. <em>Strickland </em>requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1319-15\">\u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1319-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-17\">A. We need not review in detail each of petitioner\u2019s multifarious ineffective assistance claims deriving from the guilt stage of his trial. The actions of counsel, examined under <em>Strickland, </em>are largely attributable to trial strategy, and it is inappropriate for us to second-guess the outcome of such decisions. More importantly, petitioner has altogether failed, in any instance, to satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d element by showing a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the outcome of the trial would have differed had counsel followed the courses he now recommends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-18\">B. According to petitioner, the most egregious failures of trial counsel occurred at the penalty stage, and we thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>direct our primary attention to that portion of the trial. The alleged ineffectiveness takes two forms: i) failure to present evidence in mitigation, and ii) failure to object to the jury instructions given by the trial judge. As we have resolved the constitutional validity of the jury instructions on the merits in part II, <em>supra, </em>we need not address the latter aspect of petitioner\u2019s ineffectiveness claim further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">During the penalty stage of the trial defense counsel introduced only one mitigation witness, Briley\u2019s parole officer, whose testimony principally served to establish that Briley had a good employment record after his release from prison in August 1979 and had kept in contact with the parole officer as required. Counsel was not otherwise inactive during this stage of the trial, however. The police officer involved in Briley\u2019s prior murder attempt was cross-examined, and it was established that Briley was only sixteen at the time of that offense and that the officer was never actually harmed. Cross-examination of the state records custodian revealed that while Briley had committed several minor offenses while in prison, none involved violence, and Briley had sought to learn a trade and earned substantial time off his sentence for good conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">Petitioner now asserts, as he did at the hearing on his ineffectiveness claim in state court, that other mitigation witnesses might have been called to testify, including family members, co-workers, and corrections personnel. With the exception of his mother, however, he has never established how any of those potential witnesses might have testified had they been called. Mrs. Briley testified at the state habeas hearing about her relationship with her son and his behavior at home and after release from prison. The principal advantage that might have been gained by calling her as a witness at the penalty stage would have been jury sympathy. We do not minimize the importance of such sympathy during the sentencing phase, but petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not believe that the mother\u2019s testimony would have been helpful in Briley\u2019s situation, given that he had been released from prison less than two months before the Barton murders. Even if this additional mitigating evidence might have been helpful, it certainly does not suggest a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the result reached by the jury would have differed had they been exposed to it. Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not present a strong case in mitigation, but the fault lies with the intrinsic lack of suitable mitigating evidence rather than the neglect of counsel in finding it. We find that petitioner received effective assistance of counsel at the penalty stage of his trial under the <em>Strickland </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-8\">Having examined with care all of petitioner\u2019s allegations of error, we are of the opinion that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be affirmed. The stay of execution shall be dissolved upon issuance of the mandate. We direct that issuance of the mandate be stayed pending timely application for review by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-10\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-11\">THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the Court will now instruct you as to the punishment aspect of the case. You have convicted the defendant of an offense which may be punishable by death. You must decide whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-12\">Before the penalty can be fixed at death, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of the following two alternatives: One, that, after consideration of his past criminal record, there is a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing, serious threat to society; or, two, that his conduct in committing the offense was outrageous and wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or aggravated battery to the victim beyond the minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>necessary to accomplish the act of murder. If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proven beyond a reasonable doubt either or the two alternatives, then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at death; or if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified, then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at life imprisonment. If the Commonwealth has failed to prove either alternative beyond a reasonable doubt, then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-4\">You have, you have really found him guilty of two capital murders. This one instruction will take care of both capital murders. That\u2019s what you must find.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">Then I give you the forms of your verdict, which read: We, the jury, on the issues joined, having found the defendant guilty of capital murder of Judy Diane Barton, the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon, and having found that, now you will have to scratch out what you do not find. In other words, you will use your pencil or pen and just scratch that out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">One, after consideration of his past criminal record, that there is a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing, serious threat to society and/or you can find both or one. His conduct in committing the offense is outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that, it involved torture, depravity of mind, aggravated battery of the victim beyond the minimum necessary to accomplish the act of murder, and having considered the evidence in mitigation of the offense, unanimously fix his punishment at death; or, we, the jury, on the issues joined, having found the defendant guilty of capital murder of Judy Diane Barton during the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon and having considered all of the evidence in aggravation and mitigation of such offense, fix his punishment at imprisonment for life. In any event, your foreperson will find that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-9\">You will also have another verdict on Harvey Wayne Barton, which is, and won\u2019t cross out the same thing: We, the jury, on the issues joined, having found the defendant guilty of capital murder of Harvey Wayne Barton during the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon and having found that, then you must find one of these two things, or both. After consideration of his past criminal record, that there is a probability that he will commit criminal acts of violence that will constitute a continuing, serious threat to society or, and/or his conduct in committing the offense is outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, and that means depravity of mind, aggravated battery of the victim beyond a minimum necessary to accomplish the act of murder, and having considered the evidence in mitigation of the offense, unanimously fix his punishment at death; or, we, the jury, on the issues joined, having found the defendant guilty of capital murder of Harvey Wayne Barton during the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon and having considered all the evidence in aggravation and mitigation of such offense, fix his punishment at imprisonment for life.

Petitioner first challenged the jury instructions in issue III of his state habeas petition. The Virginia courts disposed of this issue on collateral review, however, on the alternative grounds of procedural forfeiture, <em>Slayton v.
