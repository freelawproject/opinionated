(\u201cCharter Oak\u201d) appeals the order of the district court entering judgment in favor of appellee Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance Co. (\u201cSumitomo\u201d). Charter Oak, appellant in this case, insured John D. Wodarski and Wodarski Sled and Cycle Shak, and Sumitomo, appellee, insured Yamaha Motor Co. Charter Oak settled a judgment against its insured in a state court action in which Raymond Peterson sued Wodarski and Yamaha for damages resulting from a snowmobile accident. In this diversity case Charter Oak asserts that Sumitomo wrongfully failed to defend it in the action and indemnify it for the amount paid in settlement. The district court conducted a bench trial in the case and entered an order dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>missing Charter Oak\u2019s action on the basis of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Peterson sued Wodarski, an authorized dealer in products designed and manufactured by Yamaha, and Yamaha, in the Common Pleas Court of Erie County, Pennsylvania for injuries sustained by him while operating a snowmobile manufactured by Yamaha and sold to him by Wodarski. Peterson asserted both a negligence claim and a strict liability claim, alleging that the snowmobile had a defective throttle mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Yamaha was insured under a comprehensive general liability policy containing a broad form vendor\u2019s endorsement, issued by Sumitomo, and Sumitomo retained counsel and managed Yamaha\u2019s defense. Similarly, Charter Oak and its counsel controlled Wodarski\u2019s defense. The same counsel represent Sumitomo and Charter Oak in this action. In the state action, counsel for Wodarski answered Peterson\u2019s complaint and included New Matter under Pa.R.C.P. 2252(d), joining Yamaha in the nature of a cross-claim for contribution and/or indemnity. In the cross-claim Wodarski asserted that if it was held liable to Peterson by reason of selling a defective snowmobile, then Yamaha was liable to it for all damages, and costs of defense. App. at 402. In this federal court diversity action, Charter Oak again claims reimbursement and indemnity, this time from Sumitomo alone, rather than from Sumitomo through its insured, Yamaha. In addition, Charter Oak asks for damages arising from Sumitomo\u2019s failure to defend it in the state court action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">At the conclusion of all testimony in the state court litigation, the court of common pleas directed a verdict for Yamaha against Peterson in the underlying tort action and for Yamaha against Wodarski in the cross-claim for indemnity and defense. After a six-day trial, the jury returned a verdict for Peterson against Wodarski for $250,000.00. Wodarski filed post-trial motions contesting both the jury verdict against it and the dismissal of its cross-claim. After the state court denied the motions, Wodarski appealed, then settled with Peterson and withdrew its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The record clearly indicates the reasons for the various dispositions in the state court action. The evidence showed that the snowmobile came from Yamaha in an undefective condition and that while it was in Wodarski\u2019s possession and control; persons employed by Wodarski took apart the throttle and then improperly reassembled it. The jury\u2019s verdict against Wodarski necessarily rested on a finding that the misassembly caused the throttle to stick and that the sticking of the throttle caused the accident, since this was the only theory of liability presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The insurance policy between Sumitomo and Yamaha contained a vendor\u2019s endorsement which excluded coverage for \u201c(b) bodily injury or property damage arising out of (i) any physical or chemical change in the form of the product made intentionally by the vendor, or (ii) demonstration, installation, servicing or repair operations, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>such operations performed at the vendor\u2019s premises in connection with the sale.\u201d App. at 20. Charter Oak bases this action for indemnity on the vendor\u2019s endorsement, which was available to it during the state trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The district court properly dismissed Charter Oak\u2019s claim under section (b)(i) of the vendor\u2019s endorsement. In its pretrial submissions, Charter Oak <em>admits </em>that the injury did not occur during a demonstration, servicing or repair in connection with the sale of the snowmobile. App. at 144. The district court likewise correctly concluded that application of finality of judgments principles precludes appellant from claiming in federal court that it is covered at all under the vendor\u2019s endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The law has developed the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata in order to \u201cprotect ... adversaries from the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and foster reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.\u201d <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153-54, 99 S.Ct. 970, 973-74, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979). These interests are implicated when, as in this case, nonparties control the litigation in the first action, and then sue in their own right in the second. Litigating nonparties simply are not \u201cstrangers to the cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 99 S.Ct. at 974. Although Sumitomo and Charter Oak were not technically \u201cparties\u201d to the state court action, they did control the litigation. The Supreme Court has stated that \u201cone who prosecutes or defends a suit in the name of another to establish and protect his own right, or who assists in the prosecution or defense of an action in aid of some interest of his own ... is as much bound ... as he would be if he had been a party to the record.\u201d <em>Souffront v. Compagnie Des Sucreries, </em>217 U.S. 475, 487, 30 S.Ct. 608, 612, 54 L.Ed. 846 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Because this is a diversity case, the district court correctly looked to Pennsylvania law in applying finality of judgment principles. The court did not, however, identify the correct theory of preclusion. Under Pennsylvania law, Charter Oak is barred from bringing the action for indemnity by virtue of res judicata, not collateral estoppel. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in <em>Williams v. Lumbermen\u2019s Ins. Co. of Philadelphia, </em>332 Pa. 1, 5-6, 1 A.2d 658, 660-61 (1938), held that one who controls or substantially participates in the presentation on behalf of a party is bound by the judgment in that action and is barred from bringing another action upon the same claim. <em>See also Estate of Flinn, </em>479 Pa. 312, 322, 388 A.2d 672, 677 (1978) (citing <em>Lumbermen\u2019s </em>for proposition that \u201cone not a party to litigation may be bound by it if he openly and actively, with notice to adverse party, assumes and manages the litigation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Charter Oak controlled the litigation in the state court and asserted the same claim for indemnity in its cross-claim against Yamaha as it asserts here. In defining the \u201ccause of action\u201d for purposes of preclusion under res judicata, the fact that the state court cross-claim may, as characterized by Judge Weis, have asked for relief under a common law theory of indemnity and duty to defend, while the suit in federal court sought relief based upon a contractual theory, is irrelevant. The conduct complained of is the same in both cases; failure to indemnify and pay costs of defense. The \u201cplaintiff is not entitled to another day in court if he merely proposes a different theory of recovery based upon the same \u2018liability creating conduct\u2019 of the defendant which gave rise to the first action.\u201d <em>Ley v. Boron Oil Co., </em>454 F.Supp. 448, 450 (W.D.Pa.1978). <em>Accord, Williamson v. Columbia Gas &amp; Electric Corp., </em>186 F.2d 464, 470 (3d Cir. 1950), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 U.S. 921, 71 S.Ct. 743, 95 L.Ed. 1355 (1951); <em>Cemer v. Marathon Oil Co., </em>583 F.2d 830, 832 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>Seamon v. Bell Telephone Co. of Pa., </em>576 F.Supp. 1458, 1460 (W.D.Pa.1988). <em>See also </em>IB J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>110.410.1 (2nd ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">At the commencement of the state court trial, Charter Oak had been in possession of the insurance policy and vendor\u2019s en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>dorsement for at least two months. It cannot escape the effect of res judicata simply by failing to introduce any evidence based on the contractual theory. We agree with the district court in the <em>Ley </em>case which stated, \u201c[i]n determining whether two cases involve the same cause of action, a basic concern is whether the plaintiff had a \u2018reasonable opportunity\u2019 to advance in his first day in court those claims or theories of recovery which he advances in his second.\u201d <em>Ley, </em>454 F.Supp. at 450. Here, Charter Oak certainly had the opportunity. Moreover, Charter Oak\u2019s participation in the state court litigation clearly rose to the level of control necessary to apply preclusion rules. <em>See, e.g., Ransburg Corp. v. Automatic Finishing Systems, Inc., </em>412 F.Supp. 1357, 1363-64 (E.D.Pa.1976) (where \u201cthe non-party actively and avowedly conducts the defense, manages and directs the progress of the trial at its expense and under its supervision, the outcome, which if favorable would have redounded to his benefit, if adverse becomes sauce for the goose and gander alike, and binding under principles of <em>res judicata.\u201d). </em>Application of the <em>Lumbermen\u2019s </em>principle here results in an absolute bar to Charter Oak bringing the action for indemnity in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Both parties to this appeal, as well as the district court, addressed the application of collateral estoppel to specific issues litigated in the state court action. Perhaps they were misled by federal common law in this area. The Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 154, 99 S.Ct. 970, 974, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979), stated that preclusion of non-parties who control litigation \u201cfalls under the rubric of collateral estoppel rather than res judicata because the latter doctrine presupposes identity between causes of action. And the cause of action which a nonparty has vicariously asserted differs by definition from that which he subsequently seeks to litigate in his own right.\u201d <em>Accord </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 39 (1980). But while the courts label what they are doing collateral estoppel, they frame the \u201cissue\u201d which is to be precluded so broadly as to make issue preclusion in this context virtually indistinguishable from res judicata.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the result under federal common law is in effect the same result as under Pennsylvania\u2019s more straightforward application of res judicata. We approve the Pennsylvania approach and believe that the principles behind claim preclusion justify its application in this case, where the insurance company litigated the case in the state court and now seeks another chance in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Charter Oak also claims that Sumitomo wrongfully failed to defend it in the state court action. We find the failure to defend claim barred by res judicata under the same reasoning as we set out above. In the state court action, Wodarski asked for \u201ccosts of defense.\u201d Whether the theory relied on was contractual and based on the insurance policy and vendor\u2019s endorsement, or based on principles of common law indemnity, is irrelevant. Plaintiffs in this action should not be given another chance to litigate issues \u201cwhich they have already litigated or had a reasonable opportunity to litigate.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Columbia Gas &amp; Electric Corp., </em>186 F.2d 464, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>469 (3d Cir.1950). Here, as in the <em>Williamson </em>case, the \u201conly thing that is different is the theory of recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470. Charter Oak\u2019s claim for damages for breach of duty to defend, therefore, is the same claim, for purposes of res judicata, as Wodarski made in the state court action under the name of \u201cdefense costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">But even if res judicata did not bar it, we would affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the duty-to-defend claim on the ground that Sumitomo had no duty to defend. The insurance policy in this case contains two clauses which, when read together, impose a \u201cduty to defend\u201d in \u201cany suit against the Insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage, even if any of the allegations are groundless, false or fraudulent.\u201d App. at 43. Wodarski became an \u201cinsured\u201d by virtue of the vendor\u2019s endorsement, app. at 47, but only to the limited extent of the endorsement. Appellant argues that Sumitomo had a duty to defend Wodarski regardless of the merits of Peterson\u2019s claim against Wodarski or the facts potentially excluding the claim from coverage. It is true that, according to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the \u201cobligation to defend arises whenever the complaint filed by the injured party may <em>potentially </em>come within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>Gedeon v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>410 Pa. 55, 58, 188 A.2d 320, 321 (1963); <em>Brugnoli v. United National Ins. Co., </em>284 Pa.Super. 511, 516, 426 A.2d 164, 166 (1981). But it is also true that under Pennsylvania law the insurer need only defend \u201cuntil it can confine the claim to a recovery excluded from the scope of the policy.\u201d <em>Seaboard Industries, Inc. v. Monaco, </em>258 Pa.Super. 170, 176, 392 A.2d 738, 743 (1978); <em>Brugnoli v. United Nat. Ins. Co., </em>284 Pa.Super. 511, 516, 426 A.2d 164, 166 (1981). <em>See also Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. Fidelity and Cas. Co. of N.Y., </em>281 F.2d 538, 540 (3d Cir.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In this case, Wodarski did not demand defense from Sumitomo until March 26, 1980, almost three years after the state suit commenced. App. at 416. By that time Peterson had filed its pre-trial narrative statement which clarified the issues for trial to the point where it was clear that the claim to be tried fell outside the coverage of the insurance policy. In the pre-trial narrative Peterson stated that the \u201cthrottle mechanism [of the snowmobile] had been improperly assembled by the defendant Wodarski and it was the improper assembly which caused the throttle mechanism to stick.\u201d App. at 21. Since the vendor\u2019s endorsement excluded coverage when there was an intentional change in the physical form of the snowmobile by the vendor, Sumitomo properly concluded that the claim was not covered and it had no duty to defend. Indeed, less than two months after Wodarski\u2019s demand for defense, the trial court dismissed the claim against Yamaha by Peterson and the cross-claim by Wodarski for indemnity and costs of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Under principles of finality and fairness the district court acted properly in precluding Charter Oak from litigating this case. The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\">. Appellant makes an initial argument in its brief that \"the Pennsylvania Supreme Court definitively ruled that insurance coverage and duty to defend issues cannot be joined to the under lying action, as a cross-claim under Pa.R.C.P. 2252(a),\u201d citing <em>Stokes v. Loyal Order of Moose Lodge 696, </em>502 Pa. 460, 466 A.2d 1341 (1983). Brief at 27. Therefore, claims Charter Oak, it is \"entitled to a full determination of its indemnity and defense rights in the instant action,\" and cannot be barred from relitigating these issues. <em>Id. </em>at 19. We find appellant\u2019s argument wholly without merit for two reasons. First, the <em>Stokes </em>case dealt with joinder of third-party defendants under 2252(a). Wodarski cross-claimed against Yamaha under 2252(d), not 2252(a). Both Yamaha and Wodarski were already parties and no Pennsylvania rule or case law prohibits cross-claims under 2252(d) for indemnity or defense costs. But regardless of whether <em>Stokes </em>does or not does not apply in this case, Wodarski did cross-claim for indemnity and defense and the record does not show that any party objected to it. On the contrary, the court dismissed the cross-claim on the merits and Wodarski did not pursue its appeal. Charter Oak attempts to persuade us that it cannot be precluded from relitigating its claim since it was unable to join the claim in the state court action. But the record shows not only that it was able to bring the cross-claim, but also that it did bring it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-5\">. Professor Moore, trying to justify an expansive definition of \u201cissue\u201d in this area, observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">A new contention is not ... necessarily a new issue. If a new legal theory or factual assertion put forward in the second action is \"related to the subject-matter and relevant to the issues\u201d that were litigated and adjudicated previously, \"so that it could have been raised, the judgment is conclusive on it despite the fact that it was not in fact expressly pleaded or otherwise urged.\u201d The analogy to the rule against splitting a single cause of action is striking. Like a cause of action, \u201can issue may not be ... split into pieces. If it has been determined in a former action, it is binding notwithstanding the parties litigant may have omitted to urge for or against it matters which, if urged, would have produced an opposite result.\u201d Any contention that is necessarily inconsistent with a prior adjudication of a material and litigated issue, then, is subsumed in that issue and precluded by the prior judgment\u2019s collateral estoppel effect [footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">1B Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 0.443[2], at 760. <em>See also Ransburg v.

The first is Charter Oak\u2019s claim for indemnification, and the second is its claim for reimbursement of the costs of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">I. <em>Indemnification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">At the outset, it is necessary to clarify one major difference between my analysis and that adopted by my colleagues. The majority maintains that \u201cCharter Oak controlled the litigation in state court and asserted <em>the same claim for indemnity </em>in its cross-claim against Yamaha as it asserts here.\u201d Maj. op. at 270. I am convinced that these claims are not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">The cross-claim against Yamaha was grounded on the common law rights of indemnification and contribution among joint tortfeasors. That dispute was resolved in state court. It is, however, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>claim distinct from that now presented in the federal court \u2014 a contractual obligation to indemnify and defend grounded in the Sumitomo insurance policy itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Because I find these to be distinct claims, I follow a different route but nevertheless reach the same result on the indemnification issue. As to the costs of defense issue, my analysis leads me to disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Rather than invoke the often amorphous res judicata doctrine, it seems to me that the court should rely on collateral estoppel, or more precisely, issue preclusion. \u201cRes judicata\u201d in its broadest sense describes the various ways in which a prior judgment fen have a preclusive effect on subsequent litigation. Used generically, it may include both \u201cclaim preclusion\u201d and \u201cissue preclusion.\u201d <em>See </em>C. WRIGHT, LAW OF THE FEDERAL COURTS \u00a7 100A (4th ed. 1983). The prior judgment in this case was handed down by a Pennsylvania court, and, in extending full faith and credit, we give the same effect to that judgment as would the state courts. <em>Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education, </em>- U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984); <em>Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980); <em>Public Service Mutual Ins. Co. v. Cohen, </em>616 F.2d 704 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Pennsylvania requires the concurrence of four elements to establish res judicata. There must be an identity of:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">(1) The things sued upon;</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">(2) The cause of action;</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">(3) The persons and parties to the action;</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">(4) The quality or capacity of the parties. <em>Stevenson v. Silverman, </em>417 Pa. 187, 190, 208 A.2d 786, 787-88 (1965). The \u201ccause of action\u201d test has often been the turning point on whether strict res judicata or claim preclusion should be applied, and so it is here.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">In the Peterson state court action, Wodarski\u2019s crossclaim against Yamaha was based on a primary-secondary tort liability relationship. Wodarski contended that as vendor he was a mere conduit, and that ultimate liability for the defective product rested with Yamaha, the manufacturer. <em>See Sochanski v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>689 F.2d 45 (3d Cir.1982); <em>Burbage v. Boiler Engineering &amp; Supply Co., </em>433 Pa. 319, 249 A.2d 563 (1969); <em>Burch v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>320 Pa.Super. 444, 467 A.2d 615 (1983); <em>Mixter v. Mack Trucks, Inc., </em>244 Pa.Super. 313, 308 A.2d 139 (1973). That is a substantially different claim from the one Charter Oak, as subrogee of Wodarski, is asserting against Sumitomo here. The federal court action is purely contractual, and rests on the terms of the vendor\u2019s endorsement contained in the insurance policy issued by Sumitomo.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">That we are confronted with separate causes of action may be illustrated by a scenario in which Wodarski would be denied complete indemnity from Yamaha because his separate negligence contributed to Peterson\u2019s injury together with Yamaha\u2019s defective product. <em>See Burch v. Sears, Roebuck; </em>RESTATEMENT OF RESTITUTION \u00a7 93 comment d and \u00a7 95 (1937). In that event, however, it is entirely possible that Wodarski would still be entitled to indemnification under the Sumitomo insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">Strict res judicata or claim preclusion, therefore, cannot be applied to the insurance coverage question. Nevertheless, certain facts necessary to the Peterson judgment were adjudicated in state court, and they have a determinative effect on Wodarski\u2019s (and its subrogee Charter Oak\u2019s) claim for indemnity under the vendor\u2019s endorsement. Included in this category are matters such as whether Wodarski intentionally modified the snowmobile\u2019s throttle mechanism. Because Wodarski and Charter actively contested this issue in the state court, they are bound by the adverse decision there. This results not from res judicata, or claim preclusion, but rather from collateral estoppel, more specifically, issue preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">The Pennsylvania Superior Court, summarizing the differences between res judicata and collateral estoppel, noted that the requirements for the latter were (1) that the issue of fact be the same in both suits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>even though the cause of action was not identical, and (2) that the party against whom the defense is invoked is identical to or in privity to the party in the first action. <em>Thompson v. Karastan Rug Mills, </em>228 Pa. Super. 260, 265, 323 A.2d 341, 344 (1974). <em>See also Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S.Ct. 970, 973, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Because the causes of action in the state and federal courts here were different, collateral estoppel \u2014 issue preclusion, rather than res judicata \u2014 claim preclusion, provides the correct rationale. Nevertheless, Sumitomo is not required to indemnify Wodarski or Charter Oak in any event because the facts adjudicated in state court establish that no coverage is owed under the vendor\u2019s endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">II. <em>Duty to Defend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The second issue is whether the insurance policy required Sumitomo to defend Wodarski in the state court action. That question was not litigated in the state court, nor were determinative facts adjudicated there.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">It is well settled in Pennsylvania that a carrier\u2019s duty to defend its insured, putative or otherwise, is governed by different principles than those that control the policy obligation to indemnify. <em>Gedeon v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>410 Pa. 55, 188 A.2d 320 (1963). The insurer\u2019s duty to defend is triggered by the allegations in the personal injury or property damage complaint. When the facts set out in the pleading could come within the policy coverage, the duty to defend arises. <em>Cadwallader v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em>396 Pa. 582, 152 A.2d 484 (1959). The insurance company is not relieved of its defense obligation until the lawsuit is confined to a claim that the policy does not cover. <em>Id. </em>at 590, 152 A.2d at 489; <em>Lee v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>178 F.2d 750 (2d Cir.1949); <em>see also Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company of New York, </em>281 F.2d 538 (3d Cir.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The majority concludes that res judicata applies to the duty to defend claim because in state court Wodarski filed a cross-claim against Yamaha asking for \u201ccosts of defense.\u201d The cross-claim was pleaded in accordance with Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure 2252(d), which permits one defendant to assert claims against a co-defendant on the ground that the latter is solely liable to the plaintiff or liable for contribution or indemnity to the \u201cjoining party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">In support of its position, the majority finds a difference between the cross-claim procedures of 2252(d) and the procedure for joining third party claims under 2252(a). Such a distinction, however, does not exist. After setting forth a procedure for pleach ing claims against co-defendants in the answer under the heading \u201cNew Matter\u201d, Pennsylvania Rule 2252(d) states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">\u201cThe case shall proceed thereafter as if such party (co-defendant) had been joined by a writ or complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">The quoted sentence makes the point that the procedure specified in subsection (d) is designed to eliminate the circuitous steps of severance of the co-defendant and service with a complaint to join additional defendant, the practice which prevailed under former rules. Thus, subsection (d) does no more than eliminate redundant pleadings which were necessary before subsection (d) was promulgated. <em>See </em>GOODRICH-AMRAM SECOND, \u00a7 2252 (d):l (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">The rule does not change existing law as to the substantive matters which may be asserted or adjudicated in additional defendant proceedings. In short, under Pennsylvania procedure it makes no difference whether an indemnity claim is asserted against a non-party via Rule 2252(a) or someone already a party through Rule 2252(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">Res judicata cannot preclude the duty of defense claim asserted against Sumitomo in the federal court. That company was never made a party to the state court action, and thus the breach of contract claim asserted against it here was not litigated there. Nor could it have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held in <em>Stokes v. Loyal Order of Moose Lodge #696, </em>502 Pa. 460, 466 A.2d 1341 (1983), that a defendant\u2019s claim for insurance coverage may not be litigated by way of additional defendant proceedings in the tort suit brought by a personal injury plaintiff. The court observed that the evidence to establish an insurance company\u2019s obligation is distinct from that which the personal injury plaintiff would present to establish liability against a putative insured. The proper way to resolve the coverage issue, said the court, is by a separate suit. In the case at hand, therefore, Wodarski was not able to join the Sumitomo Insurance Company as additional defendant in the Peterson state court suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The cross-claim that Wodarski filed against Yamaha asked for \u201cindemnity or reimbursement against the manufacturer for any and all such liability including costs of defense.\u201d As noted earlier, that common law claim was based on the relationship of manufacturer-retailer. The demand on Yamaha for the cost of defense was based on that premise, not the separate duty to defend set out by the terms of Sumitomo\u2019s policy. The insurance carrier\u2019s duty to defend is separate from any primary-secondary liability relationship between Yamaha and Wodarski.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Pennsylvania law recognizes a cause of action for a claim for reimbursement such as that of Wodarski against Yamaha. In <em>Boiler Engineering and Supply Co. v. General Controls, Inc., </em>443 Pa. 44, 277 A.2d 812 (1971), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that one secondarily liable could recover \u201cdefense costs,\u201d including counsel fees for trial and appeal, from the primary tortfeasor. This holding was consistent with the earlier ease of <em>Orth v. Consumers Gas Co., </em>280 Pa. 118, 124 A. 296 (1924), where a property owner, only secondarily liable, recovered counsel fees, costs of printing appellate briefs, and other expenses from a gas company which was primarily responsible for personal injuries to a pedestrian.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Unquestionably under Pennsylvania law, a person may be entitled to costs of defense from more than one source, and the majority errs in failing to distinguish between the two causes of action \u2014 common law and insurance policy \u2014 available in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The state court judgment resolved only the primary-secondary tort liability issue and Yamaha\u2019s obligation to pay for Wodarski\u2019s defense on that basis. Sumitomo\u2019s duty to defend was neither presented nor decided in state court. <em>See Haize v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>536 F.2d 576 (3d Cir.1976). That question remains open and should be decided in the first instance by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The facts established in state court, although material to a right of indemnity under the vendor\u2019s endorsement, do not resolve the contractual duty to defend issue. <em>Gedeon v. State Farm Insurance </em>makes clear that under Pennsylvania law a carrier may have a duty to defend an individual even though ultimately it is determined that no right of indemnity exists under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Since the district court in the case at hand did not rule separately on the duty to defend issue, I would remand for further proceedings to determine that matter. The point at which it became clear that the claims made against Wodarski were outside the policy remains open. The majority concludes that upon the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s pretrial statement in state court \u201cit was clear that the claim to be tried fell outside policy coverage.\u201d I have some doubt on this point, but it should be decided in the first instance by the district court on remand. Even accepting the majority\u2019s conclusion, an allowance for the three year period preceding pretrial is still at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The majority asserts that the delay in demanding a defense from Sumitomo precludes any recovery for costs of defense. Under Pennsylvania law, however, delay is irrelevant when the carrier can show no resulting prejudice. <em>Brakeman v. Potomac Ins. Co., </em>472 Pa. 66, 371 A.2d 193 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>(1977). Sumitomo suffered no prejudice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">I would remand to the district court to resolve the cost of defense issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
