Because we conclude that defendant\u2019s actions are protected from antitrust liability by state action immunity according to the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass\u2019n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., </em>445 U.S. 97, 100 S.Ct. 937, 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-16\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-17\">The plaintiffs are a number of Radio Common Carriers (RCCs) or Radio Telephone Utilities (RTUs) which provide radiotelephone and paging services in upstate New York. Capital Telephone Company, Inc. (Capital) and Peter A. Bakal (Bakal), both RCCs, offer one-way paging and two-way mobile radio services in Albany, Schenectady and Troy, New York. Tri-Cities Telephone Co., Inc. (Tri-Cities or Tri-City)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides two-way marine mobile radio services on the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers and Lake George, New York. Capital District Answering Service, Inc. (Capital District) offers telephone answering services in the Albany region. Plaintiffs Capital, Bakal and Tri-Cities are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Public Service Commission of the State of New York (PSC). <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq.; </em>N.Y. Pub.Serv.Law \u00a7\u00a7 90-101-a. Capital District is unregulated. All four plaintiff companies are owned and operated by Peter A. Bakal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-18\">Defendant New York Telephone Company (N.Y. Tel.) is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York. As a \u201ctelephone corporation,\u201d N.Y.Pub. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>Serv.Law \u00a7 2(17), N.Y. Tel. is regulated by the PSC, N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law \u00a7 94.2, as well as by the FCC, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">The history of this conflict is a long one. Throughout a variety of administrative and judicial actions, detailed below, plaintiffs have charged that N.Y. Tel. has discriminated against them by performing a number of anticompetitive acts. Among plaintiffs\u2019 specific allegations are that they are charged for incoming and outgoing circuits and for circuit installations while their competitors are not; that plaintiffs are charged for radio tie lines, paging numbers and mobile numbers while their competitors are not; that their competitors receive free out-pulsing and phone book listings while plaintiffs must pay; and that plaintiffs have no toll call investigation or credit card services while their competitors do receive these services.

The record indicates that the administrative and judicial action concerning the dispute between the RCCs and N.Y. Tel. began in 1968 and has continued through the intervening years. The details of these actions are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>In July 1982, after the FCC dismissed their complaint, the RCCs filed this action with the district court. Plaintiffs alleged that the activities on which their prior complaints had been based constitute violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 and of Section 2 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">C. <em>District Court Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMG\">Defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c), claiming that its actions are immune from antitrust liability under the state action exemption. After determining that state action immunity is available to private parties, <em>Capital Telephone Co., Inc. v. New York Telephone Co., </em>No. 82-CV-789 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 1984), J.App. at 436, the court applied the facts of this case to the Supreme Court\u2019s two part test in <em>California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass\u2019n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., </em>445 U.S. 97, 100 S.Ct. 937, 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980) <em>(Midcal). </em>Although in <em>Midcal </em>the Court considered the threshold question of whether there was a violation of the Sherman Act, <em>see infra, </em>the district court did not address this issue below. Because the question was not considered, we will assume for purposes of our analysis that violations of federal antitrust laws are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">The court determined that New York\u2019s Public Service Law and decisions of the state courts demonstrated that the state\u2019s \u201cpolicy ... articulates and expresses a clear intent to displace unfettered competition with regulated market activity,\u201d J.App. at 442, thus satisfying the first part of the test; <em>see also Midcal, </em>445 U.S. at 105, 100 S.Ct. at 943. The court also believed that the Public Service Law demonstrated the \u201cactive supervision\u201d exercised by the state over telephone corporations. J.App. at 443. Therefore, the court concluded that both requirements for state action immunity had been fulfilled. J.App. at 442-43. Because the court found the state action immunity issue dispositive, it did not consider N.Y. Tel.\u2019s additional claims of defenses under theories of implied immunity, primary jurisdiction and the filed tariff doctrine. The court granted the defendant\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) motion. <em>Id. </em>at 445. Plaintiffs filed Notice of Appeal with this Court on February 14, 1984. J.App. at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-10\">A. <em>State Action Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"AlGH\">1. <em>Development of Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9N\">The antitrust laws represent a national policy favoring competition. <em>Midcal, </em>445 U.S. at 110-11, 100 S.Ct. at 945-46. In certain situations that policy is set aside to permit states to exercise control of competition through regulation. Where challenged actions are taken pursuant to a state\u2019s legislative determination to displace competition with regulation, a court considering antitrust claims will not interfere with the state\u2019s decision. This \u201cstate action immunity\u201d from antitrust liability, first recognized in <em>Olsen v. Smith, </em>195 U.S. 332, 344-45, 25 S.Ct. 52, 55, 49 L.Ed. 224 (1904), was fully explained by the Supreme Court in <em>Parker v. Brown, </em>317 U.S. 341, 63 S.Ct. 307, 87 L.Ed. 315 (1943). In <em>Parker </em>the Court held that California\u2019s Agricultural Prorate Act did not violate the Sherman Act. <em>Id. </em>at 352, 63 S.Ct. at 314. The Prorate Act provided for the institution of prorate marketing programs for agricultural commodities in order to \u201cconserve the agricultural wealth of the State\u201d and \u201cprevent economic waste.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 63 S.Ct. at 311. The program designed for the raisin industry allowed producers to sell only thirty percent of their crops on the open market. Of the remainder, fifty percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>was to be placed into a stabilization pool and twenty percent into a surplus pool, both of which were to be marketed by the authorities according to prescribed guidelines. A producer and packer of raisins sued, claiming <em>inter alia </em>that the Prorate Act violated national antitrust laws. The Court disagreed, holding that sovereign acts of states were not within the intended scope of the Sherman Act. <em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 63 S.Ct. at 313-14. \u201cThe state in adopting and enforcing the prorate program made no contract or agreement and entered into no conspiracy in restraint of trade or to establish monopoly but, as sovereign, imposed the restraint as an act of government which the Sherman Act did not undertake to prohibit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 63 S.Ct. at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">More than thirty years passed before the Court again considered the question of state action immunity. In <em>Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, </em>421 U.S. 773, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975), the Court found that a minimum fee schedule issued by the county bar association and enforced by the Virginia State Bar violated the Sherman Act. Because the state had voluntarily joined in the private anticompetitive activity of the bar association, no immunity applied. <em>Id. </em>at 791-92, 95 S.Ct. at 2015-16. In <em>Goldfarb </em>the Court first used language of compulsion, which has created substantial confusion in succeeding years. \u201cIt is not enough that ... anticompetitive conduct is \u2018prompted\u2019 by state action; rather, anticompetitive activities must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791, 95 S.Ct. at 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">The following year the Court decided <em>Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., </em>428 U.S. 579, 96 S.Ct. 3110, 49 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1976). Here, too, state action immunity provided no protection. A private utility, subject to regulation by the state public service commission, issued \u201cfree\u201d lightbulbs to residential customers. The bulb exchange program, although initiated by the utility, was included in the tariffs filed with the PSC. The existence of the tariff was not enough to immunize the utility from antitrust liability because the light bulb exchange program was not essential to the effective functioning of the state\u2019s utilities regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 598, 96 S.Ct. at 3121. The Court stated, \u201c[tjhere is no logical inconsistency between requiring such a firm to meet regulatory criteria insofar as it is exercising its natural monopoly powers and also to comply with antitrust standards to the extent that it engages in business activity in competitive areas of the economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 96 S.Ct. at 3120.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">The following year in <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U.S. 350, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977), state action immunity was held to apply to enforcement by the state supreme court of disciplinary rules against attorney advertising. The Court noted, \u201cwe deem it significant that the state policy is so clearly and affirmatively expressed and that the State\u2019s supervision is so active.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, 97 S.Ct. at 2698.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">In 1978 the Court upheld the possibility of immunity for acts pursuant to state policy in two cases. In <em>City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., </em>435 U.S. 389, 98 S.Ct. 1123, 55 L.Ed.2d 364 (1978), the Court found that state action immunity would apply to acts of municipalities if those acts were undertaken according to clear state policy. \u201c[T]he <em>Parker </em>doctrine exempts only anticompetitive conduct engaged in as an act of government by the State as sovereign, or, by its subdivisions, pursuant to state policy to displace competition with regulation or monopoly public service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 98 S.Ct. at 1136 (plurality opinion). <em>See also New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., </em>439 U.S. 96, 99 S.Ct. 403, 58 L.Ed.2d 361 (1978) (Act was \u201ca system of regulation, clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed, designed to displace unfettered business freedom,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 109, 99 S.Ct. at 411; immunity prevented liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">In 1980 the Court set out the present controlling standard for determining whether a state agency\u2019s involvement in a regulatory scheme was sufficient to render the acts of private parties immune from antitrust liability. <em>California Retail Li</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number><em>quor Dealers Ass\u2019n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., </em>445 U.S. 97, 100 S.Ct. 937, 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980). The <em>Midcal </em>test incorporated and expanded on ideas expressed in earlier decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-4\">California state laws required wine producers and wholesalers to file fair trade contracts and price schedules with the state. The terms of the applicable fair trade contracts and price lists controlled all wholesale transactions. Enforcement procedures were provided, including fines and license suspensions. 445 U.S. at 99-100, 100 S.Ct. at 940. Midcal, a wine wholesaler, was charged with selling wine at a price below that set by the fair trade contract. Midcal filed suit in the California courts, claiming that the system was a restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act. The state Court of Appeal found a Sherman Act violation and declined to find state action immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 100 S.Ct. at 940. The United States Supreme Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">The Court first considered the \u201cthreshold question ... whether California\u2019s plan for wine pricing violates the Sherman Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 100 S.Ct. at 941. The Court found that the system was resale price maintenance, a clear Sherman Act violation. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 100 S.Ct. at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">Once the violation had been established, the Court considered the question of state action immunity. The Court set out the controlling two part test: \u201cFirst, the challenged restraint must be \u2018one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy\u2019; second, the policy must be \u2018actively supervised\u2019 by the State itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 100 S.Ct. at 943 (quoting <em>Lafayette, </em>435 U.S. at 410, 98 S.Ct. at 1135 (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">The Court determined that California\u2019s wine pricing system satisfied the first standard because \u201c[t]he legislative policy is forthrightly stated and clear in its purpose to permit resale price maintenance.\u201d 445 U.S. at 105, 100 S.Ct. at 943. The program faltered, however, under the second standard. \u201cThe State neither establishes prices nor reviews the reasonableness of the price schedules; ... [t]he State does not monitor market conditions or engage in any \u2018pointed reexamination\u2019 of the program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105-06, 100 S.Ct. at 943. Because no active supervision was found, the Court held that the state\u2019s actions were not immune from antitrust liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-11\">Since its <em>Midcal </em>decision the Court has considered the state action immunity issue in two additional cases, with differing results. <em>See Community Communications Co., Inc. v. City of Boulder, </em>455 U.S. 40, 55, 102 S.Ct. 835, 842, 70 L.Ed.2d 810 (1982) (city\u2019s anticompetitive actions pursuant to general \u201chome rule\u201d statute were not immune from antitrust liability because there was no clearly established and affirmatively expressed state policy; state was neutral); <em>Hoover v. Ronwin, </em>- U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 1989, 80 L.Ed.2d 590 (1984) (state supreme court, acting in legislative capacity, developed bar admission testing and operating procedures; <em>Midcal </em>test not required because acts in question were those of the sovereign itself, rather than of a subdivision; <em>id. </em>at \u2014 n. 33, 104 S.Ct. at 2001 n. 33). In neither of these cases has the Court shown any inclination to alter the terms of the <em>Midcal </em>standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we apply those standards here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>2. <em>Application of </em>Midcal <em>Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"A92\">a. <em>State Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">The district court found that it was New York State\u2019s policy to displace competition with regulation. Although the court found no specific language clearly stating this intent, it noted statutory provisions, state court decisions and recent legislative activity which supported its view. J.App. at 437-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Pervasive regulation alone is not adequate evidence of a state\u2019s policy to displace competition. <em>Northrop Corp. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>705 F.2d 1030, 1056 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 156, 78 L.Ed.2d 144 (1983); <em>Phonetele, Inc. v. AT &amp; T, </em>664 F.2d 716, 729 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1145, 103 S.Ct. 785, 74 L.Ed.2d 992 (1983); <em>cf. Cantor, </em>428 U.S. at 596-97, 96 S.Ct. at 3120-21. <em>See also </em>Areeda, <em>Antitrust Immunity for \u201cState Action\u201d After </em>Lafayette, 95 Harv.L.Rev. 435, 438 (1981) (not only state supervision is required; \u201cthe state must also intend to displace the antitrust laws\u201d). As the district court noted, establishing the existence of such a policy is made more difficult by the legislature\u2019s failure to state clearly its intent to control the field. J.App. at 437. However, the district court correctly found that such intent can be gleaned from an examination of the broad regulatory scheme, state judicial decisions and recent legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-14\">The New York legislature granted the PSC wide ranging authority over telephone corporations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law \u00a7\u00a7 90-101-a. The statutory scheme encompasses virtually all aspects of the telephone business: the provision of services by telephone corporations, \u00a7 91; rates, \u00a7\u00a7 92, 97; \u201cgeneral supervision\u201d by the PSC of corporations and lines, \u00a7 94; filing of annual reports, \u00a7 95; ordering of repairs, improvements or changes, \u00a7 98; granting of franchises, \u00a7 99; transactions in stock \u00a7\u00a7 100-01; and reorganization of corporations, \u00a7 101-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>Moreover, the PSC is charged with conducting its activities in the public interest. <em>State ex rel. Delaware &amp; Hudson Co. v. Stevens, </em>197 N.Y. 1, 9, 90 N.E. 60 (1909); <em>State ex rel. New York Tel. Co. v. Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>157 A.D. 156, 163, 141 N.Y.S. 1018, 1023 (1913). <em>See also </em>N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law \u00a7 97.1 (commission shall determine \u201cjust and reasonable rates;\u201d if commission finds \u201cthat the public interest requires a change in the rate, ... the commission may ... authorize an immediate, reasonable, temporary increase or decrease in such rate\u201d); \u00a7 97.2 (\u201cthe commission shall determine the just, reasonable, adequate, efficient and proper regulations\u201d); \u00a7 98 (commission may order repairs, improvements or changes if it believes they ought to be made \u201cin order to promote the convenience of the public\u201d); \u00a7 100 (\u201cNo consent shall be given by the [PSC] to the acquisition of any stock in accordance with this section unless it shall have been shown that such acquisition is in the public interest.\u201d). This legislative charge is another indication of the state\u2019s intention to supplant the antitrust laws, also designed to protect the public interest, with a regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">Both the terms of the statute itself and recent action of the state legislature suggest that the regulatory scheme encompasses the same goals as those underlying the antitrust laws. The Public Service Law prevents any telephone corporation from giving \u201cany undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any person, corporation or locality.\u201d \u00a7 91.3. Rate schedules must state \u201call privileges ... granted or allowed.\u201d \u00a7 92.1. Corporations are not permitted to extend any contract privileges unless they do so uniformly with respect to all who are in similar situations. \u00a7 92.2. The PSC may determine that a telephone company\u2019s rates \u201care unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential.\u201d \u00a7 97.1. <em>See also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 97.2, 100. These standards, against which the PSC is to measure the conduct of telephone corporations, suggest that the statute has as a basis the fundamental principles of antitrust law. If the Public Service Law were not intended to allow for a grant of state action immunity for actions taken pursuant to its provisions, there would be no need for the antitrust principles to appear in the text of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">Recent legislative activity also confirms our belief that the district court interpreted New York State regulatory policy correctly. In 1981 the legislature suspended application of the provisions of Article 5 of the Public Service Law to telegraph corporations. The legislature stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-9\">[We] find[] that since competition exists in communication by telegraph the panoply of regulation required by the public service law does not appear to be necessary to assure adequate service at reasonable rates____ The legislature therefore declares that it shall be the purpose of this act to suspend regulation of communication by telegraph and to authorize the commission to reinstitute such regulation if, and to the extent, it determines it necessary to protect the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-12\">Legislative Findings and Declaration of Purpose, N.Y.L.1981, c. 414, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-13\">In an Executive Memorandum accompanying the Act, Governor Carey stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-14\">In view of the competition, the extensive regulation which the Public Service Law requires to protect the consumer against monopoly practices in the telegraph industry no longer is necessary____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-15\">This bill, which applies solely to telegraph corporations, will stimulate competition and accelerate the development of innovative communication technologies for the benefit of the residents of New York State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-16\">Memorandum filed with Senate Bill No. 5463. Attorney General Robert Abrams expressed his view in a memorandum for the Governor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-17\">The Governor\u2019s Office has unequivocally assured my office that it was not the intent of this Act, to suspend application of Article 5 of the Public Service Law to any telecommunication service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>provided by a telephone company such as New York Telephone, the dominant supplier of telecommunications in this State. This assurance is critical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">Attorney General\u2019s Memorandum for the Governor Re Senate 5463 (July 2, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">It is clear that both the executive and legislative branches of state government viewed regulation of telegraph corporations as unnecessary. We may assume that had the legislature determined that regulation was similarly unnecessary for telephone corporations it would have suspended application of the statute to those utilities for a similar test period. The fact that the legislature failed to do so leads inescapably to the conclusion that it viewed continued regulation of the telephone industry as necessary to displace competition in the public interest. <em>See Capital Telephone Co. v. City of Schenectady, </em>560 F.Supp. 207, 210 n. 6 (N.D.N.Y.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">Although it might be appropriate for RTUs to function in an openly competitive marketplace, that decision rests with the legislature. Presently the statutes demonstrate the state\u2019s policy to displace competition with regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\">Appellants argue, however, that, because the particular activities of which they complain are not directed by the legislature through the Public Service Law, there is no basis for a finding of an \u201caffirmatively expressed state policy.\u201d This may be another way of saying that a compulsion requirement, which we have already rejected, should be read into the <em>Midcal </em>standard. <em>See supra </em>note 3. However, because it may be possible for specific activities to be addressed by the statute without being compelled by it, we will consider this argument separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">The Supreme Court has never held that a comprehensive, specific legislative mandate is necessary to a finding of immunity from antitrust liability. To the contrary, a broader interpretation has been suggested. In <em>Lafayette </em>Justice Brennan wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-9\">This does not mean, however, that a political subdivision necessarily must be able to point to a specific, detailed legislative authorization before it properly may assert a <em>Parker </em>defense to an antitrust suit. While a subordinate governmental unit\u2019s claim to <em>Parker </em>immunity is not as readily established as the same claim by a state government sued as such, we agree ... that an adequate state mandate for anticompetitive activities of cities and other subordinate governmental units exists when it is found \u201cfrom the authority given a governmental entity to operate in a particular area, that the legislature <em>contemplated the kind of action complained of.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-11\">435 U.S. at 415, 98 S.Ct. at 1138 (plurality opinion) (citation omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-12\">Although this interpretation did not garner majority support on the Court, we consider it to be consistent with the purpose of state action immunity. We find no persuasive authority to the contrary. Where, as here, there is sufficient evidence that a state intended to supplant open competition with regulation, activities that are reasonably necessary or related to the subject of the legislation should be included within the scope of the immunity. <em>See Cantor, </em>428 U.S. at 596, 96 S.Ct. at 3120 (light bulb exchange program was not a part of the utility\u2019s \u201cnatural monopoly power;\u201d no immunity was present). <em>See also </em>Areeda, <em>supra </em>at 445-46 (citing <em>Lafayette; </em>noting that, because statutes are rarely clear in their statements of intent, the policy may be inferred \u201cif the challenged restraint of competition is a necessary or reasonable consequence of engaging in the authorized activity\u201d); Morgan, <em>Antitrust and State Regulation: Standards of Immunity After </em>Midcal, 35 Ark.L.Rev. 453, 464-65 (1981) (\u201c[Ajuthority to regulate may be implied in general delegations of authority. Any restraints based on such implied legislative decisions must, however, be basic to the regulatory program\u2019s functioning.\u201d). Therefore, to the extent that appellants\u2019 claim of a need for specificity is separable from the compulsion argument, we find it similarly unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-13\">In a recent decision the Sixth Circuit reached a similar conclusion. <em>Hybud </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number><em>Equipment Corp. v. City of Akron, </em>742 F.2d 949 (6th Cir.1984). In evaluating the applicability of state action immunity to a waste disposal scheme, the court examined the anticompetitive restraint in light of the legislative intent. \u201cIf the challenged restraints are reasonably related to an agency\u2019s express powers and reasonably designed to promote the state aims within a designated field of regulation, they can be found to result from a \u2018clearly and affirmatively expressed state policy\u2019 to displace competition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 960-61. The court held that although the waste regulation statute itself was not an adequate basis for a finding of immunity, when combined with provisions allowing contractual arrangements for carrying out state policy it was sufficient evidence of a \u201creasonable relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 961-62. Therefore, the first <em>Midcal </em>requirement was satisfied. The evidence in the instant case is at least as strong; here too there is a \u201creasonable relationship\u201d between the restraints in question and the state policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">B. <em>Active Supervision</em></p>\n<p id=\"AS1\">The district court found that the state legislature had \u201cexpressly conferred\u201d powers upon the PSC which enabled it to review rates and other aspects of telephone company operations for reasonableness. J.App. at 442. Because the program requires \u201cactive state involvement in the operative anticompetitive decisions,\u201d the court found the state\u2019s supervision adequate to warrant a finding of immunity. <em>Id. </em>(citing P. Areeda, <em>Antitrust Law </em>\u00b6 212.7 (Supp.1982) at 71). Although we find the question to be a close one, we conclude that the district court\u2019s determination was correct. The Public Service Law provides for comprehensive, ongoing involvement by the state in the functioning of telephone corporations. This involvement is sufficient to meet the second <em>Midcal </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">The regulatory scheme gives the PSC a broad range of powers: \u201cThe commission shall have general supervision of all ... telephone corporations and ... telephone lines within its jurisdiction____\u201d N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law \u00a7 94.2. Within the ambit of \u201cgeneral supervision\u201d fall such activities as examination of \u201call books, contracts, records, documents and papers,\u201d \u00a7 94.3; and investigation of \u201cany act done or omitted to be done,\u201d \u00a7 96.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Procedures for the development and enforcement of rates are extensively covered by the statute. <em>See </em>N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law \u00a7 92 (orders filing of rate schedules, provides for PSC hearings where changes in rate schedules are sought); \u00a7 97 (PSC may hold hearing on rates either on receipt of complaint or on own motion; PSC shall determine reasonable rates and may authorize temporary rate changes). Moreover, any telephone corporation wishing to \u201cissue stock, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness ... when necessary for the acquisition of property, the construction, completion, extension or improvement of its facilities or the improvement or maintenance of its service within the state ...\u201d must receive authorization from the commission. \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-10\">It is clear that the legislature intended the PSC\u2019s authority over telephone corporations to be very broad. This regulatory role is quite different from that of the State of California in <em>Midcal. </em>There, the Supreme Court found that no immunity was possible for the wine pricing program because the state\u2019s involvement did not constitute \u201cactive supervision.\u201d <em>Midcal, </em>445 U.S. at 105-06, 100 S.Ct. at 943. \u201cThe State neither establishes prices nor reviews the reasonableness of the price schedules; nor does it regulate the terms of fair trade contracts. The State does not monitor market conditions or engage in any \u2018pointed reexamination\u2019 of the program.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>Here, by contrast, the state has authority to review any contracts entered into by the telephone corporations, \u00a7 94.3, to examine \u201caccounts, records and memoranda,\u201d \u00a7 95.-2, and to \u201cinvestigate ... any act done or omitted to be done by any ... telephone corporation.\u201d \u00a7 96.1. This role provides much more than a \u201cgauzy cloak of state involvement [cast] over ... a private price-fixing agreement.\u201d <em>Midcal, </em>445 U.S. at 106, 100 S.Ct. at 943. It would be inconsistent with such a broad regulatory scheme to find that the particular activities in question are subject to antitrust liability where the legislature so clearly intended to allow the PSC to control all activities which are a reasonable part of such a regulatory scheme. Therefore, we agree with the district court that this regulatory program constitutes \u201cactive supervision\u201d under Midcal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Capital Telephone Co. v. City of Schenectady, </em>560 F.Supp. at 210-11 (comprehensive regulatory scheme satisfies \u201cactive supervision\u201d requirement, state action immunity protects city from liability for denial of franchise to Capital); <em>North v. New York Telephone Co., </em>1980-81 Trade Cas. 1163, 675 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (rate structure of N.Y. Tel. is immune from antitrust liability; all aspects of rate structure are regulated and state \u201cactively investigates, supervises and determines NYT\u2019s rates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77,628).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">3. <em>Additional Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">In an attempt to find controlling precedent in other telecommunications cases, appellants make two additional arguments. First, they insist that we should follow cases which have failed to find state action immunity in regulatory schemes which are primarily interstate in character. In short, they contend that the doctrine of state action immunity does not apply to the telecommunications industry, <em>citing United States v. AT &amp; T, </em>552 F.Supp. 131 (D.D.C. 1982), <em>aff'd mem., </em>460 U.S. 1001, 103 S.Ct. 1240, 75 L.Ed.2d 472 (1983), and that, even if it did, telecommunications regulations rarely meet the strict <em>Midcal </em>standards, <em>citing Northeastern Tel. Co. v. AT &amp; T, </em>497 F.Supp. 230 (D.Conn.1980), <em>rev\u2019d in part, vac. in part &amp; remanded, </em>651 F.2d 76 (2d Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 943, 102 S.Ct. 1438, 71 L.Ed.2d 654 (1982); and <em>Essential Communications Systems, Inc. v. AT &amp; T, </em>610 F.2d 1114 (3d Cir.1979). Quoting liberally from <em>United States v. AT &amp; T, </em>appellants argue that because N.Y. Tel.\u2019s operations are closely tied to interstate commerce, no claim of state action immunity is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-10\">These cases are clearly distinguishable, both on their facts and because appellants erroneously characterize the applicable standard as one of \u201cexemption.\u201d It is true that the <em>AT &amp; T </em>Court found that because Congress had extensively regulated the telecommunications industry, the area was one which is \u201cnational par excellence.\u201d 552 F.Supp. at 157-58. However, the court also noted that much of the conduct involved was not the subject of state regulation at all, while the remainder was subject only to tariffs. <em>Id. </em>at 158. The instant action is quite different because the activities are subject to comprehensive state regulation and there is no conflict here with federal legislative policy. <em>See also Essen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number><em>tial, </em>610 F.2d at 1125 (state law not clearly involved in the regulation in question; no exemption found in the 1934 Communications Act); and <em>Northeastern, </em>651 F.2d at 82-84 &amp; n. 7 (FCC regulation does not prevent liability for protective coupler requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\">Appellants\u2019 characterization of the standard as \u201cexemption\u201d adds to the confusion. The standard which should be applied is that of preemption. <em>See </em>Handler, <em>Antitrust-1978, </em>78 Colum.L.Rev. 1363, 1378-83 (1978) (explaining difference between exemption and preemption and noting that the presumptions that apply are different in the two situations). Because there is substantial state regulation of the activities in question here, in contrast to those involved in <em>AT &amp; T, </em>the question should be whether Congress has <em>preempted </em>the field of telecommunications regulations. It is clear that Congress has not exclusively occupied this area; the extensive regulatory schemes in virtually every state demonstrate the viability of state interest in the field. In addition, there is no basis for a finding that there is an intolerable conflict between federal and state interests. Therefore, there is no preemption present here. In the absence of evidence of intent to preempt, a holding that a state may not circumvent the antitrust laws through its own regulatory scheme would challenge the federalism on which our governmental system is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">Appellants\u2019 second argument is that any state action present here is not adequate to confer immunity on the defendants, <em>citing Litton Systems, Inc. v. AT &amp; T, </em>487 F.Supp. 942, 959 (S.D.N.Y.1980), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>700 F.2d 785 (2d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 984, 79 L.Ed.2d 220 (1984) (district court found no state action immunity, holding that, as in <em>Cantor, </em>the program in question was initiated by the utility rather than by the state, which only approved tariffs; court of appeals affirmed on different grounds without reaching state action); <em>Phonetele, Inc. v. AT &amp; T, </em>664 F.2d 716, 735-36 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1145, 103 S. Ct. 785, 74 L.Ed.2d 992 (1983) (filing of tariff alone is not adequate to confer state action immunity); and <em>Sound, Inc. v. AT &amp; T, </em>631 F.2d 1324, 1334-35 (8th Cir.1980) (no evidence of state policy requiring displacement of competition by regulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-12\">This argument also must fail. As we stated above, New York\u2019s current policy clearly favors the imposition of regulatory controls over competition in the telephone industry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the legislature has given the PSC a considerably more active role than the mere approval of tariffs. Therefore, the district court was clearly correct in concluding that on the facts of this case N.Y. Tel. is protected from federal antitrust liability by state action immunity-</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">. Although plaintiffs\u2019 brief refers to Tri-Cities in the plural, many of the prior administrative and judicial opinions use the name Tri-City. We refer to plaintiff as Tri-Cities except where the singular form is necessary to remain consistent with prior decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">. Capital first filed a complaint with the PSC in late 1968, alleging that the tariff filed by N.Y. Tel. contained a charge against the mobile companies. Capital believed that it was being charged for costs for which its subscribers should have been billed directly. <em>In re Capital Mobile Radio Service, Inc., </em>80 Pub.Util.Rep.3d (PUR) 445, 449 (Aug. 20, 1969). The PSC disagreed, finding that the fees were charged against the subscribers rather than against the carrier. The PSC also refused to grant Capital\u2019s request that it be allowed to bill N.Y. Tel. for calls originating from landline companies and received at mobile units. <em>Id. </em>at 452-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">Tri-Cities filed a complaint with the FCC in 1969 requesting that N.Y. Tel. be required to interconnect with it on the same terms as it did with Tri-Cities\u2019 competitors. <em>In re Petition of Tri-City Telephone Company, </em>FCC No. 18741 (Recommended decision Nov. 17, 1972), J.App. at 285. The FCC denied the complaint, finding that Tri-Cities\u2019 operation at the time did not merit the establishment of a central office like those of its competitors. J.App. at 296. The FCC also rejected Tri-Cities\u2019 request that N.Y. Tel. divide revenues with it on the same basis as with Pattersonville Telephone Co., a landline company. The FCC noted that the costs of a landline company's mobile operations are not considered when revenue divisions are calculated, so that the calculations are not comparable. J.App. at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">Capital filed another complaint with the PSC in 1970, requesting that its arrangements with N.Y. Tel. be revised. Hearings were held for six days between 1970 and 1972. The PSC found that the evidence did not support Capital\u2019s claims of discrimination and anticompetitive action. <em>Pub.Serv.Comm\u2019n Op. </em>No. 73-8 (Mar. 12, 1973), J.App. at 212, 229. The PSC ordered N.Y. Tel. to continue to offer direct dial interconnection services to RCCs, but ordered Capital to pay for the services it had received. Stating, that the relationship between RCCs and N.Y. Tel. was different than that between landline companies and the telephone company, the PSC found that the record disclosed no evidence of discrimination by N.Y. Tel. <em>Id. </em>at 231-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">Pursuant to a recommendation by the PSC in the 1973 action, Tri-Cities filed a petition for a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The PSC granted the certificate but rejected the toll revenue division plan offered by Tri-Cities because the marine service provided by TriCities was not similar enough to landline service to allow toll division based on the standard formula. <em>Pub.Serv.Comm\u2019n Op. </em>No. 74-21 (July I, 1974), J.App. at 266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-14\">Next, Tri-Cities filed suit in the Appellate Division of the state supreme court requesting that the Commission\u2019s decision concerning the interconnection agreement be reversed. <em>Tri-City Telephone Co. v. Alfred E. Kahn, </em>49 A.D.2d 126, 373 N.Y.S.2d 655 (1975). Noting that the applicable standard of review was a limited one, the court upheld the PSC\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 373 N.Y.S.2d 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-15\">In May 1978 Capital and Bakal again filed complaints with the PSC. J.App. at 329. These complaints contained allegations of \"illegal, preferential and anticompetitive conduct\u201d by N.Y. Tel. favoring plaintiffs\u2019 competitor, Pattersonville. <em>Id. </em>In a memo the Communications Division informed the PSC that the complaints were without merit. J.App. at 333. The Communications Division believed that the comparison between Bakal\u2019s services and those of Pattersonville was not appropriate and that Bakal/Capital were not being treated differently from any other RCC. <em>Id. </em>at 334, 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-16\">Less than a year later, Capital, Bakal and Tri-Cities filed complaints with the FCC. These complaints were substantially similar to the 1978 PSC complaints. J.App. at 325-28. In April 1979 these complaints were dismissed. J. App. at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-18\">In February 1980, Capital, Bakal and TriCities unsuccessfully petitioned this Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>an evidentiary hearing in a motion which essentially repeated the allegations of the prior administrative complaints. J.App. at 314. A similar complaint and request for hearing was filed with the FCC in May 1980. In May 1982 the FCC responded. <em>Capital Telephone Co., Inc. v. New York Telephone Co., </em>File No. E-80-17 (May 14, 1982). J.App. at 377. The FCC dismissed the complaint as to all allegations except those concerning discrimination in the use of direct distance dialing (DDD). As to those charges, the PSC ordered that access to the DDD network be provided to Capital at the same cost as to N.Y. Tel.\u2019s own mobile service. J.App. at 382.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">. The plaintiffs argued strenuously that an additional \"compulsion\u201d requirement applies, thereby making it necessary to find that the specific acts in question were compelled by the State of New York. The Fifth Circuit has embraced this requirement. <em>See United States v. Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conf., Inc., </em>702 F.2d 532 (5th Cir., Unit B. 1983) (en banc), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 3508, 82 L.Ed.2d 818 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">In the Supreme Court\u2019s latest consideration of state action immunity, the Court\u2019s language indicates that no compulsion requirement should be read into the standard. <em>Hoover v.

This language suggests that the Court does not intend that compulsion be required. The Sixth and Ninth Circuits apparently agree. <em>See Hybud Equipment Corp. v.

This view is endorsed by antitrust scholars. <em>See </em>Areeda, <em>Antitrust Immunity for \"State Action\" After </em>Lafayette, 95 Harv.L.Rev. 435, 438 (1981) (\u201cCompulsion, however, should not be read as an independent requirement for state action immunity; rather, its presence or absence should serve only as strong evidence about state intent.\"); Handler, <em>Antitrust-1978, </em>78 Colum.L.Rev. 1363, 1384 (1978) (courts\u2019 use of compulsion as a requirement is \"overreaction\u201d); Morgan, <em>Antitrust and State Regulation: Standards of Immunity After </em>Midcal, 35 Ark.L.Rev. 453, 467-68 (1981) (compulsion was not included in the Court's statement of the standards but \"it is likely to remain as a factor, presumably under the first standard\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-12\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertion, this Circuit has never expressly adopted the compulsion requirement. <em>See Litton Systems, Inc. v.

There is no question that this regulatory scheme applies to RCCs such as appellants herein. New York\u2019s courts have held that the regulation of RCCs is within the jurisdiction of the PSC. <em>See Application of Radio Common Carriers of New York, Inc. v. Public Serv.

The dissent misinterprets our analysis to hold that regulations that satisfy the second prong of the <em>Midcal </em>test must necessarily satisfy the first.Our analysis of the \"state policy\u201d prong incorporates evidence of legislative intent found in both the scheme itself and in recent legislative activity-</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">Where the regulatory scheme demonstrates that the state actively supervises the telephone industry, we need not look to wholly different sources to find support for first prong analysis. Where no clear expression of state policy exists, we may look to the breadth of the regulatory scheme, as a demonstration of the legislature\u2019s delegation of authority, in conducting our first prong <em>Midcal </em>analysis. <em>Hybud Equipment Corp. v. City of Akron, </em>742 F.2d 949, 960 (6th Cir.1984) (\"a legislative intent to displace competition may be inferred from the legislature\u2019s delegation of authority\u201d). Our use of this particular regulatory scheme in evaluating both prongs of the <em>Midcal </em>test in no way suggests that satisfaction of one prong requires satisfaction of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-12\">The dissent also fails to credit our use of other evidence to support our finding, specifically, the legislature\u2019s recent action concerning the telegraph industry. While regulation alone is not enough to provide exemption from the antitrust laws, here there is more than mere regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">. We note that New York\u2019s courts have interpreted the application of state antitrust laws to the Public Service Law differently. <em>See Capital Telephone Co. v.

Although proper application of the state action immunity doctrine should include consideration of state judicial decisions, we believe that a federal court may reexamine the issue precisely because the doctrine is based on the principles of federalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">We disagree with the dissent in its belief that <em>Pattersonville </em>mandates a different result. We read that case to hold only that a \"not illegal\u201d ruling by the PSC does not collaterally estop the plaintiff from filing suit under the state antitrust laws. <em>See Columbia Gas v. New York State Electric and Gas Corp., </em>28 N.Y.2d 117, 128-29, 320 N.Y.S.2d 57, 66, 268 N.E.2d 790, 796 (1971) (holding that failure to assert per se antitrust violation does not prevent fact-based, rule of reason analysis of antitrust allegations). We do not agree that the <em>Pattersonville </em>Court\u2019s decision in this limited context provides incontrovertible evidence of an affirmative state policy. In the absence of a clear statement of legislative intent, we cannot view this decision as more powerful than the recent legislative action deregulating the telegraph industry, but retaining regulatory authority over the telephone industry. The legislature has not taken advantage of the opportunity to repeal the application of L.1981, c. 414, \u00a7 2; nor has it expanded the 1981 act to include the telephone industry. New York\u2019s legislature of course remains free to bring the actions of the state telephone industry within the scope of federal antitrust laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>PIERCE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ATy\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">I dissent. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that appellee\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive activities are protected from federal antitrust scrutiny by state action immunity. I do not believe that New York, by choosing to regulate the telephone industry, has acted to displace competition therein. Hence, I would hold that state action immunity is not available to appellee under the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., </em>445 U.S. 97, 100 S.Ct. 937, 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">The state statute upon which the majority relies in finding the alleged anticompetitive conduct protected requires only that telephone companies shall provide \u201cadequate service\u201d at \u201cjust and reasonable charges\u201d without \u201cunjust discrimination\u201d or \u201cunreasonable preference\u201d and that the Public Service Commission (\u201cPSC\u201d) shall have powers of \u201cgeneral supervision\u201d over such companies. N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law \u00a7\u00a7 91, 94 (McKinney 1955). This vague mandate cannot satisfy the requirement of <em>Midcal </em>that anticompetitive conduct, to be exempt, must be <em>\u201cclearly articulated and affirmatively expressed </em>as state policy.\u201d <em>Midcal, </em>445 U.S. at 105, 100 S.Ct. at 943 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">Moreover, in <em>Capital Telephone Company v. Pattersonville Telephone Company, </em>56 N.Y.2d 11, 451 N.Y.S.2d 11, 436 N.E.2d 461 (1982), the New York Court of Appeals explicitly held that the state Public Service Commission\u2019s approval of a practice challenged as anticompetitive will not preclude a private plaintiff\u2019s state antitrust action attacking that practice. In so deciding, the New York Court of Appeals necessarily concluded that the State\u2019s decision to regulate the telephone industry is not inconsistent with the principles of competition. Under these circumstances, the conduct challenged here cannot reflect an affirmative state policy and hence is not exempt from federal antitrust scrutiny. <em>See Midcal, </em>445 U.S. at 105, 100 S.Ct. at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">State action immunity is based principally on considerations of federalism. It allows states a limited degree of autonomy and latitude in pursuing independent economic policies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> States may make choices concerning economic regulation even though those choices might otherwise violate the Sherman Act. However, the Sherman Act is fundamental national economic policy: <em>See Midcal, </em>445 U.S. at 106, 100 S.Ct. at 943. Consequently, not every instance of state economic regulation gives rise to exemption from federal antitrust law: \u201cThe mere possibility of conflict between state regulatory policy and federal antitrust policy is an insufficient basis for implying an exemption from the federal antitrust laws.\u201d <em>Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., </em>428 U.S. 579, 596, 96 S.Ct. 3110, 3120, 49 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1976). Nor will every choice of a state that conflicts with the policies of the Sherman Act be respected: \u201c[A] state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful ____\u201d <em>Parker v. Brown, </em>317 U.S. 341, 351, 63 S.Ct. 307, 313, 87 L.Ed. 315 (1943) (quoted in <em>Midcal, </em>445 U.S. at 106, 100 S.Ct. at 943). Thus, a state is at times free to supplant the Sherman Act\u2019s policy of free competition with one of actively regulated monopoly or oligopoly\u2014 but it may not defeat the Sherman Act without adopting a coherent policy toward anticompetitive activities and subjecting that policy to \u201cpointed re-examination by the policymaker.\u201d <em>Midcal, </em>445 U.S. at 105-06, 100 S.Ct. at 943; <em>see Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U.S. 350, 362, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 2698, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>The Supreme Court, in <em>Midcal, </em>established \u201ctwo standards for antitrust immunity under <em>Parker v. Brown. </em>First, the challenged restraint must be \u2018one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy\u2019; second, the policy must be \u2018actively supervised by the State itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Midcal, </em>445 U.S. at 105, 100 S.Ct. at 943 (quoting in part <em>City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light, </em>435 U.S. 389, 410, 98 S.Ct. 1123, 1135, 55 L.Ed.2d 364 (1978) (plurality opinion)). These are <em>independent </em>requirements, and <em>each </em>must be fulfilled if a challenged restraint is to be considered exempt from federal antitrust scrutiny. The purpose of the two-pronged <em>Midcal </em>test is to insure both that the State makes a conscious choice to displace competition and that this choice is subject to critical re-examination. If both these ends are to be accomplished, it may not be assumed that the requirements are met whenever the State engages in economic regulation. Rather, as perusal of <em>Lafayette, Cantor, Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, </em>421 U.S. 773, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975), and other decisions leading up to <em>Midcal </em>reveals, the test is to be applied strictly. In my opinion, the majority fails to make the proper strict application of the <em>Midcal </em>test to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">The majority holds that regulation of the telephone industry by the state Public Service Commission is sufficient to satisfy the \u201cactive supervision\u201d prong of the <em>Midcal </em>test, and it may be that this conclusion is correct. However, the majority also holds that this same regulation clearly evinces the state legislature\u2019s choice to pursue a policy in conflict with that of the Sherman Act. The problem with this analysis is that it conflates the two requirements of <em>Midcal </em>making them one. Under the majority\u2019s analysis, regulation that fulfills the \u201cactive supervision\u201d requirement of <em>Midcal </em>necessarily satisfies its demand that the challenged restraint be \u201cclearly and affirmatively expressed as state policy.\u201d But, as already stated, not every instance of state economic regulation gives rise to exemption from federal antitrust laws. The Supreme Court has made clear that regulation alone is <em>not </em>sufficient to exempt challenged restraints from antitrust scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">In <em>Goldfarb, </em>421 U.S. 773, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 44 L.Ed.2d 572 the Court recognized that the State Bar was given power to regulate the legal profession but nevertheless held that its price-fixing activities were not beyond the purview of the Sherman Act: \u201cThe fact that the State Bar is a state agency for some limited purposes does not create an antitrust shield that allows it to foster anticompetitive practices for the benefit of its members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791, 95 S.Ct. at 2015. The Court went on to hold that because there was no evidence showing the Bar\u2019s price-fixing activities to be within the policy of the <em>State as sovereign, </em>those activities were not exempt from antitrust scrutiny. And in <em>Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., </em>428 U.S. 579, 96 S.Ct. 3110, 49 L.Ed.2d 1141, the Court rejected defendants\u2019 argument that because the state Public Utility Commission had approved a tariff containing the allegedly anticompetitive activity \u2014 distribution of free lightbulbs\u2014 the Sherman Act was inapplicable thereto. The Court reasoned that without a showing of actual conflict between the state regulatory policy and that of the Sherman Act there could be no implied exemption from the antitrust law. The Court found that because the activity challenged in <em>Cantor </em>was not compelled by the State, it should not be considered within the State\u2019s affirmative regulatory policy. As the Court stated in words applicable to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-8\">Unquestionably there are examples of economic regulation in which the very purpose of the government control is to avoid the consequences of unrestrained competition____ But all economic regulation does not necessarily suppress competition. On the contrary, public utility regulation typically assumes that the private firm is a natural monopoly and that public controls are necessary to protect the consumer from exploitation. There is no logical inconsistency between requiring such a firm to meet regulatory criteria insofar as it is exercising its natural monopoly powers and also to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>with antitrust standards to the extent that it engages in business activity in competitive areas of economy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 595-96, 96 S.Ct. at 3119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Here, making what I consider to be the proper strict application of the <em>Midcal </em>test, I would hold that the activities of appellee, to the extent that they violate the Sherman Act, are not within the \u201cclearly articulated and affirmatively expressed\u201d policy of the State of New York. In finding appellee\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive conduct exempt from federal antitrust scrutiny, the majority relies upon the Public Service Commission\u2019s approval of that conduct. However, this approval is insufficient evidence that appellee\u2019s conduct reflects any <em>affirmative </em>policy of the State. I find it far from certain that the PSC decisions at issue here are anything more than determinations that the appellant has failed to prove that appellee\u2019s conduct violates the New York Public Service Law. Moreover, even if the Public Service Commission has mandated New York Telephone\u2019s actions, this is nevertheless insufficient to constitute a statement of policy of the <em>State. </em>The Public Service Commission is not the State itself. Therefore, before concluding that its actions have immunized a private defendant from antitrust liability, a court must ascertain whether the state \u201clegislature [in granting the Public Service Commission power to regulate New York Telephone] contemplated the kind of action complained of.\u201d <em>Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, </em>455 U.S. 40, 55, 102 S.Ct. 835, 842, 70 L.Ed.2d 810 (1982). As already noted, New York\u2019s Public Service Law provides only that telephone companies shall give \u201cadequate service\u201d at \u201cjust and reasonable charges\u201d without \u201cunjust discrimination\u201d or \u201cunreasonable preference\u201d and that the PSC shall have powers of \u201cgeneral supervision\u201d over such companies. N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law \u00a7\u00a7 91, 94. This vague grant of power evidences, at best, the legislature\u2019s neutrality toward Public Service Commission approval of anticompetitive conduct. \u201c[P]lainly the requirement of \u2018clear articulation and affirmative expression\u2019 is not satisfied when the State\u2019s position is one of mere neutrality respecting the ... actions challenged as anticompetitive.\u201d <em>Community Communications, </em>455 U.S. at 55, 102 S.Ct. at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">Moreover, to the extent that New York Telephone\u2019s conduct might actually violate the Sherman Act, that conduct would appear to directly conflict with New York State\u2019s regulatory policy. This conclusion follows from two facts. First, as all parties concede, the Public Service Commission seeks to promote competition in <em>all </em>aspects of the telephone industry. <em>See </em>Testimony of Paul Gioia, Chairman, Public Service Commission of the State of New York, before Legislative Commission on Science and Technology and Assembly Committee on Corporations, Authorities, and Commissions, February 1982. Thus, to the extent that the Public Service Commission has approved practices challenged herein, that decision logically would represent at most a determination that such practices are not anticompetitive. It would not imply that the PSC considers a certain level of anti-competitive behavior desirable. Second, and more importantly, the New York Court of Appeals has ruled \u2014 in a case involving the parties herein \u2014 that a Public Service Commission determination as to the legality of various practices will not bar a private plaintiff from pursuing a state antitrust action challenging those practices. <em>Capital Telephone Company v. Pattersonville Telephone Company, et al., </em>56 N.Y.2d 11, 451 N.Y.S.2d 11, 436 N.E.2d 461 (1982). In that case, the N.Y. Court of Appeals stated that \u201cdiscrimination which may be justifiable under ... the Public Service Law \u2018may still be unlawful if it can be shown to have actually restrained competition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 451 N.Y.S.2d 11, 436 N.E.2d 461. Since New York\u2019s Donnelly Act, N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law \u00a7 340 (McKinney 1968), is essentially a state version of the Sherman Act \u2014 and hence there is no evidence herein that New York State intended to displace its own, let alone federal, antitrust laws \u2014 the State\u2019s decision to regulate the telephone industry cannot be considered inconsistent with application of fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>eral antitrust law to that industry. Thus, one must conclude that New York\u2019s antitrust law and Public Service Law fulfill different but complementary functions with regard to the telephone industry, and, further, that Public Service Commission regulation does not conflict with a policy of free competition in the telephone industry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I would conclude that New York has not decided to eliminate competition in the telephone industry but instead has decided to encourage competition through the dual means of careful regulation and application of antitrust law, state and federal. Under these circumstances, I would hold that appellee's allegedly anticompetitive activities are not exempt from the federal antitrust laws. <em>See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., </em>428 U.S. at 595-96, 96 S.Ct. at 3119-20. I would reverse and remand accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">. There may be limits other than those expressed in <em>Midcal </em>on a state\u2019s ability to impose a regime of economic regulation that conflicts with the principle of free competition mandated by the Sherman Act. For example, Judge Greene, in <em>United States v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>552 F.Supp. 131, 157-58 (D.D.C.1982), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>460 U.S. 1001, 103 S.Ct. 1240, 75 L.Ed.2d 472 (1983), suggested that state action immunity may be unavailable where the industry involved is by its nature \"technologically and economically, a national network with interdependent components\u201d \u2014 such as the telephone industry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1241-15\">. As a general proposition, the interpretation of a state\u2019s law by the highest court of that state is conclusive. <em>Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, </em>362 U.S. 207, 211, 80 S.Ct. 619, 621, 4 L.Ed.2d 660 (1960); <em>General Trading Co. v.

Railroad Commission, </em>279 U.S. 125, 139, 49 S.Ct. 325, 328, 73 L.Ed. 637 (1929). This rule, of course, is inapplicable when acceptance of such an interpretation would thwart vindication of a constitutional right, <em>Indiana ex rel. Anderson v. Brand, </em>303 U.S. 95, 100, 58 S.Ct. 443, 446, 82 L.Ed. 685 (1938), but such a situation is not present here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
