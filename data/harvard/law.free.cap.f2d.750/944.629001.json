Grier (Grier) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">Grier was a civilian employee at the San Francisco Public Health Service Hospital. On August 17, 1980 [sic, 1981], Grier received a general notice of a reduction in force (RIF) because of an anticipated decrease in funding for fiscal year 1982. On October 19, 1980 [sic, 1981], Grier received a specific RIF notice which advised him that Health and Human Services (agency) had determined that the San Francisco Public Health Service Hospital would be closed because of the reduced funding provided by Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub.L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 357 (1981). The notice further stated that his competitive area was the San Francisco Public Health Service Hospital. Since the entire hospital would be closed, he would be separated by RIF procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">Grier argued before the Board\u2019s presiding official that the agency\u2019s determination to place him in a competitive area consisting of only the San Francisco Public Health Service Hospital denied him the right to compete for other positions and thus was contrary to the regulations. He contended that the agency\u2019s decision constituted harmful procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-13\">The agency\u2019s testimony showed that each Public Health Service hospital was under a regional office\u2019s appointing authority forming a separate competitive area. Grier\u2019s competitive area was limited to the local commuting area for the San Francisco hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-16\">The presiding official found the agency\u2019s implementation of the RIF was in accordance with applicable regulations. The presiding official\u2019s initial decision became final pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-17\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-18\">In this appeal, Grier raises the same issue argued before the Board. He contends that the agency decision to make the San Francisco Public Service Hospital a competitive area was contrary to regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Chapter 351 of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM). In petitioner\u2019s view an agency <em>must </em>designate a competitive area large enough \u2014 either geographically or organizationally, or both \u2014 so th\u00e1t some jobs remain in the competitive area after jobs are eliminated. Otherwise, the area is not \u201clarge enough to permit adequate competition among employees\u201d as required by FMP 351, 2-2b (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-19\">We have found no statute, regulation or case law which requires an agency to expand a competitive area for the sole purpose of providing actual competition for a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-20\">The validity of petitioner\u2019s separation turns on the validity of OPM\u2019s regulations concerning RIFs. These regulations were adopted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502 which reads in part: \u201cThe Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations for the <em>release </em>of competing employees in a reduction in force____\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-21\">The RIF regulations promulgated by OPM pursuant to its legislative mandate in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502 provide the administrative process through which the government eliminates jobs and deals with the employees who formerly occupied the abolished positions. Unlike adverse actions, RIFs are not aimed at removing particular individuals; rather, they are directed solely at positions. After the agency has decided to eliminate positions as a matter of its inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>pendent managerial discretion, the identification of affected employees is governed by OPM regulations. To avoid the personnel problems which might result if all government employees were affected by every RIF, OPM has limited the term \u201ccompeting\u201d by carefully defining the scope of competition in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.-401-.506.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Two criteria are used in delineating the scope of competition: competitive area and competitive level. Here we are concerned solely with that portion of the RIF regulations dealing with competitive area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">A competitive area is defined as the geographical area and bureaucratic unit within which the incumbent of an eliminated position will be permitted to vie for retention. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402. Agencies, therefore, must accommodate two elements, administrative structure and geography, in determining competitive areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">As to structure, a competitive area should include \u201call or that part of an agency in which employees are assigned under a single administrative authority.\u201d FMP 351-2-2a (1981). This requirement is designed to limit the effects of a RIF to the administrative component whose management decided the reduction was necessary. Ideally, the regulations permit a single administrative unit to plan and carry out the entire personnel action with only minimal effects on the remainder of the agency\u2019s administrative structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">As to the geographic requirement, no competitive area need be larger than the \u201clocal commuting area.\u201d FPM 351-2-2b (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">Although a competitive area theoretically should encompass no less than a single distinct agency subdivision and no more than a single commuting area, an agency may create competitive areas larger than those required by the regulations without prior OPM approval. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402(c). A commentator has stated that \u201c[t]his ability to expand competitive areas appears to be the most advantageous method of encouraging enhanced competition whenever efficiency can be preserved. Still, any attempt by the [OPM] to promulgate regulations identifying when expanded competitive areas should be created would likely result in considerable confusion.\u201d Note, <em>Reduction In Force: A Guide For The Uninitiated, </em>44 GEO.WASH.L.REV. 642, 651 n. 51 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">Therefore, the agency may, but need not, expand the competitive area to provide actual competition. This is left solely to the agency\u2019s discretion and this court has held: \u201cAn agency is accorded wide discretion in conducting a reduction in force; absent a clear abuse of discretion, a substantial departure from applicable procedures, a misconstruction of governing statutes, or the like, we do not upset a final agency decision.\u201d <em>Cooper v. TVA, </em>723 F.2d 1560, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Dancy v. United States, </em>668 F.2d 1224, 1226, 229 Ct.Cl. 300 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">One of our predecessor courts has stated that it was obvious from the language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a), which remains virtually unchanged since its enactment in 1944,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that Congress has left the OPM to deal with all the disruptions whenever the inevitable RIF occurred. The regulations that ensued have been attacked without success by employees whose retention rights the statutes curtailed. <em>Finch v. United States, </em>179 Ct.Cl. 1 (1967) (citing <em>Elder v. Brannan, </em>341 U.S. 277, 71 S.Ct. 685, 95 L.Ed. 939 (1951); <em>Fass v. Gray, </em>197 F.2d 587 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>344 U.S. 839, 73 S.Ct. 39, 97 L.Ed. 653 (1952); <em>Leeds v. Rossell, </em>101 F.Supp. 481 (S.D.N.Y.1951)). The <em>Finch </em>court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-13\">There would seem to be no doubt that in enacting section 861 originally the Congress was made fully aware of a long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>standing policy of limiting veterans\u2019 retention rights by competitive area and competitive level, then stated in 5 CFR (Supp.1943) Sec. 12.301-12.313, and that the Commission did not expect the new legislation to effect changes in that regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-5\">... In any event, the involved interpretation and application of section 861 was for the Commission, not the courts, absent abuse of discretion not shown here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ8s\">179 Ct.Cl. at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">In <em>Bashein v. United States, </em>279 F.2d 255, 150 Ct.Cl. 138 (1960), the court upheld the validity of the Navy\u2019s treatment of two shipyards, both in the Port of New York, as separate competitive areas and implied that it was at the agency\u2019s discretion to seek a broadening of that competitive area. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-7\">[T]here is no question that the Shipyard and the Supply Depot were under separate command, and that separate retention registers were maintained at each installation____ The activities of each were completely different and to hold that one could foist its employees on the other by a bumping process, merely because both were in the Navy Department and close neighbors, and both maintained a police force would, to put it mildly, create consternation in the camp of the employment officer of either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-10\">The record does not disclose that approval was sought or granted to broaden that competitive area as regarded the civilian police force of either the Naval Shipyard or the Bayonne Naval Supply Depot____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-11\">Therefore, we hold that the regulation was not meant to encompass the entire Navy Department, but was directed to each Naval establishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-12\">... the reductions were accomplished in accordance with statute and regulations ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">279 F.2d at 257-58, 150 Ct.Cl. at 142-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">The agency properly established the hospital, an activity under a separate administration, as Grier\u2019s competitive area in accordance with the requirements of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402. This section creates retention rights among competing employees in a competitive area. It does not guarantee that there will be positions for which employees may compete. Nor does it create a right to continued employment if the decision is made to terminate some or all of the employees in a given group. <em>See American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Stetson, </em>640 F.2d 642, 645 (5th Cir.1981). Further, the FPM specifically recognizes that all positions may properly be eliminated within a competitive area. FPM 351-3-2d(1). Thus, the proper interpretation of the regulations is contrary to that asserted by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">In light of the substantial evidence presented in support of the Board\u2019s decision, and the agency\u2019s compliance with applicable regulations, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1018-9\"> With the exception of minor amendments and the 1978 amendment which substituted the OPM for the Civil Service Commission, the current statutory provisions applicable to RIFs were enacted in the Veterans Preference Act of 1944. The Act codified the many statutes, executive orders and administrative practices that had been used to give preferences in federal employment through the preceding century.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
