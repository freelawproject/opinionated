WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b479-16\">We consider three appeals from denials of petitions for appointment of counsel under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). The appeal consolidates three independent <em>in forma pauper-is </em>civil rights actions brought by prison inmates pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Each plaintiff moved the district court for appointment of counsel, but in each case, the motion was denied. Plaintiffs appeal from the denial of these motions. Two issues are presented on appeal: (1) whether the denials of motions to appoint counsel in these eases are appealable orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and if so, (2) whether the decision to deny appointed counsel in any or all of the three cases was appropriate. We first conclude that denial of counsel in a civil rights case is appealable as a final collateral order. Finding jurisdiction, we remand each case on the merits for more detailed findings by the district court as to why appointment of counsel was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-20\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b479-21\">The first of the three cases in this consolidated appeal was brought in December 1981, by Johnny W. Robbins, an inmate at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Robbins brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that he had been denied competent medical assistance, and that he had been denied an appropriate diet. Robbins\u2019 suit was filed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and referred to a United States magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-22\">Robbins moved for appointment of counsel under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. In December 1982, the magistrate denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. Over a year later, in April 1983, the magistrate again denied a motion for appointment of counsel, stating in a minute entry that \u201cthis case is not too complex for presentation by the plaintiff ... [and] plaintiff is capable of properly investigating this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-23\">Thereafter, on April 22, 1983, Robbins filed a notice of appeal stating that review was sought \u201cby the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit from the final judgment entered in this action, denying plaintiffs an attorney on the 7th day of April, 1983.\u201d On April 26, 1983, four days after Robbins filed the notice of appeal, the district court affixed a handwritten order to Robbins\u2019 certificate for appeal, pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 24.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aed\">Petitioner seeks to appeal from an order of the magistrate who refused to appoint counsel to referenced petitioner in this \u00a7 1983 action. There was no abuse of discretion on the part of the magistrate. The Court finds petitioner is not entitled to counsel at this time in this suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5R\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Robbins did not file a formal notice of appeal from the April 26, 1983, district court order. On May 24, 1983, however, Robbins did file in this Court a document entitled \u201cMOTION TO PROCEED ON APPEAL IN FORMA PAUPERIS.\u201d At issue is whether either of the motions filed by Robbins satisfies the requirements for proper notice of appeal from the April 26, 1983, district court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The second plaintiff, Charles Edward Bolden, filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in March 1983. Bolden alleged inadequate medical treatment while incarcerated at the St. Martin Parish Jail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Named as defendants were Steve Champagne, Warden of the St. Martin Parish Jail; Earl Dundas, a nurse at the jail; and Dr. Willis Bienvenue, a physician at University Medical Center. In May 1983, Bolden moved for appointment of counsel. The motion was supported by an affidavit stating that \u201cI can not read or write to good and in a case like this I don\u2019t no all my right.\u201d The district court denied Bolden\u2019s motion on June 15, 1983, concluding that \u201cthis is not such an exceedingly complex case that Plaintiff will not be able to adequately represent himself.\u201d Bolden timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The third and final plaintiff, Kenneth James Midkiff, filed a \u00a7 1983 suit <em>in forma pauperis </em>in May 1983. Midkiff alleged that he had suffered a broken hand while incarcerated at the Lafayette Parish Jail, and that he had not received proper medical attention. In an affidavit attached to the complaint, Midkiff moved for appointment of counsel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) stating that \u201cI will not be able to file any other papers, and do not have law books to look up case law.\u201d Midkiff has a high school education.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In June 1983, the district court denied Midkiff\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, concluding that the case was not overly complex. Midkiff filed timely notice of appeal from the district court order on June 23,1983. On that same day, Midkiff filed a second federal lawsuit, based on the same facts as the first suit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, against Joseph C. Duhon, Warden of the Lafayette Parish Jail, and Brett Pryor, jailer. Midkiff simultaneously made a motion for appointment of counsel, alleging that the case was serious and that \u201c[I] have no law understand what so ever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">On July 6, 1983, the magistrate consolidated Midkiff\u2019s two suits, and denied Midkiff\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. Midkiff timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">I. NOTICE OF APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">We must first decide whether the appeal of appellant Robbins is timely. Robbins failed to file a document constituting a timely notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rule 4(a) requires that a notice of appeal \u201cbe filed with the clerk of the district court within 30 days after the date of the entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\u201d The time limitation for filing a notice of appeal is jurisdictional and lack of a timely notice mandates dismissal of an appeal. <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 103 S.Ct. 400, 403, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982). <em>Williams v. Treen, </em>671 F.2d 892, 895 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1126, 103 S.Ct. 762, 74 L.Ed.2d 977 (1983). We do accept the filing of certain documents other than a formal notice of appeal, if filed within the thirty day limit of Rule 4(a), as the substantial equivalent of a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">This Court has repeatedly held that a request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>satisfies the filing requirement for notice of appeal. <em>See Causey v. Civiletti, </em>621 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>F.2d 691 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Cobb v. Lewis, </em>488 F.2d 41 (5th Cir.1974); <em>Tillman v. United States, </em>268 F.2d 422 (5th Cir.1959). Plaintiff Robbins\u2019 motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>was filed within the thirty day period following the district court\u2019s denial of appointment of counsel, and as such, we accept it as the substantial equivalent of a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We next address the question of our jurisdiction over these appeals. Section 1291 of 28 U.S.C. provides, \u201c[t]he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all <em>final decisions </em>of the district courts of the United States ... except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.\u201d (emphasis added). A final decision for purposes of \u00a7 1291 has been defined as \u201ca decision by the District Court that \u2018ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) (quoting <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945)). Appellees argue that an order denying counsel does not prevent a litigant from presenting a <em>pro se </em>claim to the court. Since such an order does not end the litigation on the merits, it cannot be considered a \u201cfinal decision.\u201d Accordingly, appellees argue that this Court has no jurisdiction to consider these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In response, appellants contend that even if the orders denying counsel do not constitute \u201cfinal decisions,\u201d they nevertheless are appealable under the \u201ccollateral order\u201d doctrine of <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The issue in <em>Cohen </em>was the appealability of a district court order in a stockholder\u2019s derivative suit, denying a defendant\u2019s motion that the plaintiff be required to post security for costs of litigation. Although that order did not technically end the litigation on the merits, the Court held that it nevertheless was immediately appealable. The Court reasoned that an order denying security for costs would be unreviewable if review was postponed until final disposition of the merits. After disposition of the case on the merits, any right plaintiff might have to security would be lost. Thus, the Court created an exception to the final decision requirement. In <em>Cohen </em>the court explained that this \u201ccollateral order\u201d exception is applicable when the district court order falls within \u201cthat small class which finally determinefs] claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">In <em>Caston v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., Hattiesburg, Miss., </em>556 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1977), this Court concluded with \u201clittle hesitation\u201d that a plaintiff who was allowed to file a Title VII suit <em>in forma pauperis </em>but was then denied appointed counsel could immediately appeal the denial of his application for counsel. We stated in <em>Caston:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"APy\">Obviously, the refusal to appoint an attorney is collateral to the merits of the case. The decision to deny the assistance of an appointed attorney to a layman unschooled in the law in an area as complicated as the civil rights field is truly too important to be deferred until a resolution on the merits can be had. Such an individual likely has little hope of successfully prosecuting his case to a final resolution on the merits. Thus, we hold that the denial of an application to appoint counsel pursuant to Section 706(f) of Title VII is immediately appeal-able pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1308.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">Appellees acknowledge the precedent established in this Circuit by <em>Caston, </em>and do not attempt to distinguish the present case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>on its facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, appellees argue that since our decision in <em>Caston, </em>the collateral order doctrine has been constricted and that under the later interpretations a district court order denying appointment of counsel is not appealable prior to disposition on the merits. Appellees refer to <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981), and <em>Flanagan v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1051, 79 L.Ed.2d 288 (1984), all of which were decided by the Supreme Court subsequent to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Caston.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Appellees are correct in their assertion that the <em>Cohen </em>doctrine has been restated with significance since our decision in <em>Caston. </em>One year after <em>Caston, </em>in <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>the Supreme Court dealt with the appealability of a district court order denying a motion to certify a case as a class action. The Court concluded that such an order was not final nor collateral and thus not appealable prior to a determination of the case on the merits. In order to qualify as collateral, the Court stated that an order must (1) \u201cconclusively determine the disputed question\u201d, (2) \u201cresolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action\u201d, and (3) \u201cbe effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>437 U.S. at 468, 98 S.Ct. at 2458. The first two <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>elements merely track the requirements established in <em>Cohen. </em>The third condition, however \u2014 that the order be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment \u2014 was not stated as part of the original <em>Cohen </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Applying the <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>test three years later in <em>Firestone, </em>the Court held that an order denying a motion to disqualify counsel in a civil case was not appealable as a collateral order because the third <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>element had not been met. An order denying disqualification of counsel is reviewable as part of a final judgment, and it was found not to differ significantly from other interlocutory orders reviewable only after final judgment. <em>Id. </em>449 U.S. at 376, 101 S.Ct. at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">In its most recent pronouncement on the appealability of interlocutory orders, the Supreme Court held that the granting of pretrial motions to disqualify defense counsel in criminal prosecutions are not immediately appealable. <em>Flanagan v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1051, 79 L.Ed.2d 288 (1984). The Court reasoned that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a speedy trial required utmost strictness in the interpretation of the collateral order exception to the final judgment rule in criminal cases. <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">The decision in <em>Flanagan </em>turned on an analysis of the second <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>element. The Court held that an order granting disqualification of counsel was not an issue sufficiently separable from the merits of the action to justify immediate appeal. This was so because prejudice to a criminal defendant is not presumed upon disqualification of counsel as it would be when a criminal defendant is denied an asserted right such as appointment of counsel. The Court concluded that a criminal defendant\u2019s rights are only violated if it can be demonstrated that a disqualification order actually resulted in prejudice to the defendant. Because actual prejudice cannot be fairly assessed until after trial, an order granting disqualification in a criminal case is not sufficiently separable from the merits of the case. Thus, the second <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>element was found to be unsatisfied. <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-17\"><em>Flanagan </em>narrowly applies to orders granting disqualification of counsel in criminal cases. This Court has recently considered whether orders granting disqualification in civil cases would be directly appealable. We held that orders granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>disqualification in civil cases are not appealable under the collateral order exception because such orders do not \u201clend themselves more readily to consideration apart from the merits of the litigation than such orders in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Gibbs v. Paluk, </em>742 F.2d 181, 186 (5th Cir.1984). The Court felt constrained by <em>Flanagan </em>to find that the second <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>element was not satisfied because a disqualification order was of such nature that fair assessment of prejudice in the civil context, as in the criminal context, could only be made after completion of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 185.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The question presented in these appeals while somewhat analogous differs as to its critical elements from the issue of the appealability of disqualification orders. Appellees urge that the analogy is close and controlling. It is their position that in light of the recent Supreme Court decisions, <em>Caston </em>is no longer binding. They contend that an order denying appointment of counsel in civil rights cases does not meet the <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>unreviewability test because any damage created by an erroneous order denying counsel can be remedied on appeal simply by ordering a new trial with appointed counsel. Appellees also question the separability of the appealed order from the underlying merits in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Flanagan. </em>They support their arguments by pointing out that other circuit courts have addressed this same issue after <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>and have ruled <em>against </em>appealability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During the same period, however, other circuits have ruled that orders denying counsel in civil rights cases are appealable as collateral orders.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">The <em>Caston </em>decision was implicitly reaffirmed by this Court in <em>White v. United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., </em>646 F.2d 203 (5th Cir.1981). The Court did not address the jurisdictional question of appealability of orders denying appointment of counsel but focused instead on the merits of the district court\u2019s grounds for denying the plaintiffs\u2019 applications. <em>White </em>was decided subsequent to <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand. </em>We must, therefore, recognize that this Court decided that the result reached in <em>Caston </em>had not been altered by the <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>redefinition of the <em>Cohen </em>test.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here we turn our attention specifically to the appealability issue, and we confirm the result in <em>White.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>For an interlocutory order to be appealable immediately, <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>requires that the order (1) conclusively determine the disputed question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. We conclude that all three elements are satisfied by an order denying appointment of counsel in civil rights cases and that the order is subject to immediate appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The first <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>element is met because the order is one that conclusively determines the question of appointment of counsel. If a defendant after denial of the motion chooses to go forward with his claim, he must do so without the assistance of appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The second requirement raises a closer question. Can an order denying counsel be considered separable from and collateral to the underlying merits of the litigation after <em>Flanagan\u2019s </em>elaboration of the second <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>element? This Court stated unequivocally in <em>Caston </em>that \u201c[ojbviously, the refusal to appoint an attorney is collateral to the merits of the ease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1308. We do not find that <em>Flanagan </em>in any way alters this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Generally speaking, no right to counsel exists in \u00a7 1983 actions. <em>Hardwick v. Ault, </em>517 F.2d 295, 298 (5th Cir. 1975). However, this court has recognized that appointment of counsel should be made as authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) where \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d are present. <em>Branch v. Cole, </em>686 F.2d 264, 266 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Schack v. Florida, </em>391 F.2d 593 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>392 U.S. 916, 88 S.Ct. 2080, 20 L.Ed.2d 1376 (1968). Although no comprehensive definition of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d is practical, \u201cthe existence of such circumstances will turn on the quality of two basic factors \u2014 the type and complexity of the case, and the abilities of the individual bringing it\u201d, (footnote omitted). <em>Branch, </em>686 F.2d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">In <em>Branch, </em>a plaintiff in a post-trial appeal challenged the denial of appointment of counsel by the district court in a state prisoner\u2019s civil rights action. This Court held that in considering whether exceptional circumstances existed, the Court could only look at facts known by the district court <em>prior </em>to trial. Hindsight gained by observing the litigant\u2019s actual performance was an inappropriate consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 266. <em>Branch, </em>therefore, instructs us to review orders denying counsel in light of facts before the district court when the denial of appointment of counsel was ordered, and not in relation to what ensued at trial. This is in complete contrast to orders conveying disqualification of counsel. <em>See Firestone </em>and <em>Flanagan, supra, </em>where the evaluation is based upon prejudice at trial. The factors examined in reviewing an order denying appointment of counsel are, therefore, separable from the merits of the case. This fact meets the <em>Caston </em>requirement that an order to be appealable must be viewed as separate from the merits of the underlying litigation. Thus, we find that the second <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>element has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Finally, we consider whether an order denying appointment of counsel will be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. In <em>Caston, </em>this Court expressed the view that a layman unschooled in the law in the area of civil rights who had been inappropriately denied assistance of appointed counsel had little hope of successfully prosecuting his case to final resolution on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 1308. This statement is no less true after <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand. </em>Indeed, there remains a great risk that a civil rights plaintiff may abandon a claim or accept an unreasonable settlement in light of his own perceived inability to proceed with the merits of his case,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>resulting in the loss of vital civil rights claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The holdings of <em>Firestone </em>and <em>Gibbs </em>dealing with disqualification of counsel do not affect our determination that orders denying appointment of counsel are effectively unreviewable because denial of appointed counsel involves different considerations. As pointed out earlier, the issue in orders involving disqualification is prejudice during trial. Disqualification orders do not result in the inability of litigants to advance through their trial and to raise possible issues of the appropriateness of the disqualification order on appeal. A litigant who can afford counsel may erroneously be denied his choice of counsel when a disqualification motion is granted, but. he is still able to proceed with other retained counsel. This is assurance that the opportunity for meaningful review will not perish. But when a litigant unable to afford counsel and unable to present his case himself is forced to proceed <em>pro se, </em>there is little guarantee that a civil rights action will be successfully prosecuted to appeal so that the denial of counsel may be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We emphasize that the application of the third <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>requirement is not whether a claim becomes jurisdictionally unreviewable, but whether it becomes <em>effectively </em>unreviewable. It is technically true, as appellees argue, that a litigant denied appointment of counsel may proceed <em>pro se. </em>However, it is the likelihood that a litigant will not be able effectively to prosecute his claim or to appeal that determines the reviewability of that claim rather than the theoretical existence of the right to proceed with a claim. The potential loss of a claim by a <em>pro se </em>civil rights litigant involves an \u201casserted right <em>te </em>legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.\u201d <em>Firestone, </em>101 S.Ct. at 675 (quoting <em>United States v.

Thus, we find that the third <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>element is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">We conclude, therefore, that orders denying appointment of counsel to litigants who have clearly demonstrated inability to afford counsel continue to fall into the class of orders envisaged by <em>Cohen </em>that are directly appealable as interlocutory orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">III. MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Having concluded that an order denying appointment of counsel in a civil rights action is directly appealable, we turn to the question of whether in any of these consolidated cases such denial by the district court was an abuse of discretion. We find it necessary to remand all three cases before us because we cannot determine from the records whether the district courts exercised reasoned and well-informed discretion in denying the motions. In all three cases, the district courts made cursory findings that the cases lacked the complexity necessary to warrant appointment of counsel and that plaintiffs possessed the ability adequately to represent themselves. Although complexity of the issues and ability to represent themselves are appropriate factors in reviewing requests for appointment of counsel, we cannot review the merits without more specific findings by the district courts as to why counsel was denied in each of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"A7N\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-17\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) authorizes a trial court to appoint counsel for indigent civil litigants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-24\">.

We note, as did the Ninth Circuit in <em>Bradshaw v.

In <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>the Supreme Court discussed the so called \"death knell\u201d doctrine as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>possible justification of appealability of a class certification claim. The Court held that the doctrine did not justify appellate jurisdiction for interlocutory orders denying class certification. Under the \"death knell\u201d doctrine, some courts have allowed immediate appeal of orders in certain cases on the theory that denial of direct appeal would effectively preclude review of any of the issues in those cases, not just of the collateral issues from which the appeals were taken. <em>Gillespie v.

As this Court noted, \u201cneither the language nor holding of <em>[Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>], or the views of the commentators as to its meaning,\u201d support an argument that the decision overruled the death knell doctrine in contexts other than denial of class certification. <em>McKnight </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>667 F.2d 477, 479 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>GARWOOD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AT_\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Though the majority opinion treats the issue fairly and comprehensively, stating as persuasive a ease for appealability as can be made, I nevertheless must respectfully dissent from its holding that these orders denying appointment of counsel are appealable under the \u201ccollateral order\u201d exception enunciated in <em>Cohen v.

The <em>Firestone </em>decision caused the Seventh Circuit, in <em>Randle v. Victor Welding Supply Co., </em>664 F.2d 1064, 1066 (7th Cir.1981), to overrule its prior decision in <em>Jones v. WFYR Radio/RKO General, </em>626 F.2d 576, 576 n. * (7th Cir.1980), which, in reliance on <em>Caston, </em>had held orders such as these to be appealable. The Tenth Circuit, relying principally on <em>Coopers </em>and <em>Firestone, </em>has declined to follow our <em>Caston </em>decision. <em>Cotner v. Mason, </em>657 F.2d 1390 (10th Cir. 1981). The First Circuit, in <em>Appleby v. Meachum, </em>696 F.2d 145 (1st Cir.1983), approved both <em>Randle </em>and <em>Cotner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\"><em>Post-Flanagan, </em>only two Circuits have heretofore spoken to the precise question. In <em>Smith-Bey v. Petsock, </em>741 F.2d 22 (3d Cir.1984), the Third Circuit felt compelled by <em>Flanagan </em>to reconsider and overrule its earlier decision in <em>Ray v. Robinson, </em>640 F.2d 474 (3d Cir.1981), which had held appealable orders denying appointment of counsel under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), relying in part on <em>Caston. </em>The <em>Smith-Bey </em>Court regarded <em>Flanagan </em>as being \u201ca fortiori\u201d on that issue. 741 F.2d at 25. A contrary position was taken by the Sixth Circuit in <em>Henry v. City of Detroit Manpower Department, </em>739 F.2d 1109 (6th Cir.1984). However, the <em>Henry </em>opinion regarded <em>Flanagan </em>as being confined to criminal cases, <em>id. </em>at 1116, and hence felt free to rely on prior decisions holding disqualification of counsel in civil cases to be immediately appealable. <em>Id. </em>at 1117-18. We have already rejected this rationale in <em>Gibbs, </em>where the panel felt compelled by <em>Flanagan </em>to depart from several prior decisions of this Court extending <em>Cohen </em>appealability to civil case disqualification of counsel orders. 742 F.2d at 183 n. 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">In my opinion, the intervening decisions in <em>Coopers, Firestone, Flanagan </em>and <em>Gibbs </em>have cut the ground from under <em>Caston </em>and this panel should no longer follow it, just as the <em>Gibbs </em>panel felt compelled by <em>Flanagan </em>to depart from our prior decisions dealing with disqualification orders in civil cases. <em>White </em>does not stand in the way of this result, for it does not even address the jurisdictional issue, and is in any event <em>pre-Flanagan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">To apply the test for <em>Cohen </em>appealability to these orders, some initial consideration may appropriately be given to the criteria under which such counsel appointment decisions are made and reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>We have stated that \u201cgenerally speaking no right to counsel exists in \u00a7 1983 actions.\u201d <em>Hardwick v. Ault, </em>517 F.2d 295, 298 (5th Cir.1975). The \u201cno right\u201d language of <em>Hardwick, </em>however, \u201cis subject to limitation when exceptional circumstances exist.\u201d <em>Slavin v. Curry, </em>690 F.2d 446, 448 (5th Cir.1982). As this is gauged by \u201cthe type and complexity of the case, and the abilities of the individuals bringing it,\u201d <em>Branch v. Cole, </em>686 F.2d 264, 266 (5th Cir.1982), it necessarily \u201cdepends upon the facts in each case.\u201d <em>Slavin </em>at 448. \u201cConsequently, the decision whether to appoint counsel properly lies within the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Caston </em>we \u201crejected] the notion that the merits of the claim may not be considered in ruling upon an application for counsel.\u201d 556 F.2d at 1309. Although it is not entirely clear from the opinion, it appears that in <em>Branch </em>we adopted a rule of automatic reversal for instances where a requested appointment of counsel was erroneously denied. 686 F.2d at 267. We also stated in <em>Branch </em>that the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action on a given request for counsel would be reviewed only on the basis of the facts known to the trial court when the challenged ruling was made. <em>Id. </em>at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Three or four characteristics have been authoritatively identified as ones each of which an order not finally disposing of the case on the merits must possess if it is to have <em>Cohen </em>appealability. Three are stated in <em>Coopers </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201c... [1] the order must conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 2458.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atm\">In <em>Nixon v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 731, 102 S.Ct. 2690, 2698, 73 L.Ed.2d 349 (1982), the Court noted that \u201c[a]s an additional requirement, <em>Cohen </em>established that a collateral appeal of an interlocutory order must \u2018present[] a serious and unsettled question.\u2019 337 U.S. at 547, 69 S.Ct. at 1226.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Avz\">Determination of whether an order meets these tests must be made in light of the rule that \u201cthe <em>Cohen </em>doctrine \u2018should be strictly construed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spiess v. C. Itoh &amp; Co. (America), Inc., </em>725 F.2d 970, 975 (5th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Arango v. Guzman Travel Advisors Corp., </em>621 F.2d 1371, 1378 n. 8 (5th Cir.1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In my opinion, the present orders do not meet the first and fourth <em>Cohen </em>requirements and are also deficient in respect at least to one, and perhaps both, of the second and third requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The first requirement, stated in <em>Coopers </em>as \u201cmust conclusively determine the disputed question,\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 2458, was restated in <em>Firestone </em>as \u201cthe challenged order must constitute \u2018a complete, formal and, in the trial court, final rejection,\u2019 <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. [651] at 659, 97 S.Ct. [2034] at 2040 [52 L.Ed.2d 651] [1977], of a claimed right ____\u201d <em>Firestone, </em>101 S.Ct. at 675. The <em>Gaston </em>panel did not address this requirement, and the majority opinion here does so only in a eonclusory manner. In <em>Coopers </em>the Court held that an order denying class certification failed to meet the first requirement because \u201csuch an order is subject to revision in the District Court.\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 2458. That is plainly the situation here. In each of the present appeals the reason given below for denial of counsel was that the case was not overly complex or beyond the plaintiff\u2019s capacity to represent himself. Should later developments indicate a greater complexity or a lesser capacity, the district court might well appoint counsel. For example, in one of the appeals <em>(Robbins, </em>our No. 83-3240), the district court\u2019s order states \u201c[t]he court finds petitioner is not entitled to counsel <em>at this time </em>in this suit\u201d (emphasis added). Such tentativeness is inherent in the eomplexity/capacity component of the standard for counsel appointment, as well as in \u201cthe merits of the claim\u201d component of that standard. Of course, the district court\u2019s order finally denies counsel for at least a temporary period, but that is not the kind of final rejection in the trial court which is envisaged by the first <em>Cohen </em>factor, else that factor would be completely meaningless. This is the obverse of the situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>referred to in <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corporation, </em>460 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 927, 935 n. 14, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (\u201cvirtually all interlocutory orders may be altered or amended before final judgment\u201d and so the first <em>Coopers </em>factor \u201cdoes not reach all pretrial orders that are formally subject to revision, but only those as to which some revision might reasonably be expected in the ordinary course of litigation.\u201d). As the <em>Apple-by </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">\u201cWe do not think that a denial of appointed counsel at the outset necessarily \u2018conclusively determine[s] the disputed question____\u2019 [Coopers,] 437 U.S. [463] at 468, 98 S.Ct. [2454] at 2457. We would expect the district court to leave the order \u2018subject to revision,\u2019 <em>id. </em>437 U.S. at 469, 98 S.Ct. at 2458, as, for example, where a possibly meritorious case appears to be developing.\u201d 696 F.2d at 147.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\"><em>See also Henry, </em>739 F.2d at 1121 (Bailey Brown, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting) (\u201c... the very nature of the question suggests that the determination should not be deemed conclusive for purposes of appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The second <em>Cohen </em>factor as articulated in <em>Coopers </em>is that the order \u201cresolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action.\u201d <em>Coopers </em>held that a class action determination did not meet this test because such a ruling \u201cgenerally involves considerations that are \u2018enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.\u2019 \u201d 98 S.Ct. at 2458. Since the propriety of declining to appoint counsel depends in such large part on how complex the facts of the particular substantive claim are and on the degree of arguable merit which the claim has, it would appear that the \u201ccompletely separate from the merits\u201d test as articulated in <em>Coopers </em>is not met by the present orders. <em>See Appleby, </em>696 F.2d at 147; <em>Bradshaw v. Zoological Society of San Diego, </em>662 F.2d 1301, 1332 (9th Cir.1981) (J. Clifford Wallace, Circuit Judge, dissenting).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in <em>Flanagan </em>the Court stated that the second condition for <em>Cohen </em>appealability would <em>not </em>be met in respect to an order disqualifying defense counsel in a criminal case <em>if </em>the \u201casserted right is one requiring prejudice to the defense for its violation.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1057. A possible negative inference from this language is that denial of counsel <em>does </em>meet the second appealability condition <em>if </em>redress for its violation does <em>not </em>require a showing of prejudice in the outcome of the case. If, as <em>Branch </em>indicates, we do not require a showing of prejudice in order to reverse for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>an erroneous denial of counsel, then it is arguable from this language in <em>Flanagan </em>that the second condition for appealability is met. Otherwise, however, it is clear that the second condition is not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">This brings us to the third condition, that the order \u201cbe effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Coopers, </em>98 S.Ct. at 2458. <em>Firestone </em>restated this condition as one which was met only \u201c \u2018where denial of immediate review would render impossible any review whatsoever.' \u201d 101 S.Ct. at 675. <em>Flanagan </em>clearly holds that this condition is not met if .review of the order following trial on the merits is under the presumed prejudice standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201cIn sum, as petitioners concede, if establishing a violation of their asserted right requires no showing of prejudice to their defense, a pretrial order violating the right does not meet the third condition for coverage by the collateral order exception: it is not \u2018effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u2019 \u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1056.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The majority suggests that the party denied counsel will for that reason be unable to perfect an appeal or will be discouraged from doing so. I disagree. A party capable of perfecting <em>pro se </em>an appeal from an order denying counsel is likewise capable of so perfecting an appeal after judgment on the merits. As to discouragement, the Court in <em>Coopers </em>said \u201cwe <em>hold </em>that the fact that an interlocutory order may induce a party to abandon his claim before final judgment is not a sufficient reason for considering it a \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1291.\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 2462 (footnote omitted; emphasis added). <em>See also Firestone, </em>101 S.Ct. at 675-76 &amp; n. 13. Certainly, the large number of <em>pro se </em>tried cases where <em>pro se </em>appeals have been perfected in this Court should suffice to demonstrate that the denial of appointment of counsel does not effectively prevent, or ultimately wholly discourage, such cases from being actually tried and appealed. <em>See, e.g., Appleby, </em>696 F.2d at 146 (\u201c... we are unpersuaded by arguments to the effect that <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs are such a frail class of litigants that denial of appointed counsel at the outset effectively terminates the suit____\u201d). <em>See also Branch; Slavin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">In sum, <em>Flanagan </em>makes clear that if failure to appoint counsel is tested on review by a prejudice standard, then it does not meet the second condition for <em>Cohen </em>appealability, while if it is tested on review by a presumed prejudice standard, then it does not meet the third condition. In neither event is the order appealable before final judgment. <em>Flanagan, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1056-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The fourth condition for <em>Cohen </em>appealability is that the challenged order presents a serious and unsettled question. Here, the respective district courts entered the challenged orders under no apparent misapprehension of the correct and well settled legal criteria, and review of the propriety of the denial hence presents only a question of whether, in light of all the particular facts in each discrete case, the district court abused its discretion. <em>Cohen </em>itself indicates that review of such an order should await final judgment. 69 S.Ct. at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Holding orders of this character appealable before final judgment represents in my view a major and serious invasion of the values sought to be promoted by the final judgment rule. It tends to undermine \u201cthe respect due trial judges by\u201d materially increasing \u201cappellate-court interference with the numerous decisions they must make in the pre-judgment stages of litigation.\u201d <em>Flanagan, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1054. It makes highly probable multiple appeals in <em>every in forma pauperis civil </em>case in which counsel is requested and denied. Section 1915(d), the <em>only </em>basis for appointment of counsel in these actions, is <em>not </em>confined to civil rights cases, but extends to <em>all </em>civil cases prosecuted <em>in forma pauperis. See Henry, </em>739 F.2d at 1124-25 (Bailey Brown, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting). If counsel is requested on filing the action and then denied, there will be an appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Though there is an affirmance,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if the request is renewed and again denied when an amended pleading is filed or following discovery or rulings on motions to dismiss or the like, then there will still be another appeal. Perhaps then we will decide to remand, as we do here, because we regard the trial court\u2019s order as insufficiently specific in its reasons for denial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If denial again follows, there is yet another appeal, the third <em>prior to trial.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Such a prospect is the very kind of thing the final judgment rule is designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-10\">. Post <em>-Firestone </em>and <em>pre-Flanagan, </em>the Eighth and Ninth Circuits held orders denying appointment of counsel in civil cases were immediately appealable. <em>Slaughter v.

Pleasure, </em>425 F.2d 1205 (2d <em>Cir.), cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 880, 91 S.Ct. 123, 27 L.Ed.2d 117 (1970), <em>overruling Miller v. Pleasure, </em>296 F.2d 283 (2d Cir.1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>370 U.S. 964, 82 S.Ct. 1592, 8 L.Ed.2d 830 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\">. In this respect, the present appeals are to be contrasted to those where \u201c[t]he district court conclusively determined that question by the decision manifesting its belief that it had no authority to appoint counsel in this type of case.\u201d <em>Ray v. Robinson, </em>640 F.2d 474, 477 (3d Cir.1981). The <em>Bradshaw </em>court considered that it was faced with a similarly final order, as the denial of counsel there was predicated on the assumption that appointment of counsel was inappropriate in any Title VII case since if the case had merit retained counsel could be obtained because of the attorney fee provisions of Title VII. 662 F.2d 1301 at 1319. Admittedly, <em>Firestone </em>points in the other direction. 101 S.Ct. at 674. But there the character of right at issue (not to have one\u2019s opponent represented by counsel with conflicting interests) was different than that here, and the district court\u2019s order was on its face definitive and purported to govern continued representation throughout the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>101 S.Ct. at 671-72. It was not an order \"as to which some revision might reasonably be expected in the ordinary course\u201d of proceedings in the trial court. <em>Cone, </em>103 S.Ct. at 935 n. 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-12\">. Further, counsel is not appointed in cases such as these for any reason other than to help the party for whom the appointment is made prevail on the merits of his case. The appointment has no significance independent of that merits-related purpose. By contrast, the protection to be afforded by the security at issue in <em>Cohen </em>would in no sense be rendered superfluous if the party who requested it were to ultimately prevail on the merits. Similarly, the protections such as those afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Speech and Debate Clause and the doctrine of executive immunity are designed, in part at least, to shield their beneficiaries from the litigation process, in addition to shielding them from adverse judgments, and are in that sense separate from the merits of the underlying cause of action. <em>See Flanagan, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1055; <em>Spiess, </em>725 F.2d at 974-75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b490-14\">. If we mean it when we say that the appointment decision is committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion, then it follows that in the vast majority of instances we will not ultimately direct an appointment decision different than that made by the trial court. This is certainly in keeping with the source of court authority in these instances, namely, section 1915(d) which relevantly provides only that \u2018\u2018[t]he court <em>may request </em>an attorney to represent any such person [allowed to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>] unable to employ counsel.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b490-26\">. Such remands are not rare. <em>See, e.g., Caston.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b490-27\">. Indeed, the plaintiff may eventually fully prevail at trial, rendering all three pretrial appeals meaningless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
