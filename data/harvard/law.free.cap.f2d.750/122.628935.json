The order under review denied Shin\u2019s motion to reopen his deportation proceeding to allow him to apply for adjustment of his status to that of a permanent resident. The Board regarded the application at issue as repetitive of a prior motion to reopen Shin had made. In denying the instant motion, the BIA referred solely to the reasons already stated in its rejection of Shin\u2019s earlier reopening request. But Shin featured two linked events occurring <em>after </em>the Board\u2019s prior ruling: his wife\u2019s attainment of United States citizenship; and approval by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) of an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d visa petition she filed on his behalf. Because the Board failed to acknowledge the existence of these new circumstances and thus did not address their significance, we are unable to affirm the Board\u2019s order. We remand the case so that the BIA may supply a reasoned, evenhanded response to Shin\u2019s altered situation \u2014 his current status as an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d of a citizen of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Shin entered the United States in November 1972, as a nonimmigrant visitor for business. He did not depart upon the expiration of his visa in March 1973. On the petition of a company that sought to engage Shin as a truck mechanic, the INS, on September 19, 1973, accorded him sixth preference immigrant classification. Based on this preference, on December 14, 1973, Shin applied for status as a permanent resident. Twenty-two months later, on September 17, 1975, the INS denied his application because the agency\u2019s inquiries impugned a representation Shin had made concerning his employment when he applied for his nonimmigrant business visa. On October 21, 1975, Shin was found deportable and was granted permission to depart voluntarily by January 5, 1976. On the same day, October 21, 1975, Shin filed a motion to reopen his application for permanent residence; in this filing, he sought to substantiate further the veracity of his representations about prior employment. Shin requested, but did not receive, a stay of deportation pending disposition of this motion. He did not depart on the appointed day. The INS denied the motion to reopen on February 7, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Shin married a naturalized United States citizen, his second wife,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in January 1977. She filed a petition for an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d visa, but withdrew it in July 1978, after the marriage failed. The INS issued a warrant of deportation on August 11, 1978, and ultimately ordered Shin to report for deportation on July 5,1979. Shin failed to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">Shin married his present wife, then a lawful permanent resident, in June 1980. She filed a petition for second preference immigrant status on his behalf in July 1980. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(2) (1982). The INS granted her petition on June 23, 1981. On June 15, 1981, Shin was taken into custody under a warrant of deportation, but was released under an order of supervision. Shin thereupon filed an application to stay deportation pending consideration of his simultaneously filed motion to reopen to permit him to apply for political asylum, suspension of deportation, and reinstatement of voluntary departure. The immigration judge granted the stay. Eventually, on March 11, 1982, the judge denied reopening, citing Shin\u2019s failure to submit affidavits or other evidence demonstrating either the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d that might qualify him for suspension of deportation, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1254(a)(1), or the \u201cwell-founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>fear of persecution\u201d that might warrant asylum. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(a). The BIA affirmed on June 15, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">From August 1981 through June 1982, Shin reported in person each month to an INS deportation officer pursuant to his order of supervision. In July 1982, INS ordered Shin to report for deportation on August 2, 1982. Prior to that date, Shin again moved to reopen, this time limiting requested relief to suspension of deportation. On August 11, 1982, the District Director stayed Shin\u2019s deportation pending resolution of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The BIA denied reopening on January 18, 1983. It gave two reasons for its decision. First, the Board found that Shin had failed to make a prima facie showing of \u201cextreme hardship\u201d to himself or his spouse, a statutory prerequisite for suspension of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1). Second, the Board denied Shin\u2019s request for relief as a matter of discretion because he had \u201cflouted the immigration laws.\u201d <em>In re Sang Seup Shin, </em>No. A20-484-414, slip op. at 3 (BIA Jan. 18, 1983) <em>(\u201cShin I\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Shin did not appeal this decision. He was ordered to report for deportation on May 24, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Some months after the BIA\u2019s January 1983 decision, on May 13, 1983, Shin\u2019s spouse became a naturalized United States citizen. On June 7, 1983, she petitioned for Shin\u2019s classification as an \u201cimmediate relative,\u201d a status that would exempt him from numerical limitations on immigration visas. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(b) (only \u201cchildren, spouses, and parents of a citizen of the United States\u201d can qualify for \u201cimmediate relafive\u201d status). Shin simultaneously applied for adjustment of status. The INS approved \u201cimmediate relative\u201d immigrant classification for Shin. The BIA, however, treating Shin\u2019s request for adjustment as a motion to reopen his deportation proceeding,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> summarily denied relief in an October 31, 1983, order. Shin\u2019s petition for review challenges the Board\u2019s October 1983 disposition as an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">Shin has applied for discretionary relief \u2014 adjustment of his status \u2014 under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255; <em>infra </em>note 6. Regulations promulgated under the Act permit reopening his deportation proceeding, so that he may apply for such relief, on a showing of \u201ccircumstances which have arisen subsequent to the [deportation] hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2 (1984); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 242.22. Shin rests his claim on two such circumstances \u2014 his wife\u2019s attainment of United States citizenship and the attendant INS determination of his \u201cimmediate relative\u201d status. The material documenting these circumstances \u201cwas not available and could not have been ... presented\u201d earlier. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.2, 242.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">The BIA unquestionably has wide discretion in determining what circumstances warrant reopening a deportation proceeding. <em>See INS v. Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 143 n. 5, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 1030 n. 5, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981) (per curiam). We review Board dispositions in cases of this kind<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> only to ensure that administrative discretion has not been abused. <em>E.g., Chae </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Kim Ro v. INS, </em>670 F.2d 114, 116 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Sida v. INS, </em>665 F.2d 851, 854 (9th Cir.1981). Broad as the BIA\u2019s discretion is, however, that tribunal may not act arbitrarily or irrationally. It may not proceed at whim, shedding its grace unevenly from case to case. It must explain departures from settled policies, <em>see Wing Ding Chan v. INS, </em>631 F.2d 978, 983-84 (D.C.Cir.1980) (citing <em>Wong Wing Hang v. INS, </em>360 F.2d 715, 719 (2d Cir.1966)), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 921, 101 S.Ct. 1371, 67 L.Ed.2d 349 (1981); and it may not unaccountably disregard on one day considerations it held relevant on another day. <em>E.g., Luna v. INS, </em>709 F.2d 126 (1st Cir.1983); <em>Batoon v. INS, </em>707 F.2d 399, 401-02 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Chae Kim Ro, </em>670 F.2d at 116; <em>Sida, </em>665 F.2d at 854-55; <em>Prapavat v. INS, </em>662 F.2d 561 (9th Cir.1981) (per curiam) (on rehearing in light of <em>Wang).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The BIA\u2019s exercise of discretion in ruling on reopening motions is linked to its projection of the likelihood that the applicant would be granted the relief sought if reopening were permitted. <em>In re Rodriguez-Vera, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 105, 106 (BIA 1979). In this case, the Board pretermitted consideration of Shin\u2019s statutory eligibility for status adjustment;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the BIA found it could bypass \u201cthreshold issues of eligibility for relief\u201d because it was \u201csatisfied that [Shin\u2019s status adjustment] application would be denied in the exercise of discretion whether or not eligibility is established.\u201d <em>In re Sang Seup Shin, </em>No. A20-484-414 (BIA Oct. 31, 1983) <em>(\u201cShin II\u201d). </em>In so ruling, the Board relied solely and explicitly upon the \u201creasons stated\u201d in its January 18, 1983, opinion denying reopening to afford Shin an opportunity to gain suspension of deportation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">In its January 1983 ruling, the BIA did not question Shin\u2019s satisfaction of the statutory requirements of presence in the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ed States for the last seven years and good moral character for the same period, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1), but it rejected his claim that deportation to Korea would occasion \u201cextreme hardship.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Board observed that Shin\u2019s skills as a mechanic should help him to find employment in Korea; that sale of the couple\u2019s home and car should, together with bank accounts and other assets, lessen economic detriment; that a letter from his wife\u2019s physician, although stating that she should avoid stressful conditions, failed to detail the seriousness of her malady (hypertension) or show that adequate medical care was unavailable in Korea; and that, in light of the INS\u2019s approval of second preference visa status, even if Shin were deported to Korea, any resulting separation from his wife would be temporary. <em>Shin I, </em>slip op. at 2-3. (The observation that separation would be \u201ctemporary\u201d does not acknowledge that once an involuntary deportee leaves the country, there is a statutory bar to his return for five years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(17); <em>see Luna, </em>709 F.2d at 127.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The BIA ruled additionally that reopening should be denied as a matter of discretion, because Shin \u201chas flouted the immigration laws of the. United States except when they served his purpose.\u201d <em>Shin I, </em>slip op. at 3.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As evidence, the Board cited the year Shin\u2019s original visa expired (1973), the month and year of his deportation order (January 1976), and his failure on two occasions to leave when granted the privilege of voluntary departure. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">We do not suggest that the BIA must rule de novo on each of a series of petitions to reopen a deportation hearing. When circumstances have not changed or significant newly discovered evidence is not presented,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it may well be an appropriate economy simply to refer back to reasons already stated even when a second petition entails relief <em>(e.g., </em>adjustment of status) less demanding or exceptional than that sought earlier <em>(e.g., </em>suspension of deportation).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But that is not the situation here. Shin did not merely seek a different, more common form of relief \u2014 adjustment rather than suspension. He based his petition on events postdating the opinion the Board gave as its entire explanation for turning him away. We are obliged to conclude, on the record before us, that the BIA failed to give due consideration to factors the Board itself has identified as pertinent to the exercise of its discretion. <em>See, e.g., Luna; Batoon; Chae Kim Ro, </em>670 F.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">It is true that the Board\u2019s January 1983 opinion touched on Shin\u2019s marriage, but only in the context of finding hardship insufficiently extreme. Moreover, that opinion contemplated that Shin\u2019s wife might return to Korea with him, to find employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ment and obtain medical care there. The opinion nowhere addressed the relevance of United States citizenship, should Shin\u2019s wife attain that status, as she now has. In view of the \u201cmost precious right\u201d Shin\u2019s wife has acquired, <em>see Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 159, 83 S.Ct. 554, 562, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963), the supposition that she would sell her assets and leave the country, if it ever had validity,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> bears reexamination. Of principal concern to us, however, is the very heavy weight the Board, on other occasions, has said it attributes to the United States citizenship of a petitioner\u2019s spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In <em>In re Ibrahim, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 55 (BIA 1981), the BIA recognized that \u201c[t]he Immigration and Nationality Act makes immediate relative status a special and weighty equity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57. The Act, the Board noted, exempts \u201cimmediate relatives\u201d (\u201cthe children, spouses, and parents of a citizen of the United States\u201d) from numerical limitations on immigration visas. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(b). Further, an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d is exempt from denials of adjustment in status founded on unauthorized employment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c)(2); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.5(a)(2)(vi)(A), .5(a)(3) (duration of voluntary departure privilege is extended for immediate relatives). The special position of \u201cimmediate relatives\u201d was the sole basis upon which the BIA squared denying adjustment of status to Mr. Ibrahim, whose United States-citizen sister obtained approval of a fifth preference visa petition for him, with granting adjustment to an otherwise similarly situated alien in <em>In re Cavazos, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 215 (BIA 1980). Specifically, the BlA said: \u201cIn view of this most favorable status accorded by Congress, we believe it appropriate to accord greater weight to immediate relative status than to visa-preference status when making discretionary determinations under the Act.\u201d <em>Ibrahim, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">We are cognizant that marriage to a United States citizen does not, as a matter of law, entitle a deportable alien to reopening for adjustment. <em>See Riasati v. INS, </em>738 F.2d 1115, 1118 (10th Cir.1984); <em>Obitz v. District Director of the INS, </em>623 F.2d 1331 (9th Cir.1980). In both <em>Riasati </em>and <em>Obitz, </em>courts affirmed BIA denials of motions to reopen where the Board relied on prior denials; in each case, however, the BIA had evidently already taken into account citizenship of the petitioner\u2019s spouse and imminent entitlement to \u201cimmediate relative\u201d status. In neither <em>Riasati </em>nor <em>Obitz, </em>we note, did the BIA utterly fail to consider a \u201csubstantial and weighty equity\u201d; nor was there a salient change in status, such as that identified by the Board in <em>Ibrahim, </em>underlying either Riasati\u2019s or Obitz\u2019s second petition to reopen.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The BIA has judged \u201cimmediate relative\u201d status, about which it was silent in Shin\u2019s case, to be on a higher plane than visa preference status, which it did consider. Because of its silence, we do not know whether the Board has changed course, whether it considers its exposition in <em>Ibrahim </em>distinguishable, whether it believes failing to depart twice is a per se offense which defeats even \u201csubstantial and weighty equities],\u201d or whether the BIA has acted without reason. What determines rights in one case the Board may not ignore in the next.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Discretion does not mean license. We grant the petition for review, vacate the BIA\u2019s order, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>remand the case to the Board with directions to consider and determine the proper weight to be given the United States citizenship attained by Shin\u2019s wife, and Shin\u2019s acquisition of \u201cimmediate relative\u201d status, in light of the BIA\u2019s statement of position in <em>Ibrahim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-10\">.

Shin at no time concealed his identity. Nor did he ever hide or flee from the grasp of the immigration authorities. <em>Cf. In re Reyes, </em>18 I. &amp; N.

Once the INS serves an order to show cause why an alien should not be deported, the alien may apply for adjustment of status only in the procedural setting of the deportation proceeding. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 245.2(a)(1), 242.22 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b196-15\">. Denials of motions to reopen deportation proceedings are among the \"final orders of deportation,\u201d which, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), courts of appeals are empowered to review. <em>Cheng Fan Kwok v.

We share our dissenting colleague\u2019s discomfort with the nation\u2019s convoluted immigration laws and their uncertain, inefficient, or protracted administration. We find his large assault on the validity of motions to reopen unwarranted, however. Affording aliens the opportunity to present new evidence is securely within the Attorney General\u2019s authority to provide procedures for the just administration of the laws governing immigration. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a). In any event, no party to this proceeding has invited us to overthrow or undermine the provision for motions to reopen. <em>See, e.g., Wang, </em>450 U.S. at 140-41, 101 S.Ct. at 1029 (\"The Act does not expressly provide for a motion to reopen, but regulations promulgated under the Act allow such a procedure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">More troubling is the general postulate, proffered by the dissent, that judicial deference should be greatest where an agency exceeds its statutory authority. See dissent at 131. Logically, in such a case, the need for judicial scrutiny would be greater than where administrative power is confined by Congress\u2019 guidance. Our system of laws requires evenhanded adjudication, not administrative indulgences unchecked by congressional limits or judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">The status of an alien who was inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States may be adjusted by the Attorney General, in his discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe, to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if (1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment, (2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">Shin has applied for adjustment of status and, by virtue of his wife\u2019s approved petition for \u201cimmediate relative\" classification, it appears that he is eligible for and has immediately available an immigrant visa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b197-14\">.

Similarly, in <em>Hibbert v.

Here, in contrast, the Board never mentioned any steps taken by Shin\u2019s wife toward naturalization. Instead, it focused on the prospect of her return to Korea to resume her residence, and live together with her spouse, in that country.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b199-12\">.

In my judgment, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) acted properly within its discretion in refusing to reopen Mr. Shin\u2019s deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The majority\u2019s decision rests principally upon the BIA\u2019s failure in its October 31, 1983, order to discuss the new factor of Mr. Shin\u2019s wife\u2019s having become a United States citizen, an event which occurred after the BIA had denied Mr. Shin\u2019s earlier motion to reopen. That prior motion, aimed at suspending deportation proceedings, was denied by the BIA in a comprehensive order dated January 18, 1983. In denying relief, the BIA there determined, <em>first, </em>that Mr. Shin had failed to establish extreme hardship and, in so concluding, took expressly into account the circumstances of Mr. Shin\u2019s present spouse, whom the Board observed was \u201ca lawful permanent resident of the United States.\u201d Order of January 18, 1983 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">But the Board did not stop there. After finding no extreme hardship, the Board went on to determine, <em>second, </em>that \u201csignificant reasons exist for denying reopening, in the exercise of discretion, based on [Mr. Shin\u2019s] actions. [Mr. Shin] has flouted the immigration laws of the United States except when they served his purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. In setting forth a bill of particulars in this respect, the BIA emphasized the following: (1) Mr. Shin had remained in the United States in an illegal status since 1973; (2) he was granted the privilege of voluntary departure on two occasions, in 1975 and 1976, and on each occasion failed to depart; (3) he had been under a final deportation order since January 1976; and (4) it appeared to the Board that Mr. Shin\u2019s \u201cvarious motions at this point in the proceedings [were] designed to prolong his stay in this country pending the processing of his visa in Canada.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The BIA\u2019s order, it bears noting, was final and appealable but no appeal was taken.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">It was this second ground for rejecting Mr. Shin\u2019s earlier motion \u2014 the willful disobedience of United States law \u2014 upon which the BIA <em>exclusively </em>relied in denying relief in the order under review. Nothing has changed in this respect. Mr. Shin stands here now, as he did before the BIA last fall, with a final, unappealed from determination that he has \u201cflouted the immigration laws of the United States.\u201d He does not here, nor did he before the Board, advance any new facts in this respect; in consequence, the BIA\u2019s second ground for denying relief in January 1983 stands unaffected and unassailable by the happy occurrence of Mrs. Shin\u2019s having since become a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">There can be no doubt that it was this second ground \u2014 willful disobedience of federal law \u2014 upon which the Board relied in denying relief in this latest round of maneuvering. The Board\u2019s order is crystal clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-14\">One basis [for the January 1983 denial of relief] was our finding that <em>his application and motion did not merit approval as a matter of discretion. </em>For the reasons stated therein, we reach that same conclusion with regard to the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>stant motion and application for discretionary relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Order of October 31,1983 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">That explanation is entirely sufficient. In a word, Mrs. Shin\u2019s new-found status is utterly beside the point; the Board has ruled that, as a matter of discretion, it will not entertain a request for discretionary relief because of Mr. Shin\u2019s own checkered past of failing time after time to comply with applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">If we must go beyond this basis for the Board\u2019s action \u2014 a ground that I find completely adequate and independent of Mrs. Shin\u2019s status to support the Board\u2019s order \u2014 we then move to the significance of her new status. In my view, it is here that the majority\u2019s reasoning is fraught with potential mischief for future cases, as opposed to reflecting simply what I believe to be a misapprehension of the basis of the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">To begin, let us take note again of the background of this case. Mr. Shin has been illegally present in the United States for over a decade. He has evinced no intention whatever to leave, notwithstanding his illegal status and clear and binding directives to him to depart. He has been taken into custody in order to effect his departure, but through the exercise of discretion was permitted by INS to make other, voluntary arrangements for departing. He still did not leave. His present marriage (his third) occurred seven years into his period of unlawful residence, and five years after he first agreed to depart voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">And the likelihood of his wife\u2019s eventually becoming a U.S. citizen could scarcely have been unknown to the Board in January 1983 when it denied the earlier request to reopen deportation proceedings. The BIA indicated at the outset of its opinion that Mrs. Shin was \u201ca lawful permanent resident of the United States\u201d and noted that she had filed a visa petition on Mr. Shin\u2019s behalf, which had subsequently been approved. Her citizenship, coming a few months later, was no new evidence; it was, in the words of the Second Circuit, merely \u201cthe natural consequence[ ] of her earlier virtual completion of the naturalization process.\u201d <em>Hibbert v. INS, </em>554 F.2d 17, 21 (2d Cir.1977). <em>Hibbert </em>is, in fact, highly instructive. There, the Second Circuit upheld a BIA determination not to reopen deportation proceedings, even in the face of the petitioner\u2019s wife\u2019s having become a U.S. citizen and the fact that the petitioner, in the interim, had become the father of a U.S. citizen child. In language that rings true here, the court flatly rejected the attack on the Board\u2019s refusal to reopen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">On the final application to the Board to reconsider its decision not to reopen, there was no new evidence. [The wife\u2019s] citizenship and the birth of [the] child were the natural consequences of her earlier virtual completion of the naturalization process and her pregnancy, all of which was known to the Board at the time of the first motion to reopen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 21. As does Mr. Shin, Mr. Hibbert strenuously maintained, correctly, that marriage to a citizen is a \u201cfactor of significance\u201d to the INS or, in the words of <em>In re Ibrahim, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 55 (BIA 1981), relied upon here by the majority, \u201ca special and weighty equity.\u201d Like Mr. Shin, Mr. Hibbert argued that this new equity could support a favorable exercise of discretion by the BIA and that the ease should thus be remanded to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">But the Second Circuit was unmoved. The court flatly rejected this request as \u201cwithout merit\u201d because, critically, Mr. Hibbert\u2019s \u201cimmigration history amply supports the discretionary refusal to waive deportation.\u201d 554 F.2d at 21. Under those circumstances, the court concluded, it would be pointless to remand to determine his technical eligibility since the end result was destined to be deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">Here, as in <em>Hibbert, </em>a remand to consider the \u201cspecial and weighty equity\u201d of Mr. Shin\u2019s post-deportation-order marriage to a U.S. citizen \u2014 when the factor of that marriage had earlier been taken into account\u2014 is an exercise in futility, for the Board is properly within its broad discretion in refusing to reopen deportation proceedings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>venerable length by virtue of the applicant\u2019s history of flouting the immigration laws. Indeed, as the <em>Hibbert </em>court noted, it was on this ground that the Supreme Court reversed, in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, a Court of Appeals determination that the statute required the immigration judge to make findings as to the applicant\u2019s eligibility for the requested status (admission into the country as a permanent resident). The Supreme Court held flatly that such a determination would have been \u201cpurely advisory\u201d and, absent a statutory requirement to the contrary, such advisory findings and conclusions simply could not be required of INS by the judiciary. <em>INS v. Bagamasbad, </em>429 U.S. 24, 25-26, 97 S.Ct. 200, 201, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Here, in effect, the majority is directing the Board to issue an advisory opinion as to the applicability of <em>Ibrahim. </em>But, as in <em>Hibbert </em>and <em>Bagamasbad, </em>there is no need for the exercise, no matter how enlightening and edifying a new opinion from the Board might be, for the Board has spoken, finally and decisively. It will not hear further from Mr. Shin no matter how many equities he may amass, for he stands charged and convicted, administratively, of deliberately flouting this Nation\u2019s laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In the judicial quest for reasoned administrative decision-making, we have today taken a salutary principle of law and applied it in a setting where, in my view, it simply does not fit. The immigration laws are unique, an act of fundamental sovereignty quite unlike administrative regulation of natural gas sales or activities in the communications industry. Congress, which continues periodically to examine this set of laws which have aptly been compared to the labyrinth of ancient Crete, has nowhere provided for the procedural vehicle invoked by Mr. Shin. One will sift through this labyrinthine maze of immigration laws and find not a word about motions to reopen deportation proceedings. Congress clearly knows how to provide for motions to reopen, such as petitions for reconsideration, in administrative settings, and has done so with regularity, but it did not do so in this unique area of sovereign national interest. It is within the inherent power of an administrative agency to reconsider its actions, <em>see Dawson v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>712 F.2d 264, 267 (7th Cir.1983), but there is fairly to be inferred a congressional mandate that deportation proceedings, while comporting with elementary values of fairness and decency, are to be accomplished with dispatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">That mandate is flouted daily throughout the Nation, to the point that it has become a truism in public discourse on the subject that this Nation has lost control of its borders. Not only does the Nation seem powerless to curb the tide of illegal immigration in the first instance, but the process of returning whence they came those who are now illegally here has become so protracted and complicated that the cost of an able immigration lawyer is in effect a ticket of admission permitting those unlawfully here to remain indefinitely. <em>See, e.g., Rios-Pineda v. INS, </em>720 F.2d 529 (8th Cir. 1983), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 562, 83 L.Ed.2d 503 (1984). The INS has itself contributed measurably to this enervation, as the saga of the case at hand itself shows. The INS apparently felt that it knew better than Congress, so it drew up a regulation providing administratively for the procedural vehicle that the Article I branch never saw fit to enact. (And, stays of deportation at critical junctures in this drama were granted in two instances, once by an immigration judge and once by an INS District Director.) Then, the Article III branch has seen fit over the years to incorporate a wide body of judicial teaching on administrative decision-making that seems to me wildly misplaced. Today\u2019s decision is but part of that development, unfolding case by case, the end result of which is immobilism in enforcement of these most fundamental of laws. And even a change in today\u2019s result would do little to eliminate the administrative and legal barnacles that have turned the immigration laws and their administration into what our elected representatives not infrequently disparage as a national disgrace.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">And thus, as so frequently happens, a confession of error within the judiciary contains in it the prayer for relief from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>representative branch whose will seems so politely but nonetheless emphatically trammeled in the inexorable extension of the administrative state.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">These broader observations lead me, in closing, back to a narrower point. Since Congress itself has not, in the unique area of immigration regulation, seen fit to provide for motions to reopen deportation proceedings, I should think we would be highly deferential to the Board, particularly where, as here, the petitioner had previously, without success, availed himself of a motion to reopen. The Board\u2019s discretion, in my view, is at its zenith in making a discretionary procedural determination which Congress did not see fit to enact. That discretion was exercised entirely appropriately here, given the blemishes of studied noncompliance with law that mar Mr. Shin\u2019s record, laws of a Nation where he so earnestly and understandably desires to stay. He has been here illegally since 1973. He was first found deportable in 1975; now, almost a decade later as 1985 approaches, his quest to remain in the United States under the protective umbrella of the laws he chooses day by day to violate continues with what seems to be a powerful life of its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">I would affirm the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-10\"> I do not offer this in an effort to assert that Mr. Shin is, by virtue of preclusion doctrines, es-topped from attacking the BIA\u2019s determination. His flouting of the laws of the United States was an alternative determination, and since either of the two alternative grounds for the BIA's decision in the Order of January 18, 1983, would have been sufficient, neither standing alone is, arguably, conclusive. <em>Cf. </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 comment i (1982). However, Mr. Shin\u2019s disrespect for United States law was specifically asserted by the BIA as the ground for denying relief in the Order of October 31, 1983. Mr. Shin\u2019s wife's new status has, as I will seek now to show, no effect on that ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
