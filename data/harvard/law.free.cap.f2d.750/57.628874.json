After a hearing the trial court granted defendants\u2019 pretrial motion to suppress. The government now appeals that determination. The issues presented for review are whether the warrants were proper in form and whether they were supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Agents of the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control sought search warrants for three locations in Ardmore, Oklahoma. The first warrant was for \u201cBucky\u2019s Auto Salvage,\u201d a business operated by the defendant Addison E. Berisford, Jr. The second was for the same defendant\u2019s home. The third warrant was for the home of Addison E. Berisford, Sr., also a defendant. No incriminating evidence was unearthed at the business address, but sizable quantities of controlled drugs were discovered at both residences. Information from these searches led to the issuance of a fourth search warrant directed towards several safety deposit boxes at a local bank. Because of the defects which the trial court found in the first three warrants the contents of the boxes were suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Agent John Guyton prepared a three page document titled \u201cAffidavit in Support of Search Warrant\u201d to support his request to the United States Magistrate for three search warrants. This \u201caffidavit\u201d was typed on plain paper, signed by the agent but undated. It was not separately sworn and subscribed to before a notary or magistrate. Instead, it was attached to printed forms titled \u201cAffidavit for Search Warrant\u201d which were filled out. On the face of each printed form an \u201cX\u201d was placed next to a sentence which read: \u201cSee attached affidavit which is incorporated as part of this affidavit for search warrant.\u201d Each of the form affidavits was properly filled out, signed, dated, and attested to by the affiant. The magistrate signed the forms and initialed two out of the three attached statements of Agent Guyton.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The trial court found the separate attachment was not a proper \u201caffidavit,\u201d and that the attachment of the document to the form did not cure the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">There is nothing unusual about reading together the several components of an affidavit for search warrant, where properly incorporated or related by reference, <em>United States v. Rael, </em>467 F.2d 333 (10th Cir.); <em>United States v. Myers, </em>553 F.Supp. 98 (D.Kan.). When this is done and considered in a nontechnical manner we must hold that the warrants were adequate in form.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">The trial court ruled also that none of the drug transactions described in Agent Guy-ton\u2019s statement were recent enough to support a determination of probable cause for any of the three locations. Thus in the court\u2019s view the information supporting the warrants was stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">The affidavit of May 4, 1983 recited the reliability of the informants and described drug transactions or observations of sales and of drugs at the three locations. As to the dates of these events the affidavit recites as to the salvage yard \u201cas early as October, 1982 and as recently as the last six days, with numerous sales during the intervening time.\u201d As to the 27 Cason Avenue location the time was stated as the last week of March 1983, and for the father\u2019s residence on Harris Street as recently as January 1983 and as far back as October 1982. The affidavit showed that the activity recited by the informants at the several places was interrelated and was continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">We conclude that the time that elapsed between the events recounted in the affidavit and the issuance of the warrants is insufficient to support a finding of staleness especially in view of the continuing nature of the enterprise. <em>United States v. Erickson, </em>676 F.2d 408, 410 (10th Cir.). The passage of time is not the only consideration. <em>United States v. Schauble, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>647 F.2d 113 (10th Cir.); <em>United States v. Rahn, </em>511 F.2d 290, 292 (10th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The affidavit taken as a whole depicts activity of a protracted nature having a connection with each of the three locations. The statements pertaining to the role of the elder Berisford\u2019s home as a storehouse for cash and drugs provided a reasonable basis for the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that the home was still a part of the overall continuing dealings and where contraband was located. The same conclusion must be reached as to the younger Berisford\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, reiterated the importance of veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge in assessing the value of a particular piece of information used as a basis for the issuance of a warrant. The Court rejected the approach that turned these considerations into \u201centirely separate and independent requirements.\u201d The probable cause standard is a practical, nontechnical concept. <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879. The Court abandoned the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>method and adopted instead a totality of the circumstances analysis. The Court in <em>Gates </em>thus said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">\u201cThe task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, commonsense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2K\">103 S.Ct. at 2332.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">We conclude that the issuing magistrate in the present case had a basis under <em>Gates </em>for his finding of probable cause. Agent Guyton\u2019s affidavit when viewed as a whole and in a practical way depicts an ongoing criminal enterprise of considerable scope at the several locations and there was a fair probability of contraband or evidence of a crime to be there found. The informants\u2019 reliability and the basis for their knowledge were adequately disclosed. Accordingly, the magistrate\u2019s \u201caction cannot be a mere ratification of the bare conclusions of others.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2332. Here the totality of the information set out in the affidavit provided the substantial basis for the finding that there was a fair probability that contraband would be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">In view of the disposition by an application of <em>Gates </em>of the issues presented in this appeal, we do not reach the doctrines announced by the Court in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">The order of the trial court with regard to the suppression of evidence is REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
