The issue is whether petitioner\u2019s retirement from federal service was deemed voluntary or involuntary, in the context of a reduction-in-force action. The Board held petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>retirement to be voluntary and therefore dismissed his appeal challenging the agency\u2019s action. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the decision of the Board and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Petitioner Elias Covington is a former GS-13 grade employee of the Community Services Administration (CSA). Covington, who held a 5-point veteran\u2019s preference, was employed by CSA as a General Supply Specialist with a service computation date of August 24, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">On July 30, 1981 CSA distributed a general reduction-in-force (RIF) notice which informed employees that the President had requested no funding for fiscal year 1982, that CSA might be terminated, and that all CSA positions might be abolished as of September 30, 1981. On August 13, 1981, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA), Pub.L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 358 (1981) was enacted. Title VI of this Act terminated CSA as of October 1, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">On August 21,1981 Covington received a specific RIF notice informing him that CSA would not exist after September 30, 1981, that his position would be abolished, and that he would be separated due to the RIF effective September 30, 1981. The notice advised Covington that \u201c[b]ecause all positions in your competitive area are being abolished as of September 30, 1981, you have no right of assignment to another position.\u201d Since Covington was eligible for an immediate retirement annuity, information concerning benefits of discontinued service retirement was included in the notice. The notice advised Covington that he could appeal the RIF action to the MSPB if he was of the opinion that his rights had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">On September 12, 1981 the CSA union filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that CSA employees had rights under the Veterans Preference Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to perform certain activities authorized by OBRA. The union also moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent HHS from filling certain positions under OBRA without first effecting the transfer of CSA employees in accordance with the Veterans Preference Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">Effective September 30, 1981, Covington retired from federal service for reason of \u201cAbolishment of Agency\u201d. The agency treated his retirement as involuntary and established his eligibility for discontinued service retirement. All CSA employees who had not resigned or retired were separated due to RIF on September 30, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">On October 16, 1981 District Judge Penn acted on the union\u2019s complaint and permanently enjoined HHS from staffing positions in the Office of Community Services (OCS), CSA\u2019s successor, without giving the former CSA employees Veterans Preference rights. <em>Nat\u2019l Council for CSA Locals, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), AFL-CIO v. Schweiker, </em>526 F.Supp. 861 (D.D.C.1981). The district court did not decide whether a transfer of function from CSA to HHS had occurred, nor did it adjudicate the rights of former CSA employees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503, holding that the former CSA employees had not exhausted their administrative remedies with regard to questions of employee rights pursuant to RIF procedures. 526 F.Supp. at 864-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">On November 5,1981 Secretary Schweiker determined that a transfer of function from CSA had occurred with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>certain activities of OCS. As a result, approximately 180 former CSA employees were appointed to OCS positions retroactively to October 1, 1981. These persons received back pay and all other benefits associated with their retroactive appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">On December 5, 1981, as part of the transfer process, HHS officials offered Covington a position as a GS-5 clerk-typist with GS-13 saved pay for two years. Covington declined the offer because his experience was as a property officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">As of December 21, 1981, approximately 250 former CSA employees had appealed their separation by RIF to the Board. On February 12, 1982 the Board consolidated these appeals and assigned them to the Office of Administrative Law Judges for consideration of common issues of law and fact which were national in scope. On February 15, 1982 Covington appealed the failure of HHS to transfer him to a position identified with a function that was transferred from CSA, and requested consolidation of his appeal with the others. He requested a hearing and stated that he had retired involuntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">On August 20, 1982 MSPB Chief Administrative Law Judge McCarthy found that a transfer of function had occurred so that certain former CSA employees had the right to compete for positions at OCS. <em>Certain Former Community Services Administration Employees v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>MSPB Partial Initial Decision, Decision No. HQ12008110063 (Aug. 20, 1982). Both parties petitioned the Board to review this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">While these appeals were pending, on July 15, 1983 HHS moved to dismiss Covington\u2019s appeal, arguing that he had retired prior to his separation by RIF and that the Board therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear his appeal. In response to an order to show cause, Covington asserted that his appeal satisfied the requirements of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.901, that he had been terminated by a RIF action, and that his retirement was involuntary and not of his own choosing. He provided copies of his RIF notice, his notice of appeal, and his SF 50 involuntary retirement form. This form appears to have been filled out by the agency, is signed by Mr. Robert Davis on behalf of the agency, and states \u201cINVOLUNTARY RETIREMENT, RIF NOTICE DTD 08-21-81\u201d in Block 30 as the reason for Covington\u2019s separation. Covington also included a copy of a letter dated July 21, 1983 from the former Director of Personnel for CSA which stated that certain other former CSA employees \u201cmay have taken advantage of early retirement, however none of you voluntarily resigned your position\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny records to the contrary are in error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">On August 15, 1983 the presiding official dismissed Covington\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>Case No. DC3518210591 (Aug. 15, 1983). Observing that a retirement is normally a voluntary action which is not appealable to the Board, the presiding official framed the issue to be whether Covington had presented a non-frivolous allegation that his retirement was wrongfully coerced by the agency. Although the presiding official determined that Covington\u2019s \u201cretirement was involuntary, for purposes of [establishing eligibility for discontinued service] retirement\u201d, that fact did not \u201camount to an allegation that his retirement decision was wrongfully extracted by deception or coercive agency action\u201d which would render his retirement involuntary for purposes of establishing Board jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">The presiding official also found that the statement in the RIF notice that no jobs would be available was harmless error which did not mislead Covington because the union had filed a court action prior to the effective date of his retirement. The official concluded that \u201c[w]hile it may have behooved the agency to be more specific so as to inform petitioner that he could retire <em>or </em>be separated by RIF, I do not find the agency\u2019s specific notice presented such confusing or misleading information as might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>work to bring this appeal within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">In his petition to the full Board to review the presiding official\u2019s decision, Covington argued that <em>Gonzalez v. Department of Transportation, </em>701 F.2d 36 (5th Cir.1983), cited but not followed by the presiding official, required reversal by the Board because he had not been informed that by choosing to retire he would forfeit his right to challenge the agency\u2019s action. On January 19, 1984 the Board denied Covington\u2019s petition for review; he then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">On June 18, 1984, the Board issued its opinion on review of the AU\u2019s partial decision of August 20,1982. The Board\u2019s opinion, issued June 18, 1984, modified the decision of the ALT but agreed that the agency had failed to match the continuing functions with those individual employees who had been identified with those functions prior to the transfer. Accordingly, the petitioners were entitled to continue their individual appeals at the local level:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">The effects of this agency error as it relates to each appellant have yet to be determined. Upon remand, each individual appellant must be afforded an opportunity to present with some degree of specificity, evidence which tends to establish that he was denied retention to which he was otherwise entitled under 5 C.F.R. 351.303. <em>Debold v. Department of the Navy, </em>9 MSPB 95 (1982).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-8\">It is therefore incumbent upon each appellant to assert that he was identified with a continuing function that is now being performed by OCS. <em>Jackson v. National Transportation Safety Board, </em>MSPB Docket No. DC03518110850, (January 9, 1984). In addition, the appellant must identify a position or positions for which he was qualified that have been assigned to other employees with less retention standing or positions occupied by employees who had no initial entitlement to transfer. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, at 4. Once these factors have been established by the appellant, the agency may refute the contentions made or prove that that appellant\u2019s rights have not been abridged by showing that notwithstanding the evidence, the appellant would not, in any event, have been retained. <em>Speaker v. Department of Education, </em>11 MSPB 430 (1982). Should an individual appellant present evidence that tends to establish that he was denied retention to which he was otherwise entitled under 5 C.F.R. 351.303 and the agency is unable or unwilling to refute such evidence by showing it to be untrue or that his retention standing would not have provided such benefit, the appellant would prevail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anp\"><em>Certain Former Community Services Administration Employees v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>MSPB Docket No. ATO3518210251 at 21-22 (June 18, 1984) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">This court\u2019s review of decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board is narrowly defined by statute. The Board\u2019s decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-12\">(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-13\">(2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-14\">(3) unsupported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (1982); <em>Hayes v. Department of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535 (Fed.Cir. 1984); <em>Phillips v. United States Postal Service, </em>695 F.2d 1389 (Fed.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-16\">Absent evidence to the contrary, retirement is presumed to be a voluntary act. <em>Christie v. United States, </em>518 F.2d 584, 587, 207 Ct.Cl. 333, 338 (1975); Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supp. 752-1, sub-chapter S1-2(a)(1). Voluntary action initiated by the employee preeludes a subsequent appeal to the MSPB. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.401(c)(3) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-17\">To determine whether a retirement is voluntary, a court must examine \u201cthe surrounding circumstances to test the abili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>ty of the employee to exercise free choice\u201d. <em>Scharf v. Department of the Air Force, </em>710 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed.Cir.1983) (citing <em>Perlman v. United States, </em>490 F.2d 928, 933, 203 Ct.Cl. 397, 407-08 (1974)). The fact that an employee is faced with an inherently unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unpleasant alternatives does not make an employee\u2019s decision any less voluntary. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>591 F.2d 688, 692, 219 Ct.Cl. 86, 92 (1979); FPM Supp. 752-1, subchapter S1-2a(3). But the decision must ultimately be the employee\u2019s decision, not the government\u2019s; whether the employee made an informed choice is the touchstone of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The presiding official found that Covington made no allegation that his retirement had been involuntarily extracted through coercion or duress. However, a retirement need not be \u201ccoerced\u201d to be involuntary. A resignation or retirement is involuntary if it is obtained by agency misinformation or deception. <em>Scharf, </em>710 F.2d at 1574; FPM Supp. 752-1, subchapter S1-2(a)(1). <em>Scharf </em>held that an objective test applies to such situations and that a court in applying this test will not inquire into the \u201csubjective perceptions of the employee\u201d or \u201cthe subjective intentions of the agency\u201d. 710 F.2d at 1575. Unlike a retirement which is induced through duress, there is no requirement that an employee be intentionally deceived about his employment options, it being sufficient that \u201cthe employee shows that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency\u2019s statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The misleading information can be negligently or even innocently provided; if the employee materially relies on the misinformation to his detriment, his retirement is considered involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">We hold that the August 21, 1981 notice was misleading and erroneous in material ways. The notice stated, without qualification, that the agency was going to be abolished and that Covington had no right of assignment to another position. A person in this situation could reasonably rely upon the government\u2019s statement that he would have no opportunity to be reassigned, and Covington did so rely. At no time prior to Covington\u2019s discontinued service retirement did the agency correct its misinformation. Subsequent events, some of which transpired only weeks after Covington\u2019s separation, demonstrated that several functions of CSA were transferred to another agency. Even the presiding official acknowledged that the RIF notice was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">The agency\u2019s erroneous representations are not excused by the fact that the CSA union challenged them in court prior to the date that the agency was abolished. It is not material whether Covington had knowledge of that suit prior to his decision to accept discontinued service retirement. The mere initiation of litigation is not such evidence of eventual success as to have required Covington to stake his sustenance on its outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">We agree with Covington that the events of involuntary retirement and separation by RIF are not necessarily mutually exclusive. As FPM Supp. 831-1, Subchapter S11-2(a) indicates, discontinued service retirement can be obtained upon \u201cinvoluntary separation\u201d, defined as \u201cany separation against the will and without the consent of the employee ____\u201d The manual states that a reduction in force, such as the abolishment of position, is an example of this type of separation. Block 12 of Covington\u2019s SF 50 described the nature of the action as being \u201cretirement-abolishment of agency\u201d and block 30 lists the reason for the separation as being \u201cinvoluntary retirement\u201d on account of the RIF notice dated August 21, 1981. The agency has never denied that Covington was eligible for discontinued service retirement. We find no basis for the agency\u2019s inconsistent position that petitioner was not separated due to RIF or, in view of the contemporaneous statements in the agency\u2019s own documents, that his retirement was other than involuntary. Accordingly, we hold that Covington\u2019s retirement was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Covington also asserted that his rights had not been correctly explained to him at the time of the RIF. His RIF notice failed to state that his involuntary retirement might forfeit any rights that he would otherwise have in appealing the agency\u2019s RIF action. The agency limited Covington\u2019s choices between discontinued service retirement, on the one hand, and separation without severance pay and with reinstatement contingent upon a favorable outcome in a costly, time-consuming appeal. The law does permit such a hard choice, \u201ca choice, as the poet says, between \u2018death and exile,\u2019 a choice between the \u2018guillotine and the hangman\u2019s noose,\u2019 a choice between \u2018Scylla and Charybdis\u2019____\u201d <em>Christie, </em>518 F.2d at 591, 207 Ct.Cl. at 345 (Skelton, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">But the law also requires that a choice between two alternatives, however unpleasant, must be understood by the employee and that such a decision be freely made. In this case, the agency was responsible for Covington\u2019s lack of an informed choice. A decision made \u201cwith blinders on\u201d, based on misinformation or a lack of information, cannot be binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process. <em>Cf. Shubinsky v. United States, </em>488 F.2d 1003, 1006, 203 Ct.Cl. 199, 204 (1973) (Government\u2019s misleading notice of preference-eligible rights and withholding of information concerning plaintiff\u2019s right to appeal adverse action entitles plaintiff to adjudication on the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">Since Covington was not informed that a transfer of function had occurred (and actually was informed to the contrary), he had no grounds to believe an appeal of his RIF action might be productive. The agency\u2019s additional failure to inform him that a retirement election would preclude a later appeal denied him the right to consider this fact in making his decision. Covington was given a Hobson\u2019s choice, that is to say no real choice at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">Covington also asserts that he was improperly denied a hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of his retirement. The decision of the Fifth Circuit in <em>Gonzalez v. Department of Transportation, </em>701 F.2d 36 (5th Cir.1983), is instructive on this point. In that case petitioner received a termination notice which indicated that she could appeal and also either resign or accept involuntary separation and still receive retirement pay. The Fifth Circuit held that the voluntariness of her resignation could not be presumed by virtue of her application for retirement pay, and that petitioner was entitled to a hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of her resignation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-12\">Neither the initial reduction-in-force notice from the Agency, however, nor the subsequent letter from the Board requesting jurisdictional argument, informed her of her applicable rights. The Board\u2019s regulations furnished her do not show that a voluntary resignation waives the right to appeal the termination action of an agency-employer. Nor does the record indicate that Gonzalez was adequately informed, by the Agency or by the Board, of her applicable rights relative to voluntarily resigning and applying for discontinued employment retirement or, in the alternative, accepting involuntary separation and <em>also </em>applying for discontinued employment retirement. In the first instance, she would lose her right to appeal, and in the second, she would not. However, the notice to Gonzalez as a whole indicated that she could <em>both </em>appeal and <em>also </em>either resign or accept involuntary separation and still receive retirement pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">As in <em>Gonzalez, </em>the presiding official in the present appeal issued a decision on the merits of the jurisdictional issue, based solely upon the pleadings and written submissions of the parties. This violated procedures required by law that guarantee an employee a hearing on the issue of involuntary retirement. <em>See Gratehouse v. United States, </em>512 F.2d 1104, 1108, 206 Ct.Cl. 288, 296 (1975); <em>McCormack v. United States, </em>204 Ct.Cl. 371, 373, 378 (1974). Precedent within the MSPB is also in accord. <em>See, e.g., Murray v. Defense Map</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number><em>ping Agency, </em>1 MSPB 338 (January 17, 1980). We note that the government\u2019s own handbook for prosecuting MSPB appeals states that \"[a]n appellant who makes a non-frivolous allegation of the involuntariness of a resignation/retirement is entitled, under <em>Spiegel v. Department of the Army, 2 </em>MSPB 307 (1980), to a hearing to resolve that issue.\u201d H. Ashner and W. Jackson, <em>Representing the Agency Before the United States Merit Systems Protection Board </em>\u2014 A <em>Handbook on MSPB Practice and Procedure </em>29 (GPO May 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The presiding official\u2019s summary disposition of Covington\u2019s appeal without a hearing, despite Covington\u2019s timely request, was a prejudicial violation of Covington\u2019s procedural rights. As we recently noted in <em>Callahan v. Dept. of the Navy, </em>748 F.2d 1556 (Fed.Cir.1984), the hearing right was a central provision of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, and Congress has charged the Board with the job of protecting the procedural rights of federal employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">We hold that Covington\u2019s RIF notice was both inadequate and erroneous. As in <em>Gonzalez, </em>Covington\u2019s appeal should not be prejudiced by the agency\u2019s and the Board\u2019s failure to inform him of his applicable rights as required by statute and regulations. <em>See McCormack v. United States, </em>204 Ct.Cl. 371, 378 (1974) (Government, after put on notice the plaintiff considered his resignation to be involuntary, must inform plaintiff of all administrative rights attaching to an involuntary resignation). These facts, coupled with the agency\u2019s erroneous statement that Covington had no right of assignment, are sufficient to establish, as a matter of law, that Covington\u2019s decision to retire was not voluntary. On remand, Covington is entitled to show at a hearing that he had been denied retention to which he was otherwise entitled under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.303 (1984), in light of the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Certain Former Community Services Administration Employees v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>MSPB Docket No. AT03518210251 (June 18, 1984). Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the MSPB and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503 (1982) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-10\">(a) When a function is transferred from one agency to another each preference eligible employed in the function shall be transferred to the receiving agency for employment in a position for which he is qualified before the receiving agency may make an appointment from another source to that position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-15\">(b) When one agency is replaced by another, each preference eligible employed in the agency to be replaced shall be transferred to the replacing agency for employment in a position for which he is qualified before the replacing agency may make an appointment from another source to that position.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
