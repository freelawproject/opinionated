Since 1979 he has practiced medicine in Florida as an employee of a professional association (hereafter P.A.), of which he is the sole director, officer, and stockholder. The P.A. has employed no one in addition to appellant for most of the time that it has been incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-11\">In 1979 the P.A. created two pension plans pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001, <em>et seq. </em>(1982) (ERISA) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401, <em>et seq. </em>(1982), both established as trusts naming the P.A. as settlor, appellant as trustee, and P.A. employees as beneficiaries. Provisions in the trusts prohibited any assignment or alienation of the beneficiaries\u2019 interests but reserved in the settlor the power to amend or terminate the trusts. The terms of the trusts permitted employees to borrow trust funds. The P.A. and appellant contributed to the trusts. Appellant\u2019s earnings as a surgeon constituted the funds contributed by the P.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-20\">Appellant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on September 3, 1982. He claimed that the two trusts were excluded property according to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(2) (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court rejected his position, holding that the trusts would be included in the property of the estate and therefore could be subject to creditors\u2019 claims. On appeal the district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-21\">This appeal followed. We hold that the trusts were not excluded property under \u00a7 541(c)(2) and, in addition, could not be exempted under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A) (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s decision is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-22\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-24\">Under \u00a7 541 of the Bankruptcy Code, all property in which a debtor has a legal or equitable interest at the time of bankruptcy comes into the estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1) (1982). What constitutes a legal or equitable interest is broadly construed. One exception to the sweeping scope of \u00a7 541(a) is \u00a7 541(c)(2). It preserves restrictions on the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust which is enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>able under applicable nonbankruptcy law and thus prevents such an interest from inclusion in the property of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-4\">Relying primarily on legislative history,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> courts have generally interpreted the section\u2019s reference to \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law\u201d as applying only to state law concerning spendthrift trusts. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Goff, </em>706 F.2d 574 (5th Cir.1983); <em>see also In re Graham, </em>726 F.2d 1268 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Matter of La Fata, </em>41 B.R. 842 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1984); <em>Matter of Berndt, </em>34 B.R. 515 (Bankr.N.D.In.1983); <em>Matter of Kelley, </em>31 B.R. 786 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 1983); <em>In re DiPiazza, </em>29 B.R. 916 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1983). <em>But see In re Pruitt, </em>30 B.R. 330 (Bankr.D.Colo.1983). We too hold that \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law\u201d refers only to state spendthrift trust law. Therefore, ERISA-qualifying pension plans containing anti-alienation provisions are excluded pursuant to section 541(c)(2) only if they are enforceable under state law as spendthrift trusts. <em>See Matter of Goff, </em>706 F.2d 574 (5th Cir.1983); <em>cf. In re Kelleher, </em>12 B.R. 896 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-5\">Florida law recognizes and enforces as spendthrift trusts those trusts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1562-6\">that are created with a view of providing a fund for the maintenance of another, and at the same time securing it against his own improvidence or incapacity for self-protection. The provisions against alienation of the trust fund by the voluntary act of the beneficiary, or invitum by his creditors, are the usual incidents of such trusts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1562-7\"><em>Croom v. Ocala Plumbing &amp; Electric Co., </em>62 Fla. 460, 465, 57 So. 243, 244 (1911); <em>see also Waterbury v. Munn, </em>159 Fla. 754, 32 So.2d 603 (1947). Because the purpose of a spendthrift trust is to protect the beneficiary from himself and his creditors, such a trust fails where the beneficiary exercises \u201cabsolute dominion\u201d over the property of the trust. <em>See Croom, </em>62 Fla. at 466, 57. So. at 244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-10\">Although the two pension plans in the instant case contain- anti-alienation provisions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> they are not spendthrift trusts under Florida law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While appellant as beneficiary cannot assign or alienate his interest in the trusts, he as sole officer and director of the settlor P.A. can amend or terminate the trusts. That appellant can only amend or terminate the pension plans in his capacity as agent for the P.A. is not important here. He alone enjoys the authority to act, whether as an agent of the settlor or in his own right as trustee and beneficiary. He therefore enjoys \u201cabsolute dominion\u201d over the property of the trusts. The reasons for creating and enforcing spendthrift trusts would not be served if we were unwilling to look beyond legal forms in this case. <em>Cf. Matter of Witlin, </em>640 F.2d 661, 663 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201cThere is ... a strong public policy that will prevent any person from placing his property in what amounts to a revocable trust for his own benefit which would be exempt from the claims of his creditors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-11\">We therefore hold that because the pension plans in the instant case are not spendthrift trusts, they are not excluded from the property of the estate under \u00a7 541(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-13\">Although the two trusts come into the bankruptcy estate, we must examine whether they could be exempted out pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522 (1982). That section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>permits a debtor to choose either the federal exemptions listed at \u00a7 522(d) or those provided by state law and also \u201cany property that is exempt under Federal law, other than subsection (d) of this section____\u201d \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A). Florida law, however, eliminates the federal exemptions option of \u00a7 522(d). <em>See </em>Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 222.20 (West Supp.1984). Therefore, the trusts in the instant case will only be exempted if ERI-SA-qualified pension plans fall under \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A). We agree with the Fifth Circuit that Congress did not intend to exempt such plans under this section. <em>See Matter of Goff, </em>706 F.2d 574, 585 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Matter of Turpin, </em>644 F.2d 472, 474 n. 1 (5th Cir.1981) (dicta).</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-7\">The House and Senate reports on \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A) provide a list of property that can be exempted under federal laws.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ERISA-qualified pension plans are not included. Although Congress may not have intended the list to be exhaustive, the failure to include ERISA is nonetheless indicative of congressional intent. Congress knew of the much-debated and comprehensive statute when it issued the House and Senate reports on \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A) in 1977 and 1978, and yet it did not include ERISA in those reports. <em>Matter of Goff, </em>706 F.2d at 585; <em>see also In re Graham, </em>726 F.2d 1268, 1274 (8th Cir.1984). Congress, however, did refer to ERISA in other sections of the Bankruptcy Code. Of particular importance is ERISA\u2019s inclusion within the alternative federal exemptions listed in \u00a7 522(d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The failure to mention ERISA in connection with \u00a7 522(b) was intentional. <em>Matter of Goff, </em>706 F.2d at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-19\">Furthermore, excluding ERISA-qualified pension plans from the list of property exempted under federal law is consistent with an important distinction between exempted property and property covered by ERISA. Despite the similarity between the anti-alienation provisions of ERISA and some of the listed statutes, the \u201cpensions, wages, benefits and payments included in the ... list are all peculiarly federal in nature, created by federal law or related to industries traditionally protected by the federal government. In sharp contrast, ERISA regulates private employer pension systems.\u201d <em>In re Graham, </em>726 F.2d at 1274. It is this \u201cpeculiarly federal nature\u201d shared by the cited statutes that identifies and determines which federal statutes are to be included within the \u201cother federal law\u201d exemption of \u00a7 522 and which, like ERISA, are to be excluded. <em>See Matter of Goff, </em>706 F.2d at 586. The failure to mention ERISA in the legislative history accompanying \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A) is, therefore, both purposeful and reasoned. <em>See In re La Fata, </em>41 B.R. 842 (Bankr.E.D.Mich. 1984); <em>Matter of Kelley, </em>31 B.R. 786 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>(Bankr.N.D.Ohio 1983). <em>But see In re Hinshaw, </em>23 B.R. 233 (Bankr.D.Kan.1982) (ERISA-qualified pension plans are exempt under \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A)). Thus we conclude that appellant could not exempt the two trusts from the bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-4\">The trust funds are neither excluded nor exempted property.
