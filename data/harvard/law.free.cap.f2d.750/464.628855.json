Wise, a claimant in the bankruptcy proceedings of Stalvey &amp; Associates, asks this Court to determine whether his claim against the debtor is protected as a \u201ccustomer\u2019s claim\u201d under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (SIPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 <em>78aaa-78ll </em>(1982). Wise seeks recovery for the value of his bonds, which the debtor, a broker-dealer, removed from the safe-keeping of a bank that held the bonds as collateral for a loan to Wise. The trustee in bankruptcy denied Wise\u2019s claim on the grounds that he was not a customer under SIPA\u2019s relevant provision. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 <em>78lll(2). </em>The bankruptcy court reversed the trustee. The trustee and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d) appealed to this court. We agree with the trustee and SIPC that Wise was not a customer within the meaning of SIPA, and accordingly reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-18\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b538-19\">Erbon Wise, a retired general living in Sulfur, Louisiana, for over 20 years had invested in municipal bonds and revenue bonds. He bought his bonds from Sam Stalvey both before and after Stalvey organized his own company. Wise sought letters of credit from The Mississippi Bank of Jackson, Mississippi (\u201cBank\u201d), for a venture unrelated to this proceeding. The Bank required that he deposit $500,000 worth of collateral bonds in their safekeeping department to secure these letters of credit. Wise delivered half of the bonds to the Bank personally, and sent the other half to Sam Stalvey, president of Stalvey &amp; Associates, Inc. (\u201cDebtor\u201d), to be delivered to the Bank as collateral. Wise received the safekeeping receipts for these bonds. Under the terms of the agreement for the letter of credit and for safekeeping, no one could remove the bonds from the bank without a safekeeping receipt and without substituting replacement bonds having an equal value.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The Bank informed Wise that it was reluctant to assume the responsibility of clipping the bonds\u2019 coupons that would mature and could be cashed at various times. Wise, however, wished to avoid travelling extensively between his residence in Sulfur, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi, to clip coupons. He therefore gave Stalvey authority to clip and cash these coupons and then deposit the proceeds to Wise\u2019s account with the Debtor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stalvey or one of his employees, usually Marcia Crisler, routinely clipped and cashed coupons for Wise as a free service to a \u201cpreferred customer\u201d. The Debtor also absorbed the Bank\u2019s safekeeping charges for Wise. On four occasions, however, Wise sent the safekeeping receipts for particular bonds to Stalvey with instructions to remove these bonds from the bank, replace them with other named bonds of equivalent value, and sell the former collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">On February 18, 1982, the Bank notified Wise that it had only one $5,000 bond in its safe-keeping account. The parties have stipulated that either Stalvey or his employee, Marcia Crisler, removed the missing bonds from the Bank. This removal of the bonds took place without Wise\u2019s instructions, was not accompanied by safekeeping receipts, and was contrary to the agreement between Wise and the Bank. No one has contended that the removal of the bonds was within the Stalvey\u2019s ordinary course of business as a broker. Wise still holds the safekeeping receipts for the missing bonds, but the bonds\u2019 whereabouts are unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">On the same day the Bank notified Wise that the bonds were missing, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d) obtained an order in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi appointing a trustee for the liquidation of the Debtor and transferring the cause to the Bankruptcy Court. On March 31,1982, Wise agreed with the Bank that he would first seek recovery from SIPC as a \u201ccustomer\u201d of the Debtor, but did not surrender any claims against the Bank. Wise filed his claim against SIPC on April 15, 1982.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under SIPA, if Wise were a \u201ccustomer\u201d of the Debtor, his claim would be insured by SIPC, just as the depositor of a failed bank receives protection from the FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">On March 2, 1983, the trustee denied Wise\u2019s claim for the bonds on the grounds that they were not covered under SIPA. Wise appealed to the bankruptcy court, and there prevailed. The trustee and SIPC appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">II, DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">On appeal, SIPC and the trustee advance two contentions. First, they argue that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determination that Wise was a \u201ccustomer\u201d under SIPA is a conclusion of law rather than a finding of fact, and therefore is not entitled to the deference appellate courts pay to the clearly erroneous standard of review. Second, the appellants argue that Wise is not a \u201ccustomer\u201d within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>78lll </em>(2) (1982) because Stalvey did not \u201creceive, acquire, or hold\u201d the securities \u201cin the ordinary course of business\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>and because Stalvey neither had the securities \u201cfor safekeeping\u201d nor had them \u201cwith a view to sale\u201d. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\n<em>A. The Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AeVB\">Wise has argued that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determination that Wise was a customer within the ambit of SIPA is a finding of fact that cannot be set aside absent an express finding that it was clearly erroneous. <em>In re McCrary\u2019s Farm Supply, </em>8 Cir.1982, 705 F.2d 330, on which the claimant principally relies, fails to carry this burden. In <em>McCrary\u2019s, </em>the bankruptcy court determined that a certain business outlet fell within the scope of the U.C.C.\u2019s \u201cplace of business\u201d. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit held that this finding was a factual issue that would not be set aside unless it was clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 332. That court, however, carefully limited its holding: \u201c[T]his determination does not involve a conclusion based on an application of a legal standard, but rather involves a finding based on a non-technical statutory standard closely related to practical human experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201cnon-technical statutory standard\u201d is nowhere defined in the U.C.C. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u201cCustomer\u201d, by contrast, is a statutorily defined term of art as used in SIPA. The term is an integral part of a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the rights of creditors and brokers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is not used in the colloquial sense of \u201cone who buys or trades\u201d. It is instead meant as a shorthand designation for those eligible under SIPA to receive special protection for their investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">This Court has held that interpretations of such statutorily defined terms are a matter of law. In <em>Donovan v. American Airlines, </em>5 Cir.1982, 686 F.2d 267, 270 n. 4, the Court (Rubin, J.) stated that in deciding whether student-trainees are \u201cemployees\u201d under Fair Labor Standard Act\u2019s statutory definitions, \u201c[t]he standard of review ... is that of a legal, and not a factual, determination\u201d. Some courts have explicitly held that the determination of a claimant\u2019s status as a \u201ccustomer\u201d under the SIPA \u201cpresents solely a question of law\u201d. <em>SEC v. White &amp; Co., </em>E.D.Mo.1975, 406 F.Supp. 806, 807, <em>aff'd, </em>8 Cir.1976, 546 F.2d 789. In <em>SEC v. Albert &amp; Maguire Securities Co., </em>3 Cir.1977, 560 F.2d 569, 571, the court observed that the stipulation that parties were \u201ccustomers\u201d under SIPA \u201cpurports to decide a legal issue\u201d. This Court therefore must \u201cindependently determine the correctness of the ultimate legal conclusion adopted by the bankruptcy judge on the basis of the facts found\u201d. <em>In re Hammons, </em>5 Cir.1980, 614 F.2d 399, 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">\n<em>B. Wise\u2019s Status as Customer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Congress established SIPC in 1970 as a nonprofit membership corporation to protect customers who had deposited cash or securities with failing broker-dealers. SIPC was also to arrest the disastrous \u201cdomino effect\u201d that threatened otherwise solvent brokers having substantial open transactions with firms that failed, to restore investor confidence in the capital markets, and to upgrade the financial responsibility requirements for registered brokers and dealers. <em>See SIPC v. Barbour, </em>1975, 421 U.S. 412, 415, 95 S.Ct. 1733, 1736, 44 L.Ed.2d 263, 267. SIPC maintains a fund for customer protection by laying assessments on the annual gross revenues of all securities dealers registered under the 1934 Securities Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78ccc(a)(2)(A), 78ddd(c)(2) (1982). SIPC makes payments to customers who have outstanding obligations with the failed broker or dealer up to $500,000. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 78fff-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\n<em>1. The Trustee\u2019s Denial of Wise\u2019s Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The trustee in bankruptcy denied Wise\u2019s claim for the missing bonds. Although we reach the same result, we use a different route from the one the trustee used.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The trustee relied on two cases in denying Wise\u2019s claim: <em>SEC v. Packer, Wilbur &amp; Co., </em>2 Cir.1974, 498 F.2d 978, and <em>SEC v. Kenneth Bove &amp; Co., </em>S.D.N.Y.1974, 378 F.Supp. 697. In <em>Packer Wilbur, </em>a securities house irresponsibly, if perhaps unknowingly, aided an investor\u2019s fraudulent scheme to buy and sell stock in violation of the SEC\u2019s margin requirements. Packer Wilbur, a brokerage house on the verge of failure, was a third party in one of the transactions in this scheme. Packer Wilbur surmised the investor\u2019s purpose, and paid for the investor\u2019s stock with two checks that it would later dishonor. Packer Wilbur then sold the stock to a third person, and applied the proceeds to its own account. Packer Wilbur fell upon hard times in 1971, and in June of that year SIPC appointed a trustee. The securities house was left with two valueless checks, and it sought recovery both from Packer Wilbur and the investors. In denying the claim, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cSIPA was not designed to provide full protection to all victims of a brokerage collapse. Its purpose was to extend relief to certain classes of customer[s].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8a\"><em>Packer Wilbur, </em>498 F.2d at 983. The trustee in the instant case relied on that language in denying Wise\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In <em>Packer Wilbur, </em>however, the question presented was whether a commercial broker could receive the same protection afforded to \u201cmembers of the investing public\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 984. The court\u2019s holding is inapplicable to Wise\u2019s case, where a \u201cmember[] of the investing public\u201d has filed a claim from a loss he suffered as a direct result of his dealings with a failed broker-dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The trustee\u2019s second case, <em>SEC v. Kenneth Bove &amp; Co., </em>S.D.N.Y.1974, 378 F.Supp. 697, is also inapposite. In <em>Kenneth Bove, </em>the claimants agreed to sell to the debtor, Kenneth Bove &amp; Co., 7800 shares of Princeton Associates for Human Resources common stock for $23,302.50. The claimants were not customers of the debtor before the instant transaction, and they failed to deliver the stock to the debt- or on the sale date or before the brokerage house went into liquidation two weeks later. The district court held that because the stock was never delivered to the liquidated brokerage firm, the claimants were not customers within the meaning of SIPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlG\">\u201cTo have a protected \u2018net equity\u2019 claim under the Act as a \u2018customer\u2019, the claimant must have <em>entrusted </em>his securities to the debtor in liquidation. Claimants\u2019 shares were never actually received by the debtor; the Debtor never came into their possession or control so as to become accountable under the Act to the claimants therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-11\"><em>Kenneth Bove, </em>378 F.Supp. at 699 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">In <em>Kenneth Bove, </em>the broker did not have even physical possession or access to the securities. The determination that he did not fall within the statute was properly predicated on the bright-line rule that in \u201cthe absence of actual receipt, acquisition or possession of the property of a claimant by the brokerage firm under liquidation\u201d, a claimant was not entitled to the protection of SIPA. In the instant case, the Debtor, through Stalvey or Crisler, had at least access to the bonds for the purposes of clipping coupons and physical possession of the bonds, for they were able to remove the bonds from the Bank\u2019s safekeeping department, subject to the condition that they be replaced by bonds of equivalent value. Wise\u2019s appeal therefore falls on the other side of this bright-line rule, and we cannot reject his claim solely on the basis of <em>Kenneth Bove.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">\n<em>2. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Reversal of the Trustee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">The bankruptcy court rejected the trustee\u2019s analysis. The court held instead that Stalvey \u201cheld the securities for safekeeping\u201d for Wise, thus bringing his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>within section <em>78lll </em>(2). The court seems to have relied upon the designation on Wise\u2019s receipt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">\u201cWhile the Bank had actual possession of the securities, the securities were held in a safekeeping account styled \u2018Stalvey &amp; Associates, Inc. for Erbon W. Wise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnZ\">Both parties conceded on appeal that the bank\u2019s styling of the bonds in Stalvey\u2019s name is inexplicable \u2014 given the circumstances in which the account was opened. It is probably attributable to clerical error. In any case, the designation constitutes a tenuous ground for holding that Stalvey \u201cheld\u201d the securities for Wise, and, further, that Wise was a customer of Stalvey for the purposes of the missing bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The bankruptcy judge also relied on the longstanding broker-customer relation between Stalvey and Wise, the broker\u2019s access to the bonds both for clipping coupons and for sale, and the Bank\u2019s \u201cnegligence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cIn addition, Stalvey held the securities with a view to sale. He was authorized to act upon Wise\u2019s instructions and had an obligation to make prudent investments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u201cClearly Stalvey had access to the bonds through presentation of the proper safekeeping receipt. Wise had no way of preventing Stalvey from removing the bonds from his account without a receipt and should not be made to suffer as a result of negligence on the part of the Bank. The Trustee has admitted that it was the duty of the Bank to insure that the bonds were not removed from its safekeeping without the proper receipt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u201cThe negligence of the Bank should not work to defeat the clear intentions of the parties that Stalvey be allowed access to the bonds for the purpose of acting as brokering agent for Wise. Customer must not be restricted to exclude investors who have suffered a substantial loss as a result of their broker\u2019s activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\n<em>3. Our Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">To determine the reach of the SIPA\u2019s protection, we must first examine the statute. \u201cIt is a universally recognized rule of statutory construction that a court should look first to the language of the statute to determine the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>SEC v. Ambassador Church, </em>6 Cir.1982, 679 F.2d 608, 611. The SIPA itself mentions \u201ccustomer\u201d in several places, but the parties agree that the only applicable provision is 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>78lll(2) </em>(1982). The provision states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">\u201c(2) Customer. \u2014 The term \u2018customer\u2019 of a debtor means any person (including any person with whom the debtor deals as principal or agent) who has a claim on account of securities received, acquired, or held by the debtor in the ordinary course of its business as a broker or dealer from or for the securities accounts of such person for safekeeping, with a view to sale, to cover consummated sales, pursuant to purchases, as collateral security, or for purposes of effecting transfer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">A claimant therefore qualifies as a customer of a broker if the broker \u201creceived, acquired, or held\u201d the claimant\u2019s securities \u201cin the ordinary course of business,\u201d either with a \u201cview to sale\u201d or for \u201csafe-keeping\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">Wise has argued once a customer, always a customer. He asserts that Stalvey\u2019s clipping coupons from the collateral bonds, and Stalvey\u2019s occasional replacement of those bonds with others of like value constituted an ordinary course of business. SIPA does not contest this characterization, and we agree that the clipping and cashing of coupons and the replacement of bonds represented an ordinary course of business. Wise also introduced into evidence records from the Debtor showing the long-standing dealings between Wise and the Debtor. But Wise then claims \u201c[although Wise by no means consented to Stalvey\u2019s removal and conversion of the securities, their theft does not diminish the fact that Stalvey\u2019s access to the bonds was in the ordinary course of business\u201d. Appellee\u2019s brief at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">It is true that Wise and the Debtor had a broker-customer relationship that often brought Wise within the ambit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>SIPA. Wise\u2019s original complaint against the trustee contained prayers for relief to which Wise was clearly entitled as a \u201ccustomer\u201d under section <em>78lll(2). </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>78lll(2) </em>(1982). Moreover, if Wise had instructed the Debtor to remove the pledged bonds from safekeeping for sale, Wise would have a claim under the SIPA for the value of those bonds if the Debtor had taken the bonds but then failed to execute the order or to remit the proceeds before going into receivership. Similarly, if the Debtor cashed coupons clipped from the bonds that Wise had pledged for safekeeping, but had failed to remit the money, Wise would have a cognizable claim under the SIPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The statute, however, designed relief predicated upon the specific securities or transactions for which a claim is made. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 78fff(c). Wise\u2019s customer status in the course of some dealings with a broker will not confer that status upon other dealings, no matter how intimately related, unless those other dealings also fall within the ambit of the statute. \u201cThe Act contemplates that a person may be a \u2018customer\u2019 with respect to some of his claims for cash or shares, but not with respect to others.\u201d <em>S.E.C. v. F.O. Baroff Co., 2 </em>Cir.1974, 497 F.2d 280, 282 n.2. Customer status \u201cin the air\u201d is insufficient to confer the SIPA\u2019s protection on a given transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The statute\u2019s first requirement is that the broker must have \u201creceived, acquired, or held\u201d the securities. The Debt- or, however, \u201creceived, acquired, or held\u201d nothing. Although the parties stipulated that the Debtor or one of the employees of the Debtor took the bonds, we cannot say that the Debtor possessed the securities within the meaning of the statute. The securities were pledged as collateral. Neither Wise nor Stalvey could legally sell this collateral, even with safekeeping receipts, unless Wise provided substitute collateral. Until that time, the bonds were encumbered by Wise\u2019s pledge to the bank and were neither \u201cheld\u201d nor \u201cpossessed\u201d by Wise or Stalvey. <em>Cf. S.E.C. v. F.O. Baroff Co., 2 </em>Cir.1974, 497 F.2d 280, 284, holding that securities pledged as collateral are not within protection of the SIPA because of the \u201cformidable barrier in the way of any ... sale or disposition\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Section <em>78lll (2) </em>further requires that for Wise to be a customer, Stalvey must hold the lost securities \u201cwith a view to sale\u201d, in safekeeping, or as collateral. Wise fails to meet these criteria. Wise argued both in bankruptcy court and on appeal that Stalvey held the securities \u201cwith a view to sale\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">\u201cThe fact that Stalvey corresponded and communicated with Wise concerning potential sales including the bonds in The Mississippi Bank and that on at least four different occasions sales were consummated further evidences Stalvey &amp; Associates\u2019 \u2018view to sale,\u2019 and his holding securities \u2018pursuant to purchases\u2019 and \u2018for the purposes of effecting transfer.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOB\">Appellee\u2019s brief at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Assuming for argument that the Debtor \u201cheld\u201d the bonds, it cannot fairly be said that the securities were held with \u201ca view to sale\u201d. The missing bonds were intended as security for a letter of credit that the Bank had extended to Wise. It is probative, but not dispositive, that Wise replaced and sold the pledged bonds on four earlier occasions. But at the moment Wise encumbered certain bonds as collateral for the letter of credit, their primary purpose became security for the Bank. From that moment on, the securities were not held with a view to sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">Nor did the Debtor hold the securities \u201cin safekeeping\u201d or \u201cas collateral\u201d. The bankruptcy judge concluded that the securities were held in \u201csafekeeping\u201d for Wise by Stalvey, apparently relying on the Bank\u2019s designation: \u201cSince the safekeeping account was in Stalvey\u2019s name, Stalvey actually held the securities for safekeeping and [Wise] is therefore a customer under the Act.\u201d The Bank\u2019s designation of the account as \u201csafekeeping\u201d, however, has no importance to the statutory criteria under section <em>78lll </em>(2). \u201cSafekeeping\u201d is a term of art having distinct meanings in both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>investment and banking. In brokerage houses, \u201csafekeeping\u201d securities are those that are fully paid for and held in custody by the broker. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. 1613, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1970), <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5254, 5256. \u201cSafekeeping\u201d as designated on the bank\u2019s receipts refers to securities pledged by an individual as collateral for loan with a bank. The designation of securities \u201cfor safekeeping\u201d by the Bank therefore has no bearing on Wise\u2019s status as a \u201ccustomer\u201d under the SIPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Similarly, Wise cannot rely on the use of the securities as \u201ccollateral\u201d to bring him within the SIPA. The securities were collateral for a customer\u2019s letter of credit at a commercial bank. No party has contended that this letter of credit was related to securities trading. The SIPA\u2019s use of \u201ccollateral\u201d was not intended to encompass such transactions. \u201cCollateral\u201d, as used in the statute, referred to securities left with the broker to cover the purchaser\u2019s margin purchases. <em>See id.; see also SEC v. F.O. Baroff, </em>2 Cir.1974, 497 F.2d 280, 284 (use of securities as \u201ccollateral for margin purchases ... of other securities\u201d would have brought lost stocks within coverage of SIPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Judicial interpretations of \u201ccustomer\u201d status support a narrow interpretation of the SIPA\u2019s provisions. On at least two occasions, the Second Circuit declined to extend the Act\u2019s protection to parties that fell within the literal definition of customer. In <em>F.O. Baroff Co., </em>the court faced the issue of \u201cwhether a voluntary lender of securities to a failing brokerage house, who made his loan to help out the company and not for a purpose related to securities trading or investments, qualifies under the Act\u2019s scheme\u201d. 497 F.2d at 281. The court found that although the literal language of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78fff(c)(2)(A)(ii) seemed broad enough to cover the claimant, the Act\u2019s legislative history showed that Congress intended that SIPA was to protect only \u201ctrading customers\u201d and \u201cpublic customers\u201d of brokers. <em>Id. </em>at 282. A person who becomes a creditor of a broker in some manner that does not involve participation in the securities market is not covered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">In <em>SIPC v. Morgan, Kenney &amp; Co., </em>2 Cir.1976, 533 F.2d 1314, <em>cert. denied, </em>1976, 426 U.S. 936, 96 S.Ct. 2650, 49 L.Ed.2d 387, the Court held that the individual beneficiaries of a profit-sharing plan did not qualify as customers of a failed brokerage house that owed the plan money.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Third Circuit has refused to extend the SIPA\u2019s coverage to an assignee of a \u201ccustomer\u2019s\u201d cause of action. <em>S.E.C. v. Albert &amp; Maguire Securities Co., </em>3 Cir.1977, 560 F.2d 569, 571-72. <em>But cf. S.E.C. v. Ambassador Church, </em>6 Cir.1982, 679 F.2d 608, holding that a church issuing mortgage bonds was a \u201ccustomer\u201d of a broker-dealer that sold bonds without commission even though the dealer performed other services for the church resembling those of an underwriter.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">The legislative history of SIPA bolsters our holding. SIPA was intended to protect customers who had entered the securities market but then suffered losses as a result of a broker\u2019s failure. The claimant here, Wise, had removed the last securities from the market to pledge them as collateral for his letter of credit. The statutory scheme envisioned by the drafters of the statute was to protect persons buying and selling securities through a stockbroker, not to compensate a person who turned over his securities to a bank as collateral for a loan by that bank. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1613, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 1-3 (1970), <em>re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>printed in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5254, 5254-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Moreover, there is evidence in the legislative history that Congress believed that the SIPA was only an \u201cinterim step\u201d that would not provide complete protection for losses occasioned by the failure of broker-dealer firms. <em>Id. </em>at 12, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5266. Courts have acknowledged the limited coverage of the SIPA regardless of the equities in favor of the claimant. In <em>SIPC v. Executive Securities Corp., </em>2 Cir.1977, 556 F.2d 98, the court held that a loan agreement between an investor and his broker was not covered under SIPA. <em>S.E.C. v. F.O. Baroff Co., </em>2 Cir.1974, 497 F.2d 280 (investor/creditor denied SIPA protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The legislative history also shows that Congress recognized the limited coverage of the specific language used in section 78<em>lll (2). </em>The House Report commented on analogous language in Section 8(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">\u201c[The provision applies] only \u2018in the course of business as a broker,\u2019 thus apparently excluding indebtedness not incurred in the \u2018ordinary course of business\u2019 and indebtedness incurred in the course of business as a dealer. Indebtedness in these categories presents a hazard to customers equal to that presented by indebtedness incurred \u2018in the ordinary course of business as a broker.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 13, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5267. Congress then enacted such a provision in section <em>78lll </em>(2). Congress intended section <em>78lll </em>(2) to have only limited coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Wise is not a customer of Stalvey as far as the missing bonds are concerned. Stalvey did not hold the securities in the ordinary course of business. Moreover, even if Stalvey, in some tenuous sense, \u201chad\u201d the bonds, Stalvey did not have them with a \u201cview to sale\u201d or for safekeeping. The judgment of the bankruptcy court is therefore REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\">. Initially the arrangement consisted of a one-sentence letter signed by Wise stating: \u201cI hereby authorize Stalvey &amp; Associates to clip and deposit above coupons to account number 60-2572-0.\u201d After about three months, the Bank entered into a more formal agreement with Wise, where Wise appointed \"Stalvey &amp; Associates, Inc. to collect all income due on said securities\" deposited with the Bank. That agreement specifically named Sam Stalvey and an employee, Marcia Crisler, as the authorized representatives of Stalvey &amp; Associates who \"shall have authority to perform any and all actions necessary to collect income, including having access to securities deposited with The Mississippi Bank\u201d. Wise further agreed to \u201chold harmless and indemnify\u201d the bank from \"liability losses or damages\u201d from \"missing coupons\u201d and \"from the loss of any securities\u201d placed \"into the control of Stalvey &amp; Associates, Inc. for the purposes set forth in this Agreement\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-13\">. Count I of Wise\u2019s complaint was for bonds that Wise had purchased but that the Debtor failed to deliver. Count II was for the bonds that had been in safekeeping at the Bank. Count III was for bonds that Wise had purchased from the Debtor without the knowledge that the bonds\u2019 issuers had defaulted or were bankrupt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">. Congress has demonstrated its interest in the definition by amending its scope in the Securities Investor Protection Act Amendments of 1978. <em>See </em>Securities Investor Protection Act Amendments of 1978, Pub.L. 95-283 \u00a7 16, 92 Stat. 249, 271; Sen.Rep. No. 763, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 764, 779. Moreover, the definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d is part of a comprehensive scheme regulating relations between debtors and creditors. The SIPA\u2019s provision defining \u201ccustomer\u201d was amended to conform with changes made in Chapter 11 by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. <em>See </em>Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. 95-598 \u00a7 308(o), 92 Stat. 2549, 2676.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\">. The court reached the same conclusion in <em>SIPC v. Executive Securities Corp., </em>2 Cir.1977, 556 F.2d 98, which involved a loan of securities to a brokerage house in return for cash collateral equal to the market value of the loaned shares.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\">.
