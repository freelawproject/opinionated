MOEGAN, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1571-5\">As disabled retirees of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 613 (IBEW), the plaintiffs receive benefits from the IBEW Local 613 and Contributing Employers Health and Welfare Fund (the H &amp; W Fund). Certain of the defendant trustees of the H &amp; W Fund, contemporaneously with their tenure as trustees of that Fund, have also served as trustees of the IBEW Local 613 and Contributing Employers Pension Fund (the Pension Fund) and as officers of the union or the National Electrical Contractors\u2019 Association (NECA), an employer, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1002(5) (West 1975). In 1975 the trustees of the H &amp; W Fund required all disabled retirees, early retirees and unemployed active members of the union to make monthly self-payment contributions to the H &amp; W Fund. The amount of the required contributions has steadily increased. The plaintiffs allege that the impetus for the imposition of these fees was the agreement of the collective bargaining representatives to decrease the employers\u2019 required contributions to the H &amp; W Fund by one percent and to increase by one percent the employers\u2019 payments to the Pension Fund. As officers of the union or the NECA, certain of the trustees were involved in the negotiation of the pertinent collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-6\">The plaintiffs alleged in the district court various breaches of fiduciary duty by the trustees. The court granted the trustees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs argue on appeal that the trustees violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1381 (West 1975 &amp; Supp.Pamph. 1976-84), by serving in conflicting official capacities and by acting adversely to the interests of the H &amp; W Fund in the collective bargaining process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trustees cross-appeal the district court\u2019s refusal to entertain their request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-12\">ERISA imposes upon fiduciaries of employee benefit plans the duties of loyalty and prudence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1104(a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It elaborates upon these duties by specifying that a fiduciary shall not \u201cin his individual or in any other capacity act in any transaction involving the plan on behalf of a party (or represent a party) whose interests are adverse to the interests of the plan or the interests of its beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1106(b)(2). A fiduciary may, however, also serve as an officer, employee, agent, or other representative of a union or an employer. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1108(c)(3); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1002(4), (5), (14). Logic demands that if a fiduciary may hold such positions, then he may fulfill the concomitant responsibilities. <em>See Curren v. Freitag, </em>432 F.Supp. 668, 672 (S.D.Ill.1977). Thus, a trustee of an employee benefit plan does not violate ERISA merely by also serving in a position with an employee organization or employer that requires him to represent such entity in the collective bargaining negotiations that determine the funding of the plan. <em>See id. </em>at 671. In those negotiations, the bargaining representative represents either the employer or the employees. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158(b)(1)(B), 186(c)(5)(B). To require him to consider only the best interests of the plan at the negotiation ta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>ble would be to require him to breach the trust of his constituents. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-4\">Likewise, nothing in ERISA prohibits a fiduciary from serving as a trustee of two employee benefit plans so long as nothing in the arrangement causes him to violate the general fiduciary duties codified in ERISA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1104(a)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs failed to produce any evidence of such a violation. The district court therefore properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-5\">The district court entered judgment against the plaintiffs, dismissed the case on the merits and awarded costs to the trustees. The trustees filed a motion to alter and amend judgment, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), and requested that the court retain jurisdiction to permit them to file a motion for award of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court denied the motion, noting only that the issue of an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the defendants was close.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-6\">A district court may in his discretion award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of the action to either party in an ERISA action. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). The standard for review of such a decision is abuse of discretion. <em>Iron Workers Local No. 272 v. Bowen, </em>624 F.2d 1255, 1266 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc) (decisions of the former Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981, are binding precedent in the eleventh circuit). This review requires that the district court state the reasons for his disposition of a request for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Gordon v. United States Steel Corp., </em>724 F.2d 106, 108 (10th Cir. 1983); <em>Iron Workers, </em>624 F.2d at 1266. His analysis must include the criteria enunciated in <em>Iron Workers, </em>624 F.2d at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-9\">The district court\u2019s denial of the trustees\u2019 rule 59(e) motion was in effect a refusal to make the findings required by <em>Iron Workers. </em>This denial was an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See Thomas v. Farmville Manufacturing Co., </em>705 F.2d 1307, 1307 (11th Cir.1983) (standard of review for a denial of a rule 59(e) motion is abuse of discretion). We therefore reverse the denial of the trustees\u2019 rule 59(e) motion and remand the claim for attorney\u2019s fees to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1571-7\">. The trustees argue that these contentions are not properly before this court because the plaintiffs did not present such arguments to the district court. The plaintiffs did not raise these issues in their complaint. They did, however, cite them in opposition to the trustees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and the district court did rule on them. \"In federal practice any question which has been presented to the trial court for a ruling and not thereafter waived or withdrawn is preserved for review.\u201d <em>United States v. Harue Hayashi, </em>282 F.2d 599, 601 (9th Cir.1960); <em>see Bentley v. Palmer House Co., </em>332 F.2d 107, 109 (7th Cir.1964) (although appellants did not raise issue before the district court, holding of district court placed issue before appellate court.) We may therefore review the plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1571-14\">. A trustee of an employee benefit plan, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1002(3), is a fiduciary for purposes of ERISA. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2509.75-8 (question D-3) (1984); <em>see 29 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1002(21)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1572-7\">. The plaintiffs contend that because the H &amp; W Fund and the Pension Fund \"compete\" for employers\u2019 contributions, their interests are adverse so that serving as a trustee of both constitutes a <em>per se </em>violation of ERISA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1106(b)(2). The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that section 1106 requires a transaction between the plan and a party having an adverse interest. <em>Donovan v. Bierwirth, </em>680 F.2d 263, 270 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1069, 103 S.Ct. 488, 74 L.Ed.2d 631 (1982). We do not embrace this conclusion totally since section 1106 expressly forbids a fiduciary to <em>represent </em>an adverse party. We do agree with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, however, that Congress did not intend an expansive interpretation of section 1106 such as that proffered by the plaintiffs, \"particularly in light of the inclusion of the sweeping requirements of prudence and loyalty contained in \u00a7 404 [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1104].\u2019\u2019 680 F.2d at 270; <em>cf. Cutaiar v. Marshall, </em>590 F.2d 523, 531 (3d Cir.1979) (section 1106(b)(2) creates \"per se prohibition of a transfer between two funds where the trustees are identical but the participants and beneficiaries are not\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1572-13\">. Under the circumstances of this case, a rule 59(e) motion was the proper means of seeking an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Stacy v. Williams, </em>446 F.2d 1366, 1367 (5th Cir.1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
