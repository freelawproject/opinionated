Because the trial judge, in applying <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(b)(6), concluded the statements were untrustworthy \u2014 without having listened to the witnesses testify at a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing \u2014 we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The circumstances surrounding this evidence question are relatively simple. On November 2, 2007, defendant Hans J. Schmidt, M.D., performed laparoscopic gastric banding surgery on Patricia, who, within a few days of surgery, telephoned and visited defendant Schmidt\u2019s office to complain of chest pains. On November 9, 2007, Patricia suffered a pulmonary embolism; she remained on life support until her death ten days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Plaintiffs filed a complaint asserting that defendants\u2019 negligence caused Patricia\u2019s death. Following discovery, a jury was sworn on December 3, 2013, and opening arguments were scheduled to begin the next day. Before the trial proceeded beyond jury selection, however, the judge entertained plaintiffs\u2019 motion to admit testimony from Patricia\u2019s husband, three children, other relatives and a friend pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(b)(6), which permits, in civil cases, admission of \u201ca statement made by a person unavailable as a witness because of death if the statement was made in good faith upon declarant\u2019s personal knowledge in circumstances indicating that it is trustworthy.\u201d Plaintiffs assert that Patricia told these potential witnesses, immediately after either a telephone call or visit to defendants\u2019 office, that in the days after surgery she was experiencing chest pain, that she told Schmidt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>staff she was experiencing chest pain, and that she was told by Schmidt\u2019s staff that her pain was a normal complication of surgery caused by gas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">After hearing argument, but without reading the deposition testimony of the witnesses, the judge denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for a <em>Rule </em>104 hearing and for the most part<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to admit the proposed hearsay testimony. The judge labeled the testimony about what Patricia was told by Schmidt\u2019s staff as \u201cclassic double hearsay\u201d that should be excluded because defendants would not be able to challenge the statements through cross-examination and because there was \u201cno mechanism to ensure [ ] trustworthiness.\u201d The judge concluded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7a\">my ruling in this case is certainly, for example, Mr. Grieco can say that he observed [Patricia] having chest pain or that she told him that she had chest pain. But any communication in terms of what ... [Patricia] said that she told to someone else and what that someone else then responded to her, that information is double hearsay and cannot be ... testimony in this trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The judge further explained that \u201c[t]he part [of the testimony that] could not overcome the hearsay exception was the part of the conversation between [Patricia] and whoever it is she\u2019s having the communication with at the office of Dr. Schmidt.\u201d In response, plaintiffs argued those statements \u2014 made by an unidentified individual over the telephone and Kathleen Connor, a bariatric nurse, during an office visit \u2014 were admissible pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, plaintiffs maintained all Patricia\u2019s statements were trustworthy because they were made within a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>short time after her communications with Schmidt\u2019s staff. The judge concluded that a lack of \u201ccorroborating evidence pertaining to the truthfulness\u201d precluded admissibility of those statements allegedly made by Schmidt\u2019s staff. The judge therefore barred testimony that Patricia \u201ctold [potential witnesses] that the office staff told her to take Gas-X.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">On December 20, 2013, an order was entered barring plaintiffs from introducing evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">concerning any statements that [Patricia] may have made to third parties as to what was told to her by the \u201cunknown employee\u201d of L J defendant during the phone calls of [November 6] and as to what was told to her by [ ] defendant\u2019s bariatric nurse ... during her office visit on LNovember 8].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">On January 6, 2014, the judge granted plaintiffs\u2019 request to voluntarily dismiss the case without prejudice \u2014 and certified that order as final, citing <em>Rule </em>4:42-2 \u2014 while also, among other things, setting the stage for a resumption of the proceedings in the trial court should we determine the evidence ruling was incorrect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Plaintiffs then filed this appeal, seeking our review of the December 20 order. Plaintiffs argue that the hearsay statements as to what Patricia told the proposed witnesses she was told by defendant\u2019s staff were admissible or, if there were doubts about the trustworthiness of such statements, that the judge should at least have conducted a <em>Rule </em>104 hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>It is helpful to start with the fundamental concept that hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>801(c). Unless falling within one of the many stated exceptions, hearsay is inadmissible. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>802; <em>State v. Long, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>138, 152, 801 A.2d 221 (2002). The prohibition on hearsay is intended to \u201censure the accuracy of the factfinding process by excluding untrustworthy statements, such as those made without the solemnity of the oath, and not subject to cross-examination ... or the jury\u2019s critical observation of the declarant\u2019s demeanor and tone.\u201d <em>State v. Engel, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>453, 465, 493 A.2d 1217 (1985); <em>see also Neno v. Clinton, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>573, 579, 772 A.2d 899 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Plaintiffs argue that one such hearsay exception is applicable here, namely, the exception contained in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(b)(6), which we quoted above. To qualify for this exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">(1) the declarant must be dead; (2) the statement must have been made in good faith; (3) the statement must have been made upon the declarant\u2019s own personal knowledge; and (4) there must be a probability from the circumstances that the statement is trustworthy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\"><em>[DeVito v. Sheeran, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>167, 194, 755 A.2d 1147 (2000).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In considering the application of this rule, the judge \u201cmust make particularized findings of good faith, personal knowledge, and trustworthiness[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Jeter v. Stevenson, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>229, 233-34, 664 A.2d 952 (App.Div.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Here, in the absence of further examination of the evidence in question by way of a <em>Rule </em>104 hearing, we must conclude that, on the face of the proposed testimony, all four criteria favored admission. Patricia is deceased. Her statements were ostensibly made in good faith.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statements she conveyed to others were apparently within her personal knowledge. And the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>stances suggest the trustworthiness of the evidence; that is, there is no apparent reason for Patricia to have misrepresented to her husband or to other family members or friends how she felt, the pains she claimed to have experienced, what she said to her doctor or his staff, and what she was told in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">As Judge Keefe explained in <em>Beckwith v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>50, 63, 447 A.2d 207 (Law Div.1982), in applying the predecessor to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(b)(6), \u201can absolute standard of trustworthiness is not essential before evidence is admissible.\u201d It is only necessary that the trial judge find, in engaging in a subjective analysis, \u201ca probability that the statement is trustworthy from the flavor of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court later adopted this standard in <em>DeVito, supra, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>at 195, 755 A.2d 1147. In engaging in this analysis, the trial judge may consider: \u201cwhether the statement was made under oath; the duration of the time between the event and the statement; whether the declarant had firsthand knowledge; and the credibility of the declarant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195-96, 755 A.2d 1147 (citing 2 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 324 (5th ed. 1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">It suffices to say the judge erred by declining to listen to the witnesses before concluding their testimony was untrustworthy or that the circumstances suggested that Patricia\u2019s statements were untrustworthy. Even examining the proposed testimony in light of the parties\u2019 arguments, it is clear the judge did not consider \u201cthe time between the event and the statement,\u201d which plaintiffs argue was \u201cvirtually contemporaneous,\u201d nor any evidence that might illuminate or serve to discredit Patricia\u2019s credibility, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>factors that warranted attention. <em>DeVito, supra, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>at 195-96, 755 A.2d 1147.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Indeed, the judge\u2019s reasoning boils down to her imposition of a requirement not present in the applicable rule. That is, the judge determined that \u201cwhat\u2019s untrustworthy and what makes [the testimony] not fall within a hearsay exception is there is no corroborating evidence on any level to establish what [Patricia] said in the phone call to the individual in the office and what that individual said to her.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(b)(6) does not include a corroboration requirement. Although \u201clack of corroboration may affect the weight to be given\u201d to testimony by the fact-finder, it does not bar its admission. <em>Spencer v. Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co., </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>455, 466, 720 A.2d 601 (1998). Here, Patricia uttered consistent statements nearly contemporaneously or within hours of her communication with the doctor\u2019s staff. On their face and in light of the circumstances, these statements appear trustworthy. They could not be excluded absent a \u201cparticularized finding\u201d that they lacked trustworthiness, which could not be reached without a <em>Rule </em>104 hearing. <em>DeVito, supra, 165 N.J. </em>at 194, 755 A.2d 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We lastly note the so-called \u201chearsay within hearsay\u201d problem cited by the judge does not bar the admission of state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>merits attributed by Patricia to defendant\u2019s staff. In fact, the circumstance would have been better described as \u201cadmissible hearsay within hearsay.\u201d If she was living at the time of trial, Patricia would have been permitted to recount the statements of defendant\u2019s staff pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(4), because those statements were attributed to \u201c[defendant\u2019s] agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship\u201d and were \u201coffered against\u201d that party. <em>See Spencer, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 462, 720 A.2d 601; <em>In re Opinion 668 of the Advisory Comm. on Prof'l Ethics, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>294, 300, 633 A.2d 959 (1993). Because Patricia did not live to recount these conversations in court, the judge was simply required to consider the admissibility of this admissible hearsay through application of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(b)(6). <em>See Estate of Hanges v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>369, 375 n. 1, 997 A.2d 954 (2002) (observing that admissibility of hearsay within hearsay requires that each level of hearsay have \u201ca separate basis for admission into evidence\u201d); <em>see also N.J.R.E. </em>805.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In reversing, we are mindful that ordinarily a judge\u2019s decision to conduct a <em>Rule </em>104 hearing is discretionary. <em>Kemp v. State, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>412, 432, 809 A.2d 77 (2002). But the judge could not exclude the testimony in question without conducting a hearing to examine the trustworthiness of the hearsay statements. Accordingly, to the extent the decision to conduct a <em>Rule </em>104 hearing in this instance was discretionary, the judge\u2019s refusal to require the hearing constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The order under review is reversed. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-6\"> The proposed testimony would have included Patricia\u2019s statement that she was told by defendant's staff that she should purchase Gas-X for her chest pains. Plaintiffs planned to corroborate this testimony with evidence that one witness saw \"Gas-X\u201d listed at the top of Patricia's shopping list.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\"> The judge did not bar witnesses from recounting Patricia's complaints of chest pains.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\"><em> N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(4) permits admission of otherwise inadmissible hearsay where the evidence is offered against a party and is \"a statement by the party\u2019s agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\"> For example, in the event we were to reverse, the dismissal order memorialized defendants\u2019 waiver of a statute-ol-limitations defense, plaintiffs' waiver of pre-judgment interest accruing during the intervening time period, and both parties' waiver of the right to conduct further discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b591-11\"> We briefly pause to express our chagrin about the manner in which \"finality\u201d was achieved in the trial court. Nevertheless, because we think it highly likely we would have granted leave to appeal after entry of the December 20 order\u2014 had leave been sought \u2014 we proceed to consider the merits of the appeal. We cannot stress, however, the importance of the parties actually applying to this court for leave to appeal instead of concocting ways in the trial court to give an interlocutory order the appearance of finality. <em>See Grow Co. v. Chokshi, </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>443, 457-60, 959 A.2d 252 (App.Div.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b592-9\"> Along these same lines, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(3) permits admission of \"[a] statement made in good faith of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation or physical condition (such as ... mental feeling, pain, or bodily health)____\u201d These types of statements are considered to have been made in good faith \u201cwhen made in a natural manner and under circumstances dispelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>suspicion and involving no suggestion of sinister or improper motives....\" <em>State v. Thornton, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>380, 390, 185 A.2d 9 (1962). In a dental malpractice case, we found that testimony from a plaintiff's mother and a friend that the plaintiff had complained of pain after a dental procedure should have been admissible pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(3) because the plaintiff spoke to those witnesses the day of and the day after undergoing the procedure and the statements were made \"under circumstances that do not suggest anything other than good faith,\u201d notably the plaintiff \"spoke to people one would naturally voice concerns to.\u201d <em>Roper v. Blumenfeld, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 235-37, 706 A.2d 1151 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> The judge did consider that one witness proposed to testify that Patricia referred to Connor as a nutritionist instead of what she was, a bariatric nurse, as suggesting unreliability. Although this discrepancy may be worthy of consideration when determining the trustworthiness of the proposed testimony, it was not sufficiently conclusive to negate the need for a <em>Rule </em>104 hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\"> This reasoning was based in part on the judge\u2019s examination of the notation \u201d[n]o current complaints\u201d inserted in Patricia\u2019s medical chart regarding her November 8 office visit It is not clear to us why the judge would exalt a note defendants unilaterally placed in their file over what the patient recounted to her husband or others about how she felt and what she was told after she called the doctor\u2019s office to complain of chest pains. In other words, defendant's staff memorialized what transpired with Patricia by making a note in her file; Patricia memorialized what transpired with defendant\u2019s staff by repeating the advice given to family and friends. It is not clear why the former should be viewed as evidence superior to the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
