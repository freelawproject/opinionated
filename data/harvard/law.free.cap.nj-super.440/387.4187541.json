Taylor entered a conditional guilty plea to refusal to submit to a breath test in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2, reserving the right \u201cto appeal [] any and all issues, including sentencing.\u201d Defendant was sentenced by the municipal judge as a \u201cthird offender,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a, to a $1006 fine, $33 in court costs, a $100 surcharge, forty-eight hours of attendance at the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center (IDRC), a ten-year suspension of driving privileges, and installation of an interlock device for a period of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">There is no dispute that defendant had two prior convictions for driving while under the influence (DWI), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50, in 1985 and 1996, but no prior convictions for refusal. In his appeal to the Law Division, defendant argued, among other things, that his prior convictions for DWI did not qualify as prior offenses within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a. Defendant contended that <em>State v. Ciancaglini, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>597, 10 A.3d 870 (2011), controlled and mandated that he be sentenced as a first offender for refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The Court in <em>Ciancaglini </em>considered whether a defendant previously convicted of refusal under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.4a, should be sentenced as a first or second offender on a subsequent DWI conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50, which provides for enhanced penalties for repeat offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 600,10 A.3d 870. The Court held that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50 precludes use of a prior refusal conviction to enhance the sentence on a subsequent DWI, and thus Ciancaglini had to be sentenced as a first offender. <em>Id. </em>at 610-11, 10 A.3d 870. In its ruling, however, the Court left undisturbed the holding of <em>In re Bergwall, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>382, 427 A.2d 65 (1981), <em>rev\u2019g on dissent, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>431, 436-40, 414 A.2d 584 (App. Div.1980) (Lora, P.J.A.D., dissenting), that a prior DWI conviction is deemed a prior violation for purposes of enhancing the sentence on a subsequent refusal conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a. <em>Ciancaglini, supra, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>at 610 n. 10, 10 A.3d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Specifically, the Court in <em>Ciancaglini </em>reiterated Judge Lora\u2019s analysis that the phrase \u201cin connection with a subsequent offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>of this section\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4 included prior DWI offenses because \u201c \u2018a refusal cannot be \u201cin connection with\u201d another refusal. Rather, it can only be \u201cin connection with\u201d an arrest for drinking-driving and a request to take the breath test.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bergwall, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 437, 414 A.2d 584).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Here, the Law Division judge concluded, correctly, that defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Ciancaglini </em>was misplaced. The judge determined that he remained bound by <em>Bergwall, </em>and affirmed defendant\u2019s sentence. We note that since this ease was decided, our Supreme Court has reaffirmed the vitality of <em>Bergwall </em>that a prior DWI conviction will enhance the sentence on a subsequent refusal conviction. <em>State v. Frye, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>566, 568-69, 90 A.3d 1281 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">On appeal, defendant advances two new arguments not previously raised in the Law Division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">I. THE COURTS BELOW IMPROPERLY SENTENCED DEFENDANT AS A THIRD OFFENDER OF BREATH TEST REFUSAL BECAUSE HE HAD TWO PRIOR DWI CONVICTIONS FOR OFFENSES OCCURRING MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO, THEREBY ENTITLING HIM TO BE TREATED AS A SECOND OFFENDER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">II. THE UNEXPLAINED DELAY OF MORE THAN ONE YEAR BETWEEN ISSUANCE OF THE COMPLAINT AND CONVICTION WARRANTS DISMISSAL AS A VIOLATION OF DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">The penal consequences that flow from a DWI conviction escalate with each subsequent DWI conviction. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50. \u201cThus, the number of prior violations is significant in sentencing [a] defendant.\u201d <em>Ciancaglini, supra, 204 N.J. </em>at 607, 10 A.3d 870. As the Court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">The refusal statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a, is similarly structured with penalties based on whether the conviction is the driver\u2019s first, second, or third or subsequent offense. The statute provides that \u201cthe municipal court shall revoke the right to operate a motor vehicle of any operator who, after being arrested for a violation of [the DWI statute], shall refuse to submit to a [breath test] when requested to do so.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.4a(a). The length of the license suspension under a first, second, or third or subsequent offense mirrors the length of the suspension for a first (with a [blood alcohol] concentration of 0.10% or more), second, or third or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>subsequent violation of the DWI statute. The first offense will result in a suspension of seven months to one year; if \u201cthe refusal was in connection with a second offense under this section,\u201d it will result in a suspension of two years; and if \u201cthe refusal was in connection with a third or subsequent offense under this section,\u201d it will result in a suspension of ten years. <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">.... A first offender is subject to a $300 to $500 fine; a second offender is subject to a $500 to $1,000 fine; a third offender is subject to a $1,000 fine. <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, the penalties for each refusal offense now essentially mirror the penalties for each offense of DWI, but no custodial sentence is authorized as the result of a refusal conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">[<em>Ciuncaglini, supra, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>at 607-08, 10 A.3d 870 (first and second alterations in original) (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">However, unlike the refusal statute, the DWI statute contains a so-called \u201cstep-down\u201d provision, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agh\">if the second offense occurs more than 10 years after the first offense, the court shall treat the second conviction as a first offense for sentencing purposes and if a third offense occurs more than 10 years after the second offense, the court shall treat the third conviction as a second offense for sentencing purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>39:4 \u2014 50(a)(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Defendant now argues that we should engraft a similar \u201cstep-down\u201d provision into the refusal statute, and treat his refusal conviction as a second rather than a third conviction for sentencing purposes since it followed more than ten years after his second DWI conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Defendant\u2019s argument finds support in our prior holding in <em>State v. Fielding, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>191, 675 A.2d 653 (App.Div.1996). In <em>Fielding, </em>the defendant had two prior DWI convictions in 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 675 A.2d 653. The defendant was then convicted of refusal in 1994. <em>Id. </em>at 192, 675 A.2d 653. The sole issue on appeal was whether Fielding was properly sentenced as a second offender, requiring a two-year license revocation, or whether he should have been sentenced as a first offender under the refusal statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a, in which event \u201chis license would have been revoked for only six months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 675 A.2d 653. In upholding the two-year suspension for refusal, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgN\">Fielding had two prior DWI convictions in 1981. Thus, while he received the benefit of one step-down, avoiding a ten-year suspension, he properly was sentenced as a second offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 195, 675 A.2d 653.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Thus, at least by implication, defendant\u2019s penalty for his refusal conviction, which was enhanced due to his two prior DWI convictions, was likewise reduced by the step-down provision applicable to enhanced DWI penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We view the issue as one of fundamental fairness. As noted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a has been consistently interpreted as requiring that a prior DWI conviction be deemed a prior violation for purposes of the enhanced refusal penalty. <em>Frye, supra, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>at 569, 90 A.3d 1281; <em>Bergwall, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 383, 427 A.2d 65; <em>Fielding, supra, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 193, 675 A.2d 653. If the penalty attendant to a driver\u2019s refusal conviction is enhanced by a prior conviction under the DWI statute, fairness dictates that it be similarly reduced by the sentencing leniency accorded a driver under the \u201cstep-down\u201d provision of that statute where there is a hiatus of ten years or more between offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In the present case, had defendant consented to a breathalyzer test and been convicted of DWI, he would have been treated as a second rather than a third offender because his second DWI conviction occurred more than ten years ago in 1996. Consequently, his driving privileges would have been revoked for two, rather than ten, years. We see no reason why a comparable result should not be reached here, and a \u201cstep-down\u201d applied to the same DWI convictions that serve as the basis to enhance defendant\u2019s refusal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">As noted, defendant did not previously raise the argument that he is entitled to a \u201cstep-down\u201d sentence for the instant refusal conviction. Nonetheless, the Law Division judge appears to have determined that defendant was ineligible for a second \u201cstep-down\u201d because he was previously granted \u201cstep-down\u201d status due to the ten-year lapse of time between his first and second DWI convictions. The judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">[Defendant was not entitled to a step-down provision in this particular case and whether to consider this [ ] a third offense because he had previously been afforded a step-down' \u2014 and case law indicates that you\u2019re entitled to one step-down and one only \u2014 and on a third or more offense, the prior two offense[s] are counted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>separate offenses so he was not entitled to a step down. That argument, I note, has not been made and that\u2019s probably the reason. The law says it cannot be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">After the Law Division judge issued his decision, and while this appeal was pending, our Supreme Court clarified \u201cthat a repeat DWI offender may invoke the statutory \u2018step-down\u2019 provision <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:4 \u2014 50(a)(3) ] a second time, provided that more than ten years have passed with no infraction since the defendant\u2019s most recent DWI offense.\u201d <em>State v. Revie, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>126, 129, 104 A.3d 221 (2014). Therefore, as the State concedes, defendant\u2019s prior use of a \u201cstep-down\u201d would not bar a second application of the step-down provision. As applied to the present case, we conclude that defendant should have been sentenced as a second offender due to the ten-year lapse between his second DWI offense and the instant refusal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Next, we have considered defendant\u2019s speedy trial argument in light of the record and applicable legal principles and conclude it is without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). Directive # 1-84, on which defendant relies, established a sixty-day dispositional goal for DWI cases, not a bright-line try-or-dismiss rule. <em>State v. Cahill, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>253, 270, 61 A.3d 1278 (2013). After balancing the four factors in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>514, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), which govern the evaluation of speedy trial violations in DWI cases, <em>Cahill, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 271, 61 A.3d 1278, we conclude that the limited record provided fails to establish that defendant ever asserted his right to a speedy trial, that the State caused any undue pre-trial delay, or that defendant sustained any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded for sentencing as a second offender.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
