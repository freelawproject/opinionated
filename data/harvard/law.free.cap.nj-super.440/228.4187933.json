In this appeal, defendant argues only that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search of the motor vehicle he was operating. We conclude \u2014 on the pivotal question \u2014 that police lacked a reasonable and articulable basis for ordering defendant\u2019s passenger out of the vehicle and reverse the order denying suppression.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">At the suppression hearing, the State\u2019s only witness was Wood-bridge Detective Brian Jaremczak. He testified that, at approximately 4:30 p.m., on April 29, 2011, he and his partner, Detective Patrick Harris, observed defendant operating a Ford Bronco; S.R., the owner of the vehicle, was in the front passenger seat. The detective testified he was \u201cvery aware\u201d of S.R. and \u201chad just recently heard about\u201d defendant; he believed they were \u201cnarcotic users and narcotic dealers\u201d because the police department had received \u201cinformation from concerned citizens\u201d about \u201ca lot of traffic coming and going from [defendant\u2019s] apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The detectives, driving an unmarked vehicle, followed defendant\u2019s Ford Bronco out of Woodbridge and onto Routes 1 and 9, heading toward Newark; they eventually lost the Bronco on Frelinghuysen Avenue. Suspecting defendant and S.R. \u201cwere going to purchase narcotics\u201d and \u201cwould be back very shortly,\u201d the detectives drove to Woodbridge and awaited the Bronco\u2019s return.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">At approximately 5:30 p.m., while waiting on the border of Woodbridge and Rahway, Detective Jaremczak observed the Bronco traveling south on Routes 1 and 9. When asked what happened next, the detective testified that \u201cwe\u201d observed S.R. \u201cwasn\u2019t wearing his seatbelt.\u201d They activated their vehicle\u2019s emergency lights and directed the Bronco to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Detective Jaremczak approached the passenger side, and his partner approached the driver\u2019s side. When asked whether he \u201cnotice[d] any movement by either\u201d occupant, Detective Jaremc-zak responded that \u201c[his] partner did,\u201d and that his partner \u201csaw [defendant] reaching forward ... like, reaching under his seat.\u201d Defense counsel immediately objected because the witness lacked personal knowledge. The judge made no ruling but only asked the witness whether he observed defendant\u2019s movement, and Detective Jaremczak responded \u201cno.\u201d In answer to the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tor\u2019s next question, the detective explained he was \u201cfocused on\u201d S.R., confirming he did not see defendant\u2019s alleged furtive movement. The detective testified his partner asked defendant to exit the vehicle, and he directed S.R. out of the vehicle. Both occupants complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The detectives separately questioned the occupants, who gave different responses to where they were coming from, which, according to the witness, \u201cfurther heightened] [their] suspicion as to what occurred.\u201d During his questioning of S.R., Detective Jaremczak noticed \u201ca rolled up piece of paper[,] which was in the shape of a straw[,] [a]nd a piece of Chore Boy Brillo\u201d \u201cnear the front of the middle console.\u201d He testified that, in his experience, \u201c[t]he straw can be used to snort narcotics,\u201d and the other item \u201cis used, pretty much, as a filter in a crack pipe.\u201d As a result of these observations, Detective Jaremczak requested and obtained S.R.\u2019s consent to search the vehicle. The detective read him the consent form; to him, S.R. did not \u201cappear to be under the influence of any narcotics or drugs\u201d and appeared to understand the consent form that he signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In the search of the vehicle that followed, the officers seized the straw and scrubber observed in \u201cplain view,\u201d as well as \u201cblunt wrappers,\u201d \u201ca used crack pipe inside of a Maverick cigarette pack,\u201d \u201c[a] larger piece of Chore Boy copper scrubber,\u201d and \u201c[thirteen] vials of crack cocaine in a Newport cigarette pack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Although during direct examination the detective testified only that \u201cwe\u201d observed S.R. was not wearing a seatbelt, when cross-examined he testified that he observed it, although he could not remember any details and did not issue a summons for that alleged violation. When pressed, Detective Jaremczak acknowledged there were actually two reasons for the motor vehicle stop: (1) S.R. was not wearing a seatbelt, and (2) he \u201cbelieve[d] that they just went to Newark to purchase narcotics.\u201d The detective also agreed the observations of the straw and scrubber were not made until after S.R. stepped out of the vehicle as commanded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Q. Did you see [those items] through the windshield or through the side [window]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">A. Once he got out; the door was opened; and that\u2019s when I s[aw] it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">Q. How did he get out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">A. I asked him out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">Q. So you ordered him out of the car because you were conducting what kind of investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">A. I asked him out of the vehicle. And at that time it became a narcotic investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">Q. Isn\u2019t it true that it already was a narcotics investigation before [defendant] was ordered out of the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">A. Yeah. I did believe that they went to Newark to purchase narcotics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">During direct examination, the prosecutor elicited testimony from the detective that the consent form for the search was executed at 5:55 p.m. The defense demonstrated during cross-examination, through use of a video taken from another police vehicle, that the detective was likely in error about the timing of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">As can be seen, Detective Jaremezak did not have personal knowledge of part of the circumstances that ostensibly justified the warrantless search. He did not see defendant reach under the seat; Detective Jaremezak testified only that Detective Harris said he observed this. When asked where Detective Harris was the day of the hearing, Detective Jaremezak said Harris was home and not expected to appear at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">No one else testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">A week after the hearing, the trial judge rendered an oral decision, in which he found: the observation of S.R. not wearing a seatbelt gave the detectives a lawful reason for stopping the vehicle; defendant\u2019s reaching under his seat gave the detectives a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and authorized their directions that defendant and S.R. exit the vehicle; once S.R. was out of the vehicle, drug paraphernalia was seen in plain view; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>S.R. thereafter freely and voluntarily gave his consent to the vehicle search, resulting in the seizure of thirteen vials of crack cocaine. For these reasons, the judge denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Defendant later pleaded guilty to third-degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(l), and was sentenced to a three-year prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In this appeal, defendant argues only that the judge erred in denying his suppression motion because the officers \u201cdid not have cause to order [S.R.] from the car.\u201d Accordingly, we need not question the legitimacy of the vehicle stop,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> notwithstanding the officers\u2019 overarching desire to conduct a narcotics investigation in the absence of reasonable suspicion to support that undertaking.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, there is no dispute about the observations of drug paraphernalia in plain sight once S.R. was ordered out of the vehicle. And the voluntariness of the consent given for the search that followed has not been questioned. Consequently, this appeal rises and falls on whether S.R. was lawfully ordered out of the vehicle because, without that link in the chain of events, the evidence thereafter seized would have to be excluded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We initially observe that an officer\u2019s command that <em>a driver exit </em>a vehicle constitutes a seizure, <em>State v. Smith, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>599, 609, 637 A.2d 158 (1994), but a seizure understood to be constitutionally permissible, <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>106, 111, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 333, 54 L.Ed.2d 331, 337 (1977); <em>Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 611, 637 A.2d 158, and based on the policy determination that police officer safety should prevail over the minimal intrusion on the driver\u2019s privacy interest, <em>Mimms, supra, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>at 110-11, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 333, 54 L.Ed.2d at 336-37; <em>Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 610-11, 637 A.2d 158.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In declaring this new federal constitutional principle, the <em>Mimms </em>Court was not clear whether it applied to all occupants of a vehicle. And in eases that followed the Court did not appear to confine this rule\u2019s application to drivers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This uncertainty about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Mimms\u2019s reach was finally swept away in 1997, when the Court held, as a matter of federal constitutional law, that \u201cdanger to an officer from a traffic stop is likely to be greater when there are passengers in addition to the driver in the stopped car\u201d and concluded \u2014 despite the passenger\u2019s \u201cstronger\u201d \u201cpersonal liberty interest\u201d than the driver\u2019s in that instance \u2014 the intrusion remains \u201cminimal\u201d; consequently, the Court held that \u201can officer making a traffic stop may order <em>passengers </em>to get out of the car pending completion of the stop.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>408, 413-15, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>882, 886, 137 L.Ed.2d 41, 47-48 (1997) (emphasis added). Insofar as defendant relies on federal constitutional principles, there is no merit to his argument that the command that S.R. exit the vehicle was constitutionally prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Not long before the Court decided <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>our Supreme Court considered the application of paragraph 7 of Article I of the New Jersey Constitution to police seizure of a driver or occupant from a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation. The Court concluded in <em>Smith </em>that \u201cas applied <em>to drivers,\u201d </em>Mimms\u2019s per se rule passes state constitutional muster. 134 <em>N.J. </em>at 610-11, 637 A.2d 158 (emphasis added). Unlike the per se rule that the Court ultimately adopted in <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>however, our Supreme Court \u201cdecline[d] to extend [Mimms\u2019s] per se rule to passengers,\u201d and determined that \u201can officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts that would warrant heightened caution to justify ordering the occupants to step out of a vehicle detained for a traffic violation.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 637 A.2d 158. The Court described the scope of this principle in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">To support an order to a passenger to alight from a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation, ... the officer need not point to specific facts that the occupants are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d Rather, the officer need point only to some fact or facts in the totality of the circumstances that would create in a police officer a heightened awareness of danger that would warrant an objectively reasonable officer in securing the scene in a more effective manner by ordering the passenger to alight from the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\n<em>\\Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Although not relevant to this appeal, the <em>Smith </em>Court further noted that to justify a pat-down in this circumstance, the prosecution must satisfy the more stringent requirements of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 27, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 909 (1968). <em>See Smith, supra, 134 N.J. </em>at 619, 637 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The <em>Smith </em>Court also observed that, in one respect, \u201cthe <em>Terry </em>standard and the standard for ordering a passenger out of a car are the same,\u201d rejecting \u201cthe proposition that such an intrusion will be justified solely because of an officer\u2019s \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Instead, \u201cthe officer must be able to articulate specific reasons why the person\u2019s gestures or other circumstances caused the officer to expect more danger from this traffic stop than from other routine traffic stops.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">In considering these principles and the matter at hand, the record reveals that much of what motivated this stop and investigation was the detectives\u2019 assumption that defendant and S.R. were narcotics users or sellers or both. The record contains nothing but rumor and innuendo to support that assertion. Detective Jaremczak testified that this supposition of illegal narcotic activity was based on the department\u2019s receipt of citizen complaints about the number of people entering and leaving defendant\u2019s residence and by the fact that defendant and S.R. were observed traveling toward Newark. Obviously, these two circumstances do not suggest anything other than a mere \u201chunch\u201d that defendant and S.R. may have been engaged in buying, using or selling illegal narcotics. The fact that S.R. was alleged not to have been wearing his seatbelt when the detectives observed the vehicle\u2019s return to Woodbridge adds nothing to whether either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>defendant or S.R. \u201ccaused the officer to expect more danger from this traffic stop than from other routine traffic stops.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 637 A.2d 158. S.R.\u2019s failure to wear a seatbelt generated a danger only to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">This leaves the assertion that, after the vehicle came to a stop, defendant was seen by Detective Harris \u201creaching forward ... reaching under his seat.\u201d This event was not observed by Detective Jaremczak, the only witness called by the State to testify at the suppression hearing. Defendant objected to this hearsay testimony, and the judge never adequately responded. Although Detective Harris\u2019s absence and the lack of evidence based on personal knowledge on this critical point are troubling, it is understood that, as a general matter, the State may offer evidence at a suppression hearing that would constitute inadmissible hearsay if offered at trial. <em>See e.g., State v. Wright, </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558, 565 n. 3, 71 A.3d 212 (App.Div.2013), <em>certif. granted on other grounds, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>283, 87 A.3d 770 (2014); <em>N.J.R.E. </em>101(a)(2)(E).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The weight such testimony should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>given, however, is a matter left to the trial judge as factfinder, with the prosecution running the risk that the factfinder may draw an inference adverse to the prosecution\u2019s interests when a key fact is supported only by hearsay.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Here, notwithstanding the presentation of this key fact through hearsay testimony, the judge initially made no finding regarding whether there was \u201csome fact or facts in the totality of the circumstances that would create in a police officer a heightened awareness of danger that would warrant an objectively reasonable officer in securing the scene in a more effective manner.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 637 A.2d 158. We quote the entirety of the judge\u2019s initial decision on this pivotal question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">While effectuating the stop the detective says he witness[ed] [defendant] reach under <em>the </em>driver\u2019s seat.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] He \u2014 they don\u2019t say \u2014 they don\u2019t call \u2014 movements nowadays. Because they know that\u2019s not good language. But, basically, that\u2019s what he\u2019s saying. Seen some \u2014 movements under the driver seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\"><em>In a totality of the circumstances analysis does the officer have a reasonaMe and articulafble] suspicion to believe that criminal activity is afoot? All right. </em>So he removes the defendants [sic] from the vehicle to speak with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The judge did not thereafter address this question again in his initial decision, but instead turned to what he found the officers saw in plain sight once the occupants were removed from the vehicle, and then to the events that followed the plain-view observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In our earlier opinion we concluded that the judge\u2019s findings did not adequately address the permissibility of ordering S.R. from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">First, we previously stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">even if we liberally interpret the judge\u2019s comments to suggest that the \u201cmovement! ] under the driver seat\u201d was found to be \u201csome fact\u201d that would \u201ccreate . . a heightened awareness of danger,\u201d the judge did not explain how <em>the driver\u2019s </em>movement suggested <em>the passenger </em>posed a danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\"><em>[Bacome I, supra, </em>slip op. at 15-16. J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">In a footnote in our earlier opinion, we observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">in such an instance, the prosecution should be expected to present evidence of a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a weapon was under the driver\u2019s seat and the passenger was capable of reaching it while remaining seated in the vehicle. Here, there was no testimony that the Bronco\u2019s console did not constitute an obstacle to the passenger reaching under the driver\u2019s seat, or that the officer on the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle was not capable of keeping watch over the passenger or prevent him from reaching under the driver\u2019s seat, without unnecessarily intruding on the passenger\u2019s privacy by removing him from the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 16 n. 9.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">These alleged circumstances may have been a reason for ordering defendant out of the vehicle, but the judge originally did not explain why defendant\u2019s movement suggested S.R. posed a danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">Second, the \u201cfact\u201d that triggered the order that the passenger exit the vehicle had to be considered in light of \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 637 A.2d 158. The mere fact that the vehicle\u2019s occupants were traveling to and from Newark, or the fact that defendant received many visitors at his residence, did not suggest a danger was posed when the vehicle was stopped for a seatbelt violation. Certainly, not every driver entering or leaving Newark may be assumed to be a drug user or drug dealer. Nor, even were this so, would it suggest the occupants posed a risk for the officers. In our earlier opinion, we directed \u201c[t]he judge to discuss further whether and \u2014 if so \u2014 how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>these circumstances supported the removal of [S.R.] from the vehicle.\u201d <em>Bacome I, supra, </em>slip op. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Third, in his earlier decision, the judge considered only whether defendant\u2019s movement under the driver\u2019s seat provided a reasonable and articulable suspicion \u201cthat <em>criminal activity </em>is afoot\u201d (emphasis added). That was not the right question. The \u201cfact or facts\u201d to which the officer alludes must \u201ccreate ... a heightened awareness <em>of danger.\u201d Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 637 A.2d 158 (emphasis added). Accordingly, we previously held in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">No matter how broadly we may interpret the judge\u2019s comments, we cannot locate in his opinion a finding that defendant\u2019s alleged movement would have suggested \u201ca heightened awareness of danger.\u201d We are not splitting hairs in focusing so closely on the judge\u2019s precise words; it is all we have to consider. An officer\u2019s limited right to order a passenger out of a vehicle arises from the policy determinations made by the Courts in <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Smith </em>that <em>officer safety </em>\u2014 not <em>the investigation of ctiminal activity </em>\u2014 overrides the minor intrusion into the passenger\u2019s privacy right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\"><em>[Bacome I, supra, </em>slip op. at 17.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">And fourth, we previously concluded that the judge\u2019s posing of this incorrect question of whether the officer had \u201ca reasonable and articul[able] suspicion to believe that criminal activity is afoot,\u201d followed by his answer \u2014 \u201cAll right\u201d \u2014 did not sufficiently convey the substance of his findings. Even if that was the correct question, it was not clear whether \u201cAll right\u201d was intended as the means of expressing a finding that the officers did have a reasonable and articulable suspicion of \u201ccriminal activity [being] afoot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">As a result, we concluded that \u201c[although we are required to defer to a trial judge\u2019s factual findings on a motion to suppress, <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 254, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007), the factfinding on the critical issue that this appeal poses does not command our deference. The judge clearly posed the wrong question and then gave no clear answer.\u201d <em>Bacome I, supra, </em>slip op. at 17. We, thus, remanded for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">By way of a brief written decision,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the trial judge responded to the questions posed in <em>Bacome I. </em>Based on the same evidence, the judge drew the factual conclusion that the movement of the driver \u2014 a fact before the court only by way of hearsay that would be inadmissible at trial \u2014 suggested the passenger posed a danger. The judge described these conclusions by employing a series of double negatives and by delineating what it was that the record did not reveal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\u2022 If the [defendant put a weapon under his seat, <em>there is nothing to suggest </em>that S.R. would have been unable to reach or gain access to it while remaining seated in the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">\u2022 <em>there was no indication </em>that the vehicle\u2019s center console constituted an obstacle to S.R. reaching under the [djefendant\u2019s seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">\u2022 <em>there ivas also no testimony </em>that the officer who was standing on the passenger side of the vehicle was not capable of keeping watch over S.R. so as to prevent him from reaching under the [dlefendant\u2019s seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">In other words, based on that which was not explained by the factual record, the judge determined that in light of \u201cthe danger inherent in motor vehicle stops\u201d and the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the driver\u2019s movement under his seat was a \u201cspecific and articulable fact\u201d that would create a \u201cheightened awareness of danger.\u201d The judge added that because the officers were surveil-ling defendant and S.R. for drug activity, and because they were \u201csuspected of having made a drug run to Newark just prior to the traffic stop,\u201d it was not unreasonable \u201cfor the officers to believe\u201d that defendant \u201cdid indeed place a weapon under his seat,\u201d and, for that additional reason, the order that both individuals exit the vehicle \u201cwas necessary to secure the scene in a more effective manner.\u201d Based on these suppositions, the judge concluded that the ordering of both defendant and S.R. from the vehicle was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>What is lost in this blizzard of double negatives and speculative findings is that it was the State\u2019s burden to justify this warrantless search. <em>Brown, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>at 517, 83 A.3d 45. \u201cA search conducted without a warrant is presumptively invalid, and the burden falls on the State to demonstrate that the search is justified by one of the \u2018few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions\u2019 to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>State v. Frankel, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>586, 598, 847 A.2d 561 (2004). Contrary to the trial judge\u2019s determination, the absence of adequate evidence is detrimental to the State\u2019s position, not defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The record unmistakably compels our agreement with the judge\u2019s determination that there was an absence of proof on these critical questions. No officer testified to a heightened safety concern. No officer testified S.R. was capable of reaching under defendant\u2019s seat if he remained seated in the passenger seat. No officer described the interior of the vehicle at all, let alone with enough concrete details from which an inference could be drawn that S.R. posed a danger if he remained in the passenger seat while being watched by an armed police officer. Absent findings that S.R. remaining in the vehicle created \u201ca heightened awareness of danger,\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 637 A.2d 158, the State could not sustain its burden of proof on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">As we have already demonstrated, the mere fact that the vehicle traveled to and returned from the Newark area adds nothing to the circumstances. And the basis for the stop itself\u2014 S.R.\u2019s unbuckled seatbelt \u2014 was not ground alone for ordering either individual out of the vehicle.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If that was the only legitimate basis for the stop in this case \u2014 and it was \u2014 then S.R. should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>have been served with a summons and he and defendant permitted to go on their way.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The order that S.R. exit the vehicle was impermissible and\u2014 because it was the linchpin for all that followed \u2014 defendant\u2019s motion to suppress what was thereafter discovered and seized should have been granted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The order denying defendant\u2019s suppression motion is reversed, the judgment of conviction vacated, and the matter remanded for further proceedings.

We are not being unduly cynical in concluding what is plainly apparent: the unbuckled seatbelt was a ruse for the stop and the officers were interested only in pursuing their hunch \u2014 concededly accurate \u2014 that the vehicle\u2019s occupants were involved in illegal drug activity. Why else did the officers remain on the outskirts of Woodbridge awaiting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>vehicle's return from the Newark area? Are we to believe they remained there for no other purpose but to ensure S.R. was wearing his seatbelt on the return trip? Our dissenting colleague emphasizes that in <em>Smith </em>it was the driver \u2014 not the passenger \u2014 who \"engaged in the culpable conduct that resulted] in the vehicle stop,\u201d 134 <em>N.J. </em>at 615, 637 A.2d 158, and because the opposite is true here \u2014 S.R.'s unbuckled seatbelt generated the stop \u2014 that S.R. cannot claim the same liberty interest possessed by the passenger in <em>Smith. </em>Even if we accept the premise that the unbuckled seatbelt was a legitimate ground for stopping the vehicle, our colleague gives too much weight to S.R.'s \"culpability\u201d in this chain of events. The record demonstrates the officers were unconcerned about the seatbelt and, more importantly, the unbuckled seatbelt posed them no danger. We do not depart from the letter or spirit of the applicable standard of appellate review, nor the principles enunciated in <em>Smith, </em>in concluding that the State failed to demonstrate a basis for overriding S.R.'s liberty interest in remaining in the vehicle. Just as a fluidity of events may transform an unlawful investigatory stop into a lawful search. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10-11, 926 A.2d 340 (2007), the opposite can be true, and the lack of a link between the unbuckled seatbelt and the order given S.R. to exit the vehicle transformed what may have been a lawful stop into an unlawful deprivation of S.R.'s liberty interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\"> We lastly note that the State has argued defendant lacked the requisite expectation of privacy to assert the infringement of S.R.'s liberty interest, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>211, 78 A.3d 553 (2013). In <em>Hinton, </em>the Court recognized that the defendant had standing to argue but ultimately did not possess a reasonable expectation of privacy in an apartment he shared with his mother for six years because he had been \"served with official notice that a court officer would soon enter the premises and repossess it on the landlord's behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 78 A.3d 553.

Unlike the majority, however, I find that Detective Jaremczak lawfully ordered the passenger, S.R., to exit the vehicle. In my view, the detective violated neither the Federal nor the State Constitution by ordering S.R. to exit the Bronco.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Detective Jaremczak\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing established, indisputably, that when the detectives stopped the Bronco they believed defendant and S.R. had purchased drugs in Newark. The detectives did not stop the Bronco, however, until they observed that S.R. was not wearing a seatbelt. When Detective Jaremczak was questioned on cross-examination about his motive for ordering S.R. out of the car, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">A. Once [the passenger] got out; the door was opened; and that\u2019s when I seen [the straw and scrubber].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">Q.

He would have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">The critical issue we must decide is whether Detective Jaremczak\u2019s order to S.R. to get out of the car was reasonable. <em>See State v.

Whether such a seizure is constitutional depends on the reasonableness of the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\n<em>Ubid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Under a Fourth Amendment analysis, it is reasonable for an officer to order a driver and passenger out of the car after the officer has pulled the driver over for a traffic offense. In <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>106, 111, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 333, 54 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 331, 337 (1977), the Supreme Court held that even in the absence of furtive movements or evidence of criminal activity, a police officer had the right to demand that a driver stopped for a traffic violation exit the vehicle. Because \u201c[t]he police have already lawfully decided that the driver shall be briefly detained; the only question is whether he shall spend that period sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his car or standing alongside it.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Balancing the driver\u2019s liberty interest against the State\u2019s interest in protecting its police officers, the Supreme Court struck the balance in favor of the latter, finding that the intrusion on the driver\u2019s liberty interest in such circumstances to be <em>de minimis. Ibid. </em>The Court extended the rationale in <em>Mimms </em>to a vehicle\u2019s passengers in <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>408, 414-15, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>882, 886, 137 L.Ed.2d 41, 48 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Our Supreme Court has followed <em>Mimms </em>with respect to drivers, but not passengers; at least passengers not involved in the culpable conduct leading to the traffic stop:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">Although the <em>per se </em>rule under <em>Mimms </em>permits an officer to order the driver out of a vehicle incident to a lawful stop for a traffic violation, we decline to extend that <em>per se </em>rule to passengers. Instead, we determine that an officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts that would warrant heightened caution to justify ordering the occupants to step out of a vehicle detained for a traffic violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\"><em>[Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 637 A.2d 158.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">The Supreme Court explained in <em>Smith </em>that a standard, lesser than the <em>Terry </em>standard, is required for officers to order passengers to exit a vehicle. Significantly, however, <em>Smith </em>did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>involve culpable conduct on the part of a passenger. In explaining the rationale for its decision in <em>Smith, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">Ordering a passenger to leave the vehicle is distinguishable from ordering the driver to get out of the vehicle <em>because the passenger has not engaged in the culpable conduct that resulted, in the vehicle\u2019s stop. </em>Although the State\u2019s interest in safety remains the same whether the driver or the passenger is involved, requiring a passenger to alight from a car in the course of a routine traffic stop represents a greater intrusion on a passenger\u2019s liberty than the same requirement does on a driver\u2019s liberty. <em>With respect to the passenger, the only justification for the intrusion on the passenger\u2019s privacy is the untimely association with the driver on the day the driver is observed committing a traffic violation. Because the passenger has not engaged in culpable conduct, the passenger has a legitimate expectation that no further inconvenience will be occasioned by any intrusions beyond the delay caused by the lawful stop. </em>The intrusion on the passenger\u2019s privacy, therefore, is greater than it is on the driver\u2019s privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\"><em>[Id </em>at 615, 637 A.2d 158 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Unlike the passenger in <em>Smith, </em>here S.R. engaged in the \u201cculpable conduct that resulted in the vehicle\u2019s stop.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, S.R.\u2019s liberty interest in this case is no different from that of a driver who has committed a traffic violation: \u201cThe police have already lawfully decided that the driver shall be briefly detained; the only question is whether he shall spend that period sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the car or standing alongside it.\u201d <em>Mimms, supra, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>at 111, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 333, 54 L.Ed.2d at 337. In my view, that rubric applies equally to culpable passengers, that is, passengers who have committed traffic violations. For that reason, the detectives in the case before us did not violate the protections afforded New Jersey citizens under our State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The majority\u2019s decision is based in large part upon its observation \u201cthat much of what motivated this stop and investigation was the detectives\u2019 assumption that defendant and S.R. were narcotics users or sellers or both.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 238, 112 A.3d at <em>605. </em>Specifically, the majority states: \u201cWe are not being unduly cynical in concluding what is plainly apparent: the unbuckled seat belt was a ruse for the stop and the officers were interested only in pursuing their hunch \u2014 concededly accurate \u2014 that the vehicle\u2019s occupants were involved in illegal drug activity.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 244, n. 11, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>A.3d at 609, n. 11. Although one can debate the meaning of the term \u201cruse\u201d in this context, it is clear that S.R.\u2019s failure to wear a seatbelt provided the police with probable cause to stop the Bronco. Neither defendant nor S.R. disputed that S.R. was not wearing a seatbelt. Once the lawful traffic stop occurred for that purpose, S.R.\u2019s liberty interest in remaining in the car was outweighed by the State\u2019s interest in the safety of its officers. The subjective intent of the officers at that time was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>806, 808, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1769, 1771, 135 L.Ed.2d 89, 95 (1996), the Supreme Court decided</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">whether the temporary detention of a motorist who the police have probable cause to believe has committed a civil traffic violation is inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable seizures unless a reasonable officer would have been motivated to stop the car by a desire to enforce the traffic laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">After reviewing relevant precedent, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">We think these cases foreclose any argument that the constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops depends on the actual motivations of the individual officers involved. We of course agree with petitioners that the Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race. But the constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of laws is the Equal Protection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment. Subjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 813, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1774, <em>135 L.Ed.2d </em>at 98.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Our Supreme Court has similarly rejected a subjective test when determining whether police officers have acted reasonably for Fourth Amendment purposes. <em>See e.g., State v. Brown, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>508, 531, 83 A.3d 45 (2014) (noting that, with respect to whether property had been abandoned, \u201c[t]he test is whether, given the totality of the circumstances, an objectively reasonable police officer would believe the property is abandoned\u201d and that \u201c[t]he subjective belief of the officer is not a relevant consideration, and thus the court should not delve into the murky area of whether an officer acted in good faith or bad faith\u201d); <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 27, 588 A.2d 834 (App.Div.1991) (\u201cWe begin with the well-recognized principle that generally the proper inquiry for determining the constitutionality of a search and seizure is whether the conduct of the law enforcement officer who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>undertook the search was objectively reasonable, without regard to his or her underlying motives or intent.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Moreover, our Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">[O]ur Article I, Paragraph 7 jurisprudence primarily has eschewed any consideration of the subjective motivations of a police officer in determining the constitutionality of a search and seizure____[W]e do not believe that the elusive attempt to plumb the subjective motivations of an officer will meaningfully advance either the privacy interests of an individual or the ultimate determination of whether a particular search or seizure was unreasonable under state law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\"><em>[State v. Edmonds, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>117, 132-33, 47 A.3d 737 (2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">In the case before us, Detective Jaremczak\u2019s cross-examination does not lead to an entirely unequivocal answer as to whether, when he ordered S.R. out of the car, his motivation was to continue to pursue the seatbelt violation or to pursue the drug investigation or both. What is unequivocal is that he acted for his safety. He testified, explicitly, that he asked S.R. out \u201c[jjust so that I could bring him back to the car because my partner was speaking with [defendant]. It\u2019s just easier if ... they\u2019re both watched at the same time in case one of them wanted to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Under the circumstances of this case \u2014 where the passenger\u2019s liberty expectation to remain in the car was de minimis in view of his seatbelt violation \u2014 the State\u2019s interest in the safety of its officers prevailed. In the face of federal and state precedent eschewing judicial analysis of law enforcement officers\u2019 subjective intentions in such Fourth Amendment cases, I find no basis for engaging in such analysis here. For that reason, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
