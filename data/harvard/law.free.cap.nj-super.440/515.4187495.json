Taylor, appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized by police officers after a warrantless search of a stolen motor vehicle in which he was a passenger. Because the issue presented relative to defendant\u2019s knowledge of the motor vehicle\u2019s status was unanswered by the record, we are constrained to remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">On April 18, 2012, at approximately 1:28 a.m., New Jersey State Troopers Goncalves and Brown were on routine patrol on the New Jersey Turnpike when they observed a white Lexus ES 350 bearing New York license plates weaving in the left lane and traveling at a high rate of speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">The troopers activated the overhead lights of the patrol vehicle to initiate a motor vehicle stop. The motor vehicle pulled over to the shoulder of the highway and came to a complete stop. Three individuals were inside the motor vehicle; Lastaeia Harmon, the driver, Louis Bailey, the front seat passenger, and defendant, the rear seat passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Trooper Goncalves approached the motor vehicle from the passenger side, identified himself, and requested from Harmon her driver\u2019s license and registration. Harmon provided a driver\u2019s license but was unable to produce the registration. Harmon informed the trooper that the car did not belong to her and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>she did not know the whereabouts of the paperwork for the motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The trooper inquired about the motor vehicle\u2019s ownership and the whereabouts of the occupants. Bailey responded the car belonged to \u201ca friend\u201d and was borrowed for the day. No other details were provided regarding the \u201cfriend.\u201d Harmon informed the trooper they had been in New York visiting friends and were on their way back to Atlantic City. While Trooper Goncalves spoke with Harmon and Bailey, defendant appeared to be asleep in the rear seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Trooper Goncalves returned to his patrol vehicle and contacted dispatch. The troopers were informed that the license plate on the Lexus was registered to a black 2011 Kia Optima. While Goncalves returned to the motor vehicle to speak with the occupants, Trooper Brown checked the motor vehicle identification number (VIN) on the Lexus and contacted dispatch for verification. The VIN number came back to a Lexus reported stolen five months earlier in Atlantic City.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">After additional troopers arrived, Harmon, Bailey and defendant were ordered out of the car, placed under arrest, searched and given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The troopers then conducted a search of the motor vehicle\u2019s trunk and passenger compartment. The search revealed two handguns, one located under the driver\u2019s seat and one located in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">All three occupants were transported to the barracks. At the barracks, the suspects were searched again. The second search produced two white, rock-like substances in the small pocket above the right front pocket of Bailey\u2019s jeans that was suspected to be crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">After again being advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights, an interview was conducted of each occupant. None of them acknowledged ownership of the weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The motor vehicle was impounded and towed to a private yard. Several days thereafter at the impound lot, an attendant entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the motor vehicle to search for the keys so he could move the car. In the course of the search, the attendant discovered a gun magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Defendant filed a motion to suppress which was joined by Harmon and Bailey. The motion was opposed by the State. After oral argument, the court denied the motion. The court found the defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy as they were occupants of a stolen vehicle. The court cited this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Lugo, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 592 A.2d 1234 (App.Div.1991) and employed the analysis set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Hempele, 120 N.J. 182, 576 </em>A.2d 793 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">Now, I\u2019d like to note initially that the defendant operating an automobile known by him to have been stolen has no reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents. <em>State v. Bohuk, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>581 [636 A.2d 105 (App.Div.1994) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">But in <em>State v. Lugo </em>..., the Appellate Division admitted evidence found in a stolen vehicle after relying on eases in which \u2014 a case it cited in which the defendant had knowledge that the car was stolen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">However, in the court\u2019s opinion, the facts relied on by the court did not note whether the defendant in that case was aware that the car was stolen or not stolen. So, it was not relevant to the analysis in <em>Lugo </em>whether a defendant had knowledge that the car had been stolen or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">Here, assuming these defendants had an expectation of privacy, [that they were] unaware ... that the vehicle had been stolen, even though Harmon ... was unable to turn over the vehicle registration and ownership documents, and the defendants were unable to articulate from whom they obtained the Lexus, the Lexus that they were in at the time, I conclude that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9e\">And I emphasize the word \u201creasonable\u201d expectation of privacy in a stolen car as a matter of law. Therefore, this court concludes that since there is no reasonable expectation ... in a stolen motor vehicle, the search ... conducted by the State Troopers without a warrant was lawful, and therefore, defendants\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence must be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">The court then added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">And the reason ... I\u2019m making this decision ... and not conducting an evidentiary hearing is because there are a certain set of limited facts that are not in dispute, and because I\u2019m making a determination that as a matter of law, it is unreasonable for there to exist an expectation of privacy, that it is \u2014 it is an expectation that I conclude that society will never recognize as legitimate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">On appeal, the defendant raises the following argument:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">BASED ON A FLAWED INTERPRETATION OF <em>STATE v. LUGO ..., </em>THE TRIAL COURT ERRONEOUSLY REACHED THE UNSOUND CONCLUSION THAT A PASSENGER HAS NO EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IN A STOLEN CAR, EVEN IF HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THAT THE CAR WAS STOLEN AND REASONABLY BELIEVED THAT THE DRIVER WAS IN LAWFUL POSSESSION OF IT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The State argues that defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the motor vehicle, and therefore, the police did not need a warrant to search.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Although we accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact that are \u201csupported by sufficient credible evidence in the record,\u201d <em>State v. Gamble, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>412, 424, 95 A.3d 188 (2014) (citing <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 243, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007)), we need not defer to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions reached from the established facts. <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>413 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 352, 994 A.2d 1067 (App.Div.2010). \u201c \u2018If the trial court acts under a misconception of the applicable law,\u2019 we need not defer to its ruling.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>595, 604, 573 A.2d 886 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">We first address defendant\u2019s argument he had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution protect against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. IV; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. 1,17. A search triggering constitutional scrutiny occurs when government agents intrude into an area where an individual has \u201ca reasonable \u2018expectation of privacy!.]\u2019 \u201d <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 9, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1873, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 899 (1968) (citing <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>347, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>361, 88 <em>S.Ct </em>507, 516, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 587-88 (1967) (Harlan J., concurring)); <em>see also State v. Hinton, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>211, 229, 78 A.3d 553 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Absent a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place or thing searched, an individual is not entitled to protection under either the Fourth Amendment or Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution. <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>128, 148-49, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>421, 433, 58 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>387, 404-05 (1978); <em>Hinton, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>at 239-40, 78 A.3d 553 (holding that because defendant lacked an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment police searched, the \u201cpolice action in his apartment was not a 'search\u2019 for purposes of either the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Our Supreme Court has held that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in garbage placed in opaque bags, <em>Hempele, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 215, 576 A.2d 793, and bank records maintained by third parties. <em>State v. McAllister, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>17, 30-33, 875 A.2d 866 (2005). On the other hand, a defendant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in a vacant building with an opened and unlocked front door, <em>State v. Perry, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>128, 149-50, 590 A.2d 624 (1991), or in a known stolen vehicle, <em>Lugo, supra, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 568, 592 A.2d 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Whether an individual has an expectation of privacy requires a fact-sensitive analysis. For Fourth Amendment purposes, to determine whether a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in a place or object, courts must make \u201ca two-part inquiry: first, has the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object <em>of </em>the challenged search? Second, is society willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable?\u201d <em>Cal. v. Ciraolo, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>207, 211 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1809, 1811, 90 L.Ed.2d 210, 215 (1986). Unlike the federal two-part inquiry, the New Jersey constitutional standard does not require the defendant to prove a subjective expectation of privacy. <em>Hinton, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>at 236, 78 A.3d 553. Rather, \u201cArticle I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Constitution \u2018requires only that an expectation of privacy be reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Hempele, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 200, 576 A.2d 793).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u201c[Expectations of privacy are established by general social norms,\u201d and must align with the \u201caims of a free and open society.\u201d <em>Hempele, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 200-01, 576 A.2d 793 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Under federal law, defendants have the burden of proving they had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place or object searched. <em>Rawlings v. Ky., </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>98, 104-05, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2556, 2561, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>633, 641 (1980). \u201cUnder state law, a \u2018defendant must show that a reasonable or legitimate expectation of privacy was trammeled by government authorities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hinton, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>at 233, 78 A.3d 553 (quoting <em>State v. Evers, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>355, 368-69, 815 A.2d 432 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In the ease before us, we conclude that the question of whether defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the motor vehicle cannot be solely determined as a matter of law, but requires a fact-sensitive inquiry. Such an inquiry is required since we decline the State\u2019s invitation to formulate a bright-line rule, as a matter of law, that an individual operating or occupying a stolen motor vehicle, regardless of their knowledge of its status, does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In <em>State v. Pace, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 244-45, 408 A.2d 808 (App.Div.1979), <em>certif. denied, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>384, 420 A.2d 314 (1980), the defendant was operating a motor vehicle later determined through a records check to be stolen. After the defendant was arrested, the police conducted an inventory search of the motor vehicle for evidence of ownership. <em>Id. </em>at 245, 408 A.2d 808. The police located, forced open, and searched a locked attach\u00e9 case found in the trunk. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant later pled guilty to receiving stolen property, i.e., the motor vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 250, 408 A.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">On appeal, the court noted the State\u2019s argument that defendant had no reasonable expectation of a right to privacy in any article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>placed in the stolen motor vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 408 A.2d 808. We noted, \u201c[W]ere we approaching this issue as one of first impression, we might be persuaded that this position has merit.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, citing <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>1, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2476, 53 L.Ed.2d 538 (1977) and <em>Arkansas v. Sanders, </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>753, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2586, 61 L.Ed.2d 235 (1979), we found the search of the attache case violated the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>Pace, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 247-50, 408 A.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In <em>Lugo, </em>the defendant was stopped by police and arrested after they learned he was operating a stolen motor vehicle. <em>Lugo, supra, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 567, 592 A.2d 1234. The police impounded the motor vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>Two days later, while the motor vehicle remained impounded, police received an anonymous tip that contraband would be found in the motor vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>Acting thereupon, the police located a brown paper bag under the passenger seat containing heroin. <em>Ibid. </em>We determined, based upon the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Cal. v. Acevedo, </em>500 <em>U.S. </em>565, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1982, 114 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>619 (1991) which overruled <em>Chadwick </em>and <em>Sanders, </em>we \u201cneed not reach the result we were required to reach in <em>Pace.\u201d Lugo, supra, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 568, 592 A.2d 1234. We added that \u201ca defendant operating an automobile known by him to have been stolen has no reasonable expectation of privacy respecting contraband he had hidden in it____\u201d Ibid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In <em>State v. Bohuk, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>581, 595, 636 A.2d 105 (App.Div.1994), a ease cited by the motion judge, we cited <em>Lugo </em>and noted that \u201ca defendant operating an automobile known by him to have been stolen has no reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>In view of our reading of <em>Pace, Lugo </em>and <em>Bohuk, </em>which specifically address the issue of knowledge, we reject the State\u2019s \u201cstrict liability\u201d argument that knowledge of the motor vehicle\u2019s status is irrelevant to a determination of a reasonable expectation of privacy. To be sure, one can envision other settings where an \u201cunknowing occupier\u201d of a stolen motor vehicle would have a reasonable expectation of privacy that would not offend societal norms.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The State also argues it was defendant\u2019s burden to demonstrate, at the time of the motion, that he had a reasonable or legitimate expectation of privacy. <em>Evers, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 369, 815 A.2d 432. Without further consideration of that issue, we reject the State\u2019s argument that defendant \u201cwaived\u201d his opportunity to present evidence to meet his burden as the motion was determined after oral argument based upon the agreement of the parties and the court. Therefore, no facts were developed on the issue of defendant\u2019s knowledge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of the agreed upon procedure, it would be fundamentally unfair to conclude defendant waived the opportunity to present such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Remanded in conformity with this decision. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\"> The State raised an alternative argument of inevitable-discovery during oral argument on the motion which the court rejected. No evidence of a police inventory policy was adduced at the hearing. The exception\u2019s applicability requires the finding that, notwithstanding that the police violated the law, the State \u201cwould have pursued established investigatory procedures that would have inevitably resulted in the discovery of the controverted evidence....\u201d <em>State v. Sugar, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>214, 240, 495 A.2d 90 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"> Defendant was not charged with \"Receiving Stolen Property\" which requires proof of knowledge or belief the property has been stolen. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-7(a). None of the statutory requisites supporting presumption of knowledge would apply herein. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-7(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> We are mindful that, after the motion was denied, defendant entered a guilty plea to second-degree unlawful possession of a firearm. During the plea colloquy, defendant admitted he knew the vehicle was stolen. Whether, or to what extent, that admission may be used at the hearing now required by today's decision should be considered in the first instance by the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
