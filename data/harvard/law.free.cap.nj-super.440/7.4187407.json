Poole, M.D., and from the order denying plaintiffs motion for a new trial. Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in excluding certain evidence. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">We begin by summarizing the most pertinent trial evidence. Mr. Parker was diagnosed with colon cancer when a tumor was discovered during a colonoscopy. A biopsy had revealed that Mr. Parker had an invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and he was referred to defendant to immediately undergo surgery to remove the tumor. Defendant, a board-certified general surgeon, saw Mr. Parker for a surgical consult on February 13, 2009. Defendant performed the surgery, a transverse colon resection, to remove the tumor on February 19, 2009. After removing the tumor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>defendant performed an open anastomosis, sewing the colon back together, to close the opening. Defendant reported no difficulties during the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">After the surgery, Mr. Parker remained in the hospital. At some point between February 22 and 23, he developed complications. On February 23, nurses observed blood-tinged fluid coming from the surgical site. Examination by defendant revealed that Mr. Parker had developed a dehiscence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on the risk of the incision re-opening, defendant decided to perform a second operation to repair the dehiscence.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">On February 24, defendant performed the second surgery. During the procedure, defendant noticed some \u201cmurky fluid in the abdominal wound.\u201d As a result, he investigated to determine if there was an anastomotic leak, a hole or perforation in the intestine that allows intestinal contents to leak into the abdomen. While defendant testified, \u201cWe never saw a hole[,] [w]e never saw a perforation,\u201d he nevertheless decided to resect or remove the anastomosis. He explained, \u201cI felt the anastomosis was not perfect!;] ... my job as a surgeon was to make the anastomosis perfect.\u201d Defendant continued to follow Mr. Parker after the surgery on the 24th; however, \u201che had a cataclysmic rapid demise and ultimately expired early on the 26th.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Plaintiffs theory in the case was that defendant negligently performed the first anastomosis, creating a leak, which led to sepsis, and that defendant then negligently failed to address the sepsis. Specifically, plaintiff contended that, because defendant encountered evidence of infection in the second surgery, he should have performed an ileostomy, a procedure where a loop of small bowel would have been externalized to stop feces from coming into the abdomen, and then drained the abdomen to remove the purulent fluids, and allowed Mr. Parker to heal. Once healed, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Parker could have undergone a re-anastomosis. Defendant indicated that he performs such \u201costomy\u201d procedures \u201call the time.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The defense disputed the source of the sepsis which caused Mr. Parker\u2019s death, as well as the timing of the onset of the sepsis. At trial, plaintiff sought to introduce defendant\u2019s deposition testimony, specifically, an exchange in which defendant responded to a question about the cause of Mr. Parker\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">Q: Why did Mr. Parker die?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">A: It appeal\u2019s that he got septic, though <em>Ym </em>not sure why he had such a rapid demise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">Q: To what did you attribute the sepsis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Objection, but you can answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-11\">A: I have to assume that it was related to the anastomotic leak.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">When plaintiff sought to read this deposition excerpt into the record as part of her case, defendant objected, arguing that the language he used in response (\u201cI would have to assume\u201d) was speculative. Plaintiff argued that it was an admission by a party-opponent and thus admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1), regardless of any claimed speculative nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">The trial court sustained the objection, finding the testimony speculative. The court also appeared to question the propriety of plaintiff attempting to elicit expert testimony from defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>And in addition to that, it is cumulative and it is calling for speculation on his part. And therefore, I\u2019m going to uphold [defendant\u2019s] objection and I\u2019m not going to allow it to be read into evidence[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">On direct examination, defendant testified that \u201cMr. Parker had no evidence of sepsis at the time leading up to the [second] surgery, at the time of the surgery, and immediately in the recovering room after the surgery.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in the operative report defendant dictated immediately after the second surgery, he wrote, \u201cI did not want to take the chance the anastomosis was leaking and would cause <em>further </em>sepsis.\u201d (Emphasis added). Defendant attempted to explain this apparent contradiction in the following colloquy, still on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">Q: When you said you were concerned it would cause further sepsis what did you mean by further sepsis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">A: I meant at a point in time. I might have actually dictated future sepsis but I mean, further down the road. I would \u2014 a chance that this would cause sepsis. So unfortunately \u2014 I probably dictated like I speak but they transcribe it but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">Q: It would have been future as opposed to further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">A: Well, I\u2019m dictating a medical record. I\u2019m not a novelist. In my mind, I was using \u2014 it might not be the most eloquent \u2014 but I\u2019m trying to say, I couldn\u2019t take the chance that this would \u2014 anastomosis would break down and cause sepsis in the future, cause further sepsis. That was my job to not take that chance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">Q: Did there come a time that Mr. Parker did become septic?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">A: Yes, there was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">Q: When was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">A: He became septic several hours after the surgery in the intensive care unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">Later that day, during cross-examination, defendant disputed that he saw evidence of an anastomotic leak during the second surgery, despite his operative report listing \u201c[p]robable anasto-motic leak\u201d among his post-operative diagnoses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-13\">Q: Eventually, you determined that there was a probabl[e] anastomotic leak that you encountered in the second surgeryU right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>A: That\u2019s not true. What ... I said \u2014 and I said yesterday is that when we got in there, that putting ... everything together ... the anastomosis did not look perfect. And I said it was my job, as the surgeon, to make sure that the patient is as perfect as I can make [hint]. So, I made the decision that [II needed to resect that anastomosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">Q: You\u2019re denying that you ... determined that there was a probabl[e] anasto-motic leak?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">A: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">Q: Do you recognize that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">A: That\u2019s my operating report from that day; correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">Q: Mmm-hmm. And the postoperative diagnosis that you put down includes probabl[e] anastomotic leak[,] right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">A: That\u2019s correct. Look, you asked me if I determined that\u2019s what it was. That\u2019s different than a determination____That\u2019s what I\u2019m concerned about. That it wasn\u2019t perfect and I redid it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-14\">Q: I\u2019ll jump back to something that we actually ... advanced to before. In the final analysis, we did determine that there was a probable anastomotic leak in this patient, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-15\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-16\">After the completion of defendant\u2019s testimony, plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the court\u2019s decision to exclude defendant\u2019s deposition testimony (\u201cI have to assume that it was related to the anastomotic leak\u201d) regarding the cause of Mr. Parker\u2019s sepsis. [T]he court denied the motion, reiterating, that \u201cthe comment that [defendant] nevertheless articulated was speculative. And, in fact, he said T have to assume.\u2019 Which, I think, is as great an indication of speculation [as] you\u2019re going to get, in any case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-17\">The next day, the jury returned a verdict, finding that defendant had not deviated from accepted standards of care and was therefore not negligent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that defendant\u2019s deposition testimony should have been admitted under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1) as an admission by a party-opponent, and that the exclusion of this evidence resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>clear miscarriage of justice under the law. <em>R. </em>4:49-1. The court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">On appeal, plaintiff seeks a new trial, contending that the trial court\u2019s erroneous evidentiary rulings regarding defendant\u2019s deposition testimony constituted reversible error. Specifically, plaintiff argues that the trial court improperly excluded defendant\u2019s deposition testimony, and asserts that the testimony was admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1), the hearsay exception for statements by a party-opponent. Plaintiff contends that defendant\u2019s deposition testimony is not speculative, but emphasizes that the exception applies even if the statement were speculative. Finally, plaintiff argues that the deposition testimony is not subject to exclusion under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s evidential ruling, an appellate court is limited to examining the decision for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Hisenaj v. Kuehner, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>6, 12, 942 A.2d 769 (2008); <em>accord Purdy v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>123, 130, 445 A.2d 424 (App.Div.1982). We are required to disregard an error unless, after consideration, we find \u201cit is of such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result[.]\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">We first address the trial court\u2019s comments suggesting that defendant\u2019s deposition testimony about the cause of Mr. Parker\u2019s sepsis might be excludable because \u201cit converts [defendant] into an expert witness[,]\u201d and asks \u201chim to render an opinion when, in fact, he\u2019s being called as a fact witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">\u201c[A] plaintiff in a medical malpractice [action] can ask questions of a defendant doctor in a deposition which seek to elicit expert opinions relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hutchinson v. Atl. City Med. Ctr.-Mainland, </em>314 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>468, 477, 715 A.2d 348 (App.Div.1998) (citing <em>Rogotzki v. Schept, </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 219 A.2d 426 (App.Div.1966)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">It is clear that defendants may be deposed as to the facts of the treatment they gave \u2014 what they did, what they saw, and the diagnoses rendered. It is also clear that they may not be asked to respond to purely hypothetical questions. But we think it plain that it is not \u201copinion\u201d to have them explain why something was done or not done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\"><em>[Rogotzki, supra, </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 152, 219 A.2d 426.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In <em>Rogotzki, </em>we rejected the argument \u201cthat a treating physician who is a party defendant may not be compelled to answer on depositions such questions as call for his expert opinions or conclusions related to the treatment he rendered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 219 A.2d 426.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">There is nothing unfair about such a practice. Unlike his counterpart in a criminal prosecution, the defendant in a civil suit has no inherent right to remain silent or, once on the stand, to answer only those inquiries which will have no adverse effect on his case. Rather, he must, if called as a witness, respond to virtually all questions aimed at eliciting information he may possess relevant to the issues, even though his testimony on such matters might further the plaintiffs case. We cannot agree with the suggestion that it is somehow neither sporting nor consistent with the adversary system to allow a party to prove his case through his opponent\u2019s own testimony but, whatever the merits of this view, we prefer to believe that, in a situation such as the present, [t]he ultimate requirement that judicial decisions be based on the ... facts overcomes any detriment which might be suffered by the adversary system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 149,219 A.2d 426 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>McDermott v. Manhattan Eye, Ear &amp; Throat Hosp., </em>15 <em>N.Y.2d </em>20, 255 N.Y.S.2d 65, 203 N.E.2d 469, 474 (1964) (citations and internal quotation marks in <em>McDermott </em>omitted)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Our Supreme Court subsequently indicated its approval of <em>Rogotzki, </em>stating, \u201cProof of deviation elicited from the defendants themselves, because they are competent professionals, could be relied on by the jury.\u201d <em>Lanzet v. Greenberg, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>168, 191, 594 A.2d 1309 (1991) (citing <em>Rogotzki, supra, </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 148-49, 219 A.2d 426); <em>see also, Hutchinson, supra, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 478-81, 715 A.2d 348 (holding that the trial court properly allowed plaintiffs to use the defendant doctor\u2019s deposition testimony as evidence of the applicable standard of care).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">Furthermore, it is well established that a treating doctor testifying as a fact witness is permitted to testify about the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>of the patient\u2019s disease or injury, because causation is an essential part of diagnosis and treatment. <em>See Stigliano v. Connaught Labs., Inc., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>305, 314, 658 A.2d 715 (1995) (holding \u201cthe characterization of [such] testimony as \u2018fact\u2019 or \u2018opinion\u2019 creates an artificial distinction\u201d). \u201c[Tjestimony about the likely and unlikely causes of [a patient\u2019s condition] is factual information, albeit in the form of opinion.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The questioning of defendant at his deposition reasonably sought to ascertain defendant\u2019s opinion regarding the timing and cause of Mr. Parker\u2019s sepsis, two critical issues in the case. As the surgeon who performed both operations, defendant was arguably in the best position to make these determinations. From his operative report, it would appear that he did, in fact, make these determinations by diagnosing a \u201c[p]robable anastomotic leak[,]\u201d and his statement that he \u201cdid not want to take the chance the anastomosis was leaking and would cause further sepsis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">We. next address the trial court\u2019s determination to exclude defendant\u2019s deposition testimony regarding the cause of Mr. Parker\u2019s sepsis because it was \u201cspeculative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1) provides that a \u201cstatement offered against a party which is ... the party\u2019s own statement, made either in an individual or in a representative capacity,\u201d is not excluded by the hearsay rule. Nevertheless, testimony admissible under this rule is still subject to other restrictions. Biunno, Weissbard &amp; Zegas, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 1 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1) (2014) (\u201cNote that <em>[N.J.R.E.] </em>403 is not the exclusive means for excluding a statement admissible under <em>[N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1) ]. In appropriate cases other constitutional, statutory or rule requirements might preclude a statement admissible under this Rule.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>701 generally restricts the subject matter of lay witness testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>If a witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019 testimony in the form of opinions or inferences may be admitted if it (a) is rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) will assist in understanding the witness\u2019 testimony or in determining a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The question is thus whether <em>N.J.R.E. </em>701 restricts testimony-otherwise admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1). Our courts have not yet addressed this issue. Therefore, we look to federal precedent interpreting analogous provisions of the <em>Federal Rules of Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\"><em>F.R.E. </em>801(d)(2)(A) is the parallel provision to our <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1). It provides that a \u201cstatement ... offered against an opposing party[,] ... made by the party in an individual or representative capacity!,]\u201d is not hearsay. Thus, the substance of the provisions is essentially the same. Federal courts have addressed the interaction between the party-opponent rule and other provisions. The courts have specifically exempted statements under <em>F.R.E. </em>801(d)(2)(A) from the personal-knowledge requirement for testimony. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ammar, </em>714 F.2d 238, 254 (3d Cir.) (\u201c[I]t is dear from the Advisory Committee Notes that the drafters intended that the personal knowledge foundation requirement of <em>[F.R.E.] </em>602 should ... not [apply] to admissions ... admissible under <em>[F.R.E.] </em>801(d)(2).\u201d), cert. <em>denied, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>936, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>344, 78 L.Ed.2d 311 (1983); <em>Mahlandt v. Wild Canid Survival &amp; Research Ctr., Inc., </em>588 <em>F.</em>2d 626, 630-31 (8th Cir.1978) (holding that the personal knowledge requirement does not apply to <em>F.R.E. </em>801(d)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Additionally, statements by a party-opponent are not subject to trustworthiness considerations. \u201cTrustworthiness is not a separate requirement for admission under <em>[F.R.E.] </em>801(d)(2)(A).\u201d <em>Jewell v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>135 F.3d 361, 365 (6th Cir.1998); <em>accord United States v. Pinalto, </em>771 F.2d 457, 459 (10th Cir.1985). \u201cThe admissibility of statements of a party-opponent is grounded not in the presumed trustworthiness of the statements, but on \u2018a kind of estoppel or waiver theory, that a party should be entitled to rely on his opponent\u2019s statements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jewell, supra, </em>135 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>365 (quoting <em>United States v. DiDomenico, 78 </em>F.3d 294, 303 (7th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In <em>Donlin v. Aramark Carp., </em>162 <em>F.R.D. </em>149,150 (D.Utah 1995), the district court directly addressed the issue of speculation for party-opponent admissions, and found that \u201cthe fact that the statement is speculative or in opinion <em>form </em>is <em>not of </em>consequence. Personal knowledge of the witness is not required in a party admission circumstance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">This interpretation echoes 4 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 1053 (Chadbo\u00fcrn rev.1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">A primary use and effect of [a party] admission is to discredit a party\u2019s claim by exhibiting his inconsistent other utterances. It is therefore immaterial whether these other utterances would have been independently receivable as the testimony of a qualified witness____In particular, <em>personal knowledge, </em>as indispensable to a witness, is not required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\"><em>IIbid, </em>(emphasis in original) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-12\"><em>Wigmore </em>goes on to specifically address the lay opinion rule, saying that it \u201cdoes not limit the use of a party\u2019s admissions [because] [t]he reason for that rule does not apply to a party\u2019s admissions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1053(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">Thus, federal precedent supports the position that <em>N.J.R.E. </em>701 does not independently bar speculative testimony admitted under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1). Therefore, we conclude the trial court erred in excluding defendant\u2019s deposition testimony regarding the cause of Mr. Parker\u2019s sepsis on the basis that it was speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">We further note that the record does not provide any actual support that the deposition testimony was speculative. The court failed to hold a <em>Rule </em>104 hearing to explore the issue further. While it may be possible the testimony was speculative, the record lacks any evidence or convincing argument explaining how or why the testimony constituted speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">In summary, we conclude defendant\u2019s deposition testimony regarding the cause of Mr. Parker\u2019s sepsis is admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1). The statements were made by defendant, a party to the action, and were offered by plaintiff against him at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>trial. Plaintiffs question was not improper, and whether defendant was speculating when he answered is irrelevant to the statement\u2019s admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Next, we turn to the application of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403. The trial court\u2019s oral opinion on plaintiffs motion for new trial did not explicitly address <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403, but the court stated, \u201cI believe ... the statement by [defendant] was prejudicial and not probative, and that\u2019s why I excluded it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>403 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">[Rjelevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of (a) undue prejudice, confusion of issues, or misleading the jury or (b) undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Under this test, \u201c[e]vidence should be barred if its probative value \u2018is so significantly outweighed by [its] inherently inflammatory potential as to have a probable capacity to divert the minds of the jurors from a reasonable and fair evaluation of the basic issue[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>Green v.

Thompson, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>396, 421, 283 A.2d 513 (1971)). \u201cThe burden is clearly on the party urging the exclusion of evidence to convince the court that the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403 considerations should control.\u201d <em>Rosenblit v. Zimmerman, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>391, 410, 766 A.2d 749 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Due to the nature of the weighing test, highly prejudicial evidence may only be admitted if it has \u201coverwhelming probative worth.\u201d <em>Green, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 491, 734 A.2d 1147. However, \u2018\u201c[t]hat evidence is shrouded with unsavory implications is no reason for exclusion when it is a significant part of the proof.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>289, 308, 558 A.2d 833 (1989) (quoting <em>State v. West, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>327, 335, 149 A.2d 217 (1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">Moreover, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403 concerns only <em>undue </em>prejudice. <em>State v. Bowens, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>290, 297, 530 A.2d 338 (App.Div.1987). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u201cThe question ... is not merely whether the treating doctor[\u2019s] testimony [was] prejudicial[,] ... but whether it [was] unfairly so.\u201d <em>Stigliano, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 317, 658 A.2d 715. Generally, much of the evidence introduced at an adversarial trial is prejudicial to the opposing party, and we \u201cwould ill-serve the cause of truth and justice if we were to exclude relevant and credible evidence only because it might help one side and adversely affect the other.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Counsel is permitted to attack the credibility of a witness on cross-examination. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>611(b). \u201cCross-examination is the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u201d <em>State v. Silva, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>438, 444, 621 A.2d 17 (1993) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Any witness \u201cmay be cross-examined with a view to demonstrating the improbability or even fabrication of his testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 621 A.2d 17 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">A prior inconsistent statement may also be used to attack the credibility of a witness. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>607; <em>Silva, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 444-45, 621 A.2d 17; <em>State v. DiRienzo, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>360, 383, 251 A.2d 99 (1969). Deposition testimony of a witness may be used \u201cfor the purpose of contradicting or impeaching\u201d a witness at trial. <em>R. </em>4:16-l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Here, the fact that defendant testified at deposition consistent with his operative records but then testified differently at trial, attempting to discredit his own operative reports, clearly went to the issue of his credibility. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it did not allow plaintiffs counsel to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility with his prior inconsistent deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Defendant\u2019s deposition testimony strikes at the heart of this case. As a statement by the surgeon who actually performed the procedures and observed, first hand, Mr. Parker\u2019s condition, it carries compelling probative worth. <em>Stigliano, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 317, 658 A.2d 715 (\u201c[T]he probative value of the treating doctors\u2019 testimony outweighs its prejudicial effect under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>because of their first hand proximity to the patient\u2019s condition.). As the trial court noted concerning the expert witnesses here, \u201c[t]he people who articulate that there was an anastomotic leak were not in the surgery. And, really had no direct way of making that determination.\u201d Defendant, however, was necessarily present at the surgery, affording him the ability to make direct observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The existence of the anastomotic leak and its effect were the central issues at trial. While the statement is prejudicial, the <em>undue </em>prejudice to defendant is minimal because the statement at issue is his, rather than a third party\u2019s statement. \u201c[T]he party who made the out-of-court statement cannot complain of his [or her] inability to confront and cross-examine the declarant, since he [or she] is the declarant.\u201d Biunno et al., <em>supra, </em>comment 1 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Lastly, we must consider whether the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude defendant\u2019s deposition testimony was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust resultf.]\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The proofs in this case do not overwhelmingly favor one party or the other; hence, the improper exclusion of defendant\u2019s contradictory deposition testimony could have been the deciding factor in his favor. <em>Cf. State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 87, 727 A.2d 1 (1999) (noting that where credibility is the central issue and the \u201cjury must choose which of two opposing versions to credit, it simply cannot be said that the evidence is overwhelmingly]\u201d against one litigant or the other). The risk that the jury was improperly influenced by the trial court\u2019s exclusion of defendant\u2019s deposition testimony is particularly high here because defendant\u2019s credibility was central to the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Under the circumstances of this case, we are convinced that this error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result[.]\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. The excluded deposition testimony bore directly on the issue of defendant\u2019s negligence and thus could readily have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>outcome-determinative. Because the exclusion of this evidence could have affected the jury\u2019s determination of whether defendant was negligent, a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-14\"> According to defendant, invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon is a \"patho-logic diagnosis,\" which \"means the tumor has spread beyond the basic membrane of the lining of the intestine,\u201d creating \"a risk for it to ... further spread.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> According to plaintiff's surgical expert, David Befeler, M.D., \u201cdehiscence is a failure of the abdomen wall closure,\" meaning \"the abdominal wall comes apart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Essentially, what plaintiff urges \u2014 it converts [defendant] into an expert witness. It\u2019s asking him to render an opinion when, in fact, he\u2019s being called as a fact witness. Now we have a number of expert witnesses who have opined as to Mr. Parker\u2019s cause of death. ri]t\u2019s not really a <em>[N.J.R.E.] </em>701 [issue], where we\u2019re asking for opinion testimony of a lay witness because it\u2019s not [an] opinion as to ... how fast was he going in your common experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-15\">It\u2019s an opinion that requires expertise. The reality, it seems, is that the ... cause of death isn\u2019t so much the ultimate question here.... [T]he ultimate question is, whether or not [defendant] departed from the standard of care required of him. And I do think that it is asking for, again over the objection of [defendant\u2019s] attorney, for him to become an expert witness against himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b41-16\"> Defendant explained, \"when we externalize the colon, it\u2019s a colostomy, when we externalize the small bowel, it's an ileostomy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b42-14\"> According to defendant, \"Sepsis is an infection that causes systemic changes.\u201d Its symptoms are \"increased respiratory rate, an increased pulse, ... an elevated temperature and an elevated white [blood cell] count.\u201d Sepsis can be diagnosed by the presence of two such symptoms as well as a \"documented source of infection[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b43-18\"> The jury voted six to one that defendant did not deviate from accepted standards of care in his treatment of Mr. Parker.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
