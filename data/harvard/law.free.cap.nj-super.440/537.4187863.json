Miller, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>40, 62, 65, 76 A.3d 1250 (2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. de</em>nied,. \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 134 <em>S.Ct. </em>1329, 188 L.Ed.2d 339 (2014). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Defendant Gregory A. Martinez appeals from an order denying a trial adjournment in light of private counsel\u2019s scheduling conflict. Defendant argues the denial of the reasonable adjournment request infringed upon his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Following our review of the facts here presented, and guided by the framework for review set forth in <em>State v. Hayes, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>522, 16 A.3d 1028 (2011), we conclude the denial of defendant\u2019s request to adjourn trial, without weighing the facts presented supporting the adjournment request, reflects an arbitrary exaltation of expedience in case processing at the expense of defendant\u2019s right to counsel. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand the matter for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We recite limited facts regarding the circumstances of the alleged criminal offenses, concentrating instead on the facts surrounding defendant\u2019s adjournment request. Defendant and his codefendant were charged in a twelve-count indictment returned January 5, 2011, alleging they sold cocaine to an undercover police officer. The two were occupants in a car that was seized and impounded. A search of the car pursuant to a warrant, conducted approximately one week later, yielded in excess of five grams of cocaine. Codefendant admitted the cocaine was his. Defendant was charged with six drug offenses, including first-degree possession with intent to distribute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5(a)(l) and 2C:35-5(b)(1). He pled not guilty, asserting he had no knowledge the drugs were in the car. Ultimately, defendant hired private counsel (the partner) to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">On February 4, 2013, the trial judge held a pretrial conference. An associate employed by the partner\u2019s firm attended the conference and expressed his understanding the conference was, in part, to schedule a new trial date because it was believed everyone agreed the February 13, 2013 trial date would be adjourned. The associate explained his position, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">[TJhe last time that everybody was here, everybody, at least on the [diefense side, and ... I believe from the State side as well, thought that this ... court date today <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>would be to schedule a new trial date. They believed that the trial date was off because of [the partner]\u2019s trial schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">With that belief in mind, then when [the partner]'s other trial in front of Judge Nieves fell through, he scheduled something else for this week, because he believed that this trial was off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">As a result, he\u2019s in front of Judge Rebeck on a civil matter that started on Friday, continued into today and is going to continue into next week, at least Wednesday of this week, and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week, so he\u2019s not going to be available to try the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">I am, this is my first time appearing on the case, and I will be the one trying it if it goes next week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">I\u2019ve discussed this with my client and I can tell the [c]ourt that he\u2019s not happy about it. He wants [the partner] to be his trial lawyer, and I wanted the [c]ourt to be aware of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">For that reason, we are still asking ... the ... trial ... be adjourned in order for [the partner] to be available. And just to complete the record, as far as the hearing that he\u2019s involved with that\u2019s in front of Judge Rebeck who is retiring at the end of the month and needs to get this hearing done before he retires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">THE COURT: Okay. And I understand that. Certainly neither I nor my team leader told anyone involved in this case that this case was not going next week. In fact, this case has been on for quite awhile while. It\u2019s an older case on my list. I have put the time aside for it. And while I understood [the partner] maybe had another commitment in front of Judge Nieves, once that ease did not go forward, as often happens with criminal cases, then he was available for us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">Pe2'haps [the <em>partner] </em>should have someone else try the case in front of Judge Rebeck. I mean, I don\u2019t tell him how to manage his cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">I will say to [defendant] that [the associate] is a very experienced attorney who works with [the partner], and I know that he, based on our discussions in my chambers, is familiar with the case. Obviously, he is now going to continue preparing for the trial. But I certainly have confidence that he can handle this case and he understands the defense in this case and is prepared to proceed with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\">But [defendant], if you want to say anything, I\u2019ll give you that opportunity now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-14\">DEFENDANT: I\u2019m not in agreement with this. I want [the partner] to be my lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">The judge requested the partner come to the courthouse and instructed the parties to appear before the presiding Criminal Part judge to address the adjournment request. We have no record of that conference, except the associate\u2019s recitation on the first day of trial, when he again set forth defendant\u2019s objection to proceeding without the partner. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-16\">And after our conference, we went down to [the presiding judge] to explain the situation to him. [He] did not agree that the trial date should be moved. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ordered that the trial continue as scheduled here today, even though [the partner] was not going to be available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">In the meantime, I\u2019ve had opportunities to consult with my client. While he has been cooperative in preparing for trial with me, it is still his desire to have Tthe partner] be his trial attorney, and we want to place that on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">When asked by the trial judge, the associate admitted \u201cI have had time to prepare the case and I am ready to try the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AbY\">Trial commenced. After two days of deliberations, the jury convicted defendant on all but one charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">At sentencing, the partner appeared. Expressing his client\u2019s anger, he recited the events that led him to believe the initial trial date was adjourned. The partner explained during a January 3, 2013 conference,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he advised the court of a trial conflict, as he was given a firm date to commence an aggravated sexual assault trial before another Criminal Part judge the week before the scheduled date for trial in this matter. As he would be on his feet in that priority matter, a new trial date was requested. Counsel were advised to return on February 4 for a pretrial conference. Based on unforeseen events, trial of the priority case was adjourned on January 18. The partner called the prosecutor to discuss scheduling in this case and the prosecutor stated he understood a new date would be given and he already cancelled his witnesses. The partner was then scheduled to commence a civil matter, which began prior to February 4 and was to continue the week of February 11, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Rejecting counsel\u2019s request for a new trial, the trial judge recalled the prosecutor cancelled his witness, but stated \u201c[tjhere was never an official adjournment\u201d of the trial date and the presiding judge considered and denied the request. The judge also observed the associate \u201cput forth a defense in a vigorous way,\u201d represented defendant \u201cvery well,\u201d and she was satisfied defendant received a fair trial. The trial judge sentenced defendant and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Defendant\u2019s argument is straightforward. He asserts the denial of his adjournment request was an abuse of discretion that \u201cdenied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choosing.\u201d The State counters, arguing the contention must be rejected because defendant has not demonstrated such an alleged abuse of discretion caused him to suffer a \u201cmanifest wrong or injury.\u201d <em>See Hayes, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 537, 16 A.3d 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Although the denial of an adjournment request is reviewed under a deferential standard and \u201c\u2018broad discretion must be granted trial courts on matters of continuances,\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>at 65, 76 A.3d 1250 (quoting <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>1, 11, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1610, 1616, 75 L.Ed.2d 610, 620 (1983)), \u201c\u2018an unreasoning and arbitrary \u201cinsistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay\u201d violates the right to the assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Morris, supra, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>at 11-12, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1616, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 620).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In light of United State Supreme Court jurisprudence solidifying the principle that a non-indigent defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel encompasses the right to be represented by the counsel of his choosing, <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>140, 144, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2557, 2561, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>409, 416 (2006), our Supreme Court has underscored \u201c \u2018the trial court must strike a balance between its inherent and necessary right to control its own calendar and the public\u2019s interest in the orderly administration of justice, on the one hand, and the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to obtain counsel of his own choice, on the other.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Hayes, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 538, 16 A.3d 1028 (quoting <em>State v. Furguson, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 402, 487 A.2d 730 (App.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>266, 501 A.2d 933 (1985)). The principles guiding this inquiry include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">the length of the requested delay; whether other continuances have been requested and granted; the balanced convenience or inconvenience to the litigants, witnesses, counsel, and the court; whether the requested delay is for legitimate reasons, or whether it is dilatory, purposeful, or contrived; whether the defendant contributed to the circumstance which gives rise to the request for a continuance; whether the defendant has other competent counsel prepared to try the case, including the consideration of whether the other counsel was retained as lead or associate counsel; whether denying the continuance will result in identifiable prejudice to defendant\u2019s case, and if so, whether this prejudice is of a material or substantial nature; the complexity of the case; and other relevant factors which may appear in the context of any particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Furguson, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 402, 487 A.2d 730 (quoting <em>United States v. Burton, </em>584 A.2d 485, 490-91 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>1069, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>837, 59 L.Ed.2d 34 (1979))).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-8\"><em>See also Miller, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>at 47-48, 76 A.3d 1250 (adopting the standards recited in Hayes).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Before determining whether to grant or deny a trial adjournment because of counsel\u2019s unavailability, a trial judge shall engage in \u201c \u2018a balancing process informed by an intensely fact-sensitive inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>at 66, 76 A.3d 1250 (quoting <em>Hayes, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 538, 16 A.3d 1028). \u201cIf a trial court conducts a reasoned, thoughtful analysis of the appropriate factors, it can exercise its authority to deny a request for an adjournment to obtain counsel of choice.\u201d <em>State v. Kates, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>393, 396-97, 81 A.3d 662 (2014). However, the absence of this analysis results in a one-sided and, consequently, arbitrary determination. <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">In discussing this matter, the trial judge noted the age of the case and suggested counsel should have known better because \u201can official adjournment\u201d had not been issued. The import of such comments is a denial of the request. However, the trial judge referred the adjournment request to the presiding judge for consideration. <em>See R. </em>l:33-6(b) (providing the presiding judge of a unit \u201cshall be responsible for the expeditious processing to disposition of all matters filed within that unit\u201d). The lack of a record from this review precludes our assessment of what oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>curred. However, the State\u2019s argument does not support a conclusion the presiding judge undertook the necessary weighing of the relevant facts. Moreover, the reasons recited by the State on appeal, as support for what it believes was a reasoned exercise of discretion for the trial proceeding, address only calendar considerations, omitting any analysis of the <em>Furguson </em>factors, as mandated by <em>Hayes.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We may not speculate on possible reasons justifying the denial of the adjournment request; \u201c[i]t was incumbent upon the trial court to develop that record----\u201d <em>State v. Kates, </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>32, 53, 42 A.3d 929 (2012), <em>aff'd, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>393, 81 A.3d 662 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In the absence of the necessary factual analysis prior to the denial of an adjournment request to reschedule trial because of counsel\u2019s unavailability, an abuse of discretion results. In this matter, we conclude both reviewing judges failed to deliberately balance the competing interests and give weight to defendant\u2019s right to be represented by counsel of his choice. <em>See Kates, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>at 397, 81 A.3d 662 (\u201cThus, we underscore that only if a trial court summarily denies an adjournment to retain private counsel without considering the relevant factors, or abuses its discretion in the way it analyzes those factors, can a deprivation of the right to choice of counsel be found.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">When the right to counsel is wrongfully denied, it is not necessary to inquire as to effectiveness of counsel or whether defendant suffered actual prejudice in the ensuing proceedings. \u201cDeprivation of the right is <em>\u2018complete\u2019 when the </em>defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>wants, regardless of the quality of the representation he received.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>at 148, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2563, 165 L.Ed.2d at 419. <em>See also Kates, supra, </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 46, 42 A.3d 929 (acknowledging \u201cthe availability of \u2018other competent counsel\u2019 \u201d is a factor in the analysis, but is \u201cno substitute by itself for the constitutional right to choose counsel\u201d).
