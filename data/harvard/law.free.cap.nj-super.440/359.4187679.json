Plaintiff alleges that in or around December 2009, defendant conducted a promotion by which customers purchasing at least $75 of merchandise were given a $25 gift card for use in its stores and on its website. Plaintiff alleges that even though these transferable gift cards possessed \u201cno expiration date,\u201d defendant voided all outstanding cards on January 30, 2010. Plaintiff alleges a gift card, which stated it had \u201cno expiration date,\u201d was dishonored when presented by him at one of defendant\u2019s stores in New Jersey on January 22, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Claiming in-store signs during the promotion asserted that \u201c$25 gift card expires 1/30/10,\u201d but also acknowledging some cards expressly stated they had \u201cno expiration date,\u201d and others were silent in that regard, defendant admits that as January 30, 2010 approached it \u201csent emails to customers who had registered their email addresses to remind them of the upcoming expiration date.\u201d Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s factual assertions, we review an order granting class certification by according plaintiff \u201cevery favorable view\u201d of the complaint. <em>Iliadis v.

Kenny, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 179, 628 A.2d 1080 (App.Div.1993)). In <em>Varacallo v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 45, 752 A.2d 807 (App.Div.2000), we said that in the context of consumer transactions, \u201cclass actions should be liberally allowed ... under circumstances that would make individual actions uneconomical to pursue.\u201d In short, as the Court made clear in <em>Iliadis, </em>\u201ca class action \u2018should lie unless it is clearly infeasible.\u2019 \u201d 191 <em>N.J. </em>at 103, 922 A.2d 710 (quoting <em>Riley, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 225, 294 A.2d 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In addition to this liberal approach, courts tasked with determining whether a class should be certified must focus on the <em>Rule's </em>purposes, which our Supreme Court described in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">Unitary adjudication through class litigation furthers numerous practical purposes, including judicial economy, cost-effectiveness, convenience, consistent treatment of class members, protection of defendants from inconsistent obligations, and allocation of litigation costs among numerous, similarly-situated litigants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\"><em>[Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 104, 922 A.2d 710.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Of further importance is the Court\u2019s admonition that the decision to certify a class should be guided by the policy that favors an even playing field:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">In such disputes, where the claims are, in isolation, \u201ctoo small ... to warrant recourse to litigation,\u201d the class-action device equalizes the claimants\u2019 ability to zealously advocate their positions. That equalization principle \u201cremedies the incentive problem facing litigants who seek only a small recovery.\u201d [T]he class action\u2019s equalization function opens the courthouse doors for those who cannot enter alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>In re Cadillac V8-6-4 Class Action, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>412, 435, 461 A.2d 736 (1983) and <em>Muhammad v.

Bank of Rehoboth Beach, Del., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>1, 17, 912 A.2d 88 (2006), <em>certif. denied, </em>549 <em>U.S. </em>1338, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>2032, 167 L.Ed.2d 763 (2007)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In short, the class-action device\u2019s \u201c \u2018historic mission\u2019 \u201d is caring for \u201c \u2018the smaller guy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting Marvin E. Frankel, <em>Amended Rule 23 From a Judge\u2019s Point of View, </em>32 <em>Antitrust L.J. </em>295, 299 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">There is no doubt that the certified class in question consists of numerous individuals who have allegedly suffered small injuries. In his written opinion, the trial judge noted defendant\u2019s concession that \u201cover $3,000,000 worth of $25 gift cards were voided.\u201d In fact, there is no dispute that all requirements expressly mentioned in <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(a) \u2014 \u201cnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation,\u201d <em>Lee, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>at 519, 4 A.3d 561; <em>Cadillac, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 424-25, 461 A.2d 736 \u2014 are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Defendant nevertheless argues class certification should not have been permitted because of an element it claims is embedded in the <em>Rule\u2019s </em>interstices \u2014 ascertainability. This alleged implicit element, recognized by some federal courts in construing <em>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure </em>23, insists that \u201cthe class must be currently and readily ascertainable based on objective criteria.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Marcus v. BMW of N. Am., L.L.C., </em>687 F.3d 583, 593 (3d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In arguing the trial judge erred in granting class certification, defendant contends that the defined class<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cfails the ascertainability requirement and violates due process\u201d because defendant will have no ability \u201cto test class membership,\u201d because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u201cabsent class members\u201d will have no \u201copportunity to opt-out,\u201d and because the preclusive effect of any judgment will be unknowable and unenforceable. Defendant claims our courts have recognized this doctrine but, even if that were not so, we should now recognize and apply it. We disagree on both scores.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We conclude, as did the trial judge, that our courts have never viewed <em>Rule </em>4:32-1 as requiring that a class be \u201cascertainable\u201d as a condition for certification. Defendant\u2019s contrary argument relies on <em>Iliadis, </em>where, in a footnote, it is stated that class certification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">presupposes the existence of a properly defined class. Thus, \u201c[e]ven before one reaches the four prerequisites for a class action, there must be an adequately defined class.\u201d Richard L. Marcus &amp; Edward P. Sherman, <em>Complex Litigation: Cases and Materials on Advanced Civil Procedure </em>231 (4th ed. 2004). \u201c[T]he proposed class must be sufficiently identifiable without being overly broad. The proposed class may not be amorphous, vague, or indeterminate and it must be administratively feasible to determine whether a given individual is a member of the class.\u201d <em>White v. Williams, </em>208 <em>F.R.D. </em>123, 129 (D.N.J.2002) (quotations and internal citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\"><em>[Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 106 n. 2, 922 A.2d 710.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">This footnote, however, is inapposite. It simply emphasized the need for a clear <em>definition </em>of the contours of the class; it says nothing about whether the class members must be <em>ascertainable </em>before certification may be permitted. In fact, the word \u201cascertainable\u201d does not appear in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Those federal courts that found \u201cascertainability\u201d silently residing within <em>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure </em>23 so held because they believed this judge-made doctrine: \u201celiminates \u2018serious administrative burdens that are incongruous with the efficiencies expected in a class action\u2019 by insisting on the easy identification of class members\u201d; \u201cprotects absent class members by facilitating the \u2018best notice practicable\u2019\u201d required by federal rules; and \u201cprotects defendants by ensuring that those persons who will be bound by the final judgment are clearly identifiable.\u201d <em>Marcus, supra, </em>687 <em>F.Sd </em>at 593 (citations omitted). This \u201cascertainability\u201d doctrine, however, is different from the requirement that a class be properly defined, as the Third Circuit recognized when it later held that \u201cthe question of ascertainability\u201d in <em>Marcus </em>was \u201canalyzed ... separately from the question of whether the class was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>properly defined.\u201d <em>Shelton v. Bledsoe, </em>775 F.3d 554, 560 (3d Cir.2015). So, while defendant trumpets the <em>Iliadis </em>footnote as proof our Supreme Court adopted \u201cascertainability\u201d as a requirement for class actions commenced pursuant to our own <em>Rule, </em>in fact, the footnote\u2019s language is premised on the Court\u2019s examination of what is required to properly define a class without imposing on plaintiff the obligation of then showing that all class members are identifiable. Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the \u201cascertainability\u201d doctrine has already been recognized by our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We also dispense with the argument that we should hold the \u201cascertainability\u201d doctrine is implicitly contained within <em>Rule </em>4:32\u2014 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">First, as already observed, our Supreme Court has not recognized the doctrine despite discussing the requirements for class certifications at length in <em>Lee, Merck </em>and Iliadis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nothing in those decisions remotely suggests that anything other than the <em>Rule\u2019s </em>expressed requirements are relevant, and nothing in those decisions suggests the <em>Rule\u2019s </em>requirements are to be interpreted with anything other than liberality in favor of certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Second, federal experimentation with the ascertainability doctrine seems far from over and, indeed, this doctrinal wave may have broken before ever cresting. Only a few circuits have expressly adopted it,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Third Circuit, which produced the <em>Marcus/Hayes/Carrera </em>trilogy on which defendant relies,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>quite unsettled. For example, in a case decided after the trilogy, the court expressly held that \u201cascertainability is not a requirement for certification of a(b)(2)<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> class seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief.\u201d <em>Shelton, supra, </em>775 F.3d at 563. The final act of the trilogy \u2014 disagreement about rehearing en banc in <em>Carrera, supra, </em>727 F.3d 300, set forth in <em>Carrera v. Bayer Corp., </em>No. 12-2621, 2014 <em>WL </em>3887938, 2014 <em>U.S.App. LEXIS </em>15553 (3d Cir. May 2, 2014) \u2014 demonstrates further uncertainty about the scope and application of the doctrine in class actions brought pursuant to <em>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure </em>23(b)(3), the federal counterpart to <em>Rule </em>4:32 \u2014 1(b)(3), which applies here. And the rollback of the doctrinal wave may be seen in an even more recent opinion; in concurring in a judgment reversing an order that denied certification on ascertainability grounds, Circuit Judge Rendell observed that \u201cthe lengths to which the majority goes in its attempt to clarify what our requirement of ascertainability means, and to explain how this implicit requirement fits in the class certification calculus, indicate that the time has come to do away with this newly created aspect of Rule 23 in the Third Circuit.\u201d <em>Byrd v. Aaron\u2019s Inc., </em>784 F.3d 154, 172, 2015 <em>WL </em>1727613, at *12, 2015 <em>U.S.App. LEXIS </em>6190, at *39 (3d Cir.2015).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The concerns expressed by Circuit Judges Ambro and Rendell, in <em>Carrera </em>and <em>Byrd, </em>respectively, seem more in tune with our Supreme Court\u2019s description of the policies governing the class-action device in <em>Lee, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>at 517-21, 4 A.3d 561, <em>Merck, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 382-85, 929 A.2d 1076, and <em>Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. at </em>103-05, <em>922 A.2d </em>710, than those that generated the ascertainability doctrine. Indeed, their views are more in line with the guiding principle described by the Supreme Court of the United States. \u201cThe policy at the very core of the class action mechanism\u201d was the desire \u201cto overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights\u201d and the mechanism \u201csolves this problem by aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone\u2019s (usually an attorney\u2019s) labor.\u201d <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>591, 617, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>2231, 2246, 138 L.Ed.2d 689, 709 (1997) (quoting <em>Mace v. Van Ru Credit Corp., </em>109 F.3d 338, 344 (7th Cir.1997)). Accordingly, we agree with the concurring and dissenting judges in <em>Carrera </em>and <em>Byrd </em>that when the concept of ascertainability is applied inflexibly it becomes a device that serves to burden or eliminate nascent class actions without providing any societal benefit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We find that this federal doctrine as urged here imposes far too heavy a burden on class certification where the purported injuries to class members are so minimal as to preclude the likelihood they would be individually asserted. Although we have misgivings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>about the aseertainability doctrine\u2019s use at the certification stage in any class action, we decline to consider its application in cases other than those involving low value consumer class actions because of the concept\u2019s novelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Aseertainability, as defined by defendant, is particularly misguided when applied to a case where any difficulties encountered in identifying class members are a consequence of a defendant\u2019s own acts or omissions. Had defendant obtained the identities of consumers when giving out $25 gift cards, the problems it now offers as grounds for upending certification would not exist. Allowing a defendant to escape responsibility for its alleged wrongdoing by dint of its particular recordkeeping policies \u2014 an outcome admittedly un-troubling to some federal courts<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 is not in harmony with the principles governing class actions. <em>See Byrd, supra, </em>784 <em>F.</em>3d at 176, 2015 <em>WL </em>1727613, at *14, 2015 <em>U.S.App. LEXIS </em>6190, at *50 (Rendell, J., concurring) (recognizing that \u201c[wjithout the class action mechanism, corporations selling small-value items for which it is unlikely that consumers would keep receipts are free to engage in false advertising, overcharging, and a variety of other wrongs without consequence\u201d). In the final analysis, \u201caseertainability\u201d does not benefit the chief goal of our court rules \u2014 the fair and efficient administration of justice; the Third Circuit\u2019s experiences suggest the doctrine is practically unworkable in application and is being exploited by defendants in unsuitable cases to evade liability. <em>See Hughes v. Kore of Ind. Enter., Inc., </em>731 P.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir.2013) (recognizing that \u201cwhen what is small is not the aggregate but the individual claim ... that\u2019s the type of case in which class action treatment is most needfulf,]\u201d and emphasizing that a class action \u201chas a deterrent as well as a compensatory objective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In rejecting the applicability of the \u201cascertainability\u201d doctrine when certifying class actions when members are numerous consumers with small injuries, we are guided by the very reason the class-action mechanism was created. As Justice Albin expressed for the Court in <em>Lee:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">At times, a large number of individuals may have valid claims related to consumer fraud or some other wrong, but those claims in isolation are \u201ctoo small ... to warrant recourse to litigation.\u201d The perpetrator of that fraud or wrong also may be a corporate entity that wields enormous economic power. A class action permits \u201cclaimants to band together\u201d and, in doing so, gives them a measure of equality against a corporate adversary, thus providing \u201ca procedure to remedy a wrong that might otherwise go unredressed.\u201d In short, the class action is a device that allows \u201can otherwise vulnerable class\u201d of diverse individuals with small claims access to the courthouse. In addition, a class action furthers other policy goals, including \u201cjudicial economy,\u201d \u201cconsistent treatment of class membei's,\u201d and \u201cprotection of defendants from inconsistent [results].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">[ 203 <em>N.J. </em>at 517-18, 4 A.3d 561 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">As noted earlier, the class-action device was intended to empower \u201cthe smaller guy,\u201d <em>Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 104, 922 A.2d 710, who lacks either the incentive to sue for a small recovery or the strength to take on a corporate giant in litigation. This has been the predominant theme of all our Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in this field. We therefore decline the invitation to water down \u2014 if not eliminate \u2014 the availability of the class^action device to low-value consumers by appending an onerous requirement that serves no equitable purpose and cannot be located in <em>Rule </em>4:32-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Even if ascertainability was relevant to some degree at this stage and in this case, we would find it poses no obstacle to class certification.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defendant offers the specter of \u201cextensive and individualized fact-finding or \u2018mini-trials\u2019\u201d in identifying class members, or that membership might ultimately be determined solely on the basis of the purported member\u2019s \u201csay so.\u201d <em>Marcus, supra, </em>687 F.3d at 593-94. This seems to us at most a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>concern at the claims administration stage, not a ground for rejecting class certification. And even then, the argument does not pose a very compelling ground for decertification. <em>See lliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 117, 922 A.2d 710 (observing that \u201c[djenial of class status due to manageability concerns is disfavored and, \u2018in view of the public interest involved in class actions, should be the exception rather than the rule\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)). The record on appeal does not suggest that future identification problems cannot be overcome through the application of some ingenuity, if necessary. Instead, the record reveals that defendant identified and canceled over $3,000,000 worth of gift cards. Are not the many individuals still in possession of cancelled gift cards easily ascertainable? Is there a need for objective evidence other than a member\u2019s presentation of such a card? To be sure, the other part of the defined class \u2014 those individuals who discarded a $25 gift card \u201cbecause they were told that the cards expired or had been voided\u201d \u2014 may need to show more, perhaps through submission of an affidavit; it has not been shown, however, how such a process unfairly hampers the defense. <em>See Boundas v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores, Inc., </em>280 <em>F.R.D. </em>408, 417-18 (N.D.Ill.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">To demand more of plaintiff at this stage is to impose nothing other than an artificial barrier to the court\u2019s ability to render justice in a situation that suggests \u2014 in assuming, as we must,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the truth of plaintiffs allegations \u2014 that defendant defrauded or deprived thousands upon thousands of a benefit once extended. Consumers may very well have purchased more than $75 of defendant\u2019s merchandise because of the lure of a $25 gift card, and this bargain was arguably snatched away by defendant\u2019s unilateral cancellation of the gift card at a later date. The class-action device was created not only to allow compensation for such small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>wrongs but also to deter future wrongdoing in the marketplace. <em>Hughes, supra, </em>731 F.3d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The order granting class certification is affirmed and the matter remanded for further proceedings.

Accordingly, we will hereafter, as a general matter, liberally indulge applications for leave to appeal: (1) \u201cwhen a denial of class status effectively ends the case (because, say, the named plaintiff\u2019s claim is not of a sufficient magnitude to warrant the costs of stand-alone litigation)\u201d; (2) \"when the grant of class status raises the stakes of the litigation so substantially that the defendant likely will feel irresistible pressure to settle\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>and (3) when permitting leave to appeal \"will lead to a clarification of a fundamental issue of law.\" <em>Waste Mgmt.

The <em>Rule\u2019s </em>prohibition is based on the concept declared in the first sentence of <em>Rule </em>1:36-3 that \u201cunpublished opin-ionfs]\u201d are not to be cited because they are not precedential. Because decisions of the federal courts of appeals are not binding on this court regardless of whether they are published, <em>see In re Contest of Nov. 8, 2011, </em>210 <em>N.J. 29, 45, </em>40 A.3d 684 (2012), we do not interpret <em>Rule </em>1:36-3 as precluding our citation to unpublished opinions of the federal courts of appeals. Moreover, we cite to <em>Byrd </em>and <em>Carrera </em>not because we view them as either precedential or non-precedential but merely to shed light on a judicially-created doctrine that defendant believes should be transplanted in this jurisdiction.
