In light of COAH\u2019s inaction, Fair Share Housing Center (appellant) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed this appeal asking that we order COAH to adopt regulations and that we bar transfer of trust funds to the State pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-329.1 to -829.3 (the 2008 amendments) to the Fair Housing Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-301 to -329.19 (FHA), in the interim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the pendency of this appeal, we issued orders to fill gaps caused by COAH\u2019s inaction. More recently, despite recognizing the preference for an \u201cadministrative forum, and its special processes, for addressing constitutional affordable housing obligations,\u201d <em>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 and 5:97, </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>1, 4, 110 A.3d 31 (2015), our Supreme Court determined that because of COAH\u2019s chronic failure to adopt Third Round Rules, \u201cthere no longer exists a legitimate basis to block access to the courts,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 5,110 A.3d 31. In light of the Court\u2019s determination and COAH\u2019s abject failure to adopt the regulations required by the 2008 amendments, we now enjoin the seizure of any trust funds by COAH or the executive branch; the future disposition of the trust funds will be directed by our courts <em>on </em>a ease-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>We need not canvass the earlier proceedings in this appeal except to mention that circumstances required entry of orders on July 13, 2012, and June 6, 2013,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> dealing with the problems caused by the absence of regulations and the threat of seizure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, we focus on what lies at the heart of this appeal: the 2008 amendments to the FHA. These amendments include <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-329.2(a), which: first, declares that COAH \u201cmay authorize a municipality that has petitioned for substantive certification ... to impose and collect development fees from developers of residential property\u201d; second, provides that \u201c[a] municipality may not spend or commit to spend any affordable housing development fees ... without first obtaining [COAH\u2019s] approval of the expenditure\u201d; and, third, mandated that COAH \u201cshall promulgate regulations regarding the establishment, administration and enforcement of the expenditure of affordable housing development fees by municipalities.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Of critical importance, the Legislature provided that \u201call fees shall be committed for expenditure within four years from the date of collection,\u201d and that \u201c[a] municipality that fails to commit to expend the balance required in the development fee trust fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>by the time set forth in this section shall be required by the council to transfer the remaining unspent balance at the end of the four-year period to the \u2018New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund,\u2019 ... to be used in the housing region of the transferring municipality for the authorized purposes of that fund.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-329.2(d). These and other funds<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> would be deposited into a trust fund and accounted for separately and would also be subject to transfer to the State if not used within a four-year period, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">A municipality shall commit to expend collections from payments-in-lieu imposed pursuant to subsection a. of this section within four years of the date of collection. The council may extend this deadline if the municipality submits sufficient proof of building or other permits, or other efforts concerning land acquisition or project development. The council shall provide such administrative assistance as may be required to aid in the construction of affordable housing units. <em>A municipality that fails to commit to expend the amounts collected pursuant to this section within the timeframes established shall be required to transfer any unexpended revenue collected </em>pursuant to subsection a. of this section <em>to the \u201cNew Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund, </em>\u201d... to be used within the same housing region for the authorized purposes of that fund, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the council.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>52:27D-329.3(b) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In 2008, COAH\u2019s then-Executive Director Lucy Vandenberg wrote to all New Jersey mayors explaining these provisions and noting that COAH was authorized to promulgate regulations regarding the expenditure of development fees in the municipal trust funds. In 2012, Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Commissioner Richard E. Constable prepared amendments purporting to define when funds were considered to be expended or committed for expenditure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But regulations were never adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>and, in their absence, municipalities were left to try other less formal methods, without success, including an entreaty by one group of municipalities to the Governor regarding the uncertainty presented by the status quo. Those municipalities argued that, without a clear and present understanding about the meaning and scope of \u201ccommit to expend,\u201d they would be placed in the unhappy position of committing funds while remaining liable to reimburse from their own funds or by raising taxes if COAH later devised more stringent guidelines.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As the four-year deadline approached, legislation was proposed and passed to extend the four-year deadline for two years. On June 29, 2012, the Governor vetoed that legislation and, also, line-item-vetoed language in the 2012-2013 budget, adopted as <em>L. </em>2012, c. 18, which would have defined what funds were \u201ccommitted\u201d and therefore ineligible for transfer to the State. With that proposed definitional language excised, the 2012 budget bill as signed into law provided that an \u201camount not to exceed $200,000,000\u201d from the municipal affordable housing trust funds and transferred to the New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund as funds that have not been committed \u201cshall be deposited in the General Fund as State revenue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">No administration action regarding the needed regulations has occurred. It also does not appear that proceedings anticipated by a 2012 resolution adopted by COAH, or proceedings in the manner tailored by our interim orders in this appeal, have commenced or proceeded to completion. And COAH has not met since October 2014. <em>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 &amp; 5:97, supra, </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>11-12, 110 A.3d 31. Appellant seeks our intervention to relieve the uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">In explanation for its failure to adopt regulations, COAH claims no regulations are needed \u2014 that the 2008 amendments provide sufficient clarity. This is not a serious response to the problem at hand. The 2008 amendments required COAH to promulgate regulations to define when trust funds are \u201ccommitted.\u201d The statute did not say that COAH \u201cmay\u201d adopt regulations or that prior regulations were sufficient; the Legislature declared in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-329.2(a) that COAH \u201cshall\u201d promulgate regulations. COAH\u2019s own contemporaneous interpretation of the amendments, as noted earlier, revealed its understanding that new regulations were required. Its current contention \u2014 that by enacting the 2008 amendments the Legislature was not using a specialized term that needed regulatory definition and the new law set the \u201cgenerous but inflexible limitation\u201d requiring relinquishment of funds unspent or uncommitted within four years of collection\u2014 is unworthy of further discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E). The simple fact is that COAH has ignored the considered wisdom of our Legislature by failing to promulgate rules. The only legitimate debate concerns the road to now be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Although our authority to intervene has not been disputed, we nevertheless iterate what is well-established: we are empowered to review not just agency action but agency inaction, <em>Pascucci v. Vagott, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>40, 52, 362 A.2d 566 (1976); <em>Hosp. Ctr. at Orange v. Guhl, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 329, 751 A.2d 1077 (App.Div.2000), and, if necessary, prevent any resulting \u201cdenial of \u2018fundamental procedural fairness,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 333, 751 A.2d 1077 (quoting <em>In re Arndt, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>432, 436, 341 A.2d 596 (1975)). COAH has not acted as required by the Legislature, and the parties have been placed in a most uncertain position with respect to these funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The question then is whether we should fill this vacuum by interpreting the critical provisions of the 2008 amendments and imposing our own procedures for ascertaining when funds have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>been committed. Despite the need for our courts to step into the fray \u2014 because COAH stepped out \u2014 we remain mindful that \u201c[t]he judicial role here is not to become a replacement agency for COAH.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 &amp; 5:97, supra, </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>at 29, 110 A.3d 31. Instead, in resolving the problems caused by COAH\u2019s failures, our courts are required to resolve disputes and settle uncertainties in their usual manner and not in the manner in which administrative agencies may act. Accordingly, because of the lack of a factual record or a contested case, we reject the invitation to interpret the legislative intent embodied by the 2008 amendments or establish procedures for suits yet to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In adhering to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent determination, we conclude that interpretation and construction of the 2008 amendments and the application or disposition of the funds in question must also now be adjudicated in our courts. To be sure, this is not the most ideal circumstance; the parties\u2019 concern that inconsistent determinations may be made by different Mount-Laurel\u2014 designated judges in different locales is by no means illusory. Ultimately, however, erroneous or inconsistent rulings can be addressed by this court or the Supreme Court through the parties\u2019 resort to the appellate process; this method may be slower and less efficient than the administrative process, <em>see In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 &amp; 5:97, supra, 221 N.J. </em>at 3-4, 110 A.3d 31, but now, in light of the recent action taken by the Supreme Court\u2014 and barring a change in the status quo \u2014 the courts are the only available forum for addressing these matters. The issues raised in this appeal can no longer be left in COAH\u2019s moribund hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Absent some change in circumstances,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we enjoin COAH or any other part of the executive branch from engaging in any further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>attempt to seize affordable housing trust funds. The use and disposition of those funds will hereafter be decided, in the first instance, by <em>Mount Laurelr </em>\u2014 designated trial judges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">This remedy \u2014 compelled by COAH inaction and the logical application and import of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision\u2014 takes effect immediately; resort to the courts on the issues stemming from COAH\u2019s inaction in this regard is subject to the same timelines and parameters contained in the Supreme Court\u2019s March 10, 2015 order. Our prior orders in this appeal, which set forth an interim procedure for COAH\u2019s disposition of affordable housing trust funds, are vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">So ordered.
