Grasso (collectively \u201cdefendants\u201d), appeal the denial of their motion for summary judgment in a suit brought on behalf of then-minor plaintiff Rachel A. Parsons by her parents and guardians ad litem Howard and Michelle Parsons, who also sue on their own behalf. Because defendants are immune under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4, we must reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">For purposes of summary judgment only, the parties treat as fact the following allegations by plaintiffs. From the 2001/2002 school year through at least 2004, Rachel was a student at the Mullica Township Elementary School operated by the Board. During that time, Grasso was employed by the Board as a registered nurse (RN) and certified school nurse (CSN). As part of her duties, Grasso conducted a screening test for visual acuity on Rachel. Rachel failed the vision screening in her right eye, but Rachel\u2019s parents were not notified of this failure, and Rachel was not referred for further vision testing. Defendants did not provide Rachel\u2019s parents with the vision acuity test results from 2001/2002 until Rachel failed her next school vision screening in May 2004. The delay in notification resulted in a two-year delay in the diagnosis and treatment of Rachel\u2019s right eye amblyopia, and proximately caused the loss of sight in Rachel\u2019s right eye.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Plaintiffs allege defendants breached their duty to give notice of the test results under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(6). Plaintiffs filed a complaint in 2013, when Rachel was seventeen, seeking damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>for defendants\u2019 negligence and breach of duty under the Tort Claims Act (TCA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to 59:12-3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that they were immune under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4, and that Grasso was also immune under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-4.5. The trial court denied summary judgment by order and memorandum decision on August 22, 2014. We granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Summary judgment must be granted if the court determines \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46 \u2014 2(c); <em>accord Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Given the parties\u2019 agreement to the facts for purposes of the motion for summary judgment, the motion raised only a legal issue of whether defendants have statutory immunity. \u201cOur review of the meaning of a statute is <em>de novo, </em>and we owe no deference to the interpretative conclusions reached by the trial court.... \u201d <em>Wilson ex rel. Manzano v. City of Jersey City, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>558, 564, 39 A.3d 177 (2012). Moreover, \u201c[a] ruling on summary judgment is reviewed de novo. We thus \u2018apply the same standard governing the trial court,\u2019 and do not defer to the trial court\u2019s ... interpretation of \u2018the meaning of a statute....\u2019\u201d <em>Davis v. Brickman Landscaping, Ltd., </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>395, 405, 98 A.3d 1173 (2014) (citations omitted). We must hew to that standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">We first address defendants\u2019 claim that Grasso is immune under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-4.5. This requires consideration of the statutes and regulations requiring the visual acuity test.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In 1967, the Legislature enacted the current \u201cEducation\u201d title. <em>L. </em>1967, c. 271. In the subtitle governing the conduct of schools, it included a chapter entitled \u201cHealth Promotion and Disease Prevention.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40. In that chapter, the Legislature included <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-4, which provides that a nurse or other health care personnel \u201cshall examine every pupil to learn whether any physical defect exists.\u201d \u201cThe frequency and procedure of and selection of pupils for examinations shall comply with the rules of the State board.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Under the regulations subsequently promulgated by the State Board of Education, \u201c[ejaeh district board of education shall ensure that students receive health screenings.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k). In particular, \u201c[s]creening for visual acuity shall be conducted biennially for students in kindergarten through grade 10.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(2). \u201cScreenings shall be conducted by a school physician, school nurse, or other school personnel properly trained.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(5). \u201cThe school district shall notify the parent of any student suspected of deviation from the recommended standard.\u201d <em>N.J AC. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">In 1978, the Legislature passed \u201cAN ACT concerning the examination of pupils for the condition known as scoliosis,\u201d the abnormal curvature of the spine (Scoliosis Act). <em>L. </em>1978, c. 97, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, codified at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:4(M.3 to -4.5. The Scoliosis Act required biennial examinations for scoliosis by \u201ca school physician, school nurse, physical education instructor or other school personnel.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-4.3; <em>see N.JAC. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(4). The final section of the Scoliosis Act provided that \u201c[n]o action of any kind in any court of competent jurisdiction shall lie against any physician, school nurse, physical education instructor or other school personnel by virtue of the provisions of <em>this act.\u201d L. </em>1978, c. 97, \u00a7 3, codified at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-A.5 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The natural reading of \u201cthis act\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-4.5 refers to the Scoliosis Act of which it is a part. Nonetheless, defendants argue <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:40-4.5 immunized Grasso for performing an examination under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-4. However, as noted above, <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:40-4 was enacted eleven years earlier, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>entire Education title. Defendants\u2019 argument would require us to read <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:40-4.5 as immunizing all \u201cschool personnel\u201d from any \u201caction of any kind in any court of competent jurisdiction\u201d for any violation of the entire Education title. We see no indication that the Legislature intended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-4.5 to extend that far, or indeed anywhere beyond the Scoliosis Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Thus, we agree with the trial court that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-4.5 provides immunity only against actions brought \u201cby virtue of the provisions of\u2019 the Scoliosis Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-4.3 to -4.5. It does not immunize Grasso for her conduct under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40-4 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(2) and (6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">We next address defendants\u2019 claim that they are immune under <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:6A, of the TCA. In 1972, the Legislature adopted the TCA, \u201cwhich reestablished the rule of immunity for public entities and public employees, with certain limited exceptions.\u201d <em>Marcinczyk v. State Police Training Comm\u2019n, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>586, 594-95, 5 A.3d 785 (2010); see <em>L. </em>1972, c. 45. The TCA \u201cdeclared to be the public policy of this State that public entities shall only be liable for their negligence within the limitations of this act and in accordance with the fair and uniform principles established herein.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:1-2. \u201cPublic entity\u201d includes any \u201cdistrict, public authority, public agency, and any other political subdivision or public body in the State,\u201d including the Board here. <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:1-3. Under the TCA, \u201cimmunity for public entities is the general rule and liability is the exception.\u201d <em>Kemp by Wright v. State, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>294, 299, 687 A.2d 715 (1997); <em>accord D.D. v. Univ. of Med. &amp; Dentistry of N.J., </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>130, 134, 61 A.3d 906 (2013) (describing that rule as \u201cthe \u2018guiding principle\u2019 of the [TCA]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The Supreme Court in <em>Kemp </em>found that <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 of the TCA is consistent with that policy,\u201d because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 establishes a \u201cgeneral rule of absolute immunity.\u201d <em>Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 300, 687 A.2d 715. <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:6-4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">Except for an examination or diagnosis for the purpose of treatment, neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for injury caused by the failure to make a physical or mental examination, or to make an adequate physical or mental examination, of any person for the purpose of determining whether such person has a disease or physical or mental condition that would constitute a hazard to the health or safety of himself or others. For the purposes of this section, \u201cpublic employee\u201d includes a private physician while actually performing professional services for a public entity as a volunteer without compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The Court stated that <em>\u201cN.J.S.A </em>59:6-4 can be divided into two sections.\u201d <em>Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 300, 687 A.2d 715. \u201cThe first section provides absolute immunity for the failure to perform an adequate examination \u2018for the purpose of determining whether [a] person has a disease or physical or mental condition that would constitute a hazard to the health or safety of himself or others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:6 \u2014 4). \u201cThe second section establishes an exception to the general rule of absolute immunity if the examination is \u2018for the purpose of treatment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Here, it is undisputed that the health screening of Rachel for visual acuity was not made \u201cfor the purpose of treatment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4. Rather, it was made \u201cfor the purpose of determining whether [she had] a disease or physical or mental condition that would constitute a hazard to [her] health or safety.\u201d <em>Ibid. N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 \u201cprovides absolute immunity\u201d regarding examinations for that purpose. <em>Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 300, 687 A.2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Defendants therefore contend they are immune under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4. Plaintiffs offer several arguments why that section should not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">First, plaintiffs contend that the health screening of Rachel was not \u201ca physical or mental examination.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6 \u2014 4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The TCA does not define that phrase, but the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 gives examples illustrating what the phrase includes. The 1972 <em>Report of Attorney General\u2019s Task Force on Sovereign Immunity</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>accompanied the draft legislation that was adopted as the TCA. <em>Del Tufo v. Twp. of Old Bridge, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 323, 650 A.2d 1044 (App.Div.1995), <em>aff'd, </em>147 <em>N.J </em>90, 685 A.2d 1267 (1996). The Report included a portion reprinted as the Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4. <em>See Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 302, 687 A.2d 715. The Comment states that \u201c[t]he immunity granted [by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4] pertains to the failure to perform adequate public health examinations, such as public tuberculosis examinations, physical examinations to determine the qualifications of boxers and other athletes, and eye examinations for vehicle operator applicants.\u201d Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4. The Supreme Court in <em>Kemp </em>explained that \u201c[although the examples listed in the Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 were not intended to be exclusive, their general descriptions must be construed to embrace only other illustrations that are similar in nature to those enumerated.\u201d <em>Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 303, 687 A.2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">By that measure, visual acuity screenings for students are \u201cpublic health examinations.\u201d Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4. They are similar in nature to \u201cpublic tuberculosis examinations\u201d and \u201ceye examinations for vehicle operator applicants,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>because they are \u201cconducted for diagnostic purposes only\u201d and, \u201c[o]nce the examination ... is complete, the public entity takes no further action of a medical nature,\u201d <em>Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 303, 687 A.2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Further, when <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-1 was amended in 1983, <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cthe statement of the Senate Labor, Industry and Professions Commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tee which accompanied the amendment noted that the immunity granted by the statute \u2018pertains to the failure to perform adequate public health examinations, such as tuberculosis, scoliosis, hearing, eye, mental, and other examinations for public health purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Del Tufo, supra, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 323, 650 A.2d 1044; <em>see Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 302, 687 A.2d 715 (citing <em>Senate Labor, Indus. &amp; Professions Comm. Statement, </em>No. 524, <em>L. </em>1983, c. 184). Here, the visual acuity screenings were eye examinations for public health purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Such examinations may be performed by a school. Indeed, <em>Kemp </em>involved a high school\u2019s pre-vaccination screening examination of students and resulting vaccination for measles. <em>Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 297-98, 687 A.2d 715. The Supreme Court stated that \u201c[i]f the purpose of the screening examination was to inform [the student] whether she had measles, such an examination would have been similar to testing for tuberculosis or visual fitness to operate a motor vehicle, and would fit perfectly into the group of public health examinations articulated in the Comment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 687 A.2d 715.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, the purpose of the visual acuity screening was simply to inform Rachel\u2019s parents if she had vision problems, and the screening thus \u201cfit perfectly into the group of public health examinations articulated in the Comment.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Plaintiffs argue that a visual acuity screening is not a physical examination under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16 and the Mullica Township Board of Education\u2019s regulations. However, those regulations by the State Board of Education and by Mullica Township have nothing to do with the TCA. Those regulations cannot determine, limit, or redefine the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the TCA in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>1972. They cannot dictate what examinations the Legislature intended to encompass within the immunity granted by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Plaintiffs stress that those regulations specify what type of health care professional can perform certain physical examinations, and do not include an RN or CSN such as Grasso. However, immunity does not turn on the type of license possessed by the \u201cpublic employee\u201d tasked with performing a physical examination. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4. Under the TCA, \u201c \u2018[p]ublic employee\u2019 means an employee of a public entity,\u201d and \u201c \u2018[ejmployee\u2019 includes an officer, employee, or servant, whether or not compensated or part-time, who is authorized to perform any act or service.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-3. It is undisputed that Grasso was authorized to perform the visual acuity screenings. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(5), -2.3(b)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the visual acuity screening here was a physical examination under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Plaintiffs also argue that even if <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 immunizes the \u201cscreening for visual acuity\u201d required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(2) as a physical examination, it does not immunize the failure to \u201cnotify the parent of any student suspected of deviation from the recommended standard\u201d under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(6). They assert their claim addresses only the failure to give notice of the examination results, and does not claim a \u201cfailure to make a physical or mental examination, or to make an adequate physical or mental examination.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">In common experience, physical examinations involve a three-step process: arranging to have an examination; conducting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>examination; and reporting the results of the examination. The exception plaintiffs seek to carve out of <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:6 \u2014 1 would excise from such examinations their necessary concluding step. This is illustrated by the examples given in the legislative history. \u201c[PJublic tuberculosis examinations\u201d would be of little use if the examiner kept the results to herself. Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4. \u201c[Pjhysical examinations to determine the qualifications of boxers and other athletes, and eye examinations for vehicle operator applicants,\u201d are followed by notification to the athletes or applicants of whether they are qualified. <em>Ibid. </em>A physical or mental examination which fails to communicate or inadequately communicates the results is not \u201can adequate physical or mental examination.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Plaintiffs contend that in the Comment\u2019s examples, the examiner presumably directly notifies the person examined, who is an adult or, for driver\u2019s license applicants, at least sixteen years old. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:21-7.1. Plaintiffs note that Rachel was in kindergarten, and that <em>N.J.A.C. 6A</em>:16-2.2(k)(6) requires \u201c[t]he school district shall notify the parent of any student suspected of deviation from the recommended standard.\u201d However, the identity of the persons giving and receiving notification under the regulation does not alter the integral role of notification to the adequacy of the examination. Plaintiffs assert that the regulation makes the examination and the notification two separate events, but it does not sever the inexorable connection between making and communicating the diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Severing that connection would create an anomaly for the person examined. Under plaintiffs\u2019 reading, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 would immunize the public entity and public employee for the failure to make an examination to detect the hazardous condition, and for the failure to diagnose the hazardous condition in an examination, but leave the public entity and public employee wholly liable for failure to communicate the result of the examination. The interests of the person examined do not justify such a distinction. Each failure would leave them just as ignorant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>hazardous condition. The resulting injury and damages are the same for each failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Such an exception also would not serve the goals of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4. Its provision of immunity encourages public health examinations. Public entities might not undertake such examinations if the public entities risked exposure to potentially substantial liability. If school boards could be found liable for the full damages from any hazardous condition they failed to communicate or to communicate adequately, the boards would be reluctant to conduct such public health examinations. The Legislature and State Board of Education would be similarly reluctant to compel the boards do so. To encourage public health examinations, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 was intended to provide \u201cabsolute immunity,\u201d <em>Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 300, 687 A.2d 715, not partial immunity that omits one step of a three-step process.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Accordingly, we hold that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4\u2019s immunity covering the \u201cfailure ... to make an adequate physical and mental examination\u201d includes the failure to provide adequate notification of the examination results. It thus covers failure to comply with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(6)\u2019s requirement that \u201c[t]he school district shall notify the parent of any student suspected of deviation from the recommended standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Plaintiffs primarily assert that such notification is a ministerial act, not a discretionary act. Based on that premise, they conclude the public entity and public employee are liable under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3 and 59:3-2, respectively. The trial court apparently agreed, citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-2 in ruling that the TCA \u201cdoes not provide immunity for Ms. Grasso\u2019s conduct.\u201d We accept plaintiffs\u2019 premise, but not their conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">\u201c[A] ministerial act is \u2018one which a person performs in a given state of facts in a prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety of the act being done.\u2019 \u201d <em>S.P. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Newark Police Dep\u2019t., </em>428 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 231, 52 A.3d 178 (App.Div.2012). We agree that notification here was a ministerial rather than a discretionary act. By providing that the school district \u201cshall notify the parent of any student suspected of deviation from the recommended standard,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k)(6) gave the school district no discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">However, plaintiffs\u2019 argument contravenes the structure, language, and intent of the TCA, which allows ministerial acts to be immunized by specific provisions like <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4. We first examine the general provisions of the TCA in chapters two and three.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Chapter two of the TCA addresses generally the liability and immunity of public entities. \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by this act, a public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-l(a). The TCA provides that \u201c[a] public entity is hable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of a public employee within the scope of his employment in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-2(a). However, \u201c[a]ny liability of a public entity established by this act is subject to any immunity of the public entity.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Chapter three of the TCA addresses generally the liability and immunity of public employees. \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by this act, a public employee is liable for injury caused by this act or omission to the same extent as a private person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-1(a). However, \u201c[t]he liability of a public employee established by this act is subject to any immunity of a public employee provided by law.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In chapters two and three, general provisions immunize \u201c[d]is-cretionary activities.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3, 59:3-2. Those sections declare that a public entity or a public employee \u201cis not liable for an injury resulting from the exercise of judgment or discretion vested\u201d in the entity or the employee, respectively. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>3(a), 59:3-2(a). However, those sections provide that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall exonerate a public entity [or a public employee] for negligence arising out of acts or omissions ... in carrying out ... ministerial functions.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:2-3(d), 59:3-2(d). Thus, when no provision of the TCA other than <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3 or 59:3-2 could provide immunity, \u201c[t]he standard for liability under the TCA depends on whether the conduct of individuals acting on behalf of the public entity was ministerial or discretionary.\u201d <em>Henebema v. S. Jersey Transp. Auth., </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>481, 490, 99 A.3d 336 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Importantly, <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:2-3(d) and 59:3-2(d) each provide only that \u201c[n]othing <em>in this section\u201d </em>shall immunize ministerial functions. (Emphasis added.) Thus, those sections in no way prevent immunity from being granted by other sections of the TCA. Moreover, chapter two and chapter three both provide that their general allocation of immunity and liability governs \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by this act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-l(a), 59:3-l(a). Chapter two and chapter three also provide that any liability of a public entity or a public employee \u201cestablished by this act is subject to any immunity\u201d of the public entity or public employee provided by law. <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:2-1(b), 59:3-1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\"> Therefore, \u201c[a]lthough a public entity is generally liable for the ordinary negligence of its employees in performance of ministerial duties, that liability yields to a grant of immunity.\u201d <em>Pico v. State, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>55, 62, 560 A.2d 1193 (1989) (citations omitted); <em>see Rochinsky v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>399, 412, 541 A.2d 1029 (1988). Both this court and the Supreme Court have ruled that \u201cacts of negligence, both discretionary and ministerial, ... even if not immunized by the general sections conferring entity immunity (sections 2-2 and 2-3), [may] be immunized under the specific provisions\u201d of the TCA. <em>Tice v. Cramer, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>347, 364-65, 627 A.2d 1090 (1993); <em>see, e.g., Malloy v. State, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>515, 520, 388 A.2d 622 (1978); <em>S.P., supra, </em>428 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 233, 52 A.3d 178. Where a section of the TCA provides absolute immunity, \u201cit immunizes absolutely all negligence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>public entity or the public employee,\u201d regardless of \u201cwhether the negligence is discretionary or ministerial.\u201d <em>Tice, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 367, 627 A.2d 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Kemp </em>addressed these precepts with respect to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6^4. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he TCA includes both general provisions concerning immunity and liability, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-2, and specific provisions that govern in particular factual contexts.\u201d <em>Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 307, 687 A.2d 715 (citing <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:6-1 to 6-7 (\u201cMedical, Hospital and Public Health Activities\u201d)). The Court cited <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:6-4 as an example of a specific provision which provides immunity for ministerial acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">[W]here the Legislature saw fit to confer absolute immunity for ministerial acts, it also did so in specified contexts. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A 59:6-f (providing absolute immunity in the context of examination for public health purposes).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 310, 687 A.2d 715.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">The Court thus indicated that the specificity of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 trumped the generality of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3 and 59:3-2. This view follows the \u201cwell-established rule that where two statutes appear to be in conflict, and one is general in nature and the other specific, the conflict is resolved in favor of the more specific statute \u2018as a more precise manifestation of legislative intent.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Gerald, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>40, 83, 549 A.2d 792 (1988). Moreover, if a specific immunity provision\u2019s \u201cmeaning were limited to discretionary governmental acts, the entire provision would be surplus-age, as <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3(a) ] immunizes a public entity from liability for discretionary activities.\u201d <em>Malloy, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 520, 388 A.2d 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Moreover, reading <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 to immunize all aspects of public health examinations, whether discretionary or ministerial, comports with its unqualified plain language. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 specifically provides absolute immunity for \u201cfailure to make a physical or mental examination, or to make an adequate physical or mental examination.\u201d It provides no exception for ministerial acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Furthermore, as set forth above, such an interpretation better serves <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4\u2019s goal to encourage such examinations than would a construction that failed to immunize all three steps of the examination process. Additionally, reading <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4 as immunizing only discretionary acts would cause contradictions with its plain language. For example, its language immunizing \u201cthe failure to make a physical or mental examination\u201d would dictate immunity, while a ministerial acts exception would call for liability where such an examination is required, as here. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:16-2.2(k) (\u201cEach district board of education shall ensure that students receive health screenings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">By contrast, applying <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:6-4\u2019s plain language providing absolute immunity effectuates the intent of the TCA. \u201c[T]he Legislature intended public entities to receive broad immunity protection under the\u201d TCA, and thus \u201can immunity provision of the Act will trump an applicable liability provision.\u201d <em>Ogborne v. Mercer Cemetery Corp., </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>448, 459, 963 A.2d 828 (2009); <em>see Tice, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 355, 627 A.2d 1090. Courts must \u201crecognize[ ] the precedence of specific immunity provisions,\u201d and ensure \u201cthe liability provisions of the Act will not take precedence over specifically granted immunities.\u201d <em>Weiss v. N.J. Transit, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>376, 380, 608 A.2d 254 (1992). To \u201crule otherwise would be to ignore what is probably the clearest and most important command of the [TCA], namely, that the immunities set forth in the [TCA] prevail over any liabilities.\u201d <em>Tice, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 370-71, 627 A.2d 1090 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-1(b) and 59:3-1(b)). \u201cA contrary conclusion could be reached only by ignoring the language of the statute, the holdings of the cases [above], and the basic policy of the Tort Claims Act.\u201d <em>Sczyrek v. Cnty. of Essex, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>235, 245, 735 A.2d 33 (App.Div.1999), <em>certif. denied, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>75, 747 A.2d 284(2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">We recognize certain provisions in the TCA have been held not to grant immunity to ministerial acts. We held <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:7-2 does not immunize ministerial acts because the Comment stated that chapter seven \u201c \u2018confers immunity upon public employees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>public entities for their <em>discretionary acts </em>in the administration of the tax laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tontodonati v. City of Paterson, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>475, 482, 551 A.2d 1046 (App.Div.) (quoting Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:7-3), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>35, 563 A.2d 808 (1989). We also have held <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-4 does not immunize ministerial acts by police officers, because of a similar Comment, and because the section gave no indication it was making a \u201cmajor change in prior law,\u201d which had provided for liability. <em>Suarez v. Dosky, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 8-10, 407 A.2d 1237 (App.Div.1979), <em>certif. denied, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>300, 412 A.2d 806 (1980).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, no prior law or Comment calls for liability in contravention of the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Our \u201cconclusion is consistent with California precedents interpreting California\u2019s comparable statute[,] <em>Cal. Gov\u2019t Code </em>\u00a7 855.6 (West 1996),\u201d which in its text and its comment \u201cis virtually identical to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:64.\u201d <em>Kemp, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 304, 687 A.2d 715. \u201cBecause our TCA was patterned after the California Tort Claims Act of 1963, reference to California precedents interpreting section 855.6 is appropriate.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Our Court has stressed that \u201cthe interpretations of the California statute by its judiciary, both before and after our Legislature\u2019s enactment of the Tort Claims Act,\u201d are \u201cparticularly significant to our interpretation of the [TCA].\u201d <em>Tice, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 361-62, 627 A.2d 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In <em>Creason v. Department of Health Services, </em>18 <em>Cal. </em>4th 623, 76 Cal.Rptr.2d 489, 957 P.2d 1323, 1325 (1998), the plaintiffs claimed that the public entity violated a \u201cmandatory duty with respect to its development of appropriate testing and reporting procedures\u201d in a program screening newborns for hereditary disorders. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>California Supreme Court held that even if the public entity making a physical examination fails to carry out a mandatory statutory duty which is not immunized by California\u2019s general discretionary immunity statute, \u201csection 855.6 provides specific immunity\u201d to non-discretionary acts. <em>Id,, </em>76 Cal.Rptr.2d 489, 957 P.2d at 1331. \u201cIf a specific immunity statute applies, it \u2018cannot be abrogated by a statute which simply imposes a general legal duty or liability!.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Barner v. Leeds, </em>24 Cal.4th 676, 102 Cal.Rptr.2d 97,13 P.3d 704, 711 (2000) (noting that if section 855.6 only immunized acts of discretion also covered by California\u2019s general discretionary immunity statute, \u201cthe additional immunity set forth in section 855.6 would have been unnecessary\u201d). The Court concluded that immunity was required by the public policy underlying \u00a7 855.6 and its comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201cTo provide the utmost public protection, public entities should not be dissuaded from engaging in such activities by the fear that liability may be imposed if an employee performs his duties inadequately. Far more persons would suffer if government did not perform these functions at all than would be benefited by permitting recovery in those cases where the government is shown to have performed inadequately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\"><em>[Creason, supra, </em>76 Cal.Rptr.2d 489, 957 P.2d at 1332.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">We are mindful of the serious allegation here that Rachel lost her sight in one eye because of defendants\u2019 negligence in failing to perform a ministerial act.
