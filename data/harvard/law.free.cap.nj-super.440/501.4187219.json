We reverse and remand to the Commissioner to explicitly decide those legal defenses that the Commissioner does not expressly delegate to the statutorily-mandated arbitrator to decide. The Commissioner must also inform the arbitrator what legal standards to utilize, after which the arbitrators must review the facts anew within this legal framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">We first discuss the factual situation of each teacher. We then review the common statutes that apply to both matters, and the reasons why we are compelled to remand to the agency to determine in the first instance those issues implicating policy considerations and statutory interpretation in the educational context.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">\n<em>The Chavez matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">At the time of the arbitrator\u2019s decision in February 2013, Chavez had been employed by defendant, the State-operated school district of the City of Newark,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or its predecessor the Board of Education of Newark, for approximately twenty years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>eighteen of which were spent successfully teaching math and other subjects in the adult education/GED<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> program. In August 2010, after that program was cancelled, Chavez was assigned to teach sixth grade math using a math curriculum he had not previously taught. Chavez holds an Instruction Certif\u00edcate with an Elementary Teacher (K-8) endorsement and has passed the National Teacher\u2019s Examination in math.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The school principal anticipated that it would take a few months for Chavez to transition to teaching sixth graders. Over the course of the next two school years, Chavez was provided with numerous teaching supports, including ongoing in-class assistance from a technology coordinator during the first year and a math coach for both years, as well as help from the vice principal to assist him in modifying the behavior of disruptive children in his class.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In spite of the ongoing support provided, Chavez was unable to adjust satisfactorily to the change in teaching assignment. He received negative memoranda from school administrators, including letters of reprimand and a letter of warning concerning his lack of classroom management skills, setting forth two incidents where he failed to follow proper reporting procedures when students were injured in his classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">During this two-year time period, teachers were evaluated using a scale in which they were rated either \u201cdistinguished,\u201d \u201cproficient,\u201d \u201cbasic,\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d For the school years 2010-2011 and 2011-2012, despite the ongoing support and feedback, Chavez received a rating of \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">In March 2012, Chavez was notified that defendant intended to file tenure inefficiency charges, and he was given a ninety-day improvement plan, as required by the then-existing provision in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-11. After Chavez failed to demonstrate improve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ment, tenure charges were filed in July and certified by the Commissioner of Education in September 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">At the subsequent arbitration hearing, undertaken pursuant to the recently enacted Teacher Effectiveness and Accountability for the Children of New Jersey Act (TEACHNJ), the arbitrator based his review on whether defendant\u2019s findings were true, reasoning that 1) matters were referred to arbitration only after the Commissioner of Education reviewed the tenure charges and deemed them sufficient, if true, to warrant dismissal; and 2) TEACHNJ arbitration review criteria were inapplicable because they were based on a new teacher evaluation rubric that had not yet been implemented. By statute, the new evaluation rubric was to be adopted by December 31, 2012 and implemented in the 2013-2014 school year. Looking at the factual merits of the case, the arbitrator noted that defense witnesses were credible, \u201cextraordinary efforts\u201d had been undertaken to help Chavez succeed, and no animus was directed toward him by defendant. Chavez\u2019s discharge was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">At the subsequent appeal to the trial court, Chavez argued that the arbitrator \u201cviolated the law by not reviewing or even considering\u201d his legal defenses. The trial court upheld the arbitrator\u2019s decision, finding that the arbitrator correctly analyzed which provisions of TEACHNJ he was to apply. The trial court also found \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the record, and that it was \u201creasonably debatable\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the arbitrator had fulfilled his task <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to decide whether or not the tenure charges were appropriate and true.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>The Pugliese matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Pugliese also seeks reversal of the same trial court\u2019s September 2013 confirmation of a different arbitrator\u2019s decision in which she was dismissed from her tenured teaching position. Pugliese was employed by defendant from 2004-2013. She has an undergraduate degree in sociology and a master\u2019s degree as a reading specialist. She holds an elementary certification and is \u201chighly qualified\u201d to teach language arts literacy. Beginning in the school year 2010-2011, Pugliese was reassigned from teaching reading to small groups of students to teaching large social studies classes for grades five through eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">As with Chavez, at the time of her reassignment, teachers were evaluated using a scale in which they were rated either \u201cdistinguished,\u201d \u201cproficient,\u201d \u201cbasic,\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d For the school years 2010-2011 and 2011-2012, Pugliese received a rating of \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d respectively. Pugliese received services to help rectify identified problems, but did not improve. In addition, numerous memoranda, some pre-dating her reassignment, chronicled ongoing classroom management issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In March 2012, tenure charges alleging inefficiency were filed against her. In her answer, Pugliese asserted that defendant could not claim that she was inefficient in a position defendant illegally required her to hold. She argued it was illegal because she was not \u201chighly qualified\u201d to teach social studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">At the subsequent arbitration hearing, the arbitrator concluded that defendant had demonstrated a valid educational framework for the evaluations and the absence of personal animus or improper bias in making them. He further concluded that teaching social studies fell within the scope of Pugliese\u2019s licensure. He deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>mined that she satisfied the criteria for being highly qualified, as defined by federal statute, and that her shortcomings were related to her inability to control a classroom and create level-appropriate lesson plans, rather than a lack of substantive knowledge. Pug-liese appealed the arbitrator\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The trial court upheld the arbitrator\u2019s decision, stating that there was substantial evidence to support the arbitrator\u2019s decision that Pugliese was capable of teaching social studies. The court stated that just because she was teaching a subject in which she claimed to not be highly qualified did \u201cnot render the arbitrator\u2019s decision illegal or contrary to public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\n<em>General law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 6301 to - 7941,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">reflects Congress\u2019 judgment that the best way to raise the level of education nationwide is by granting state and local officials flexibility to develop and implement educational programs that address local needs, while holding them accountable for the results.

A tenured teacher shall not \u201cbe dismissed or reduced in compensation ... except for inefficiency, incapacity, unbecoming conduct, or other just cause, and then only after a hearing----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-10. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Any charge against a tenured employee \u201cshall be filed with the secretary of the board [of education] in writing, and a written statement of evidence under oath to support such a charge shall be presented----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:6-11.

Pursuant to TEACHNJ, if the matter before the arbitrator is employee inefficiency, then four factors shall be considered by the arbitrator in rendering a decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">[W]hether or not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">(1) <em>the employee\u2019s evaluation failed to adhere substantially to the evaluation process, including, but not limited to providing a collective action plan;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-13\">(2) there is a mistake of fact in the evaluation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-14\">(3) the charges would not have been brought but for considerations of political affiliation, nepotism, union activity, discrimination as prohibited by State or federal law, or other conduct prohibited by State or federal law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-15\">(4) the district\u2019s actions were arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-16\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-17.2. (emphasis added.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-17\">Pursuant to TEACHNJ, the arbitrator must therefore determine if the evaluation adhered to the evaluation process, and provided the corrective action plan. To accomplish this task, the arbitrator must first identify the proper evaluation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>\u201cThe arbitrator\u2019s determination shall be final and binding and may not be appealable to the commissioner or the State Board of Education. </em>The determination shall be subject to judicial review and enforcement as provided pursuant to <em>N.J.S.[A.] </em>2A:24-7 through <em>N.J.SJA.] </em>2A:24-10.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-17.1(e) (emphasis added). A reviewing court may vacate an arbitration award due to corruption, fraud, undue means, partiality or misconduct, or if the arbitrators \u201cso imperfectly executed their powers that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Prior to its amendment in 2012 pursuant to TEACHNJ, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-16 had stated that if the commissioner determined that charges, if sufficient, warranted dismissal, the matter was referred to an administrative law judge (ALJ). <em>L. </em>1967, c. 271, as amended by <em>L. </em>1998, c. 42, \u00a7 2. The ALJ issued a recommended decision, which the commissioner could adopt, modify or reject. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c). Thus, the agency, using its expertise, reviewed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Thereafter, an agency determination could be appealed directly to the Appellate Division. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-9.1(a). Pursuant to TEACHNJ, the agency review process no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\n<em>Arbitrators apply different standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The performance evaluations for both Chavez and Pugliese took place prior to the enactment of TEACHNJ, using evaluation rubrics in place at that time as well as a rating scale that was superseded by TEACHNJ. Their tenure charges, however, were filed after TEACHNJ\u2019s enactment. An arbitrator\u2019s determination as to what evaluation process should apply in such a situation is a question of statutory interpretation. The two arbitrators here interpreted the statutes differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The Chavez arbitrator stated that the case presented two issues: one procedural and one related to the underlying merits of the charges. The Chavez arbitrator framed the procedural issue by stating that there needed to be \u201ca determination of the appropriate processes and standards to apply ... given that[:] (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the underlying facts occurred prior to the effective date of ... [TEACHNJ][;] and b) the referral of the matter [to arbitration] occurred after the effective date of [TEACHNJ].\u201d Chavez had argued that his case should be decided under the standards and procedures that preexisted TEACHNJ, because TEACHNJ specified four factors that an arbitrator shall consider when evaluating inefficiency charges, but did so in the context of a yet-to-be determined evaluation rubric in which the educator was to be rated using newly established designations.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The Chavez arbitrator analyzed TEACHNJ, in which a charge of inefficiency may be filed whenever an employee receives an annual rating of ineffective or partially effective in one year, followed by an annual rating of ineffective the next year.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-17.3(a)(1). But \u201c[t]he only evaluations which may be used for purposes of this section are those evaluations conducted in accordance with a rubric adopted by the board and approved by the commissioner pursuant to [TEACHNJ].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-17.3(d). The arbitrator in the Chavez matter thus concluded that since the evaluation rubrics referenced were not in place, he was precluded from basing his review on the four factors designated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-17.2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The arbitrator in the Pugliese matter, however, did not determine he was constrained by the absence of the evaluation rubrics to be implemented under TEACHNJ, finding instead that he was to \u201cdetermine whether the tenure charges brought ... demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>strate that [Pugliese] failed to perform in a satisfactory manner for two consecutive years, the criterion established by [TEACHNJ].\u201d Both arbitrators cannot be correct in applying different standards to similar procedural matters. Which standard is appropriate for teachers whose tenure charges are brought after the passage of TEACHNJ, but before the TEACHNJ evaluation rubric is implemented, is a determination better resolved in the first instance by the agency with particular expertise in matters of educational policy. See <em>In re Election Law Enforcement Comm\u2019n Advisory Op. No. 01-2008, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>254, 262, 989 A.2d 1254 (2010) (\u201c[A] state agency brings experience and specialized knowledge to its task of administering and regulating a legislative enactment within its field of expertise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u201c[T]he promulgation of administrative rules and regulations lies at the very heart of the administrative process____\u201d <em>In re N.J.A.C. 7:1B-1.1 Et Seq., </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 115, 67 A.3d 621 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>216 <em>N.J. 8, </em>75 A.3d 1162 (2013). \u201c \u2018[T]he basic purpose of establishing agencies to consider and promulgate rules is to delegate the primary authority of implementing policy in a specialized area to governmental bodies with the staff, resources and expertise to understand and solve those specialized problems.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Bergen Pines Cnty.

We do not accept this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">An agency has the obligation to make decisions clearly with its reasons spelled out on the record. An implicit, silent rejection of legal defenses based on overlapping statutory regulations does not meet that criteria. As we have said previously, \u201cwe insist that the agency disclose its reasons for any decision, even those based upon expertise, so that a proper, searching, and careful review by this court may be undertaken.\u201d <em>Balagun v.
