The Sussex County grand jury returned Indictment No. 08-06-00186, charging defendant Western World, Inc., and others with crimes that arose from a July 7, 2006 shooting during the reenactment of a gunfight at Wild West City, a business operated by defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April H, 2012, represented by private counsel and pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pled guilty as an accomplice to count fifteen of the indictment as amended to charge third-degree unlawful possession of a handgun, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(b), and 2C:2-6(b)(1). The State agreed to dismiss the balance of the indictment and recommend a one-year period of probation, subject to specific terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">We have not been provided with a transcript of the plea proceedings as part of this motion record. However, the plea form and addendum, apparently prepared by the prosecutor, indicated that the State would also dismiss the indictment as to co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>defendants Michael Stabile, at the time defendant\u2019s president, Nathan McPeak, one of its employees, and Cheyenne Corporation, an entity that owned the land upon which Wild West City operated. The addendum also indicated that the State would not seek a f\u00edne, and it set forth the State\u2019s recommendations regarding conditions of probation. Lastly, the addendum provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">It is acknowledged that the amendment to Count [Fifteen] is legally proper and sufficient and will not be challenged on appeal. [Defendant] reserves the right to appeal the limited question of whether a carry permit was required by the actors under the facts of this case. [Defendant] waives any other appellate issues and agrees to withdraw the previously filed interlocutory appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Stabile executed the plea form on behalf of defendant. The judgment of conviction entered on October 23, 2012, reflects that the judge placed defendant on probation for one year, imposed a $7500 fine to be paid over a period of three years, and imposed other mandatory financial penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">On November 8, 2012, defense counsel wrote to the regional office of OPD, indicating that defendant wished to appeal the issue reserved at the time of its guilty plea, as well as the imposition of the fine, and that his firm, which had not been compensated, would not represent defendant. He further noted the judge told Stabile at sentencing that \u201cthe corporation would be entitled to a Public Defender if it could not afford an attorney.\u201d Counsel stated that defendant, however, was \u201cturned away by the Public Defender\u2019s Office.\u201d Citing our decision in <em>In re CLM Construction Co., </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>329, 649 A.2d 888 (App.Div.1994), defense counsel contended that defendant was entitled to representation by OPD on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Based on a December 19, 2012 letter from an investigator assigned to the vicinage Criminal Division Manager\u2019s Office, we gather that Stabile applied on behalf of defendant for the services of OPD on November 30. Stabile indicated that defendant had sold its interest in Wild West City in 2007. The corporation\u2019s only asset was \u201ca 58 acre tract of land containing a large area of wetlands.\u201d Review of defendant\u2019s financial records revealed that it had \u201cavailable bank funds of $1,874.56,\u201d and it was in debt \u201cdue to past loans and attorney fees.\u201d There was also a pending civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>suit against defendant based upon the July 7, 2006 incident. As a result, the investigator approved defendant\u2019s application for OPD\u2019s services \u201cupon the acceptance of ... [OPD].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">On February 26, 2013, OPD filed a notice of appeal on behalf of defendant, and, on September 11, OPD filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. OPD argued that, pursuant to the Public Defender Act (the PDA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-1 to -25, it retained \u201csome measure of discretion\u201d regarding allocation of its \u201climited resources.\u201d OPD also questioned the \u201cvalue of th[e] appeal,\u201d because defendant\u2019s probationary term was about to end in October 2013, and the adverse decision defendant sought to appeal involved the denial of its motion to dismiss the original charge in the indictment, not the amended charge to which it pled guilty. OPD also concluded that any appeal regarding the imposition of a fine lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">On September 23, Stabile filed a letter brief in opposition to the motion on behalf of defendant. <em>Buie </em>1:21 \u2014 1(c), however, provides that subject to certain exceptions that do not apply here, \u201can entity ... other than a sole proprietorship shall neither appear nor file any paper in any action in any court of this State except through an attorney authorized to practice in this State.\u201d We therefore appointed counsel to represent defendant for purposes of this motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In opposing OPD\u2019s motion, defendant argued that while OPD has discretion to allocate its resources, it \u201clacks discretion to deny representation to an indigent defendant,\u201d and, based upon the express language of the PDA, the motion must be denied. Additionally, citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-15.1, defendant contended that review of OPD\u2019s request lay with the vicinage Assignment Judge, although, because of the public interests at stake, defendant urged us to exercise our original jurisdiction pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:10-5 and decide the motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">We also requested that the State file a response to defendant\u2019s motion. Although agreeing that the appeal lacked merit, the assistant prosecutor who handled the prosecution in the Law Division took no position on OPD\u2019s request to be relieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">At oral argument before us, OPD expanded upon its requested relief. OPD argued that because no \u201cliberty\u201d interest is at stake, it has no obligation to represent a corporate defendant under any circumstances. OPD argued that to the extent our prior decision in <em>CLM Construction </em>implies a contrary result, we should overrule that precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The only discussion in a published New Jersey decision as to whether OPD is required to represent an indigent corporation appears in a footnote in <em>CLM Construction. </em>There, the trial judge appointed an OPD pool attorney, who had represented the corporate president as an individual co-defendant, to also represent the corporate defendant. <em>CLM Const., supra, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>at 330-32, 649 A.2d 888. Both defense counsel and the assistant prosecutor advised the judge that OPD did not represent corporations. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 649 A.2d 888. Nevertheless, the judge indicated he would appoint counsel to represent the corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 649 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Although counsel provided personal justification for her refusal, the judge would not reconsider his order of appointment, <em>ibid., </em>and we granted counsel leave to appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 649 A.2d 888. We reversed the order, concluding that the judge failed to comply with then-existing <em>Rule </em>3:27-1,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> failed to make full inquiry of the corporation or its president, and failed to acknowledge the attorney\u2019s objections to the appointment; we remanded the matter for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 334, 649 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In a footnote, we discussed the assertion by counsel and the prosecutor that OPD did not represent corporate defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 331 n. 2, 649 A.2d 888. We noted that our research \u201cfail[ed] to uncover any New Jersey authority specifically considering this point.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We further observed that both <em>State v. Rush, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>399, 217 A.2d 441 (1966), and <em>State v. Horton, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>518, 170 A.2d 1 (1961), \u201cdiscuss the indigent\u2019s right to appointed counsel[,j\u201d but that neither case \u201cdistinguish[ed] between indigent individuals and indigent corporations,\u201d and we specifically cited <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-2 for the proposition that \u201ca corporation is a person.\u201d <em>CLM Const., supra, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 331 n. 2, 649 A.2d 888. We then considered the \u201ceight determining factors for eligibility for public defender representation\u201d contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:158A-14, and noted that three factors \u201cclearly only apply to people[,]\u201d but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the remaining five factors \u201cmay be read as applicable to people or corporations.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We further observed that neither the federal Criminal Justice Act, 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3006A, nor <em>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure </em>44(a), \u201cmentions indigent corporations.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Additionally, we took note of two New York decisions, <em>People v. BNB Realty Corp., </em>85 Misc.2d 487, 379 N.Y.S.2d 324 (N.Y.Crim.Ct.1976), and <em>People v. Select Tire, </em>84 <em>Misc.2d </em>159, 374 N.Y.S.2d 274 (N.Y.Crim.Ct.1975), holding that \u201cthe right to counsel, which protects only individual or property rights, does not exist for corporations where corporations could neither be imprisoned nor fined, based on indigency.\u201d <em>CLM Const., supra, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 331 n. 2, 649 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">We address the issue our footnote in <em>CLM Construction </em>succinctly framed, but left unresolved, by first considering the nature and scope of the fundamental right to counsel embodied in the United States and New Jersey Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to ... have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d The Amendment guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to retain counsel of his choice, <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>140, 144, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2557, 2561, 165 L.Ed.2d 409, 417 (2006), to the effective assistance of counsel, and if indigent and facing the potential loss of \u201clife or liberty,\u201d to have counsel appointed at the government\u2019s expense. <em>Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>367, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">The right to counsel on appeal from a State court criminal conviction derives not from the text of the Sixth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>ment, but rather from the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s equal protection provisions. As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">Although there is no constitutional right to an appeal, <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em>351 <em>U.S. </em>12, 18, 76 <em>S.Ct. </em>585, 590, 100 <em>L.Ed. </em>891, 898 (1956), once a right to appeal is provided, that right must be protected in a non-discriminatory fashion. Accordingly, an indigent defendant has a right to counsel on direct appeal. <em>Douglas v. California, </em>372 <em>U.S. </em>353, 357, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>814, 816, 9 L.Ed.2d 811, 814 (1963).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqU\"><em>[State v. Coon, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 434, 715 <em>A.2d </em>326 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>543, 724 A.2d 802 (1998).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The right to appointed counsel under the Sixth Amendment, however, exists only when \u201cthe litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.\u201d <em>Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>18, 25, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2153, 2158, 68 L.Ed.2d 640, 648 (1981). \u201c[A]s a litigant\u2019s interest in personal liberty diminishes, so does his right to appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2159, 68 L.Ed.2d at 649. \u201c[I]t is the defendant\u2019s interest in personal freedom, and not simply the special Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments right to counsel in criminal cases, which triggers the right to appointed counsel in criminal cases____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2158, 68 L.Ed.2d at 648. Thus, \u201cthe line defining the [federal] constitutional right to appointment of counsel\u201d is \u201cactual imprisonment,\u201d not fines or the threat of imprisonment. <em>Scott, supra, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>at 373, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1162, 59 L.Ed.2d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">The federal circuits have held the Sixth Amendment applies to corporations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-12\">The sixth amendment describes the class of persons protected by its terms with the word \u201caccused.\u201d This language does not suggest that the protection of sixth amendment rights is restricted to individual defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-13\">Furthermore, an accused has no less of a need for effective assistance due to the fact that it is a corporation. The purpose of the guarantee is to ensure that the accused will not suffer an adverse judgment or lose the benefit of procedural protections because of ignorance of the law. A corporation would face these same dangers unless the agent representing it in court is a competent lawyer. Thus, the right to effective assistance of counsel is not so peculiarly applicable to individuals that corporations should not be entitled to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-14\">Nor can we see how this right is in any manner inconsistent with a corporation\u2019s status as a creature of state law. Consequently, we hold that the guarantee of effective assistance of counsel applies to corporate defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>[United States v. Rad-O-Lite of Philadelphia, Inc., </em>612 F.2d 740, 743 (3d Cir.1979) (internal citations omitted); <em>accord United States v. Unimex, Inc., </em>991 F.2d 546, 549 (9th Cir.1993).] <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Significantly, however, federal courts have uniformly held that corporations, unlike defendants who are natural persons, do not have a Sixth Amendment right to appointed counsel at public expense. <em>See United States v. Hartsell, </em>127 F.3d 343, 350 (4th Cir.1997); <em>Unimex, Inc., supra, </em>991 F.2d at 550; <em>United States v. Rocky Mt. Corp., </em>746 F.Supp.2d 790, 803 (W.D.Va.2010); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>912 <em>F.Supp. </em>634, 638 (D.P.R.1996); <em>Mid-Central/Sysco Food Servs., Inc. v. Reg\u2019l Food Servs., Inc., </em>755 <em>F.Supp. </em>367 (D.Kan.1991). The court in <em>Rocky Mt. Corp., supra, </em>746 F.Supp.2d at 800, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">[T]he corporation\u2019s right to counsel does not precisely mirror the individual\u2019s right to counsel. It follows that when we speak of the corporation\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, we in no way imply that it can have counsel it cannot afford. Rather, what the corporation has is the right to retain the counsel of its choice to represent its interests without undo governmental intrusion. <em>Thus, a corporation\u2019s Sixth Amendment right in a criminal trial is its right to retain counsel while an individual\u2019s Sixth Amendment right includes the right to appointed counsel. Unlike an individual, a coloration cannot have what it cannot afford.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">[ (Emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\"><em>See also </em>Peter J. Henning, <em>The Conundrum of Corporate Criminal Liability: Seeking a Consistent Approach to the Constitutional Rights of Corporations in Criminal Prosecutions, </em>63 <em>Tenn. L.Rev. </em>793, 885 (1996) (explaining that under the United States Constitution, \u201ca corporation cannot claim the same measure or degree of protection that the individual defendant may claim\u201d). The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is so limited because corporations cannot be imprisoned or face a loss of liberty. <em>Uni-mex, Inc., supra, </em>991 F.2d at 550; <em>Rivera, supra, </em>912 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In part, Article I, Paragraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution provides, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have ... the assistance of counsel in his defense.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court long ago noted, that \u201c[Qrom very early days New Jersey has considered the matter of counsel for an indigent criminal defendant as one of absolute right under state law.\u201d <em>Horton, supra, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>at 522, 170 A.2d 1. Since 1795, New Jersey has legislated the right of an indigent defendant to assigned counsel. <em>Patterson, Laws of the State of N.J., </em>162 (1800).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Robert J. Martin and Walter Kowalski, <em>New Jersey Development: \u201cA Matter of Simple Justice\u201d: Enactment of New Jersey\u2019s Municipal Public Defender Act, </em>51 <em>Rutgers L.Rev. </em>637, 645 (1999) (noting that New Jersey was the first state in the nation to enact legislation providing assigned counsel to represent indigent defendants in its courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In addition, \u201cthe right to appointed counsel for indigent litigants has received more expansive protection under our state law than federal law.\u201d <em>Pasqua v. Council, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>127, 147 n. 5, 892 A.2d 663 (2006). In many cases, the Court found support for such expansion in Article I, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, our State\u2019s equivalent of the due process provisions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution. <em>Ibid,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>For example, State constitutional due process rights require the appointment of counsel for indigents in a variety of situations where the loss of liberty is not at stake. <em>See, e.g., N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. B.R., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>301, 306-07, 929 A.2d 1034 (2007) (termination of parental rights); <em>Doe v.

Additionally, without referencing our State Constitution, in <em>Rodriguez v. Rosenblatt, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>281, 277 A.2d 216 (1971), the Court extended the right to appointed counsel to indigent defendants in quasi-criminal municipal court prosecutions. Concluding that result was compelled \u201cas a matter of simple justice,\u201d the Court held that \u201cno indigent defendant should be subjected to a conviction entailing imprisonment in fact or other consequence of magnitude without first having had due and fair opportunity to have counsel assigned without cost.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 277 A.2d 216. Relying on the principle of \u201csimple justice,\u201d in <em>State v. Hermanns, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 30, 650 A.2d 360 (App.Div.1994), we subsequently held that imposition of significant fines constituted a consequence of magnitude.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Nonetheless, despite New Jersey\u2019s long history of assigning counsel to represent indigent defendants, and the expanded protections afforded under our constitution to other indigent litigants, our research has revealed no case in which a court has appointed counsel at public expense to represent an \u201cindigent\u201d corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The arguments made by defendant and OPD require us to construe the PDA, and in doing so, we apply some well-recognized tenets. \u201cIn statutory interpretation, a court\u2019s role \u2018is to determine and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel.

When the statutory language is sufficiently ambiguous that it may be susceptible to more than one plausible interpretation, we may turn to such extrinsic guides as legislative history, including sponsor statements and committee reports.\u201d <em>Wilson ex rel.

Under the PDA, \u201c \u2018indigent defendant\u2019 means <em>a person </em>who is formally charged with the commission of an indictable offense, and who does not have the present financial ability to secure competent legal representation, as determined by the factors in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-14], and to provide all other necessary expenses of representation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Although \u201cperson\u201d is not defined by the PDA, defendant argues that, \u201c[u]nless ... otherwise expressly provided or there is something in the subject or context repugnant to such eonstruction[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-2 supplies the meaning of certain statutory \u201cwords and phrases.\u201d \u201cThe word \u2018person\u2019 includes corporations ... unless restricted by the context to an individual as distinguished from a corporate entity____\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-14(g) (providing that under the Criminal Code, \u201c \u2018[p]erson[ ]\u2019 ... in-elude[s] any natural person and, where relevant, a corpora-tion____\u201d). Defendant\u2019s argument is straightforward. Since defendant is a <em>person, charged with ... an indictable offense </em>and lacking <em>the present financial ability to secure competent representation </em>on appeal, it is an <em>indigent defendant </em>for purposes of the PDA, and, therefore, OPD <em>shall </em>provide for its representation on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The two statutory provisions cited by defendant that ostensibly supply the definition of \u201cperson\u201d omitted from the PDA by the Legislature, however, are limited by their very terms. The definitions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-14 are expressly limited to the Criminal Code. The meanings of statutory terms supplied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-2 must be rejected if \u201cthere is something in the subject or context [of a statute that is] repugnant to such construction.\u201d Specifically construing a statute\u2019s use of \u201cperson\u201d interchangeably with \u201ccorporation[ ]\u201d should be rejected if the word \u201cperson\u201d is \u201crestricted by the context to an individual as distinguished from a corporate entity.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Decisions that have utilized the default meanings contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-2 as aids in interpreting specific statutory language are too numerous to cite. <em>See, e.g., Shelton v.

There are far fewer examples of decisions in which the default meaning was explicitly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In <em>In re Electrical Inspection Authorities, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 300, 317 A.2d 373 (App.Div.1974), we considered, among other things, whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:5A-17, which by its terms applied only to municipalities, should be interpreted to also include counties. We recognized that, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-2, the default statutory meaning of \u201cMunicipality\u201d did not include counties. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 317 A.2d 373. Nevertheless, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\"><em>The question is one of legislative intent. </em>In our view, the subject and context of the quoted section indicates that ... the legislative intent was that the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>45:5A-17 should apply to all governmental units, i.e., cities and counties which, with statutory authorization, provide for electrical inspections ... and that therefore the word \u201cmunicipality\u201d should be construed to include a county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-11\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">In a different context, in <em>Housing Authority of Atlantic City v. Coppock, </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>432, 434, 346 A.2d 609 (App.Div.1975), we considered the default meaning of \u201cmonth,\u201d as supplied by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-2 (\u201c[T]he word \u2018month\u2019 means a calendar month.\u201d). We concluded in that case that the notice of termination served upon the tenant thirty-one days prior to the filing of the complaint complied with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(b) (requiring \u201cone month\u2019s\u201d prior notice). <em>Ibid. </em>We specifically rejected the argument that the Anti-Eviction Act required \u201cthe termination be directed to the end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>of the month.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>We held that given the express language of the lease that required thirty days\u2019 notice, \u201cthe definition of \u2018month\u2019 in <em>N.J.S.A </em>1:1-2 as a calendar month is inapplicable under these circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Whether the default meanings supplied by <em>N.J.S.A </em>1:1-2 support or defeat a particular construction returns us to the lodestar of statutory interpretation \u2014 the intent of the Legislature. <em>See Shelton, supra, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>at 431-36, 70 A.3d 544 (examining \u201cthe background of the TCCWNA\u201d to determine whether its \u201cscope\u201d or the \u201ccontext in which the [undefined] term ...

Ultimately, the Court concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">[i]n light of the language of the statute as supplemented by the definition of person in Title I, the extrinsic evidence of legislative intent, and the State\u2019s strong policy to hold both active and passive child abusers accountable, we find that the [defendant] is a person under the passive abuse provision of the CSAA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 91, 902 A.2d 900.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">In short, if the default meaning of \u201cperson\u201d supplied by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-2 leads to a result contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent when it enacted the PDA, that meaning must be rejected. We are required, therefore, to examine the legislative history of the PDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">As already noted, New Jersey\u2019s history of providing counsel to indigent criminal defendants predates passage of the PDA by nearly two centuries. From 1948 to 1967, counsel were assigned to indigent defendants under various Rules of Court. For example, <em>Rule </em>l:12-9(a) (repealed 1967) provided that \u201c[w]here a person charged with a crime appears in a trial court without counsel, the court shall advise him of his right to counsel ... and if indigent, assign counsel to represent him.\u201d The application for the assignment of counsel (Form 5A), set forth in the Appendix to the 1967 Court Rule, contained questions specifically geared toward an individual, not a corporation, including whether the defendant was married, had children, earned a salary, or was employed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u201cIn <em>Rush, supra, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>at 412 [217 A.2d 441], the Court decided that the time had come to relieve the New Jersey bar of the task of defending without compensation indigents accused of indictable crimes.\u201d <em>In re Cannady, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>486, 489, 600 A.2d 459 (1991). The immediate solution arrived at by the <em>Rush </em>Court was to impose the costs of providing counsel upon the counties. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court delayed the effective date of its decision, however, to permit the Legislature to decide how best to provide for the indigent representation of criminal defendants indicted for crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 489-90, 600 A.2d 459. The Legislature responded by enacting the PDA in 1967, <em>L. </em>1967, c. 43, replacing the assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>counsel system with a statewide program for the defense of indigents at public expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">To some degree, the PDA was intended to address the expected increased costs to individual counties as a result of the <em>Rush </em>decision. This is clear from sponsors\u2019 statements in support of earlier versions of the bill, <em>see, e.g., Sponsor\u2019s Statement to A. 752, </em>at 2 (1967) (noting that increased costs to counties would result in \u201can undue burden\u201d), and the <em>Governor\u2019s Statement to S. 287, </em>(1967) (noting that appropriations to fund the public defender system were the \u201cresult of a determined effort by the State government to ... be of assistance to our counties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Foremost and primarily, however, the PDA was intended to meet the state\u2019s obligation under the Sixth Amendment to provide court-appointed counsel to indigent defendants, as was then very recently applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause in <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 <em>U.S. </em>335, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). <em>See Public Hearings before Special (Senate) Committee to Determine the Advisability of providing for the Establishment of a Public Defender System in the Several Counties, </em>at 2, 27, 31, 40, 59, 11A (Sept. 8, 1965) (noting that <em>Gideon </em>imposed a \u201ctremendous responsibility\u201d on the State to insure an indigent defendant\u2019s right to appointed counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The PDA as enacted implemented recommendations contained in the December 22, 1966 report of the \u201cCommission on the Defense of Indigent Persons Accused of Crime\u201d (\u201cReport\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Cannady, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 490, 600 A.2d 459; <em>Sponsor\u2019s Statement to S. 287, </em>at 7 (1967); <em>Governor\u2019s Statement to S. 287, supra. </em>In considering who was entitled to appointed counsel at public expense, the Commission implicitly spoke in terms of natural persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">Perhaps the most difficult problem is the matter of defining who is \u201cindigent.\u201d Several decades ago the term meant an actual <em>pauper </em>who was entirely without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>means.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] The term no longer has this narrow significance. In general, it is now widely understood as referring to <em>a person </em>who is unable to afford the cost of engaging counsel to represent <em>him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\"><em>[Report, supra, </em>at 5 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Similarly, earlier public hearings on the proposed PDA, where pre-eminent lawyers of the day engaged in all aspects of the legal profession testified, contain repeated references to the need to provide publicly-financed counsel to \u201cindividuals,\u201d \u201cpaupers\u201d and \u201cpoor men,\u201d without any reference to corporations. <em>Public Hearings, supra, </em>at 2, 41, 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The Court has said that the Legislature created OPD to \u201censure that the State fulfilled its constitutional obligation to provide legal services for indigent defendants.\u201d <em>In re Custodian of Records, supra, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>at 158, 68 A.3d 308. The PDA expressly provides, \u201cIt is hereby declared to be the policy of this State to provide for the realization of the <em>constitutional guarantees of counsel </em>in criminal cases for indigent defendants____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-1 (emphasis added). Tellingly, however, the PDA does not track exactly the language of the Sixth Amendment or the right to counsel provided by our Constitution, both of which accord the right to \u201cthe accused\u201d in criminal prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">As initially adopted, the PDA did not provide for the representation of indigent defendants charged with non-indictable offenses or juveniles. <em>See In re State in Interest of Antini, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>488, 492, 251 A.2d 291 (1969). With regard to non-indictable offenses, in 1974, in response to the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 277 A.2d 216, the Legislature amended the PDA, <em>L. </em>1974, c. 33, to expand representation to \u201cinclude persons charged as juvenile delinquents or juveniles in need of supervision, persons charged with parole violation, and indigent disorderly persons.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Sponsor\u2019s Statement to A. 1298 </em>at 2 (1974). <em>See In re Contempt of Spann, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 67, 443 A.2d 239 (App.Div.1982). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158-5.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">The Public Defender shall ... provide for the legal representation of any person charged with a disorderly persons offense or with the violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of a penal nature where there is a likelihood that the persons so charged, if convicted, will be subject to <em>imprisonment </em>or, in the opinion of the court, any <em>other consequence of magnitude.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">[ (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The Legislature clearly intended to expand the universe of offenses triggering the right to counsel at public expense for indigent defendants. The amendment did not, however, expand the definition of \u201cindigent defendants\u201d to include indigent corporations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In any event, the Legislature failed to appropriate the funds necessary to expand OPD to the municipal court level. As a result, OPD was never required to assume its statutory obligation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158-5.2. <em>Madden v. Delran, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>591, 612, 601 A.2d 211 (1992); <em>Spann, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 67, 443 A.2d 239.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">As originally enacted, the PDA also did not provide for the representation of indigent juveniles. However, just thirteen days after the PDA was enacted, on May 15, 1967, the United States Supreme Court held that an indigent juvenile had the right to be furnished with counsel during \u201cproceedings to determine delin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>quency which may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile\u2019s freedom is curtailed____\u201d <em>In re Gault, </em>387 <em>U.S. </em>1, 41, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1428, 1451, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, 554 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">As a result, our Supreme Court amended former <em>Rule </em>6:3-4(c) and (d) (1968 (now repealed)), to provide for the assignment of counsel for indigent juveniles, albeit, not by the OPD, but under the old alphabetical rotation system as set forth in <em>Rule </em>l:12-9(c) (1968 (now repealed)). The Court in <em>Antini, supra, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>at 494-95, 251 A.2d 291, directed, as it had in <em>Rush, supra, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>at 415, 217 A.2d 441, that \u201clawyers who provided services since the decision in <em>Gault </em>was handed down should be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenditures, and the juvenile court judges are authorized to enter orders, after appropriate application, directing payment thereof by the particular county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The Legislature\u2019s response was again swift. It amended the PDA, <em>L. </em>1968, c. 371, to provide for representation of juveniles by the OPD:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">[Tlhe Public Defender shall ... provide for the legal representation of any person who is charged as a juvenile delinquent or as a juvenile in need of supervision and where in the opinion of the juvenile judge the prosecution of the complaint may result in the institutional commitment of such person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-24.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">These two examples demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s clear ability to amend the PDA in order to address the rapidly changing legal landscape whenever the rights of indigent defendants are implicated. In both situations, the impetus behind the amendments to the PDA were the vital personal liberty interests at stake. On other occasions, the Legislature has not hesitated to enact legislation, separate from the PDA, to ensure that the rights of indigent <em>natural </em>persons are protected by representation through OPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">For example, the Legislature enacted legislation that requires the Office of Parental Representation in OPD to represent parents and guardians charged in abuse and neglect cases, or those facing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the loss of parental rights, in accord with their constitutional rights. <em>See, e.g., B.R., supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 306-07, 929 A.2d 1034; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.30; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.43(a); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Similarly, the Division of Mental Health Advocacy in OPD provides representation at civil commitment hearings, as constitutionally guaranteed, <em>see S.L., supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 142, 462 A.2d 1252, and statutorily required, not under the PDA, but pursuant to the civil commitment statutes and court rules. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>30:4 \u2014 27.11(c); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.12(d); <em>R. </em>4:74-7(c)(2); <em>R. </em>4:86-10. OPD counsel is also provided by statute when an indigent defendant faces commitment under the Sexually Violent Predator Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.24 to -27.38, as constitutionally guaranteed, <em>In re Commitment of D.L., </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 89, 797 A.2d 166 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif. denied, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>373, 845 A.2d 1255 (2004), and as statutorily required by Title 30. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.29(c); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">We distill from this discussion the following. The PDA was born from a legislative desire to practically and publicly fund the criminal defense of indigents, as required by evolving federal constitutional doctrine and the long history of New Jersey\u2019s constitutional and statutory right to counsel. The legislative history of the PDA demonstrates that, at its inception, the focus of the proposed legislation was on the protection of the rights of \u201cindigent people\u201d who were natural persons, not corporations or other business entities. Although the Legislature could have specifically included corporations or other business entities within the PDA\u2019s definition of \u201cindigent defendants,\u201d it declined to do so. <em>See, e.g., Zabilowicz v. Kelsey, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>507, 517, 984 A.2d 872 (2009) (\u201cThe Legislature knows how to draft a statute to achieve that result when it wishes to do so.\u201d). Yet, whenever necessary, the Legislature has either amended the PDA or enacted other laws to specifically provide for the representation by OPD of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>natural persons whose personal liberty rights may be adversely affected, or who face other consequences of magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We conclude, therefore, that it \u201cis repugnant\u201d \u201cto the subject [and] context\u201d of the PDA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-2, to construe the word \u201cperson\u201d as used in the PDA to include a corporation. Such a construction is contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent when it first enacted the PDA, an intention since restated by various amendments to the PDA and other legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Our conclusion is supported by an examination of federal decisions that have interpreted language in the CJA and the Dictionary Act, 1 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1 to \u00a7 8, that is similar to that of the PDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The court in <em>Unimex, supra, </em>991 F.2d at 549-50, explained that the CJA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">provides for appointment of counsel for an indigent \u201cperson,\u201d but does not say whether a corporation is a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of appointment of counsel. 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 3006A(a). The word \u201cperson\u201d in a federal statute includes corporations \u201cunless the context indicates otherwise.\u201d 1 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1. In the statute providing for appointment of counsel, the context does indeed \u201cindicate otherwise.\u201d ____ The statutory context includes a list of classes of persons eligible, with catch-all clauses for a financially eligible person who \u201cis entitled to appointment of counsel under the sixth amendment to the constitution\u201d or \u201cfaces loss of liberty.\u201d 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 3006A(a)(l)(H), (I). If the purpose of the statute is to assure that criminal defendants\u2019 constitutional right to appointed counsel is protected, then no appointments are needed for corporations____Although authority is scarce, we conclude from context that the CJA does not so provide either.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">As a result, the federal courts have uniformly denied indigent corporations representation under the CJA. <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>469 <em>F.</em>3d 24, 26 (1st Cir.2006); <em>Hartsell, supra, </em>127 F.3d at 350; <em>Rivera, supra, </em>912 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 638; <em>United States v.

Some have done so by conditioning the appointment to situations where imprisonment is probable or possible. <em>See, e.g., Ark.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 16-87-213(a)(l)(A), 213(a)(2)(A) (2014) (setting forth procedure for \u201cany person charged with an offense punishable by imprisonment\u201d to obtain public defender services); <em>Conn.

Pudlo, </em>123 Ill.App.3d 337, 78 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>375, 462 N.E.2d 494, 498 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>1066, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2140, 85 L.Ed.2d 497 (1985). Notably, however, Illinois law also specifically provides that \u201c[i]f the accused is a dissolved corporation and is not represented by counsel, the court may, in the interest of justice, appoint as counsel a licensed attorney of th[e sjtate.\u201d 725 <em>III.

We therefore relieve OPD of any further representation of defendant in the prosecution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We also reaffirm, however, that because corporations are entitled to the assistance of counsel under both the United States Constitution and New Jersey Constitution, because New Jersey precedent requires the appointment of counsel whenever a defendant is charged with a crime or likely faces a consequence of magnitude, and because our Rules of Court specifically provide for the appointment of counsel in such circumstances on appeal, the Clerk\u2019s Office shall work with the vicinage Criminal Division Manager to designate counsel to represent defendant hereafter.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">An appropriate order has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"ARr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-9\"> We previously described the circumstances in our unpublished opinion, <em>Stabile </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>No. A-4009-09, 2011 <em>WL </em>4483580 (App.Div.
