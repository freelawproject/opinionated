We also consider the propriety of counsel referring to the non-testifying expert\u2019s findings in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Although the general legal principles on point have been discussed in prior cases, and the pertinent rules of evidence have been in force for decades, there appears to be some confusion and uneven customs in applying those principles and rules in everyday civil trial practice. Hence, we use this occasion to clarify whether questions may be posed about the \u201cconsistency\u201d or \u201cinconsistency\u201d of a testifying expert\u2019s opinions with a non-testifying expert\u2019s views, and whether arguments about such consistency or inconsistency may be advocated in closing argument to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">We hold that a civil trial attorney may not pose such consistency/inconsistency questions to a testifying expert, where the manifest purpose of those questions is to have the jury consider for their truth the absent expert\u2019s hearsay opinions about complex and disputed matters. Even where the questioner\u2019s claimed purpose is solely restricted to impeaching the credibility of an adversary\u2019s testifying expert, spotlighting that opposing expert\u2019s disregard or rejection of the non-testifying expert\u2019s complex and disputed opinions, we hold that such questioning ordinarily should be disallowed under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403. Lastly, we hold that the closing arguments of counsel should adhere to these restrictions, so as to prevent the jury from speculating about or misusing an absent expert\u2019s complex and disputed findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Because the trial court correctly applied these principles here in ruling on objections at trial, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The circumstances presented in this ease are quite common. In essence, we have before us a classic dispute in an automobile accident case over whether the plaintiff sustained a permanent injury to his spine and thereby is entitled to pain and suffering damages under the lawsuit limitation provision (also known as the \u201cverbal threshold\u201d) in the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act (\u201cAICRA\u201d), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1.1 to -35.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">AICRA is a cost-containment measure that allows insured drivers to pay lower premiums in exchange for a limitation on their right to sue for noneconomic damages. <em>See DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 480-81, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005). One of the recurring issues in automobile negligence cases involving plaintiffs who are subject to the AICRA verbal threshold is whether there is objective and persuasive proof that they suffered in a motor vehicle accident \u201ca permanent injury within a reasonable degree of medical probability.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(a); <em>see also DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 481, 874 A.2d 1039.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In many instances, such as this case, the key issue at trial is whether such a permanent injury caused by the accident has been established, with both sides presenting competing expert testimony on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The record here shows that plaintiff was operating his car on July 2, 2010 on the Atlantic City Expressway. He stopped his car at a toll booth behind defendant\u2019s vehicle. Defendant\u2019s car then suddenly went in reverse and backed into plaintiffs car. Defendant ultimately pled guilty to improper backing up, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-127, in municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Plaintiff went to a local emergency room after the accident, complaining of lower back pain. He then underwent treatment with an orthopedic physician for the lumbar pain. The treating physician ordered a CT scan of the lumbar spine, which was conducted on July 21, 2010, less than three weeks after the accident. The CT scan was interpreted by Dr. Amerigo Falciani, a radiologist. In his written one-page report, Dr. Falciani determined, among other findings, that the CT scan showed a \u201csmall diffuse [disc] bulge at the L4-L5 level.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Plaintiffs back pain persisted, and he was evaluated by Dr. Stephen J. Zabinski, a Board-certified orthopedic surgeon, in December 2012. Among other things, Dr. Zabinski personally examined the CT scan that had been conducted in July 2010. Based on Dr. Zabinski\u2019s review of the CT scan, he likewise concluded that the CT scan showed disc bulging at the L4-L5 level. Dr. Zabinski concluded that the lumbar disc bulge was traumatically caused by the July 2010 car accident, and that it was a permanent injury not likely to heal or to function normally in the future, despite the passage of time and continued treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against defendant, alleging that she had negligently caused the accident and that the accident had caused him to sustain permanent injuries. Defendant did not contest liability for the accident, but she did dispute whether plaintiff had sustained a permanent injury that would enable him to vault the verbal threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">At the request of the defense, a Board-certified orthopedic surgeon, Dr. John A. Cristini, examined plaintiff in September 2012. Dr. Cristini specifically noted Dr. Falciani\u2019s finding of disc bulge within his first pretrial expert report, which contained this passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">The CT of the lumbar spine reported by Dr. Falciani revealed a small diffuse broad based bulge at L4-5 and disc space narrowing at Ll-2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Dr. Cristmi thereafter was provided with a CD containing the CT scan itself, and he personally inspected it. In a supplemental expert report he issued in July 2013, Dr. Cristini stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">As part of [the treating orthopedist\u2019s] evaluation, CT scans were obtained. These were carried out at Atlantic Medical Imaging and were available to me at this time on CD format. The CT of the lumbar spine dated 7/21/10 was reviewed. No evidence of disc or bone pathology was noted, specifically <em>no disc herniation at any level was evident </em>No spondylosis or spondylolisthesis was noted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Although he found no \u201cherniation\u201d at L4-L5 from his review of the CT scan, Dr. Cristmi did not specifically comment in his supplemental report as to whether he agreed or disagreed with Dr. Falciani\u2019s finding of a \u201cbulge,\u201d which he had referred to in his first report.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The matter was tried as a damages-only case before Judge James P. Savio. The critical issue was whether plaintiff had established by a preponderance of the evidence a permanent injury that overcame the AICRA verbal threshold. Plaintiff relied upon the expert testimony of Dr. Zabinski, and defendant relied on the competing expert opinions of Dr. Cristmi. Neither side called Dr. Falciani.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Both plaintiff and defendant testified about the physical impact of the accident. Plaintiff also testified about his injuries and his course of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Several days before trial, plaintiffs counsel took the videotaped deposition of Dr. Zabinski for use at trial in lieu of his live testimony. In that de bene esse deposition, Dr. Zabinski opined, as he had in his expert report, that plaintiff had sustained a permanent injury from the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">During a brief portion of Dr. Zabinski\u2019s videotaped direct examination, plaintiffs counsel asked him the following questions and elicited the following answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Q: And, Doctor, from your own review of the [CT] scan, you saw the bulge at L4-5. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">Q: Was that <em>consistent </em>with what the radiologist saw in the report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Defense counsel did not object to this line of testimony at the time of the deposition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, in his pretrial submission under <em>Rule </em>4:25-7, defense counsel more broadly urged the trial court to bar plaintiffs expert from testifying \u201cas to any opinions of non-testifying doctors.\u201d The defense\u2019s <em>Rule </em>4:25-7 submission also urged that Dr. Zabinski\u2019s videotaped testimony be edited and that the court issue rulings on defense objections before trial. Citing case law that restricts the admission of hearsay opinions on disputed complex matters, including radiology studies, the defense maintained that since the plaintiffs testifying expert, Dr. Zabinski, \u201creviewed the [CT scan] himself,\u201d there was \u201cno need for him to discuss what another doctor found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The defense presented expert orthopedic testimony at trial from Dr. Cristini. For scheduling reasons, Dr. Cristini\u2019s testimony was presented out of turn before the videotape of Dr. Zabinski was played during plaintiffs direct case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Dr. Cristini told the jury that he had personally examined the CT scan. He was more definitive in his testimony about the CT scan than he had been in his pretrial reports, referring to a display of the CT scan being shown in the courtroom to the jury. Based upon his personal review of the cross-sections of the spine, Dr. Cristini testified that there was <em>\u201cno indication </em>in [his] opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>of <em>my disc pathology or disc bulges or herniations </em>at that [L4-L5] level.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">On direct examination, Dr. Cristini expressly repudiated the contrary opinion of Dr. Zabinski, advising the jury that he \u201cdisagree[d] with\u201d his testifying counterpart\u2019s finding of a disc bulge. Based on this determination, along with his physical examination of plaintiff and his \u201creview of the medical records,\u201d Dr. Cristini concluded that plaintiff had not sustained a permanent orthopedic injury from the accident. Notably, Dr. Cristini was not asked about Dr. Faleiani\u2019s findings during his direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">On cross-examination, plaintiffs counsel attempted to show that Dr. Cristini\u2019s finding of the absence of a bulge was inconsistent with the finding of the radiologist, Dr. Falciani. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: You discussed in your first report that a <em>CT </em>scan was done, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">[DR. CRISTINI]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">Q: And the CT scan was dated July 21st, 2010, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">A: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">Q: Okay. And in the report you also discuss the results of that CT scan, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-14\">A: The report, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-15\">Q: Okay. And what did you learn from that report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-17\">THE COURT: Sustained. The report is hearsay. Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">At that point, Judge Savio had a sidebar conference with counsel, at which the court considered more fully their positions about the propriety of the attempted questioning. The judge reasoned that the questioning of Dr. Cristini about the hearsay opinions of the non-testifying radiologist was disallowed by case law and the evidence rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-19\">Among other things, Judge Savio characterized the radiologist\u2019s interpretation of the CT scan and the finding of disc bulge as a \u201ccomplex medical diagnosis.\u201d Given that complexity, the judge ruled that the radiologist\u2019s finding of a bulge should not be inquired about on cross-examination where, as here, the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>expert had not relied on the radiologist\u2019s opinion. However, the judge did permit plaintiffs counsel to confirm on further cross-examination of Dr. Cristini that he had issued his first expert report without personally reviewing the CT scan.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Judge Savio rejected plaintiffs argument that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the \u201cconsistency\u201d testimony elicited from Dr. Zabinski at his videotaped deposition justified plaintiff probing into the radiologist\u2019s findings on cross-examination of Dr. Cristini. The judge ruled that \u201cif [plaintiffs] purpose is to suggest to Dr. Cristini that the radiologist had a conclusion or an opinion or a finding that\u2019s different from Dr. Cristini, I\u2019m not going to allow that.\u201d The judge warned plaintiffs counsel, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to backdoor the radiologist\u2019s opinion into this case. He\u2019s not here to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">As the cross-examination proceeded and drew further objections because plaintiffs counsel further attempted to question Dr. Cris-tini about the absent radiologist\u2019s findings, Judge Savio issued a cautionary instruction to the jury. The judge explained that it was not proper for them to consider documents prepared by others that were not relied upon by the testifying witness, Dr. Cristini. The judge further explained that it could not allow \u201cDr. Cristini to testify that someone else examined the patient and had this particular complex diagnosis. That would be hearsay and that would not be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">As noted, plaintiff did not call the radiologist, Dr. Falciani, to testify. He did present the videotape of Dr. Zabinski, which included the brief \u201cconsistency\u201d question and answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The third time Dr. Falciani\u2019s findings came up was during the summation of plaintiffs counsel. In the course of his argument to the jury, plaintiffs counsel stated the following, which provoked an objection from defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL: [WJhat we have here is a CT sean that ultimately shows at L4-5, that there is a bulging disc. You heard Dr. Zabinski testify as faj-as what is there. You also heard him indicate in his testimony that that is <em>consistent with what the radiologist saw.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">THE COURT: Sustained. Please disregard whatever con \u2014 whatever a radiologist might have determined. Ladies and gentlemen, the radiologist did not testify here. We are talking [solely] about the testimony of Dr. Zabinski and the testimony of Dr. Cristini.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">At that point, plaintiffs counsel reminded the court that Dr. Zabinski had testified in the video deposition about the consistency of his findings with those of Dr. Falciani, without any objection by defense counsel. Judge Savio acknowledged that lack of objection, but nonetheless concluded that \u201cthe rule of law\u201d forbids plaintiff from making that consistency argument to the jury. The judge then instructed the jurors once again that they should \u201cdisregard anything about the radiologist\u2019s opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">After the jury was sent out to deliberate,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> plaintiffs counsel amplified his legal position opposing the limitation the court had imposed on his summation. He beseeched the court that he would have called the radiologist to testify, had he known before trial that he would not be able to argue about the inconsistency or consistency of the respective orthopedists\u2019 opinions with those of Dr. Falciani. Judge Savio reaffirmed his rulings, although he acknowledged that the disallowance of the references to Dr. Falciani\u2019s findings, if they were overturned on appeal, \u201ccould have affected the outcome in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">The jury returned a unanimous verdict, concluding that plaintiff had not proven a permanent injury caused by the accident, signifying that he was not eligible to recover noneconomic damages under AICRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">This appeal followed, which solely focuses on the trial court\u2019s rulings as to the \u201cconsistency\u201d and \u201cinconsistency\u201d queries and arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>The Basic Elements of Hearsay.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The pivotal issues before us arise because the findings of Dr. Falciani, the radiologist who did not testify at trial, are hearsay, if offered for their truth. Hearsay consists of three classic elements: (1) a \u201cstatement;\u201d (2) \u201cother than one made by the declarant while testifying at the [present] trial or hearing;\u201d and (3) offered in evidence for its truth, i.e., \u201cto prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d in the statement. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The third element within the hearsay definition encompasses previously-made statements offered for their truth,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as opposed to statements offered for some <em>other </em>purpose that does not hinge upon their truth. As just one example, \u201c \u2018[w]here statements are offered, not for the truthfulness of their contents, but only to show that they were in fact made and that the listener took certain action as a result thereof, the statements are not deemed inadmissible hearsay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carmona v. Resorts Int\u2019l Hotel, Inc., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>354, 376, 915 A.2d 518 (2007) (quoting <em>Russell v. Rutgers Cmty. Health Plan, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 456-57, 655 A.2d 948 (App.Div), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>452, 663 A.2d 1359 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">The long-standing policy disfavoring the admission of hearsay in Anglo-American courts, as codified in New Jersey, instructs that \u201c[h]earsay is <em>not </em>admissible except as provided by [the evidence] rules or by other law.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>802 (emphasis added). This general prohibition, subject to various exceptions, reflects that hearsay is presumptively deemed to be \u201cuntrustworthy and unreliable.\u201d <em>See, e.g., One Step Up v. Sam Logistic, </em>419 <em>N.J.Super. </em>500, 507, 17 A.3d 826 (App.Div.2011) (citation omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u201cThe hearsay prohibition \u2018ensure[s] the accuracy of the factfinding process by excluding untrustworthy statements, such as those made without the solemnity of the oath, and not subject to cross-examination ... or the jury\u2019s critical observation of the declarant\u2019s demeanor and tone.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neno v. Clinton, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>573, 579, 772 A.2d 899 (2001) (quoting <em>State v. Engel, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>453, 465, 493 A.2d 1217 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The risks of admitting hearsay indiscriminately are well known. \u201c[Statements made out-of-court, not under oath, or not subject to cross-examination may suffer infirmities of perception, memory, and narration if admitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579-80, 772 A.2d 899 (citing <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 245 (5th ed.1999)). In addition, there can be an aspect of unfairness, even in civil cases,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the substantive admission of hearsay statements by an absent declarant, without affording the opposing party a chance to cross-examine that person before the fact-finder. <em>See, e.g., Alves v. Rosenberg, </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 563-65, 948 A.2d 701 (App.Div.2008) (reversing a jury verdict and remanding for a new trial where the judge had unfairly allowed the wholesale admission of numerous hearsay statements, thereby depriving the appellant of \u201cthe opportunity for full and effective cross-examination at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Without question, Dr. Falciani\u2019s radiology report contains \u201cstatements.\u201d Those statements indisputably were made at a previous time, rather than \u201cwhile [Dr. Falciani was] testifying at the trial.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>801(c). Hence, the first two elements of hearsay are manifestly present. The third element \u2014 the substantive use of those statements for their truth \u2014 we consider more closely, <em>infra, </em>when we respectively discuss the references to Dr. Falciani\u2019s findings during plaintiffs counsel\u2019s direct examination of Dr. Zabinski and his attempted cross-examination of Dr. Cristini.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Accepting, for the moment, the premise that Dr. Falciani\u2019s findings are hearsay without yet discussing the third definitional element, we turn to whether those findings satisfy an exception to the hearsay rule. Since the findings are contained in a written report, it is useful to the analysis to consider whether the report itself would meet a hearsay exception, even though neither party attempted to move the report into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\n<em>The Business Records Exception (N.J.R.E. 803(c)(6))</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The most fitting potential exception here is the business record provision, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6), which permits the admission of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">[a] statement contained in a writing or other record of acts, events, conditions, and, <em>subject to Rule 808, opinions or diagnoses, </em>made <em>at or near the time of observation by a person with actual knowledge or from information supplied by such a person, </em>if the writing or other record was <em>made in the regular course of business </em>and it was the regular practice of that business to make it, <em>unless </em>the sources of information or the method, purpose or circumstances of preparation indicate that <em>it is not trustworthy.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Here, it is readily evident that Dr. Falciani\u2019s report interpreting plaintiffs CT scan was generated in the regular course of professional medical practice, in connection with plaintiffs treatment and diagnosis. The report was contemporaneous with the radiologist\u2019s review of the CT scan. There is nothing irregular about the report, at least on its face. Indeed, it appears in all respects to be a routine medical document. There is no indication that Dr. Falciani prepared the report for the purposes of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">\n<em>The Complex/Disputed Expert Opinion Restriction (N.J.R.E. 808)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">The analysis does not stop there, however. Even if the other elements of the business record exception are fulfilled, opinions set forth within a radiologist\u2019s report may be inadmissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>808, which is cross-referenced within <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>N.J.R.E. </em>808 limits the presentation of hearsay expert opinions to a factfinder. Specifically, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>808 directs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\"><em>Expert opinion </em>which is included in an admissible hearsay statement <em>shall be excluded, if the declarant has not been produced as a witness unless </em>the trial judge finds that <em>the circumstances involved in rendering the opinion, </em>including the motive, duty, and interest of the declarant, whether litigation was contemplated by the declarant, the complexity of the subject matter, and the likelihood of accuracy of the opinion, <em>tend to establish its trustwoHhiness.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The import of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>808, a provision that has no analogue in the federal rules, is that some expert opinions contained in business records or other sources are admissible, but others are not. As the <em>Rule </em>instructs, the non-testifying expert\u2019s opinions must be excluded, unless the trial judge finds that the \u201ccircumstances involved in rendering the opinion ... tend to establish its trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge must consider the non-testifying expert\u2019s motive, duty, and interest in issuing the opinion. <em>Ibid. </em>The judge also must consider whether the expert declarant had litigation in mind at the time. <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the judge must evaluate the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of the subject matter involved, and the likelihood<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the opinion is \u201caccurate,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>including that the opinion has been generated through an appropriate scientific or technical methodology. <em>See, e.g., Kemp v.

The plaintiff in that case fell and was injured while climbing onto a table during radiation treatment at a hospital. The plaintiffs hospital records included certain entries by non-testifying doctors, stating that the fractures she sustained were \u201cpathologic\u201d in nature and therefore not caused by the trauma of the fall. Applying the precepts of <em>Rule </em>808, we concluded that these hearsay entries within the hospital records stated \u201ca com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>plex diagnosis involving the critical issue in dispute, as opposed to an uncontested diagnosis or insignificant issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284, 652 A.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We rejected the notion in <em>Nowacki </em>that the record entries comprised supporting \u201cfacts or data\u201d that could be discussed by defendants\u2019 testifying experts under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and instead deemed them expert \u201copinions\u201d subject to the strictures of <em>Rule </em>808. <em>Id. </em>at 285, 652 A.2d 758.

Although the Court did not cite to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>808 in <em>Agha, </em>its observations in this regard as to \u201copinions\u201d are consistent with the principles expressed in <em>Rule </em>808 and related case law, which we have discussed, <em>supra, </em>prohibiting the contested admission of complex hearsay opinions from a non-testifying expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>When facts or data from a hearsay source are referred to in the course of an expert\u2019s trial testimony, it is vital that the factfinder consider that background information solely for the limited purpose of understanding the basis of the testifying expert\u2019s opinions. <em>McLean v.

Cardoso, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 421, 915 A.2d 1053 (App.Div.2006), and one from the Supreme Court, <em>see Agha, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 64, 965 A.2d 141 \u2014 have applied those limitations to the specific context of a testifying expert alluding to the hearsay findings of a non-testifying radiologist in a verbal threshold ease. Mainly applying <em>Rule </em>808, <em>Brun </em>focused on the \u201copinion\u201d aspects of an absent radiologist\u2019s findings, while <em>Agha </em>focused largely on the \u201cfacts or data\u201d aspects of the hearsay findings in applying <em>Rule </em>703. As we will show, the overarching principle in both of these cases was the same: to disallow the substantive admission of hearsay assertions of a non-testifying radiologist for their truth, at least as to disputed or complex matters.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>In <em>Brun, supra, </em>we held that a radiologist\u2019s hearsay MRI report diagnosing a herniated disc could not be \u201cbootstrapped\u201d into evidence through expert testimony from a treating chiropractor over the objection of opposing counsel. 390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 421, 915 A.2d 1053. The chiropractor lacked the expertise to read the MRI films himself, and instead relied on the radiologist\u2019s finding. <em>Ibid. </em>The defense disputed the absent radiologist\u2019s interpretation of the films. Under those circumstances, we held that the complex nature of the disputed MRI prohibited an unqualified testifying expert from conveying the absent radiologist\u2019s findings to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 421-24, 915 A.2d 1053. In reaching that determination, we applied <em>Nowacki </em>and other cases reflecting the principles now codified in <em>Rule </em>808:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">[W]e agree with the judge that, <em>on objection, interpretation of an MRI may be made only by a physician qualified to read such films, and that the MRI report, could not be bootstrapped into evidence through [the testifying chiropractor\u2019s] testimony. </em>Our conclusion is not dependent on [the witness\u2019s] status as a chiropractor but on the complexity of MRI interpretations. While there are numerous cases that support the admission of medical reports under the business records exception to the hearsay rale ... in <em>[Matulemcz, supra,] </em>the Court made it clear that it is \u201cthe degree of complexity of the procedures utilized in formulating the conclusions expressed in the [expert\u2019s] report\u201d that determines its admissibility under the business records exception. 101 <em>N.J. </em>27, 30 [499 A.2d 1363]. We have held that before introducing complex medical reports pursuant lo <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6), <em>the ability of the opposing side to cross-examine the author' of such a report must be assured. [Nowacki, supra, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 282-83, 652 A.2d 758]. In <em>Nowacki, </em>we held that it is \u201cclearly established that medical opinions in hospital records should not be admitted under the business records exception where the opponent will be deprived of an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant on a critical issue such as the basis for the diagnosis or cause of the condition in question.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">Thus, <em>MatuleuAcz </em>and <em>Nowacki </em>provide a basis for denying the admission of [the radiologist\u2019s] MRI report under the business records exception, <em>became of the complexity of reading MRIs and diagnosing damage to the back and, spine </em>.... Indeed, in the present case three qualified physicians all read plaintiffs MRI in different ways, showing the nuanced difficulty inherent in interpreting such images. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Additionally, as noted, admitting [the radiologist\u2019s] MRI report without calling him as a witness would deprive defendants of the ability to cross-examine the author of the report on the central issue of the case, namely plaintiffs herniation, in contravention of <em>Nowacki </em>In those circumstances, [the radiologist\u2019s] MRI report was, on objection, inadmissible hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\"><em>[Brun, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 421-22, 915 A.2d 1053 (emphasis added) (certain citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In addition, we rejected plaintiffs argument in <em>Brun </em>that the absent radiologist\u2019s disputed findings could be presented to the jury under <em>Rule </em>703 as \u201cfacts or data.\u201d We observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3\">in <em>Day v.

This attempted circumvention of the Evidence Rules was properly denied by the trial judge. </em>To repeat, this determination is not because the witness was a chiropractor. The same result would have obtained if the witness were a medical doctor unqualified to interpret an MRI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\"><em>[Brun, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 423-24, 915 A.2d 1053 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">More recently, the Supreme Court in <em>Agha, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 50, 965 A.2d 141, applied similar restrictive principles in limiting the ability of a testifying expert to convey to a jury the complex and disputed opinions of a non-testifying radiologist. The plaintiff had been injured in a motor vehicle accident. <em>Id. </em>at 53, 965 A.2d 141. At trial, the central dispute was over whether his injuries vaulted the permanency requirement of the AICRA verbal threshold, and, in particular, whether the accident had caused him to sustain a herniated disc. <em>Ibid. </em>In the course of the plaintiffs care, an MRI study of his spine was conducted. <em>Ibid. </em>A radiologist who interpreted that MRI issued a report, stating that the MRI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>showed a herniated disc between the L5-S1 vertebrae. <em>Ibid. </em>The radiologist was not called as a witness at trial. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed plaintiffs two testifying experts, a chiropractor and an anesthesiologist, to refer in their testimony to the radiologist\u2019s finding of a herniated disc. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial court allowed those references to the radiologist\u2019s hearsay report under <em>Rule </em>703, despite the fact that the chiropractor was not qualified to read MRI films, and the anesthesiologist, although qualified to do so, had not reviewed the plaintiffs films himself. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The Court reaffirmed in <em>Agha </em>the core principle, which we also had quoted in <em>Brun, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 422-23, 915 A.2d 1053, that \u201c[ajlthough <em>[Rule </em>703] permits a hearsay statement, such as a medical report by a non-testifying expert, to be referred to by a testifying expert for the purpose of apprising the jury of the basis for his opinion, it does not allow expert testimony to serve as \u2018a vehicle for the \u201cwholesale [introduction] of otherwise inadmissible evidence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Agha, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 63, 965 A.2d 141 (quoting <em>State v. Vandeweaghe, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 480-81, 799 A.2d 1 (App.Div.2002) (alteration in original) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>229, 827 A.2d 1028 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The Court elaborated that \u201c[w]hen the purpose of <em>[Rule </em>703] is taken into consideration, the only fair interpretation is that it was not intended as a conduit through which the jury may be provided the results of contested out-of-court expert reports.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Hence, \u201can expert may give the reasons for his opinion and the sources on which he relies, but that testimony does not establish <em>the substance </em>of the report of a non-testifying physician.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 965 A.2d 141 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The Court cited with approval our opinion in <em>Brun, </em>and our disapproval of improper \u201cbootstrapping\u201d of a non-testifying expert\u2019s findings on complex and disputed matters. <em>Ibid. </em>Consistent with <em>Brun, </em>the Court declared it essential that the testifying expert possess the credentials to interpret the MRI films, and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>that he or she have personally reviewed those films. <em>Id. </em>at 67, 965 A.2d 141. As the Court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">Only a physician who was qualified by education or training to interpret the films and, in fact, did so, could have brought the herniation conclusion to the jury as a matter of substance____[To permit otherwise over an adversary\u2019s objection] would violate the hearsay rules; contravene the standards governing expert testimony by allowing an expert to testify beyond his qualifications; and, most importantly, would defeat the cross-examination that is the bedrock of our adversary system. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The Court further underscored in <em>Agha </em>the importance of a limiting instruction to the jury in situations where a testifying expert identifies or alludes to the sources upon which he or she has professionally relied. Such an instruction is necessary to assure that the jurors do not improperly consider those outside sources for their truth. \u201c[W]here an expert references the report of a non-testifying expert to explain the basis of his or her own opinion, it is <em>incumbent </em>upon the trial judge, upon request, to instruct the jury regarding its limited use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63-64, 965 A.2d 141 (emphasis added) (citations omitted); <em>see also N.J.R.E. </em>105 (authorizing limiting instructions). \u201cEven in the absence of [such] a request, the judge should give a limiting instruction sua sponte where it is necessary to avoid an unjust result.\u201d <em>Agha, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 63-64 n. 7, 965 A.2d 141 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">We now apply these principles to the three events during this trial that are the subject of plaintiff\u2019s appeal: (1) the testimony by plaintiffs orthopedic expert, Dr. Zabinski, on direct examination, presented to the jury without objection, that his finding of a disc bulge was \u201cconsistent\u201d with the finding in the report of Dr. Falciani, the non-testifying radiologist; (2) the disallowed attempt by plaintiffs counsel to cross-examine defendant\u2019s testifying orthopedic expert, Dr. Cristini, about the radiologist\u2019s contrary findings of a bulge; and (3) the disallowed attempt by plaintiffs counsel in summation to remind the jurors that his expert\u2019s findings of a bulge were consistent with those of Dr. Falciani.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>In dealing with these three related episodes, the trial judge rightly was concerned about adhering to the strictures of <em>Rules </em>703 and 808 and the applicable case law, including <em>Agha, Brun </em>and <em>Nowacki </em>The judge concluded that in all three instances, plaintiffs counsel was attempting to convey to the jurors the substance of Dr. Falciani\u2019s out-of-court findings. Although we agree with the trial judge\u2019s perception of impropriety respecting the substantive misuse of Dr. Falciani\u2019s report, several additional considerations, some of them procedural in nature, need to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We begin the assessment by emphatically stating our agreement with the trial judge that it would have been improper for plaintiffs counsel to attempt to use either the testimony of Dr. Zabinski on direct examination, or the testimony of Dr. Cristini on cross-examination, as a conduit for the substantive admission of Dr. Falciani\u2019s hearsay opinion finding of a disc bulge. The conduit prohibition, which the Supreme Court strongly reaffirmed in <em>Agha, </em>cannot be circumvented in the guise of questions asking about the \u201cconsistency\u201d or \u201cinconsistency\u201d of a testifying expert\u2019s own opinions with the hearsay opinions of an expert who does not testify at trial. Such circumvention destroys the clear objectives of the prohibition. <em>Cf. State v. Frisby, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>583, 811 A.2d 414 (2002) (disallowing circumvention of the hearsay prohibition by asking a witness whether facts were \u201csubstantiated\u201d by the hearsay declarants that he interviewed).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">As a leading treatise on evidence law has observed, in the analogous context of the federal rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">While an expert may consider remote [i.e., out of court] statements that are not admitted and may be inadmissible, he cannot properly act as a conduit by presenting an opinion that is not his own opinion but that of someone else, <em>and should not testify that others agree with him as a means of vouching for or reinforcing any opinion of his own that he presents, at least in relation to central or contested matters. </em>The purpose of <em>[F.R.B.] </em>70S is to broaden the basis for expert opinion, but it is not enough that an expert repeats what he read or was told, even if he respects or trusts the people he read or listened to. The distinction between relying on others and repeating what others say can be made clearer as a formal matter by requiring the expert to say \u201cwhat he thinks,\u201d not what \u201csomeone else thinks,\u201d and insisting on this formality is useful in weeding out eases where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>expert has no independent view and being sure that the trier [of fact] gets the expert\u2019s own opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">[C. Mueller <em>&amp; </em>L. Kirkpatrick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 7.10 (4th ed.2009) (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\"><em>See also Krohn v. N.J. Full Ins. Underwriters, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>477, 486, 720 A.2d 640 (App.Div.1998), <em>certif. denied, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>74, 726 A.2d 937 (1999) (observing that \u201c[a]n expert witness should not be allowed to relate the opinions of a nontestifying expert merely because those opinions are congruent with the ones he has reached\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">To be sure, plaintiffs testifying orthopedist in this case, Dr. Zabinski, was indisputably qualified to review the CT scan, and he properly asserted to the jury his own independent opinion that plaintiff had suffered a disc bulge as a result of the accident. That opinion was countered by the contrary opinion of the defense orthopedist, Dr. Cristini, who likewise was qualified to read the CT scan and did so as well, reaching a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The admissibility problem here stemmed from plaintiffs effort, in effect, to use the hearsay opinion of Dr. Falciani substantively as a \u201ctie breaker,\u201d providing the jury with a third opinion on the hotly disputed subject. The radiologist\u2019s opinion was not subjected to cross-examination and the jury was not afforded a chance to observe his testimonial demeanor. Instead, the substance of his opinion was being slipped in through the proverbial \u201cback door.\u201d Moreover, Dr. Falciani\u2019s opinion finding a disc bulge at L4-L5 was sufficiently complex in nature to trigger the limitations of <em>Rule </em>808. We have no reason to believe that the \u201cmotives, duties and interest[s]\u201d of Dr. Falciani were anything other than benign. By all indications, his professional review of the MRI films was presumably undertaken solely for a patient\u2019s diagnosis and treatment, and not set forth with any contemplation of litigation on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>part. We also do not question the \u201caccuracy\u201d of Dr. Falciani\u2019s opinions, other than to recognize, as we must, that defendant\u2019s board-certified orthopedic expert disagreed with his findings. Even so, we agree with the trial judge that the disputed opinions of Dr. Falciani were sufficiently complex and controversial to require them to be excluded from the jury\u2019s substantive consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">With respect to plaintiff\u2019s direct examination of his own expert, Dr. Zabinski, it is clear that plaintiff asked Dr. Zabinski about the \u201cconsistency\u201d of his findings with those of the radiologist for the purpose of having the jury, by these indirect means, to consider the substance of the radiologist\u2019s opinions \u201cfor their truth.\u201d The query, combined with the witness\u2019s affirmative response, triggered the third element of the basic definition of hearsay. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>801(c). In fact, this manner of inquiry is even more problematic because, through this shorthand means, the jury is fed what is essentially the \u201cnet opinion\u201d of the non-testifying radiologist, without being informed of the \u201cwhys and wherefores\u201d that support the radiologist\u2019s consistent finding. <em>See Davis v. Brickman Landscaping, Ltd., </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>395, 410, 98 A.3d 1173 (2014); <em>Pomerantz Paper Corp. v. New Cmty. Corp., </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>344, 372, 25 A.3d 221 (2011).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">A procedural wrinkle here is that defense counsel did not object to the consistency question when it was posed at the de bene esse deposition. <em>See Rule </em>4:14-9(1). Plaintiff asserts that he was surprised when the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard this testimony, and that he would have called Dr. Falciani (and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>presumably would have paid Dr. Falciani the appropriate expert witness fee) had he known this portion of the recorded deposition was going to be excluded. However, plaintiffs <em>Rule </em>4:25-7 submission <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> did not list Dr. Falciani as a trial witness, even provisionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Moreover, once he learned that the court was disallowing use of the consistency testimony, plaintiff did not seek an interim adjournment of the trial to attempt to secure Dr. Falciani\u2019s appearance or de bene esse deposition. Although we recognize that this was a one-day case and that the defense almost certainly would have opposed such a mid-trial request,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> plaintiffs failure to even seek such potential relief weakens his present claim that the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling seriously undermined his trial strategy. Instead, it seems quite likely that plaintiff never intended to call Dr. Falciani, and that he simply expected to use the \u201cconsistency\u201d and \u201cinconsistency\u201d queries of the testifying experts as an alternative (and less onerous) method of getting the radiologist\u2019s findings before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Plaintiffs attempted cross-examination of the defense expert, Dr. Cristini, about the radiologist\u2019s contrary findings involves a somewhat more nuanced hearsay analysis. To the extent the attempted cross was designed to get before the jury a second time the <em>substance </em>of Dr. Falciani\u2019s findings, that effort would similarly trigger the third element of the hearsay definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>We are mindful that if the proffer for the cross were less ambitious, the testimony theoretically might not involve a prohibited hearsay use under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>801(c). In particular, if the sole limited purpose of this portion of the cross was to show that the defense expert\u2019s review of the patient\u2019s records was skewed or incomplete, such a line of inquiry arguably would amount to simply impeachment of the defense expert\u2019s credibility, an attack that does not hinge upon the actual truth of the absent declarant\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Such impeachment to expose the weaknesses of an expert\u2019s testimony potentially might assist in the search for the truth, one of the recognized goals of our law of evidence. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>102. <em>See, e.g., State v. Basil, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>570, 591, 998 A.2d 472 (2010) (\u201cOur legal system has long recognized that cross-examination is the \u2018greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Green, supra, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>at 158, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d at 497 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The probative significance of such impeachment arguably might be greater where, as here, the testifying expert has disregarded or discounted findings of a physician who is part of the patient\u2019s treatment team rather than findings of an expert physician only retained for litigation. The mere presence of a treating doctor\u2019s finding in a patient\u2019s medical file, irrespective of the actual soundness (or \u201ctruth\u201d) of that finding, could be viewed, at least in theory, as probative, comprising a form of notice to an expert who subsequently reviews that file. A plaintiff might plausibly want to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>argue that the defense expert should have been more cautious before reaching a contrary finding, having been made aware of what the treating doctor had found.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">On the other hand, we have held, as a general if not immutable proposition, that \u201c[i]t is improper to cross-examine a witness about inadmissible hearsay documents<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> upon which the expert has not relied in forming his opinion.\u201d <em>Corcoran v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 130, 711 A.2d 371 (App.Div.1998) (citing <em>State v. Pennington, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>547, 577-83, 575 A.2d 816 (1990), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Brunson, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>377, 625 A.2d 1085 (1993)); <em>see also Villanueva v. Zimmer, </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 320, 69 A.3d 131 (App.Div.2013) (similarly recognizing that \u201cgenerally\u201d it is improper to engage in such cross-examination).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Here, Dr. Cristini did not rely on Dr. Falciani\u2019s radiology report, even though he repeated (albeit without commentary) the radiologist\u2019s finding of a bulge in his own first expert report. That said, we recognize that an expert\u2019s refusal to rely on or consider such identified material may, in and of itself, be some evidence of the expert\u2019s alleged bias or lack of thoroughness.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Theory aside, the probative value of such a line of impeachment must be carefully weighed against the very realistic potential for juror confusion, undue prejudice, and other countervailing considerations under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403. If the absent expert\u2019s opinions are not in evidence, there is a significant danger that the jurors will misuse that proof substantively in spite of a limiting instruction. We have serious doubts that most jurors in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>particular context will be able to understand and follow an instruction that advises them to consider the absent radiologist\u2019s findings \u201conly for impeachment, but not for their substance.\u201d The perils of such misuse are increased in closing arguments, as we envision that even counsel attempting to make legitimate reference to the absent radiologist\u2019s findings as grounds for impeachment will be hard-pressed to do so without suggesting, at least by implication, that the jury should use the radiologist\u2019s findings for their truth as an expert tie-breaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Given these dangers of misuse, and also because the proffer of plaintiffs cross-examination of Dr. Cristini in this particular case was not limited to strictly non-substantive impeachment, we conclude that <em>Rule </em>4Q5 bars the attempted cross-examination of Dr. Cristini.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The defense expert was asked by opposing counsel what he \u201clearn[ed]\u201d from the \u201cresults\u201d of the CT scan, a query plainly designed to get before the jury the substance of Dr. Falciani\u2019s opinions. The questions, and the responses that they sought\u2014 inevitably delving into the substance of the CT study \u2014 was improper because any hypothetical probative value it may have had for impeachment was \u201csubstantially outweighed\u201d by the risks of unfair prejudice and juror confusion. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Although we do not categorically rule out in all cases the strictly-impeachment use of a treating expert\u2019s contrary hearsay findings during the cross-examination of a testifying expert, we agree that the cross-examination here improperly sought to elicit the contents of Dr. Falciani\u2019s opinions for their truth. Indeed, it is well settled that \u201c[t]he law places limits on cross-examination for reasons of both practicality and logic.\u201d <em>State v. Silva, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>438, 444, 621 A.2d 17 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>438, 621 A.2d 17 (1993); <em>see also </em>1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 49 (Strong ed., 4th ed.1992) (noting that considerations of \u201cconfusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue consumption of time, and unfair prejudice\u201d may justify restricting a cross-examination that attempts to impeach a witness with extrinsic evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We lastly consider plaintiffs counsel\u2019s attempt to argue the consistency point in his summation. To be sure, the objection from defense counsel to this point should have come sooner, ideally at Dr. Zabinski\u2019s deposition. Nonetheless, the trial court reasonably acted with vigilance in assuring that the jury was not asked by plaintiffs counsel to consider the hearsay evidence in a substantive manner, and thereby risk a tainted verdict. <em>See Kotler v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>372, 380-81, 954 A.2d 514 (App.Div.2008) (vacating a verdict and remanding for a new trial where inadmissible evidence had been presented and counsel \u201ccompounded\u201d the erroneous admission by referring to it in closing arguments).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">On the whole, the trial judge acted within his discretion in his sound application of the laws of evidence, as well as his corresponding cautionary instructions to the jury and the limitations he imposed on closing arguments. <em>Bender v.

We need not concern ourselves with those Confrontation Clause rulings in this civil context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b92-10\"> See our discussion of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b93-11\"> For instance, the facts or data might be barred under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403 (granting judges the discretion to exclude relevant evidence where countervailing factors such as undue prejudice or cumulativeness \u201csubstantially\u201d outweigh the evidence's probative value).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\"> We need not resolve here generically whether a radiologist's findings are most properly classified as \"opinions,\u201d as \"facts or data,\u201d or as some combina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>tion of the two. For the reasons we present here, the classification is inconsequential to the analysis because the guiding principles here under <em>Rules </em>808 and 703 are harmonious. In any event, Dr. Falciani\u2019s disputed finding of a disc bulge here clearly encompassed, at least to some degree, his subjective professional opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\"> To the extent that our opinion in <em>Macaluso, supra, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 355-56, 747 A.2d 830, might be read to allow such consistency testimony where a testifying expert has relied on the absent expert's findings on complex and contested matters, we disagree with that interpretation of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\"> That said, we discern no problem under <em>Rule </em>703 or <em>Rule </em>808 with the testifying expert disclosing to the jury the bare fact that he considered the absent radiologist's report, and not delving into or hinting at the report\u2019s contents. Such limited testimony may aid in showing the thoroughness of the testifying expert's review of the matter. Likewise, there would be no prohibition against the testifying expert simply stating, without elaboration revealing or suggesting the contents of the hearsay report, that he or she \"relied\u201d on it as part of his or her review. However, going beyond that boundary, over opposing counsel\u2019s objection, is impermissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\"> Since the <em>Rule </em>4:25-7 submissions are undated, we cannot tell whether they were exchanged before or after Dr. Zabinski\u2019s videotaped deposition. Even assuming, however, for sake of discussion, that plaintiff supplied his submission after Dr. Zabinski\u2019s deposition, he should not have assumed that the trial court would allow the substantive use of Dr. Falciani\u2019s hearsay findings in violation of the Rules of Evidence. The defense's <em>Rule </em>4:25-7 submission also placed plaintiff on notice that it would oppose such substantive use at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b102-9\"> We offer no views as to whether such a mid-trial request would have, or should have, been granted, recognizing that the defense would have especially resisted it if Dr. Falciani\u2019s discovery deposition had not been taken.
