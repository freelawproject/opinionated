Although the respective functions of these appellants and the traditional roles they have historically played have cast them as antagonists, they speak with one voice here. These parties have mounted a collective legal challenge to the Acting Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits\u2019 decision to refuse to implement the final determination of the Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (PFRS Board of Trustees), which found certain senior officer and longevity pay provisions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>collective bargaining agreements entered into by appellants were creditable compensation for pension purposes under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-l(26)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Thus, to be clear, we do not decide here whether the particular longevity pay provisions in these collective bargaining agreements constitute creditable compensation benefits as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-l(26)(a) or <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1. The singular legal question before us is this: Does the Acting Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits have the legal authority to refuse to implement a final decision of the PFRS Board of Trustees because the Acting Director has independently concluded that the decision of the PFRS Board of Trustees is legally incorrect? After reviewing the statutory scheme established by the Legislature in the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1 to -68, and the regulations promulgated by the PFRS Board of Trustees to administer this system, we conclude the answer to this question is unequivocally \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The Legislature vested the PFRS Board of Trustees with exclusive authority and \u201cresponsibility for the proper operation of the retirement system.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-13(a)(l). Although the Division of Pensions and Benefits has the power and responsibility to \u201cinvestigate increases in compensation reported for credit which exceed reasonably anticipated annual compensation increases for members of the retirement system!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 <em>cases :where a violation of the statute or rules is suspected shall be referred, to the Board. </em>\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1(d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The PFRS Board of Trustees has the authority to \u201cquestion the compensation of any member or retiree to determine its credibility where there is evidence that compensation reported as base salary may include extra compensation.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1(b). Only this court has the legal authority to overturn a final decision of the PFRS Board of Trustees in the context of an appeal filed by a member of the PFRS. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-1.7(a); <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(2). The action taken by the Acting Director in the cases before us lacked statutory or regulatory authority and was therefore ultra vires, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>without legal force or effect. <em>See Lourdes Med. Ctr. v. Bd. of Review, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>339, 378, 963 A.2d 289 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">We start our factual recitation with a brief overview of the longevity salary increase provisions in the various collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the municipalities and unions that have appealed the Acting Director\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\n<em>Town of Harrison</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">We have consolidated the following appeals affecting the Town of Harrison: <em>I/M/O Town of Harrison and PBA Local No. 22, </em>Docket No. A-0159-11; <em>I/M/O Town of Harrison and FOP, Lodge No. 116, </em>Docket No. A-0083-11; <em>I/M/O Town of Harrison and FMBA Local No. 22, </em>Docket No. A-0158-11; and <em>I/M/O Town of Harrison and FMBA Local No. 22, PBA Local No. 22, and SOA 22A, </em>Docket No. A-0195-11. The Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge No. 116 (FOP Lodge 116), Police Benevolent Association, Local No. 22 (PBA Local 22), and Firemen\u2019s Mutual Benevolent Association, Local No. 22 (FMBA Local 22) filed briefs in support of these appeals and join in each other\u2019s arguments. The Town of Harrison has also joined in these appeals challenging the action taken by the Acting Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\n<em>Police Officers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">FOP Lodge 116 identifies itself as \u201ca labor organization and representative within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-3(e).\u201d This appellant represents all uniformed officers in the Harrison Police Department holding the ranks of Sergeant, Lieutenant and Captain, for purposes of collective bargaining. In 2007, FOP Lodge 116 was certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for all superior officers employed by Harrison. FOP Lodge 116 entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Harrison, which was valid from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2011. Before 2007, PBA Local 22 represented police officers holding a supervisory rank.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Since 1999, the two principal bargaining agents representing superior officers in the Harrison Police Department<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> negotiated a provision in their collective bargaining agreements allowing for increases to officers\u2019 base salary contingent upon their years of service with the Town. This longevity clause provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"ao-dedup-0\">ARTICLE XVIII</p>\n<p id=\"az-dedup-0\">LONGEVITY</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">Section 1: In addition to wages, members shall receive longevity as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">After three years: Two (2%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">After five years: Four <em>(4%) </em>percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">After ten years: Six (6%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">After fifteen years: Eight (8%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">After twenty years: Ten (10%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-12\">Start of twenty-three years: Twelve (12%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-13\">Start of twenty-four years: Fourteen (14%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-14\">Section 2: Longevity will be paid in weekly salaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">This precise language was adopted in the Article XV-Longevity provision of the Harrison salary ordinance to mirror the provisions contained in the parties\u2019 collective negotiations agreement. Article XVIII was included, verbatim, in the contract between Harrison and PBA Local 22, effective January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2001. By letter dated June 15, 2000, Regina M. Trauner, the secretary of the PFRS Board of Trustees at the time, formally advised Harrison that the PFRS Board of Trustees found the \u201cstipend referred to in Article XIX Workday of the agreement\u201d was \u201cnot considered creditable for pension purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">Because Trauner did not mention the longevity provision in her June 15, 2000 letter, Harrison and FOP Lodge 116 inferred from this absence of criticism that the PFRS Board of Trustees had tacitly approved the longevity provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to FOP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Lodge 116, it and Harrison \u201ccontinued to negotiate successor agreements\u201d based on this \u201ctacit approval of the negotiated longevity provision[.]\u201d Article XVIII remained in the 2007-2011 collective bargaining agreement between FOP Lodge 116 and Harrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">By letter dated January 21, 2011, Michael R. Czyzyk, the Division\u2019s Supervisor, External Audits, informed Harrison\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) that the Division had determined \u201cthat the longevity compensation, as a component of the ordinance, is not creditable in its entirety for pension purposes as per <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:2-4.1.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As explained by External Audit Supervisor Czyzyk, the Division found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">that the longevity increment from 10% to 12% in the 23rd year of service and the longevity increment from 12% to 14% in the 24[th] year of service incrementally excessive compared to prior increases. Also, granting such an increase in the 23rd and 24th year of an employee\u2019s service is clearly being awarded in order to enhance that member\u2019s retirement benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Of particular relevance here, the Division also explained to Harrison\u2019s CFO that this determination was merely an interim step, subject to further scrutiny if the employees affected by it exercised their rights to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">The Division will not implement this Administrative determination until 90-days have elapsed from the date of this letter to permit any members who wish to appeal adequate time to do so. Please provide a copy of this letter to all employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>and retirees who are affected by this determination. Any affected member who disagrees with the determination may appeal to the PERS Board of Trustees by writing a letter setting forth the reasons thereof. The appeal should be directed to the attention of Kathleen Coates, Board Secretary to the PERS Board of Trustees, at the address on the letterhead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Despite references in the letter to the right to appeal to the Public Employee Retirement System (PERS) Board of Trustees, by letters dated March 25, 2011 and August 16, 2002, the Division acknowledged the PFRS Board of Trustees\u2019 jurisdiction to hear appeals from its administrative determination. In fact, in his March 25, 2011 letter, Czyzyk acknowledged that \u201cHarrison [Town] employees enrolled in the PFRS have filed appeals after receiving the Division\u2019s <em>January 21, 2011 correspondence.\u201d </em>Thus, \u201c[i]n order to provide both the PERS and PFRS Trustees with a complete record of the matter,\u201d Czyzyk requested Harrison to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">please forward to my attention ... all contracts, agreements, including addendums and sidebar agreements currently in-force as well as individual agreements and ordinances for all individuals or groups of individuals affected by a longevity provision as described in the Division\u2019s <em>January 21, 2011 correspondence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">In accordance with the instructions in Czyzyk\u2019s January 21, 2011 letter, on April 12, 2011, FOP Lodge 116 appealed the Division\u2019s \u201cadministrative determination\u201d to the PFRS Board of Trustees. On April 15, 2011, the Secretary to the PFRS Board of Trustees informed the parties that the appeal would be considered on May 2, 2011. By letter dated May 5, 2011, the PFRS Board of Trustees issued a final decision, which approved the longevity schedule and rejected the Division\u2019s \u201cadministrative determination\u201d reflected in Czyzyk\u2019s January 21, 2011 letter. The letter, signed by the PFRS Board of Trustees\u2019 Secretary, Wendy Jami-son, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Based <em>on </em>a <em>review of </em>the pertinent documents, the PFRS Board voted to approve the longevity schedule as cited in Article XVIII of the current contract dated January 1,2007 to December 31, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">Consequently, there will be no change in any <em>of </em>the retiree\u2019s monthly PFRS retirement allowances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Nearly three months after the PFRS Board of Trustees\u2019 final decision, Florence J. Sheppard, the Division\u2019s then Acting Director, sent a letter dated July 27, 2011, addressed to the attorneys representing the affected parties. After reinstating the analysis reflected in Czyzyk\u2019s January 21, 2011 letter, Sheppard informed the parties that \u201cthe Division will not implement the decision of the Board to permit such increases as creditable for pension retirement credit.\u201d Sheppard concluded her letter by informing the recipients, \u201c[y]ou have the right to appeal this final administrative action to the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, within 45 days of the date of this letter in accordance with the <em>Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">FOP Lodge 116, PBA Local 22, and the Town of Harrison have appealed to this court, arguing the Acting Director did not have the legal authority to refuse to implement a final decision of the PFRS Board. They seek an order from this court directing the Division to implement the PFRS Board of Trustees\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\n<em>Firefighters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Harrison FMBA Local 22 describes itself as \u201cthe exclusive bargaining representative for uniformed employees in the Fire Department of the Town of Harrison below the rank of Chief.\u201d FMBA Local 22 and Harrison entered into a collective bargaining agreement effective January 1, 2007 through December 81, 2011. Article XX of that agreement contains a longevity provision identical to the provision in the contract between Harrison and the bargaining agents that represented the police officers described <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">According to FMBA Local 22, Harrison has had a longevity program since at least 1976. In a certification submitted in this appeal, Harrison Fire Department Battalion Chief and former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>FMBA president Michael Greene describes the history of longevity pay in the FMBA\u2019s contracts is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">From 1976 to 1983, all Town employees received the following longevity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">After five years Two (2%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anc\">After ten years Four (4%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apq-dedup-0\">After fifteen years Six (6%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE4\">After twenty years Eight (8%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">In 1984, the longevity provision of the FMBA agreement was as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">After three (3) years One (1%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"af-dedup-0\">After five (5) years Three (3%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aki-dedup-0\">After ten (10) years Five (5%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaL\">After fifteen (15) years Seven (7%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIg\">After twenty-two (22) years Nine (9%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">In 1985 ...:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">After three (3) years Two (2%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAx\">After five (5) years Four (4%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO8\">After ten (10) years Six (6%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA-\">After fifteen (15) years Eight (8%) percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au3\">After twenty-two (22) years Ten (10%) percent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">The longevity schedule increased throughout the years until about January 1, 1996, when the current formula was adopted. According to Greene, \u201c[t]his formula for longevity is the <em>same as the current longevity schedule </em>and has been in at least five (5) collective negotiations agreements, including the current one which expires December 31, 2011.\u201d Stated differently, these longevity provisions have been considered creditable compensation for pension purposes, allowing retired firefighters to receive pension benefits inclusive of longevity since 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">FMBA Local 22 asserts that the Division has reviewed and acquiesced to the creditability for pension purposes of these same longevity provisions on multiple prior occasions. The record before us contains a letter dated August 16, 2002, written by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>External Audit Supervisor Czyzyk to the Harrison Town Clerk. Czyzyk informed the Clerk in this letter that the audit section of the Division had determined that several provisions of the FMBA Local 22 contract applicable from January 1,1999 through December 31, 2002, including the longevity provision, were \u201cin violation\u201d of the creditable compensation provision, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The record before us concerning how this 2002 notice of \u201cviolation\u201d from Czyzyk was addressed and resolved by Harrison and FMBA Local 22 is murky at best. The paper trail in support of appellants\u2019 position consists of a series of contemporaneous correspondence from the attorneys representing both FMBA Local 22 and Harrison memorializing telephone discussions and agreements allegedly reached with a Division representative named JoAnn E. Martin. The three outstanding issues were identified by the attorney representing FMBA Local 22 in his October 1, 2002 letter to the attorney representing Harrison:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">1. Fire Sub-Code Official Stipend. A letter from the Town clarifying the actual title would resolve the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">2. Execution of Side Agreement clarifying holiday pay in base pay would resolve the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">3. <em>Longevity issue sent to Committee on Creditable Compensation for review.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agg\">(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">The record does not contain a direct indication that Harrison reached an agreement with the Division addressing the longevity issue highlighted in Item 3 above. The record is equally barren of any correspondence or notice of violation from the Division on the longevity issue during the nine-year period from 2002 to 2011. However, whether Harrison and FMBA Local 22 reached an agreement with the Division concerning the violation referred to by Czyzyk in 2002 is not relevant to the question before us. As we made clear in our prefatory remarks, this appeal is limited to a single legal question: whether the Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits has the legal authority to refuse to implement a final decision reached by the PFRS Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">On January 21, 2011, the same date Czyzyk announced his decision to FOP Lodge 116 regarding the longevity provisions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the agreement with the police officers, he communicated the same determination that FMBA Local 22\u2019s longevity provision was not creditable for pension purposes under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:2-4.1. On April 18, 2011, FMBA Local 22 appealed the Division\u2019s January 21, 2011 \u201cadministrative determination\u201d to the PFRS Board of Trustees. On May 2, 2011, the PFRS Board of Trustees rejected the Division\u2019s determination and approved the longevity schedule cited in the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Consistent with the position she took with respect to the longevity provision in the collective bargaining agreement involving the police officers, the Acting Director announced the Division would not implement the decision of the PFRS Board of Trustees with respect to the longevity provisions in the agreement Harrison entered into with FMBA Local 22. In fact, the Acting Director used nearly identical language in the letter affecting the firefighters.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">On August 5, 2011, the attorneys representing FMBA Local 22 wrote to the Acting Director to express their disagreement with her decision to disregard the final determination of the PFRS Board of Trustees. The firefighters also disagreed that her unprecedented, unilateral decision was reviewable as of right by this court under <em>Rule </em>2:2-3(a)(2). The Acting Director did not respond to FMBA Local 22\u2019s letter. FMBA Local 22 now appeals to this court seeking the same relief sought by the Town of Harrison and the Unions representing the police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\n<em>City of Linden</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">The appeals involving Linden relate to the collective bargaining agreement Linden entered into with FMBA Local 234 effective January 1, 2005. FMBA Local 234 and Linden also have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) covering the period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013. The first provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>at issue in this case involves Article VIII Section D of the parties\u2019 now expired collective bargaining agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">D. <em>Senior Fire Officer Differential</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">Effective January 1, 2000, Fire officers who have completed their twentieth (20th) year of service with the City of Linden shall receive a Senior Fire Officer Differential in the amount of $1,500.00 per year to be paid in equal bi-weekly installments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Article VIII of the agreement, effective January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> also includes the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">C. <em>Senior Deputy Chief Differential</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">Effective January 1, 2010, Senior Officer Pay shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">Beginning of 14th year of service: $1,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgC\">Beginning of 21st year of service: $1,750.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ago\">Beginning of 24th year of service: $2,250.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">Said pay shall be non-cumulative and paid in equal bi-weekly installments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">By letters dated January 15, 2010 and March 18, 2010, Division auditor Jean C. Monahan began reviewing the collective bargaining agreement Linden had entered into with FMBA Local 234, effective January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008. Monahan asked Linden\u2019s Labor Relations Specialist, attorney Allan C. Roth, whether \u201ccompensation associated\u201d with the Senior Fire Officer Differential reflected in Article VIII, Section C was \u201creported as creditable salary for pension purposes[.]\u201d Neither Roth nor any other representative of Linden responded to Monahan\u2019s requests for \u201cclarification\u201d of the compensation awarded to firefighters under this provision of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">On October 19, 2010, Supervisor of External Audits Czyzyk wrote Roth, in his capacity as Linden\u2019s legal representative, advising him that \u201c[a]fter careful review\u201d of the collective bargaining agreement and the MOU, the Division had made \u201can administrative determination\u201d that these agreements contained provisions \u201cthat <em>may be in violation </em>of the statutes and regulations which set forth those forms of compensation that are creditable for pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>purposes. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1(a)(l) and (2).\u201d (Emphasis added). Czyzyk specifically noted that \u201c[t]he Division finds that senior officer compensation payable in the 20th, 21st and 24th year of service is extra compensation received in anticipation of retirement and in violation of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1(a)l and 2(ix) and (xiii).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">As he did in his correspondence with the Town of Harrison, Czyzyk concluded his letter to Roth with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ-\">The Division will not implement this Administrative determination until 90 days have elapsed from the date of this letter to permit any members who wish to appeal adequate time to do so. Please provide a copy of this letter to all employees and retirees who are affected by this determination. Any affected member who disagrees with the determination may appeal to the PFRS Board of Trustees by writing a letter setting forth the reasons thereof....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>You should not make a.ny adjustments to the creditable salary you currently report on these members until the end of the 90-day appeal period. ...</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\"><em>At the end of the 90-day period, if no outstanding appeals are pending or if no action was taken by the PFRS Board of Trustees, the Division will instruct you to change the creditable salary reported to conform to this determination. ... </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Linden sought to appeal the Division\u2019s October 19, 2010 determination in a letter addressed to Czyzyk dated January 17, 2011. Linden also included in this letter-appeal the \u201cadditional information\u201d Czyzyk had requested nearly two months earlier. In his capacity as Linden\u2019s Labor Relations Specialist counsel, Roth claimed that the Senior Deputy Chief Differential was negotiated after the agreement had been submitted to arbitration. According to Roth, the arbitrator \u201cawarded senior officer pay, in lieu of increasing or re-establishing longevity.\u201d Thus, under the collective bargaining agreements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">[N]o employee hired after December 31, 1974 was entitled to receive longevity. However, with the arbitrator\u2019s award of compensation entitled \u201csenior officer pay\u201d all uniformed fire department employees are entitled to fthisj pay, which was and is now paid as part of salary through the City\u2019s bi-weekly pay system. Therefore, the City and the FMBAs believe the pay to be pensionable and in compliance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:17-4:4.1(iv).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>On March 18, 2011, FMBA Local 234 submitted a letter in support of Linden\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">On May 2, 2011, the PFRS Board of Trustees reversed the Division\u2019s administrative determination and found the senior officer pay differentials to be creditable compensation for pension purposes. Once again, the Division\u2019s Acting Director refused to implement the PFRS Board of Trustees\u2019 final decision. In her letter dated July 27, 2011, the Acting Director again found the \u201cindividual salary adjustments\u201d were \u201cgranted primarily in anticipation of the member\u2019s retirement,\u201d in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-l(26)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">As was the case with respect to the Town of Harrison, FMBA Local 234 objected to the Acting Director\u2019s unilateral determination. The Acting Director did not respond. FMBA Local 234 filed this appeal thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\n<em>Vernon Township</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Vernon Township entered into a collective negotiations agreement (CNA) with PBA Local 285 effective January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011. The disputed provisions at issue in this appeal are found in Article XVII of that agreement, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">A. The salaries from Employees covered by this AGREEMENT shall be as set forth on Schedule A annexed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">B. The differential between ranks shall be ten (10%) percent above the prior grade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">E. An Officer having twenty (20) years of service within the meaning of the Police and Fire Retirement System or having fifteen (15) years of service with Vernon Township and ten (10) years of Law Enforcement experience shall be elevated one-half (1/2) the distance in pay to the next higher rank, and this will be added to and become part of the Officer\u2019s base salary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">On May 20, 2010, Czyzyk wrote a letter to Vernon\u2019s Personnel Director, Pennie Roland, advising her that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>[a]fter careful review of the PBA Local # 285 Contract for the period January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011 ... the Division has made an administrative determination that the ... contract contains a provision that is causing monies to be included in the base salary reported to the Division that is not creditable for pension purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">After specifically identifying \u201cArticle XVII: Salaries: Paragraph E\u201d as the problematic provision, Czyzyk explained that the Division \u201cconsiders this to be compensation given to a member in anticipation of retirement.\u201d Czyzyk concluded his letter to Vernon\u2019s Personnel Director Roland with the same admonition he included in his communications with the Town of Harrison and the City of Linden. <em>(See supra, </em>Part I, at 9-11; and Part II, at 20-21). In the interest of clarity, Czyzyk concluded his letter by emphasizing the following three points: (1) the Division would not implement this action for ninety days to permit employees adequate time to appeal to the PFRS Board of Trustees; (2) the Township should not make any adjustment to the creditable salary until the end of the appeal period; and (3) the Division would instruct the Township how to implement its determination only <em>\u201cif no outstanding appeals [were] pending or if no action was taken by the PFRS Board of Trustees.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Following the Division\u2019s instructions, PBA Local 285 appealed the May 20, 2010 \u201cadministrative determination\u201d to the PFRS Board of Trustees on August 11, 2010. After an initial postponement to consider additional information submitted by PBA Local 285 concerning the financial impact of the terms of the contract, the PFRS Board of Trustees met on January 10, 2011, and formally determined the salary increases provided under Article XVII, Paragraph E of the CNA were compensable for pension purposes. The PFRS Board of Trustees communicated its decision in a letter dated January 12, 2011, from Wendy Jamison, Secretary to the PFRS Board of Trustees, to the attorneys representing PBA Local 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">After framing the legal question presented to the PFRS Board of Trustees by PBA Local 285 on behalf of the members affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>by the Division\u2019s initial administrative determination, Secretary Jamison wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\">The Board voted to approve your request to include Paragraph E above as creditable compensation in the PFRS. The Board considered the salary as an additional pay step of the salary scale as denoted on schedule A. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Internal and External Audit Sections of the Division to implement the Board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">More than seven months after the PFRS Board of Trustees\u2019 decision, Acting Director Florence Sheppard sent a letter dated July 27, 2011, to the attorneys representing PBA Local 285 advising them that \u201cthe Division will not implement the decision of the Board to permit such increases as creditable for pension retirement credit.\u201d The letter reflects that the Acting Director reached this decision after conducting a de novo review of the evidence presented to the PFRS Board of Trustees and engaging in her own independent legal analysis of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions. The Acting Director did not cite any legal authority to support her decision to refuse to implement the decision of the PFRS Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Consistent with the approach she employed in the eases involving the Town of Harrison and the City of Linden, the Acting Director concluded her letter by informing PBA Local 285 that: \u201cYou have the right, if you wish, to appeal this final administrative action to the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division ... in accordance with the <em>Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">By letter dated August 8, 2011, the attorneys representing PBA Local 285 asserted that \u201c[t]he Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits does not have the authority to determine what is and is not creditable salary and to ignore decisions of the PFRS Board.\u201d Citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1.2 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:l-l.l(g), PBA Local 285 argued the Director\u2019s role was limited to reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the positions covered by the retirement system and recommending to the PFRS Board of Trustees whether they should remain a covered position for pension purposes. Counsel concluded his letter to the Acting Director with the following request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">We also respectfully request that, while this dispute is pending, you suspend implementation of your July 27, 2011 determination for any PBA Local 285 collective negotiations unit member who is receiving a pension benefit base[d] on the inclusion of the disputed contractual clause. To reduce their pension benefits at this time, especially in light of recent legislation that will all but eliminate any pension COLA [Cost of Living Adjustment], will [wreak] havoc on the household budgets of these retirees who relied in good faith on the Division\u2019s calculation of their pension benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">Thank [you] for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The Acting Director did not respond to this letter. PBA Local 285 filed its Notice of Appeal with this court on August 31, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\n<em>Borough of Ramsey</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The Borough of Ramsey entered into a collective negotiations agreement (CNA) with PBA Local 155 covering the period of time from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2011. The CNA included a provision entitled <em>\u201cSalary Schedule </em>\u201d that provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">Senior Officer Pay status is a new category. After completing 23 years of service as a police officer, top step patrolmen will be placed in senior officer pay status. Annual salary for those in senior officer pay status will be salary that is midway between the salary for an 8th step patrolman and a sergeant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">The appellate record includes a Ramsey Police Department Proposed Salary Schedule from 2003 through 2006. Based on this salary schedule, \u201cmidway between the salary for an 8th step patrolman and a sergeant\u201d in 2002 would constitute an annual salary differential of approximately $3851.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Senior Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Pay differential in 2006 was approximately $4419.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Senior Officer Pay status was a new category, available only to those police officers who had completed twenty-three years of service; a top step patrol-officer was placed in senior officer pay status only after reaching this career milestone.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The case involving PBA Local 155 and Ramsey followed the same procedural pattern we have discussed at length in this opinion in Part I involving Harrison, Part II involving Linden, and Part III involving Vernon. By letter dated October 15, 2004, Czyzyk advised Ramsey Borough Administrator Nicholas C. Sanos that the Division viewed the \u201cSenior Officer Pay\u201d status \u201cas a salary adjustment granted primarily in anticipation of the member\u2019s retirement.\u201d As such, these salary increases were not creditable for pension purposes under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">As he did with respect to the other three municipalities, Czyzyk informed Borough Administrator Sanos that: (1) the Division would not implement this action for ninety days to permit employees adequate time to appeal to the PFRS Board of Trustees; (2) Ramsey should not make any adjustment to the creditable salary until the end of the appeal period; and (3) the Division would instruct Ramsey how to implement its determination only if no outstanding appeals were pending or if the PFRS Board of Trustees had not decided otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">PBA Local 155 appealed the Division\u2019s administrative action to the PFRS Board of Trustees. By letter dated July 12, 2011, PFRS Board of Trustees Secretary Wendy Jamison advised the attorneys representing PBA Local 155 that the Board had ruled in their chent\u2019s favor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Based on a review of the pertinent documents, the PFRS Board voted to approve the salary schedule as cited in the PBA Local No. 155 contract, Article III and Appendix I dated January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. The Board found the pay was an additional salary step as denoted in the salary guideline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">Consequently, there will be no change in any of the retiree\u2019s monthly PFRS retirement allowances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The PFRS Board of Trustees\u2019 decision in the appeal filed by PBA Local 155 triggered a considerably faster,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> albeit familiar reaction from Acting Director Sheppard. In a letter dated July 27, 2011, Sheppard engaged in the same de novo review of the record presented to the PFRS Board of Trustees and reached the opposite legal conclusion. In the Acting Director\u2019s opinion \u201call of the senior officer pay violates the provisions of the statute and regulation since the payments are clearly being awarded in order to enhance the member\u2019s retirement benefit \u2018upon attainment of a specified number of years of service.\u2019 \u201d Once again, Sheppard concluded her letter by apprising those affected by her decision that they had the right \u201cto appeal this final administrative action\u201d to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">By letter dated August 5, 2011, the attorney representing PBA Local 155 asked Sheppard the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">Please advise me on what authority your determination not to enforce the Board\u2019s decisions is considered the \u201cfinal administrative action\u201d in light of the existing Board of Trustees\u2019 decisions which have not been appealed to my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Sheppard did not respond. On September 6, 2011, PBA Local 155 filed a Notice of Appeal to this court seeking a judicial declaration that the Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits does not have the legal authority to refuse to implement a final decision of the PFRS Board of Trustees merely because the Director dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>agrees with the Board\u2019s decision. Consequently, Sheppard\u2019s decision refusing to implement the PFRS Board of Trustees\u2019 decision is ultra vires, without legal force or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>Township of Woodbridge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Woodbridge entered into a collective bargaining agreement with PBA Local 38 covering the period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011. Article V of this agreement is denoted \u201cSalaries.\u201d Paragraph B in Article V provides for a \u201cSenior Officer Differential.\u201d This provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">B. Senior Officer Differential \u2014 Employees having completed twenty-two (22) year\u2019s of service shall be entitled to a senior officer differential benefit. The benefit shall be an increase in the base pay rate by five and one-half percent (5.5%) and is reflected in the senior officers\u2019 base rate (1st Class)[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Article VII is denoted \u201cLongevity,\u201d and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">A. The Township agrees to pay as a fringe benefit the following longevity payments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">2.5% after the start of 6th and through completion of 10th year\u2019 or [sic] service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abc\">4% after start of 11th and through completion of 14th year of service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">5.5% after start of 15th and through completion of 20th year of service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">7% at start of 21st year through completion of 22nd year of service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">9.5% at start of 23rd year of service and each year thereafter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-15\">By letter dated January 20, 2011, Czyzyk advised Woodbridge Township Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Richard Cahill that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5q\">the Division has made an administrative determination that the agreement executed between the Township and the Woodbridge Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association, Local No. 38 contains provisions that may be causing monies to be included in the base salary reported to the Division that are not creditable for pension purposes as per <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4~4.1(a)(l) and (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">After quoting from the regulatory standard, Czyzyk cited Article V, Paragraph B \u201cSalaries-Senior Officer Differential\u201d from the agreement and stated, \u201c[t]he Division finds that senior officer compensation payable in the 22nd year of service is extra compensation received in anticipation of retirement and in violation of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1(a)(l) and (2)(ix) and (xiii).\u201d With respect to Article VII, Paragraph A \u201cLongevity,\u201d Czyzyk indicated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The Division finds that the longevity increment from 7% to 9.5% in the 23rd year of service incrementally excessive compared to prior increases. Also, granting such an increase in the 23rd year of an Officer\u2019s service is clearly being awarded in order to enhance that member\u2019s retirement benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">As he did when he sent similar letters to the other four municipalities involved in this appeal, Czyzyk concluded by informing Woodbridge CEO Cahill that: (1) the Division would not implement this action for ninety days to permit employees adequate time to appeal to the PFRS Board of Trustees; (2) Wood-bridge should not make any adjustment to the creditable salary until the end of the appeal period; and (3) the Division would instruct Woodbridge how to implement its determination only if no outstanding appeals were pending or if the PFRS Board of Trustees had not decided otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">PBA Local 38 followed Czyzyk\u2019s instructions and appealed the Division\u2019s January 20, 2011 administrative determination to the PFRS Board of Trustees. By letter dated May <em>5, </em>2011, PFRS Board Secretary Jamison informed the attorneys representing PBA Local 38 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">Based on a review of the pertinent documents, the PFRS Board voted to approve the senior officer differential as cited in Article V and the longevity schedule as cited in Article YII of the [collective bargaining] contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">Consequently, there will be no change in any of the retiree\u2019s monthly PFRS retirement allowances.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">By letter dated July 27, 2011,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Sheppard informed the attorneys representing PBA Local 38 that \u201cthe Division will not implement the decision of the Board to permit such increases as creditable for pension retirement credit.\u201d Once again, the Acting Director reached this conclusion after engaging in a de novo review of the evidence presented by PBA Local 38 to the PFRS Board of Trustees. Finally, as she had done in the cases involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the other four municipalities in this appeal, the Acting Director advised PBA Local 38 that it had \u201c45 days [from] the date of this letter\u201d to appeal her \u201cfinal administrative action\u201d to this court \u201cin accordance with the <em>Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">By the time the Acting Director made this decision, the law firm representing PBA Local 38 also represented the Town of Harrison and PBA Local 22, and the Borough of Ramsey and PBA Local 155. By letter dated August 5, 2011, the attorney for PBA Local 38 asked Sheppard the same question he had asked on behalf of PBA Local 155:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">Please advise me on what authority your determination not to enforce the Board\u2019s decisions is considered the \u201cfinal administrative action\u201d in light of the existing Board of Trustees\u2019 decisions which have not been appealed to my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Once again, the Acting Director did not respond. PBA Local 38 filed its appeal to this court on September 6, 2011, seeking a judicial declaration that the Acting Director\u2019s action in refusing to implement a final decision of the PFRS Board of Trustees is ultra vires, without legal force or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">All appellants argue the Acting Director did not have the authority to act unilaterally and refuse to implement a final decision reached by the PFRS Board of Trustees. We agree. Under the statutory and regulatory scheme established to administer this pension system, the PFRS Board of Trustees is the only administrative body authorized to make a final administrative determination regarding what can be considered \u201ccreditable compensation\u201d for pension benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(26)(a) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">The PFRS is \u201ca statewide pension system for full-time policemen and firemen designed to ensure the uniform protection of all such public officers through the medium of pensions payable from [the] fund.\u201d <em>Saccone v.

In that capacity, the Attorney General has questioned whether this court has the authority to compel the Division to abide by the PFRS Board of Trustees\u2019 final decision in these cases. The Attorney General argues that mandamus relief \u201cis only appropriate where the party seeks to compel a governmental agency to perform a \u2018duty [that] is ministerial and wholly free from doubt\u2019 or \u2018to compel the exercise of discretion, but not in a specific manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Twp. of Neptune v. State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>Prot., </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 434, 41 A.3d 792 (App.Div.2012) (citing <em>Loigman v.

Comm. of Middletown, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>287, 299, 687 A.2d 1091 (App.Div.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Following this line of reasoning, the Attorney General attempts to justify the unprecedented action taken by the Acting Director in these eases by advancing the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">While <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1(d) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:1-7.3 direct the Division to report any-suspected violations to the Board, nothing in the legislative and regulatory scheme compels the Division to accept \u201cclaims for benefits\u201d that clearly offend the statute. Indeed, \u201cadministrative agencies are ... charged under the State constitution with the responsibility of faithfully executing the laws.\u201d <em>In re Appeal of Certain Sections of the Uniform. Admin. Procedure Rules, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>85, 92-93 [447 A.2d 151] (1982) (citing <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. V, \u00a7 1,11 11).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s position on behalf of the Acting Director disregards that the Legislature unambiguously \u201cvested\u201d the PFRS Board of Trustees with \u201cthe general responsibility for the proper operation of the retirement system[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:16A-13(a)(l). As discussed in great detail infra, the composition of the PFRS Board of Trustees reveals the Legislature\u2019s intent to devise an administrative quasi-judicial body composed predominantly of private citizens. The men and women who serve as trustees on the PFRS Board are required to take an oath that they will discharge their responsibilities and exercise their legal authority \u201cdiligently and honestly,\u201d and \u201cwill not knowingly violate or willingly permit to be violated any <em>of the provisions of the law </em>applicable to the retirement system.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:16A-13(a)(3). In the regulatory system devised to implement this legislative mandate, the PFRS Board of Trustees has the exclusive authority to \u201cquestion the compensation of any member or retiree to determine its credibility where there is evidence that compensation reported as base salary may include extra compensation.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4r-4.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The Acting Director\u2019s refusal to implement the final decision of the PFRS Board of Trustees is untethered to any statutory or regulatory authority. This unprecedented ad hoc approach adopted by the Acting Director in these cases undermines the complimentary role the Division is obligated to play by providing the staffing support necessary to enable the PFRS Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Trustees to carry out its role as the final administrative arbiter of what constitutes creditable compensation for purposes of pension benefits. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1(d); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:l-7.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The PFRS Board of Trustees has acted as the final arbiter in these matters consistently since its creation by the Legislature. \u201c[T]he fact that the Legislature has not acted in response to an agency\u2019s interpretation or practice is \u2018granted great weight as evidence of its conformity with the legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Klumb v. Bd. of Educ. of Manalapan-Englishtown Reg\u2019l High Sch. Dist., Monmouth Cnty., </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>14, 24-25, 970 A.2d 354 (2009) (quoting <em>Malone v. Fender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>129, 137, 402 A.2d 240 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">We also question the role the Attorney General has played in these appeals. In our view, the position the Attorney General adopted in <em>Gladden v. Board of Trustees of the PERS, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 409 A.2d 294 (App.Div.1979), should have been followed in these cases. In <em>Gladden, </em>a World War II veteran who had served for many years in our State\u2019s Legislature applied for enrollment in the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System in May 1977. <em>Id. </em>at 366-67, 409 A.2d 294. The Attorney General advised the PERS Board \u201cthat under the governing statutes[,]\u201d based on the appellant\u2019s \u201ccontinuous permanent employment in the Legislature\u201d and his status as a veteran, the PERS Board was \u201cmandatorily required\u201d to enroll the appellant in the PERS, retroactive to 1958. <em>Id. </em>at 367, 409 A.2d 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The PERS Board steadfastly disregarded the Attorney General\u2019s legal opinion and refused to enroll the appellant into the PERS based on its interpretation of one of its own regulations. <em>Ibid. </em>The PERS Board notified the appellant of its decision, \u201cindicating that the decision was final and could be appealed to the Appellate Division.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thereafter, the Attorney General requested the PERS Board \u201cto reconsider its decision.\u201d Unfortunately, the PERS Board remained defiant and \u201cdenied the Attorney General\u2019s request for a reconsideration.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The appellant in <em>Gladden </em>appealed to this court. The PERS Board asked the Attorney General to represent its interests before this court. In response,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">the Attorney General reiterated to the Board that the issue involved was purely one of construction of the governing statutes; that the Attorney General\u2019s opinion on the legal issue was patently correct and binding on the Board, and that there was no arguable basis upon which the Board\u2019s decision could be defended in court. Accordingly, the Board was advised that the Attorney General would not provide it with legal representation in the courts at public expense and that a motion to intervene in support of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion would be filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\n<em>mm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The PERS Board in <em>Gladden </em>retained private counsel and filed an appeal from the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cdecision not to afford representation to the [PERS] Board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 868, 409 A.2d 294. The Attorney General moved to intervene on his own behalf as an appellant. <em>Ibid. </em>Ultimately, we granted the Attorney General\u2019s motion for leave to participate as amicus curiae, \u201cpermitted the individual members of the [PERS] Board to intervene on their own behalf,\u201d and denied the motions filed by the PERS Board\u2019s privately retained law firm to designate it as \u201cspecial counsel\u201d to the PERS Board and order the State to pay its legal fees in connection with the appeal. <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court denied the PERS Board\u2019s privately retained motions for leave to appeal our decisions. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">After deciding this flurry of motions, we reached the following decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">There can be no question that a refusal of a state agency to abide by a valid state law is a fundamental concern of the Attorney General both in his capacity and responsibility as adviser to the agency and in his capacity and responsibility as protector of the public. <em>Since the efforts of the Attorney General informally to convince the Board to abide by the statutory scheme and grant appellant\u2019s mandatory enrollment have met with not only unacceptance but defiance, the Attorney General has appeared \u201cto preserve his function and responsibility and to protect the public from arbitrary and illegal action. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 368-69, 409 A.2d 294 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">Here, by contrast, the Attorney General has not asserted he made any efforts, informal or otherwise, to advise the PFRS Board of Trustees that its decisions with respect to what eonsti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>tutes creditable compensation for pension purposes under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-l(26)(a) were legally incorrect and that there was no arguable basis upon which the PFRS Board\u2019s decisions could be defended in court. As we noted in <em>Gladden, </em>whether a state agency is abiding by a valid state law \u201cis a fundamental concern of the Attorney General both in his capacity and responsibility as adviser to the agency and in his capacity and responsibility as protector of the public.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Had the record in these appeals contained evidence of: (1) the Attorney General\u2019s efforts to advise the PFRS Board of Trustees of the proper legal interpretation of creditable compensation for pension purposes under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-l(26)(a), and (2) the PFRS Board of Trustees\u2019 defiant refusal to abide by the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, the proper action should have been for the Attorney General to petition this court under <em>Gladden </em>to compel the PFRS Board of Trustees to abide by the Attorney General\u2019s legal opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Instead, the Attorney General decided to represent and defend the legally untenable actions of the Acting Director to unilaterally refuse to implement the final decisions of the PFRS Board of Trustees. This approach is both legally unsupportable and completely unnecessary because it promotes ultra vires, self-help actions by the Acting Director and overlooks the lawful path the Attorney General could have followed under <em>Gladden.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The Legislature placed the Division of Pension and Benefits within the Treasury Department and appointed the State Treasurer or the deputy State Treasurer as a permanent member of the PFRS Board of Trustees. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A \u2014 13(a)(2)(b). Considering the five public members who are appointed by the Governor, <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:16A-13(a)(2)(a), the Legislature structured the PFRS Board of Trustees in a manner that gives the Executive Branch a permanent majority of six presumably \u201cdisinterested\u201d members on this eleven-member Board. Although the PFRS Board of Trustees can function and transact business with six members present, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-13(a)(6), there is no basis to presume the multiple permutations of the makeup of any six-member majority will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>necessary favor any particular point of view. Thus, as matter of fact, the composition of the PFRS Board of Trustees does not favor those most affected by its decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">However, we do not mean to suggest or imply there are valid reasons to question the objectivity or impartiality of the remaining five members of the PFRS Board of Trustees, merely because they are selected from the ranks of police officers and firefighters. We presume all of the members of the PFRS Board of Trustees will carry out their duties and obligations faithfully, impartially, and according to law, regardless of how they are selected. In fact, this court has a longstanding, well-established view that citizens who serve on these pension boards</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">are fiduciaries and therefore have a duty to protect the fund and the interests of all beneficiaries thereof. They must exercise due care, diligence and skill in administering the trust____It would not serve the statutory policy to pay out moneys to those not entitled thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\"><em>[Mount v.

The amount of pension benefits is based on the member\u2019s \u201cfinal compensation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-5(2)(b), (3). The term \u201cfinal compensation\u201d refers to the member\u2019s final year of service, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-l(28)(a), or, alternatively for newer PFRS members, the average of the three highest years of salary during all service years, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-l(28)(b). The word \u201ccompensation,\u201d is defined by statute as \u201cbase salary ... which is in accordance with established salary policies of the member\u2019s employer for all employees in the same position____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(26). The statute specifically excludes \u201cindividual salary adjustments which are granted primarily in anticipation of the member\u2019s retirement----\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>In plainer English, the statutes provide that PFRS pension benefits are to be calculated using the member\u2019s legitimate final or highest base salary and not enhancements in compensation intended to increase the member\u2019s retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The exclusion of atypical salary increases near the time of retirement \u201cprotect[s] the actuarial soundness of the pension fund by prohibiting the use of ad hoc salary increases intended to increase retirement allowances without adequate compensation to the [pension] fund----\u201d <em>In re Puglisi, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>529, 534, 897 A.2d 1015 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). According to the Division, the employing municipality and the employee do not contribute enough to the pension fund from short-term, pre-retirement salary increases to fund the higher pension benefits that will likely be payable over many years of retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">In the appeals currently before us, the Division questioned accelerated salary increments granted by the appellant municipalities after the PFRS members\u2019 twentieth year of service. For example, the Town of Harrison provides to its police officers an additional two-percent longevity increment every five years from completion of the fifth to the twentieth years of service. It then provides an additional two-percent increment at the start of the twenty-third year of service and yet one more two-percent increment at the start of the twenty-fourth year. <em>See ante </em>at 273, 112 A.3d at 1171. Thus, Harrison\u2019s longevity increments accelerate after the twentieth year, increasing by four percent in just three years and one day of additional service. Similarly, the City of Linden provides to some of its firefighters a $1,000 increment as \u201csenior officer pay\u201d beginning in the fourteenth year of service. It then provides another $1,750 beginning in the twenty-first year and still an additional $2,250 beginning in the twenty-fourth year of service. <em>See ante </em>at 280-81, 112 A.3d at 1175-76. The Division took the position that these later increments are granted in anticipation of the retirement of police officers and firefighters and should not increase their pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The unions that represent the PFRS members and the municipalities that negotiated those contract terms presented arguments and information to the PFRS Board of Trustees in opposition to the Division\u2019s position. The Board then ruled that the salary increments in dispute were not granted to enhance retirement benefits and should be included in calculating the pensions of retiring police officers and firefighters. The Acting Director of the Division disagreed with those rulings and declined to implement them. The court holds today that the Acting Director was not authorized by the Legislature to overrule the PFRS Board of Trustees. I agree with that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The court reaches no conclusion on the merits of the dispute, that is, whether the disputed longevity and seniority increments are consistent with the statutory definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d or are \u201cindividual salary adjustments ... primarily in anticipation of ... retirement,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:16A-1(26). <em>See ante </em>at 270-71, 112 A.3d at 1169-70. I, too, reach no conclusion on the merits of the dispute, noting as well that these appeals provide an inadequate factual record from which we might have decided the issue had it been properly before us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">My present concern is with the disparity in the administrative and judicial review process of such decisions by the PFRS Board of Trustees. It seems that an appeal can be taken only when the Board decides a matter against the interests of a PFRS member. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-1.7. In that circumstance, the member has a right to appeal the adverse decision to this court under <em>Rule </em>2:2-3(a)(2). However, if the decision of the PFRS Board favors the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>member, there seems to be no interested party who has a right to appeal. The employer municipality is not an interested adverse party because it negotiated the increments and is not itself responsible for paying the increased pension benefits during the members\u2019 years of retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">As these appeals illustrate, five municipalities and four unions joined together and \u201cspeak with one voice,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 270, 112 A.3d at 1169, in challenging the decisions of the Acting Director. Not only are the municipalities bound by the collective bargaining agreements they negotiated but they have a financial interest in the enforcement of those agreements. The municipalities pay the salary increments out of their own coffers for a limited number of years until the police officer or firefighter retires. Then the burden falls on the PFRS to pay the increased pension benefits for all the years of retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">By negotiating terms that provide favorable retirement benefits to their employees, the municipalities might obtain concessions in other areas of negotiations that benefit the municipalities financially. In <em>Board of Trustees of the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund of New Jersey v. La Tronica, </em>81 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 471, 196 A.2d 7 (App.Div.1963), <em>certif. denied, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>587, 197 A.2d 874 (1964), we described unusual salary arrangements in the final years of a public employee\u2019s active employment as the local employer\u2019s \u201cgrand gesture of farewell at little expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In these cases, the Acting Director claims she refused to implement the PFRS Board\u2019s decisions to protect the viability of the pension fund for all PFRS members. It seems, however, that the Legislature has afforded her, and the Executive Branch of State government, no right to review the PFRS Board\u2019s decisions or to appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">This court\u2019s decision today explains the statutory and regulatory provisions that establish the Division\u2019s and the PFRS Board\u2019s relative authority in addressing the matters in dispute. The Division\u2019s primary function is administrative. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-13(a)(8). It also has an investigatory and referral function when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>detects salary enhancements that may be contrary to the statutory definition of \u201ccompensation,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-4.1(d), but it does not have adjudicatory responsibilities or authority in determining what compensation should be credited for purposes of calculating a member\u2019s pension rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The court today holds that the Legislature has placed the adjudicative function and authority exclusively with the PFRS Board of Trustees. <em>Ante </em>at 297-98, 112 A.3d at 1186-87. I am not as certain as my colleagues that the Board\u2019s adjudicative authority is exclusive, but I agree that no statute, regulation, or case law cited to us grants the Acting Director power to review the Board\u2019s decisions. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>43:16A-13(a)(l) (\u201cthe general responsibility for the proper operation of the retirement system is hereby vested in a board of trustees----\u201d); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-1.7 (setting forth procedures for a member\u2019s appeal to the PFRS Board of Trustees); <em>Hemsey v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>215, 220-22, 966 A.2d 1020 (2009) (final administrative decision issued by Board of Trustees); <em>see also Sellers v. Bd. of Trs. of the Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 62, 942 A.2d 870 (App.Div.2008) (Decision-making powers of PFRS Board of Trustees include authority \u201cto apply equitable principles to provide a remedy when justice so demands, provided the power is used rarely and sparingly... .\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">While full adjudicative authority placed in such a board may not be unusual, the Board of Trustees in this case is not entirely under the control of the Executive and Legislative Branches of State government. The eleven-person Board consists of five positions that are reserved for and elected solely by active or retired police officers and firefighters who are members of PFRS. <em>N.J.S.A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>43:16A-13(a)(2)(e), (d); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-1.4(b). Those five Board members may be adjudicating a dispute about salary provisions that are the same as ones from which they themselves benefit financially.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In comparison, persons with similar conflicts of interest would likely be excused for cause from serving on a jury that was asked to decide the issue, although jurors too take an oath to render a fair and impartial decision. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2B:23-6. I do not mean that a jury and an administrative board are the same kind of adjudicative body. I use the analogy as an illustration of the impartiality we expect in governmental adjudication of factual disputes. Nor are my comments intended to criticize the membership of the PFRS Board of Trustees. I do not denigrate the integrity and good faith of the police and firefighter members of the PFRS Board of Trustees any more than a trial judge denigrates the integrity and good faith of a potential juror who is excused from a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Whatever the Board\u2019s membership may be, my comments are primarily directed to the absence of administrative and judicial review of its decisions when they are favorable to the PFRS member. If such decisions of the Board are final and the Director of the Division has no power to review them administratively or to decline to implement them, then the Executive Branch is seemingly without recourse in protecting the pension fund against a legally erroneous or skewed ruling of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The court\u2019s decision today explains the unusual procedural steps taken by the State Attorney General after a disagreement with the Board of Trustees of a similar public employees\u2019 pension fund. <em>See Gladden v. Bd. of Trs. of the Pub. Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 367-68, 409 A.2d 294 (App.Div.1979). The court suggests that the Attorney General could similarly have advised the PFRS Board in these cases that its actions are contrary to law and then pursued a remedy in this court if the Board refused to heed the Attorney General\u2019s advice. <em>Ante </em>at 299-300, 112 A.3d at 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The <em>Gladden </em>decision, however, only came before this court for judicial review because the Board of Trustees in that case decided the matter against the interests of the prospective member of the pension fund, Gladden, and he filed the appeal. <em>Gladden, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 367, 409 A.2d 294. Had the Board\u2019s decision been in favor of Gladden, there would have been no appeal and no judicial ease in which the Attorney General could have intervened to resolve a disagreement with the Board\u2019s decision. In the absence of an appeal by a party that has the right to appeal, I am unable to identify what procedural mechanism the Attorney General might have employed to make a direct application to this court, which is not normally a court of original jurisdiction. <em>See R. </em>2:10-5 (\u201cThe appellate court may exercise such original jurisdiction as is necessary to the complete determination of any matter on review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">I also question the lack of any record in these cases stating the reasons supporting the final rulings of the PFRS Board of Trustees. The Division and the Board explained their determinations when initially deciding these matters against the interests of PFRS members. But the Board\u2019s subsequent rulings in favor of PFRS members consist only of terse letters from the Board secretary stating the result without further explanation. Not even a tally of the Board\u2019s vote is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">As the Legislature has devised the PFRS and its Board of Trustees, there seems to be no opportunity for judicial review when the PFRS member obtains a favorable decision from the PFRS Board of Trustees and when the pension fund is thus obligated to pay a higher pension. While that result may not be different from the procedures applicable to other adjudicative boards, these cases seem to differ in that the Governor and the Legislative Branch have only partial control of appointments to the PFRS Board of Trustees, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-13(a)(2). Consequently, the PFRS Board of Trustees seems to have powers beyond that of other adjudicative boards within our State system of governance.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>I eoncur in the court\u2019s judgment because I agree that the applicable statutes and regulations do not authorize the Acting Director effectively to overrule decisions made by the PFRS Board of Trustees by declining to implement them.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\"> As far as I can tell, the record before the PFRS Board of Trustees did not include information such as what the actuarial costs of the increments are to the PFRS pension fund and, most important, how frequently and quickly members retire after receiving the increments. It might have been relevant to consider whether the accelerated longevity and seniority increments help the municipalities retain in active employment their highly-experienced police officers and firefighters or whether the increments simply increase \"final compensation\" shortly before retirement of most officers and firefighters who are eligible to retire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\"> The Division does not argue that the Acting Director is the \u201chead of the agency\u201d who, under the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act, <em>N.J.S.A. 52:14B-1 to -15, </em>must issue a final <em>agency decision </em>in a contested pension benefits case, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10. Also, the Division has not cited <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-8 as supporting a declaratory ruling of the Acting Director with respect to the disputed salary provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
