State-Court Lawsuits</p>\n<p id=\"Aby\">This is a consolidated action. The case originates from two personal-injury actions (\u201cState-Court Lawsuits\u201d) filed in state court against Allied Shipyard, Inc. (\u201cAllied\u201d): <em>Adams, et al. v. Allied Shipyard, Inc., et al. </em>and <em>St. Pierre, et al. v. Allied Shipyard, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The plaintiffs in the State-Court Lawsuits allege Allied negligently performed sandblasting activities, causing dangerous silica dust and other hazardous substances to permeate the plaintiffs\u2019 neighborhood.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs seek damages for physical pain and suffering, medical expenses, property damage, and other damages as a result of their exposure' to the hazardous substances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The two cases were consolidated in state court on September 9, 2013.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In both State-Court Lawsuits, Allied filed third-party demands against its contractors that performed the sandblasting jobs, including Superior Labor Services, Inc. (\u201cSuperior\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Masse Contracting, Inc. (\u201cMasse\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, Allied alleges that Superior and Masse contracted with Allied to perform certain job responsibilities and to indemnify Allied under master work contracts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>- Allied seeks indemnity from Superior -and from Masse with respect to the claims in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Allied has also alleged the right to additional assured status and coverage on all insurance policies issued to Superior and to Masse for any liability in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">' The plaintiffs in <em>Adams </em>amended their petition to name Superior, Masse,' other subcontractors, and Gray Insurance Company as direct defendants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">The contractors against which Allied brought third-party demands \u201cin turn sought coverage, defense and/or indemnity from their various insurers for the periods of time when these jobs were allegedly performed, which prompted the insurers to file lawsuits in federal courts.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-18\">B. Declaratory Actions in Federal Court</p>\n<p id=\"b701-19\">Three federal actions related to the State-Court lawsuits are pending in this Court. The Court consolidated the three cases on November 21,2014.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-20\">\n<em>1. No. 11-2375</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-21\">On September 21, 2011, Hanover Insurance Company (\u201cHanover\u201d) filed a complaint in this Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Hanover filed an amended complaint on September .27, 2012.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Hanover alleges it has been participating in the defense of. Superior against Allied\u2019s third-party demands- in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Hanover maintains the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>other insurers it names in its federal suit \u201care. not participating in Superior\u2019s defense\u201d in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Hanover seeks judgment against Superior declaring that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Superior in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If Hanover has a duty to defend or indemnify Superior, Hanover seeks declaratory judgment that State National Insurance Company (\u201cState National\u201d), Arch Insurance Company (\u201cArch\u201d), and \u201cother unidentified insurance companies collectively named as ABC Insurance Company\u201d are liable \u201cfor their share of defense and indemnity to be paid on behalf of Superior\u201d in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Hanover also seeks reimbursement, contribution,: and/or damages from State National, Arch, and other unidentified insurance companies for defense costs already incurred by Hanover on behalf of Superior in the State-Court Lawsuits that, Hanover argues, should have been paid by those insurance companies.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">On January 14, 2015, Hanover filed a second supplemental and amending complaint naming Allied as a defendant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Hanover alleges that \u201cAllied has tendered the [State-Court Lawsuits] to; Hanover for defense and indemnity in its capacity as an alleged additional insured\u201d under Superi- or\u2019s policies, and Hanover has offered to participate in Allied\u2019s defense in the State-Court Lawsuits subject to a full reservation of rights.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Hanover alleges that Allied is not an additional assured under Hanover\u2019s policies, and Hanover seeks judgment against Allied declaring that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Allied in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the alternative, if the Court finds Hanover has a duty to defend or indemnify Allied, Hanover seeks judgment declaring that Arch, State National, other unidentified insurance companies are obligated to pay then- portions of defense costs and/or indemnity incurred by Hanover on behalf of Superior and Allied in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">\n<em>2. No. 14-1980</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">On August 22, 2014, Arch Insurance Company brought an action for declaratory judgment against Superior and Allied. Arch seeks a declaration of its rights and responsibilities under \u201ccertain insurance policies issued by Arch to Superior,\u201d with respect to Superior\u2019s request for defense and indemnity in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Arch, also seeks a declaration of its rights and responsibilities with respect to Allied\u2019s request for additional assured status under the Superior policies and defense and indemnity of Allied in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Arch seeks a declaration against Superior and Allied that Arch has no defense or indemnity obligation to Superior in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Arch also seeks recovery of the portion of defense costs already incurred by it on behalf of Superior.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\n<em>3. No. Up-1933</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On August 22, 2014; Arch also filed an action for declaratory judgment against Masse and Allied. Arch seeks a declaration of its rights and responsibilities under \u201ccertain insurance policies issued by Arch to Masse,\u201d with respect to Masse\u2019s request for defense and indemnity in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Arch also seeks a declaration of its rights and responsibilities with respect to Allied\u2019s request for additional assured status under the Masse policies and defense and indemnity of Allied in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Arch seeks a declaration against Masse and Allied that Arch has no defense or indemnity obligation to Masse in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">On January 14, 2015, Hanover filed a complaint in intervention in Case No. 14-1933 against Defendants Masse and Allied.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Hanover seeks judgment declaring that Hanover has no obligation to defend or indemnify Masse or Allied in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">State National Insurance Company (\u201cState National\u201d) also filed a petition for intervention for declaratory judgment on January 14, 2015.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> State National issued two marine general liability policies to Masse that provided coverage from November 15, 2006, to November 15, 2007, and from November 15, 2007, to November 15, 2008.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Allied seeks additional insured status under the policies issued by State National to Masse.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> State National seeks a judgment declaring there is no coverage afforded to Masse under the State National policies and that State National has no duty to defend or indemnify Masse in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> State National also seeks a declaration that \u201cthere is no coverage afforded to Allied under the [State National] policies as a purported additional insured\u201d and that State National does not owe a duty to defend or indemnify Allied in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">C. Hanover\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">Hanover filed a motion for partial summary judgment against Masse and Allied on July 29, 2015.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Hanover argues it has no duty to defend Masse or Allied, as an additional insured under the policies issued to Masse, in the State-Court Lawsuits for three reasons: (1) that the plaintiffs in the State-Court Lawsuits do not allege \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d that occurred during the terms of the policies Hanover issued to Masse; (2) alternatively, that the plaintiffs in the State-Court Lawsuits seek recovery for injuries arising out of exposure to silica dust and the Hanover policies contain an exclusion for silica, silicon, and silicate; and (3) alternatively, the policies contain a Pollution Buyback Endorsement that is not triggered by the State-Court Lawsuits and thus does not extend coverage for the state-court plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In its motion, and solely for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>purposes of its motion, Hanover assumes that Allied qualifies as an additional assured within the meaning of the Masse policies.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Whether Allied will indeed qualify as an additional assured under the policies is not addressed in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\">Masse filed its opposition to Hanover\u2019s motion on December 8, 2015,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and Allied filed its opposition on December 14, 2015.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Hanover filed a reply memorandum in support of its motion on December 15, 2015.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> After deposing Anthony Boudreaux, Allied\u2019s vice president of operations and Superior\u2019s former vice president, Masse filed a memorandum to supplement its opposition on February 29, 2016.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">HANOVER\u2019S INTERVENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The Court must determine whether Hanover\u2019s intervention in No. 14-1933 was permissible under Rule 24. Rule 24(a) provides for intervention as of right, while Rule 24(b) provides for permissive intervention. Hanover filed a supplemental memorandum on March 29, 2016, arguing intervention was proper under both Rule 24(a) and Rule 24(b).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Masse argues the intervention is improper.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">A. Intervention of Right</p>\n<p id=\"AN9N\">Rule 24(a) provides that the court must permit anyone to intervene who (1) is given an unconditional right to intervene by a federal statute or (2) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant\u2019s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">Hanover points to no federal statute giving it an unconditional right to intervene. \u201cAbsent a statute giving a right to intervene, Rule 24(a) imposes four requirements for intervention as of right:' (1) tim\u00e9-liness, (2) an interest relating to the subject matter of the main action, (3) at least potential impairment of that interest if the action is resolved without the intervenor, and (4) lack of adequate representation by existing parties.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">To show it has an interest relating to the subject matter of the main action, Hanover must demonstrate it has \u201ca direct, substantial, legally protectable interest in the action, meaning \u2018that the interest be one which the <em>substantive </em>law recognizes as belonging to or being owned by the applicant.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Hanover argues that it has shown it has an interest relating to the subject matter of the main action (1) because it \u201chas been defending Masse pursuant to reservation in the same underlying lawsuits at issue in Arch\u2019s declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>judgment action,\u201d and (2) because Hanover\u2019s policies issued to Masse and Arch\u2019s policies issued to . Masse, the subject of the main action, both contain substantially similar exclusions. Hanover argues it has an interest \u201cin obtaining a consistent judicial determination, regarding its .coverage obligations to Masse in the underlying lawsuits.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Hanover fails to show, however, that it \u201chas a stake in the matter that goes beyond a generalized preference that the case come out a certain way.\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark>Hanover\u2019s purported interest is insufficient to establish an \u201cinterest\u201d relating to the subject matter of the main action under Rule 24(a).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Hanover also fails to show that its interest would be at least potentially impaired if the action is resolved without it. \u201cImpairment exists when the decision of a legal question would, as a practical matter, foreclose the rights of the proposed intervenor in a subsequent proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Hanover has failed to establish that its interest would be potentially impaired if the main action is resolved without it, as Hanover has not demonstrated that \u201cthe disposition of [the main] suit will ... bar [Hanover] from asserting [its] rights in a separate action.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">Because Hanover fails to demonstrate at least two of the four prongs necessary to establish intervention of right, the. Court finds Hanover is not entitled to intervention of right under Rule 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">B. Permissive Intervention</p>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">Rule 24(b) provides that courts may permit anyone to intervene who has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> \u201cEven if not warranted as a matter of right, the Court has broad discretion to allow permissive intervention where, as here, the parties seeking to intervene assert claims with a common question of fact or law in connection with the main action.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> If the \u2022 intervenor has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact, district courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in allowing intervention.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> \u201cA court possesses the discretion to - determine whether to permit permissive intervention and must \u2018consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The rule. on permissive intervention \u201cshould be liberally construed.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">In <em>Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Co. v. Perlberg, </em>the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>trict court for the District of Maryland allowed an insurer to intervene permissively under Rule 24(b)(1)(B) in a situation similar to that currently before this Court.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In <em>Perlberg, </em>Penn National issued a commercial general liability policy to the Perlbergs, defendants in an underlying personal injury lawsuit.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Penn National filed a federal declaratory judgment action against the' Perlbergs, seeking a declaration that it owed no duty to defend or indemnify the Perlbergs in the underlying lawsuit.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> New Hampshire, another insurer that provided a separate commercial general liability policy to the Perlbergs, had been defending the Perlbergs in the underlying lawsuit.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> New Hampshire filed a motion to intervene in Penn National\u2019s declaratory judgment action to protect its potential contribution rights.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The court granted the motion to intervene, concluding that permissive intervention under Rule 24(b) was appropriate.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The court explained that the lawsuit could determine both Penn National\u2019s declaratory judgment action and New Hampshire\u2019s contribution claim in one proceeding while allowing all parties to be heard.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The court also explained that the intervention would avoid a competing suit in state court.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Several issues of law and fact in Hanover\u2019s declaratory judgment action against Masse and Allied are common to those in Arch\u2019s declaratory judgment action against those same entities. Both Arch and Hanover seek declaratory judgment that they have no duty to defend or indemnify Masse or Allied in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The allegations of the underlying State-Court Lawsuits are the same with respect to both declaratory judgment actions. Although the relevant provisions of the policies issued to Masse by Arch and by Hanover are not identical, the material factual disputes -will most certainly overlap and the legal issues surrounding the application of the silica and pollution exclusions in the policies will be substantially similar. As in <em>Perlberg, </em>this lawsuit can be used to determine Arch\u2019s declaratory judgment action and Hanover\u2019s declaratory judgment action in one proceeding while allowing all parties to be heard. Intervention will avoid a competing action in state court and will avoid inconsistent results on these disputed issues. The Court finds the approach taken by the court in <em>Perlberg </em>to be common-sense and well within the Court\u2019s discretion under Rule 24(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">Courts should also consider whether permissive intervention will achieve judicial economy.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> The Court finds that judicial economy will be served by allowing Hanover to intervene in this action and that allowing Hanover\u2019s claim in intervention to proceed will not unduly delay or prejudice any parties.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the Arch declaratory judgment action has been pending for some time, there has been virtually no activity in the case other than motions for summary judgment on the duty to defend, as the parties have been focusing on the underlying State-Court Lawsuits. Hanover\u2019s claim in intervention is permissible under Rule 24(b), and the Court will exercise its broad discretion by allowing the claim in intervention to proceed, as \u201c[^Intervention should generally be allowed where no one would be hurt and greater justice could be attained.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">CONSIDERATION OF DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Hanover has intervened to assert a declaratory judgment action against Masse and Allied. The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction ... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">The Fifth Circuit has explained that, when considering a declaratory judgment action, a district court must engage in a three-step inquiry to determine whether to decide or dismiss a complaint for declaratory relief.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> First, the Court must determine whether the action is justiciable.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Second, the Court must determine whether it has the authority to grant declaratory relief.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Third, the Court must determine \u201chow to exercise its broad discretion to decide or dismiss a declaratory judgment action.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> If Hanover\u2019s claims survive this analysis, the Court will then consider whether Hanover has a duty to defend the insured under the policies at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">A. Justiciability</p>\n<p id=\"b707-16\">The justiciability doctrines of standing, mootness, political question, and ripeness derive from Article Ill\u2019s \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> In a declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>judgment action, justiciability often turns on ripeness.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> This case is no exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The ripeness doctrine is drawn \u201cboth from Article III limitations on judicial power and from- prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The purpose of this doctrine is to forestall \u201centanglement] ... in abstract disagreements\u201d through \u201cavoidance of premature adjudication.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> \u201cThe key considerations are \u2018the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A03\">The Fifth Circuit has recognized that \u201capplying the ripeness doctrine in the declaratory judgment context presents a unique challenge.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> This stems primarily from the fact that declaratory relief often involves an <em>ex ante </em>determination of rights, ie., a determination of rights before an injury has occurred, that \u201cexists in some tension with traditional notions of ripeness.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Fortunately, this challenge is not presented today, because the Court\u2019s analysis is guided'by a distinct subset of ripeness jurisprudence on disputes regarding the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">Because the duty to defend does not depend on the outcome of the underlying law suit,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> a duty-to-defend claim is ripe when the underlying suit is filed.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Accordingly, Hanover\u2019s duty-to-defend claim is ripe, and the Court finds the action is justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">B. Authority to Grant Declaratory Belief</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">The Fifth Circuit has explained that \u201cwhen a state lawsuit is pending, more often than not, issuing a declaratory judgment will be tantamount to issuing an injunction\u2014providing the declaratory plaintiff an end run around the requirements of the Anti-Injunction Act.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court cannot consider the merits of a declaratory judgment action when (1) a declaratory defendant has previously filed a cause of action in state court against the declaratory plaintiff; (2) th\u00e9 state case involves the same issues as those involved in the federal case; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the district court is prohibited from enjoining the state proceedings under the Anti-Injunction Act.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In Hanover\u2019s complaint in intervention, Hanover alleges that, pursuant to its policies, it is participating in Masse\u2019s defense against the <em>Adams </em>plaintiffs\u2019 demands and third-party demands in the State-Court Lawsuits, \u201csubject to a full reservation of rights.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Hanover does not assert that it is a party in the State-Court Lawsuits, and the Court is not aware of any state-court proceedings involving the same issues now being examined. Therefore, the' Court finds that the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply, as there is no pending state-court action between Hanover and any of the defendants in this case.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Accordingly, the .Court\u2019s authority to grant declaratory relief on the duty-to-defend claim turns on whether subject-matter\u2019 jurisdiction'' is proper.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Hanover asserts the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over its intervention pursuant to. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a).<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) provides that jurisdiction is proper where (1) the parties are completely diverse, and (2) the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">&gt; The parties are completely diverse when \u201cthe citizenship of each plaintiff is diverse from the citizenship of each defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> All of the parties in this matter are corporations.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> For purposes of diversity jurisdiction; a corporation is a citizen of (1) its state of incorporation, and (2) the state in which its principal place of business is located.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> According to the complaint in intervention, Hanover is a citizen of New Hampshire, the state of its incorporation, and Massachusetts, the state in which its principal place of business is located.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Defendant-in-intervention Masse is a citizen of Louisiana, the state of its incorporation and the state in which its principal place of business is located.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Defendant-in-intervention Allied is a citizen of Louisiana, the state of its incorporation and the state in which' its principal place of business is located.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Because none of the defendants-in-intervention is a citizen of New Hampshire or Massachusetts, the states in which Hanover is a citizen, there is complete diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>In addition to complete diversity, Section 1332(a) requires that the amount in controversy exceed $75,000. As the party invoking federal jurisdiction, Hanover bears the burden of establishing the amount in controversy by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> In order to determine whether that burden has, been met, the Court first inquires whether it is,\u201cfacially apparent\u201d from the complaint that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> If not, the Court may examine summary judgment-type evidence.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">When an insurer seeks a declaratory judgment on coverage issues, the amount in controversy is equal- to the \u201c[insurer\u2019s] potential liability under the policy, plus potential attorneys\u2019 fees, penalties, statutory damages, and punitive damages.\u201d<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> As-set forth in the complaint in this case and the petitions from the State-Court Lawsuits, the state-court plaintiffs allege they have suffered, property damage and severe bodily injury and have contracted diseases, including silicosis, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis. Masse\u2019s potential liability for these injuries\u2014and thus Hanover\u2019s derivative indemnity liability\u2014 could easily exceed $75,000.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> When coupled with Hanover\u2019s potential defense obligations, the Court concludes the amount in controversy exceeded the jurisdictional amount at the time this action was filed.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Therefore, because the Court has diversity jurisdiction over this matter and the Anti-Injunction action does not apply, the Court finds it has the authority to grant declaratory relief in this case.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">C. Discretion to Exercise Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">\u201cSince its inception, the Declaratory Judgment Act has been understood to confer on federal courts unique and substantial discretion in deciding whether to declare the rights of litigants,\u201d even when subject-matter jurisdiction is otherwise proper.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> The Fifth Circuit has developed seven factors\u2014the so-called <em>\u201cTrejo </em>factors\u201d\u2014that a district court should consider when deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">(1). whether there is a pending state , action in which all of the matters in controversy may be fully litigated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-16\">(2) whether the plaintiff filed suit in anticipation of a lawsuit filed by the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-17\">(3) whether the plaintiff engaged in forum shopping in bringing the suit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-18\">(4) whether possible inequities in allowing the declaratory plaintiff to gain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>precedence in time or to change forums exist;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">(5) whether the federal court is a convenient forum for the parties and witnesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">(6) whether retaining the lawsuit would serve the purposes of judicial economy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">(7) whether the federal court is being called on to construe a state judicial decree involving the same parties and entered by the court before whom the parallel state suit between the same parties is pending.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">As set forth below, the <em>Trejo </em>factors weigh in favor of exercising jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Court will exercise jurisdiction over this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">\n<em>1. Nature of Pending State Court Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">The first <em>Trejo </em>factor requires comparison of the declaratory judgment action with the underlying state-court action.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> If the declaratory judgment action presents the same issues as the state-court action, involves the same parties, and is not governed by federal law, the federal court should generally decline to exercise jurisdiction.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> If, on the other hand, the state-court action is not truly parallel because it does not involve all the same parties or issues as the declaratory judgment action, a federal court should consider the degree of similarity between the two actions.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">Hanover is not a party to the State-Court Lawsuits. Moreover, whereas the State-Court Lawsuits involve issues of fact, fault, and causation, the determination of whether there is a duty to defend involves a straightforward examination of the state-court pleadings and the insurance policies Hanover issued to the state-court defendants. Furthermore, the resolution of the State-Court Lawsuits will not determine Hanover\u2019s duty to provide coverage. The state and federal proceedings are clearly not parallel. \u201c[T]he lack of a pending parallel state proceeding ... weighs strongly against dismissal.\u201d<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> The first <em>Trejo </em>factor weighs in favor of exercising jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">\n<em>2. Order of Filing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-17\">The <em>St. Pierre </em>lawsuit was filed on December 8, 2010,<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> and the <em>Adams </em>lawsuit was filed on December 28, 2010.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> Arch filed the lawsuit presently before this Court on August 22, 2014,<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> and Hanover filed its complaint-in-intervention on January 14, 2015.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> Hanover likely was aware that its insurance coverage of Superior and Masse would become an issue in the pending State-Court Lawsuits. Therefore, Hanover may have filed its complaint in intervention in anticipation of becoming a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>to the pending State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> The second <em>Trejo </em>factor weighs against exercising jurisdiction.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">\n<em>3. Forum Shopping</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">That Hanover could have intervened and requested declaratory judgment in the State-Court Lawsuits does not necessarily demonstrate forum shopping.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> As a preliminary matter, there is no guarantee Hanover would have been allowed to intervene in the State-Court Lawsuits.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Moreover, courts are less likely to find forum shopping where, as here, (1) a foreign insurer files a diversity action in federal court, and (2) the selection of the federal forum does not change the applicable law.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> \u201cThe record does not support a finding that [Hanover] engaged in impermissible forum shopping by filing this declaratory judgment suit.\u201d<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> The third <em>Trejo </em>factor weighs in favor of exercising jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">A <em>Inequities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The Court cannot conceive of any inequities that flow from allowing Hanover to proceed in this action while the State-Court Lawsuits remain pending. As explained above, the State-Court Lawsuits and this action are not parallel in any material sense. No party will be prejudiced if this action is resolved before the State-Court Lawsuits. The fourth <em>Trejo </em>factor weighs in favor of exercising jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">5. <em>Convenience of Federal Forum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">The State-Court Lawsuits are pending in the 17th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lafourche, State of Louisiana.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> The state courthouse for the 17th Judicial District Court for Lafourche Parish is approximately 60 miles west of the federal courthouse in New Orleans. No party argues that this forum is inconvenient or that either forum is more convenient than the other for the parties or for the witnesses. This factor is neutral.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">\n<em>6. Judicial Economy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">This action has been pending for more than 18 months. The duty-to-defend issue has been fully briefed before this Court. It would be a waste of judicial resources to dismiss this action and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>quire Hanover to refile in.another forum. Exercising jurisdiction is clearly in the interest of judicial economy.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> This factor weighs in favor of exercising jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">7. <em>Interpretation of Decree from Parallel State Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Again, the State-Court Lawsuits and this action are clearly not parallel. This Court need not interpret any decree issued in the State-Court Lawsuits to determine whether Hanover has a duty to defend or provide coverage. The seventh <em>Trejo </em>factor weighs in favor of exercising jurisdiction.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Five of the <em>Trejo </em>factors weigh in favor of exercising jurisdiction, while one weighs against and another is neutral. Accordingly, the Court will exercise its jurisdiction over this matter.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">LAW AND ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A8PO\">A. The \u201cEight-Corners Rule\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Under Louisiana law, an insurance policy is a contract and should be construed using the general rules of interpretation of contracts set forth in the Louisiana Civil Code.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> A liability insurer\u2019s duty to defend and the scope- of its coverage are separate and distinct issues.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> Under Louisiana law, an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is broader than its obligation to indemnify for damage claims.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> Louisiana courts apply the \u201ceight-corners rule\u201d to determine whether a liability insurer has the duty to defend a civil action against its insured; courts look to the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the plaintiffs petition in the civil action and the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the insurance policy to determine whether the insurer owes its insured a duty to defend.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> One Louisiana court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-13\">Under [the \u201ceight-corners\u201d] analysis, the factual allegations of the plaintiffs petition must be liberally interpreted to determine whether they set forth grounds which raise even the possibility of liability under the policy. In other words, the test is not whether the allegations unambiguously assert coverage, but rather whether they do not unambiguously exclude coverage. Similarly, even though a plaintiffs petition may allege numerous claims for which coverage is excluded under an insurer\u2019s policy, a duty to defend may nonetheless exist if there is at least a single allegation in the petition under which coverage is not unambiguously excluded.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The duty to defend \u201carises whenever the pleadings against the insured disclose even a possibility of liability under the policy.\u201d<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> The insurer has a duty to defend unless the allegations in the petition for damages, as applied to the policy, unambiguously preclude coverage.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> \u201cOnce a complaint states one claim within the policy\u2019s coverage, the insurer has a duty to accept defense of the entire lawsuit, even though other claims in the complaint fall outside the policy\u2019s coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>135</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">When a party files a motion for summary judgment regarding the duty to defend, the Court may consider only the plaintiffs petition and the face of the policies; the parties cannot present any evidence such as affidavits or depositions.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> Factual inquiries beyond the petition for damages and the relevant insurance policy are prohibited with respect to the duty to defend.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> Any ambiguities within the policy are resolved in favor of the insured to effect, not deny, coverage.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">B. The Policies</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Hanover issued three commercial lines policies to Masse: one that provided coverage from November 15, 2009, through November 15, 2010 (\u201cthe 2009 policy\u201d),<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> another that provided coverage from November 15, 2010, through November 15, 2011 (\u201cthe 2010 policy\u201d),<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> and a third that provided coverage from November 15, 2011, through November 15, 2012 (\u201cthe 2011 policy\u201d).<footnotemark>141</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">\n<em>1. General Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">The 2009 and 2010 policies provide that Hanover \u201cwill pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of.. .bodily injury [and].. .property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence, and [Hanover] shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages....\u201d<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> Similarly, the 2011 policy states that Hanover \u201cwill pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies\u201d and that Hanover \u201cwill have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages.\u201d<footnotemark>143</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">The 2009 and 2010 policies define \u201cbodily injury\u2019 as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by any person which occurs during the policy period, including death at any time resulting therefrom.\u201d<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The 2009 and 2010 policies define \u201cproperty damage\u201d as \u201c(1) physical injury to or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period, including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom, or (2) loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy period.\u201d<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> The policies define \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure in conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>146</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Similarly, the 2011 policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.\u201d<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> The 2011 policy states, \u201c \u2018Property damage\u2019 means: (a) physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or (b) Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \u2018occurrence\u2019 that caused it.\u201d<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> The 2011 policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201call loss or damage that is attributable directly or indirectly to: (a) One cause, act, event or series of similar related causes, acts or events involving one or more persons; or (b) One cause, act or event, or a series of similar related causes, acts or events not involving any person.\u201d<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> The 2011 policy states, \u201cThis insurance applies to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage\u2019 only if: (1) The \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 is caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 that takes place in the \u2018coverage territory'; and (2) The \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 actually commences during the policy period.\u201d<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> The policy\u2019s \u201ccoverage territory\u201d includes the United States.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">2. <em>Silicon, Silica, and Silicate Exclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">All three policies contain an exclusion for silicon, silica, and silicate. The 2009 and 2010 policies provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\">1.

Pollution Buyback Endorsement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7W\">The policies also contain a Pollution Buyback Endorsement. In relevant part, th\u00e9 endorsement contained in the 2009 and 2010 policies states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy shall not apply to any claim arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials, oil or other petroleum substance or derivative (including all oil refuse or oil mixed wastes) or other - irritants, contaminants or pollutants or upon land, the atmosphere, or any watercourse or body of water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-15\">This exclusion shall not apply, however, provided that the Assured establishes that all of the following conditions have been met[:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-16\">(a) the occurrence was accidental and was neither expected nor intended by the assured.

The Allegations of the State-Court Lawsuits</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In <em>Adams, et al. v. Allied Shipyard, Inc., et al., </em>the plaintiffs allege they \u201care residents of a neighborhood that borders\u201d Allied\u2019s shipyard.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> They further allege that Allied, whose shipyard has been operating since the 1960s, has been operating \u201cfor decades without appropriate borders to stop the resulting dangerous silica dust produced by its sandblasting from permeating the neighborhood.\u201d<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Allied\u2019s alleged negligence has \u201cexpos[ed] the residents to dust containing silica sand, a very dangerous substance, as well as other toxic substances.\u201d<footnotemark>160</footnotemark> The petition alleges that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201clong, consistent and protracted\u201d exposure and \u201cinhalation of the silica dust\u201d has caused the plaintiffs to contract severe diseases and illnesses \u201cthat are'painful and disabling,\u201d including Weg-ener\u2019s granulomatosis, rheumatoid arthritis, silicosis, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> In the plaintiffs\u2019 third amended petition for damages, the plaintiffs named Masse as a defendant.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> The plaintiffs allege that Masse has \u201cconducted sandblasting and painting operations and [has] allowed dangerous by product to drift into the neighborhood,\u201d which \u201ccaused both personal injuries and property damages to all Plaintiffs.\u201d<footnotemark>163</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-17\">In <em>St. Pierre, et al. v. Allied Shipyard, Inc., </em>the plaintiffs allege they lived in a residence near Allied\u2019s shipyard for approximately eight years preceding 2010.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark> The <em>St. Pierre </em>plaintiffs allege that Allied was negligent when performing its operations, which \u201cresulted in the release into the atmosphere and environment in the neighborhoods surrounding the shipyard of hazardous substances, including, but not limited to, paint, sand and silica.\u201d<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> The petition alleges that, as a result, the plaintiffs were exposed to the hazardous substances and \u201chave suffered personal injury, mental anguish, health problems, inconvenience, distress, loss of consortium, fear of disease, and other damages.\u201d<footnotemark>166</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-18\">D. Hanover Argues the Damages Did Not Occur during the Policy Periods and, Thus, Recovery is Unambiguously Excluded under the Policies</p>\n<p id=\"b717-22\">The Hanover policies impose on Hanover a duty \"to pay on behalf of its insured any sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d and to which the policies apply.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> Under the 2009 and 2010 policies, the bodily injury or property damage must \u201coccur[] during the policy period.\u201d<footnotemark>168</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Hanover argues that it has no duty to defend Masse or Allied because the State-Court Lawsuits do not allege \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty \u00a1damage\u2019^ that \u201coccurred\u201d during the policy periods.<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> Hanover argues, \u201c[-N]either underlying plaintiffs nor Allied have alleged any injuries during Hanover\u2019s Policy periods, much less that Masse was actually- performing any work at Allied\u2019s shipyard during Hanover\u2019s Policy periods that could have caused underlying plaintiffs\u2019 alleged damages during the relevant periods.\u201d<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> As previously explained, however, Hanover misstates the standard for a motion for summary judgment on the duty to defend.<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> To prevail on a motion for summary judgment that it has no duty to defend, an insurer must establish that coverage is unambiguously precluded based oh review of the four corners of the petition for'damages and the four corners of the complaint.<footnotemark>172</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">. The Hanover policy periods span November 15, <em>2009, </em>through November 15, 2012.<footnotemark>173</footnotemark> The <em>Adams </em>lawsuit was filed on December 28, 2010.<footnotemark>174</footnotemark> The petition in <em>Adams </em>notes that Allied has operated \u201cfor decades without appropriate borders\u201d to prevent dangerous silica dust, from. permeating the neighborhood, and that the exposure has been \u201cprolonged\u201d and \u201clong, consistent and protracted.\u201d<footnotemark>175</footnotemark> Thus, the <em>Adams </em>plaintiffs\u2019 allege their exposure occurred over decades. The <em>Adams </em>plaintiffs also allege that- they contracted illnesses and diseases as a result of the exposure and that \u201c[t]he dust is so constant and voluminous -that residents must continuously wash their cars and houses, almost on a daily basis.\u201d<footnotemark>176</footnotemark> They seek damages for medical expenses, loss of income, property damage, and loss of value of property.<footnotemark>177</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">The <em>St. Pierre </em>lawsuit was filed on December 8, 2010.<footnotemark>178</footnotemark> The <em>St. Pierre </em>petition alleges that \u201c[f]or approximately eight (8) years, the plaintiffs have lived in a residence. . .located near the shipyard,\u201d and during that time, they were exposed to the hazardous substances released by Allied.<footnotemark>179</footnotemark> Based on the allegations in the <em>St. Pierre </em>lawsuit, the <em>St. Pierre </em>plaintiffs\u2019 exposure began in 2002, eight years prior to the suit\u2019s filing, and continued at least until 2010, when the petition was filed. The <em>St. Pierre </em>plaintiffs allege that, as a result of the exposure, they \u201chave suffered personal injury, mental anguish, health problems,\u201d and other damages.<footnotemark>180</footnotemark> They seek damages for physical and mental pain and suffering, medical expenses, damage to personal property.<footnotemark>181</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">Although the state-court petitions do not identify a precise time period during which the plaintiffs were exposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the hazardous substances causing bodily injury and property damage, a review of the petitions and the policies does not unambiguously preclude a finding that the exposure occurred during the policy periods. \u201cAn insured\u2019s duty to defend arises whenever the pleadings against the insured disclose even \u00e1 possibility of liability under the policy.\u201d<footnotemark>182</footnotemark> The petitions clearly allege exposure that was ongoing and continuous- for years, even decades in <em>Adams. </em>The plaintiffs in <em>St Pierre </em>allege that they were exposed to the hazardous substances from 2002 to 2010.<footnotemark>183</footnotemark> The policies Hanover issued to Masse provide coverage during these time periods.<footnotemark>184</footnotemark> The eight corners of the state-court petitions and the policies do not unambiguously preclude the possibility that the exposure causing the plaintiffs\u2019 personal injuries and property damage occurred during Hanover\u2019s policy periods.<footnotemark>185</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">E-. Hanover Argues the Policies\u2019 Silicon, Silica, and Silicate Exclusion Unambiguously Excludes Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">Hanover argues separately and alternatively that the eight corners of the petition and the silicon, silica, and silicate exclusion included in its policies taken together unambiguously bar coverage for any liability of the state-court plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.<footnotemark>186</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">The silicon, silica, and silicate exclusion contained in all three policies precludes coverage for any liability or loss \u201carising out of the actual, alleged or threatened contaminative, pathogenic, toxic or other hazardous properties of Silicon.\u201d<footnotemark>187</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">In their original petition for damages, the <em>Adams </em>plaintiffs allege that their exposure to \u201csilica sand... as well as other toxic substances\u201d<footnotemark>188</footnotemark> and \u201csilica dust and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>other harmful products\u201d caused their injuries.<footnotemark>189</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 third amended petition for damages alleges that the defendants \u201chave conducted sandblasting and painting operations and have allowed dangerous byproduct to drift into the neighborhood\u201d and \u201c[t]he byproduct caused both personal injuries and property damages to all Plaintiffs.\u201d<footnotemark>190</footnotemark> The plaintiffs allege their exposure to hazardous substances, in addition to silica dust, caused their personal injuries and property damage. The petition for damages does not unambiguously limit the cause of their injuries to \u201ccontamina-tive, pathogenic, toxic or other hazardous properties of Silicon,\u201d to which the exclusion applies.<footnotemark>191</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The <em>St. Pierre </em>petition for damages also does not unambiguously limit the cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries to the hazardous properties of silicon, silica, or silicate. The <em>St. Pierre </em>plaintiffs allege that Allied\u2019s operations \u201cresulted in the release into the atmosphere and' environment in the neighborhoods surrounding the shipyard of hazardous substances, including, but not limited to, paint, sand and silica,\u201d<footnotemark>192</footnotemark> which caused the plaintiffs\u2019 personal injuries and property damage.<footnotemark>193</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Considering the <em>Adams </em>petitions for damages, the <em>St. Pierre </em>petition for damages, and the language of the exclusion found in the policies, the Court does not find that the silicon, silica, and silicate exclusion unambiguously bars coverage of the damages alleged in the State-Court Lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-14\">F, Hanover Argues the Policies\u2019 Pollution Buyback Endorsement Unambiguously \u25a0 Excludes Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b720-17\">Hanover further argues separately and alternatively that the eight corners of the petitions and the Pollution Buyback Endorsement found in its policies unambiguously preclude coverage.<footnotemark>194</footnotemark> The Pollution Buyback Endorsement excludes coverage for \u201cany claim arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release.or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases,, waste materials, oil or other petroleum substance or derivative (including all oil refuse or oil mixed wastes) or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere, or any watercourse or body of water.\u201d<footnotemark>195</footnotemark> The insured may still be entitled to coverage, however, if it establishes five conditions.<footnotemark>196</footnotemark> The endorsement is a total pollution exclusion on damages caused by pollutants, with time-element exceptions.<footnotemark>197</footnotemark> Hanover must establish that the exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>unambiguously precludes coverage before the Court may consider whether the time-element conditions have been met.<footnotemark>198</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that a literal application of a total pollution exclusion \u201cwould lead to ... absurd results\u201d and explained that, \u201c[i]n light of the origin of pollution exclusions, as well as the ambiguous nature and absurd consequences which attend a strict reading of these provisions,\u201d a total pollution exclusion is \u201cneither designed nor intended to be read strictly to exclude coverage for all interactions with irritants or contaminants Of any kind.\u201d<footnotemark>199</footnotemark> As a result, the Louisiana Supreme Court has instructed that courts must \u201cattempt to determine the true meaning and interpretation of [the] pollution exclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>200</footnotemark> In <em>Doerr v. Mobil Oil Corporation, </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court explained that the applicability of such an exclusion in any given case must necessarily turn on three considerations: (1) whether the insured is a \u201cpolluter\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion; (2) whether the injury-causing substance is a \u201cpollutant\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion; and (3) whether there was a \u201cdischarge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape\u201d of a pollutant by the insured within the meaning of the policy.<footnotemark>201</footnotemark> If the insurer fails to show these three questions are answered in the affirmative, the total pollution exclusion is not applicable and the court need not examine whether the time-element conditions, or exceptions, contained in the endorsement are met.<footnotemark>202</footnotemark> The Louisiana Supreme Court expressly stated that these factors must be considered \u201cin any given case,\u201d<footnotemark>203</footnotemark> which this Court construes to include decisions involving a motion for summary judgment on the duty to defend, as well as motions involving the duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">Although the <em>Doerr </em>factors should be considered in the duty-to-defend context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the Court is nevertheless limited to the eight corners of the petitions and the policies when deciding whether to apply a total pollution exclusion as written. This is borne out by an examination of Louisiana state court cases facing this issue. In <em>Lodwick, L.L.C. v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>for example, a Louisiana appellate court found that, considering the four corners of the underlying petitions and the four corners of the time-element pollution exclusion, the insurer had no duty to defend because the exclusion unambiguously precluded coverage.<footnotemark>204</footnotemark> The court in <em>Lodwick </em>addressed <em>Doerr </em>as \u201cthe seminal case addressing pollution exclusions\u201d and applied the <em>Doerr </em>factors using only the four corners of the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for damages.<footnotemark>205</footnotemark> For example, the court found that the insureds were \u201c\u2018polluters\u2019 under the <em>Doerr </em>test\u201d because \u201c[t]hroughout the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for damages, all defendants ... are alleged to be oil field operators and producers.\u201d<footnotemark>206</footnotemark> The court also found that the substances that caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries were \u201cpollutants\u201d within the meaning of the total pollution exclusion because the plaintiffs \u201callege[d] that their property was contaminated by.. .[substances that] qualify as chemicals, contaminants, irritants, or waste under the various exclusions.\u201d<footnotemark>207</footnotemark> The court concluded that \u201c[p]laintiffs\u2019 allegations make it clear that all three <em>Doerr </em>factors are met.\u201d<footnotemark>208</footnotemark> The court thus found that the pollution exclusion in the policies at issue did unambiguously exclude coverage and granted summary judgment declaring that the insurers had no duty to defend.<footnotemark>209</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">In <em>Smith v. Reliance Insurance Company of </em>Illinois,<footnotemark>210</footnotemark> the plaintiffs alleged that the release of noxious odors carried by the wind to the plaintiffs\u2019 homes and properties caused their damages.<footnotemark>211</footnotemark> Before the <em>Smith </em>court was a motion for partial summary judgment on the insurer\u2019s duty to defend.<footnotemark>212</footnotemark> When ruling on the motion, the court used the eight-corners rule and examined a pollution exclusion with a buyback endorsement similar to the exclusion and endorsement currently before this Court as well as the allegations contained in the plaintiffs petition.<footnotemark>213</footnotemark> The court applied the <em>Doerr </em>factors based on the facts alleged in the petition and concluded that the insurer \u201cfailed to meet its burden of proving the applicability\u201d of the pollution exclusion.<footnotemark>214</footnotemark> The court explained that, \u201calthough the parties extensively dispute[d] the applicability of the limited buy-back endorsement to th[e] exclusion,\u201d it was unnecessary to reach the issue of whether the buyback endorsement applied because the court found the exclusion itself did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>unambiguously exclude coverage given the <em>Doerr </em>analysis.<footnotemark>215</footnotemark> The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which found that the insurer had a duty to defend.<footnotemark>216</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">To apply the <em>Doerr </em>factors in this case, the Court must first determine whether the insured is a \u201cpolluter\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion, using the eight corners of the petitions and the policies. The <em>Doerr </em>court described this issue as a fact-based determination for which courts should consider \u201cthe nature of the insured\u2019s business, whether that type of business presents a risk of pollution, whether the insured has a separate policy covering the disputed claim, whether the insured should have known from a read of the exclusion that a separate policy covering pollution damages would be necessary for the insured\u2019s business, who the insurer typically insures, any other claims made under the policy, and any other factor the trier of fact deems relevant to this conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>217</footnotemark> Hanover is unable to establish from the eight corners that Masse is a \u201cpolluter\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion. For example, Hanover is unable to point to any information within the eight corners regarding the nature of Masse\u2019s business, whether that type of business presents a risk of pollution, and whether Masse has a separate pollution policy. Accordingly, the Court is unable to conclude that Masse is a \u201cpolluter\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Second, the Court must determine whether the injury-causing substance is a \u201cpollutant\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion. The Court should consider \u201cthe nature of the injury-causing substance, its typical usage, the quantity of the discharge, whether the substance was being used for its intended purpose when the injury took place, whether the substance is one that would be viewed as a pollutant as the term is generally understood, and any other factor the trier of fact deems relevant to that conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>218</footnotemark> Hanover is unable to establish from the eight comers that the substances the State-Court Lawsuit plaintiffs allege caused their personal injuries and property damage are \u201cpollutants\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion such that the exclusion unambiguously precludes coverage. In the <em>Adams </em>and <em>St. Pierre </em>petitions for damages, the plaintiffs broadly describe the substances causing their injuries. The <em>Adams </em>plaintiffs, for example, allege that \u201csilica dust <em>and other harmful products\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>219</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and \u201cdangerous byproduct\u201d<footnotemark>220</footnotemark> caused their injuries. The <em>St. Pierre </em>plaintiffs allege that \u201chazardous substances, including, but not limited to, paint, sand and silica\u201d caused their injuries.<footnotemark>221</footnotemark> The Court is unable to determine the nature of the injury-causing substances, their typical usages, the quantity of any discharges, whether the substances were being used for their intended purpose when the injury took place, or whether the substances are ones that would be viewed as pollutants as the term is generally understood. The Court reiterates that \u201cany ambiguity should be interpreted in favor of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>222</footnotemark> Hanover has failed to establish that the injury-causing substance is a \u201cpollutant\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">Finally, the Court must consider whether there was a \u201cdischarge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>a pollutant by the insured within the meaning of the policy, a fact-based determination.<footnotemark>223</footnotemark> The Court \u201cshould consider whether -the pollutant was intentionally or negligently discharged, the amount of the injury-causing substance discharged, whether the actions of the alleged polluter were active or passive, and any other factor the trier of fact deems relevant.\u201d<footnotemark>224</footnotemark> The Court is unable to determine from the eight corners whether a pollutant was intentionally or negligently discharged, the amount of the injury-causing substance discharged, or whether the actions of the alleged polluter were active or passive. Hanover has failed to establish that there was a discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of a pollutant by the inshred within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Because Hanover has failed to establish that M\u00e1sse is a polluter, that the substance or substances to which the plaintiffs were exposed were pollutants, or that there was a discharge within the meaning of the policies, Hanover has failed to establish that the pollution exclusion unambiguously precludes coverage. Therefore, the Court need not reach the issue of whether Masse met the time-element conditions necessary to establish the exception to the pollution exclusion.<footnotemark>225</footnotemark> Hanover\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its duty to defend is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The Court notes that Hanover argues <em>Doerr </em>does not apply to this case because the exclusion in Hanover\u2019s policies is not a total pollution exclusion as was the provision examined by the court in <em>Doerr.</em><footnotemark><em>226</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Hanover cites <em>Bridger Lake, LLC v. Seneca Insurance Company, Inc. </em>in support of its position, but this case is distinguishable from the matter before the Court.<footnotemark>227</footnotemark> In <em>Bridger Lake, </em>the Western Distinct of Louisiana found that the pollution exclusion for damage \u201carising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of \u2018pollutants\u2019 \u201d applied to a case in which a crude oil pipeline ruptured, causing the release of more than 3,000 barrels of crude oil into the environment.<footnotemark>228</footnotemark> The court, however, applied Wyoming law and thus was not bound by, and did not consider, the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Doerr.</em><footnotemark><em>229</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">IT IS ORDERED that Hanover\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\">.
