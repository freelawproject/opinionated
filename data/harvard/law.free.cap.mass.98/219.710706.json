The plaintiff offered to show by ora\u00bb testimony, that two thirds of each branch did in fact vote for it; and it was agreed that if such testimony was competent it should be taken to have been so proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">In behalf of the defendants it was contended, among other things, that these facts showed no lawful authority for the city to celebrate the holiday by discharging these fireworks, and sc that the plaintiff could not recover against the city; and the judge reported the case for determination by the full court of this with other questions which are now immaterial, the parties agreeing that if on the facts reported the plaintiff could not maintain her action judgment should be entered for the defendants, but if otherwise the case should stand for trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-6\"><em>J. G. Abbott &amp; B. Dean, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVZ\">argued, on the point of the record, that the provision of the St. of 1861, c. 165, for a yea and nay vote by a city council in appropriating money to celebrate a holiday, is directory only. The right to celebrate the day is given, and the city cannot avail itself of the fact that it did not comply with details, to avoid responsibility to a party injured by the manner in which the corporation did an act within its power; for the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had no control over the Preliminary proceedings, and could only know that the city had tbe power, and undertook to exercise it, and in so doing injured him through negligence of- its servants. Further, the statute provides only that the appropriation of money to celebrate a holiday shall be made by a yea and nay vote, and here there was no appropriation of money necessarily. And besides, the record being silent, it is to be presumed that the vote was passed with the requisite formality.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-7\"><em>T. H. Sweetser &amp; W. S. Gardner, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Bigelow, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO6\">A city or town cannot be held liable in damages for the act of a person, unless it appears that the injury was inflicted by a servant or agent of the city or town while engaged in the legitimate exercise of the service or business for which he was employed. Unless this is shown the maxim <em>respondeat superior </em>does not apply. <em>Walcott </em>v. <em>Swampscott, </em>1 Allen, 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The only authority conferred on a city by which it can legally appropriate money to celebrate a holiday is found in St. 1861, <em>c. </em>165. Before the enactment of that statute any appropriation of money for such purpose was illegal. <em>Hood </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of </em>Lynn, 1 Allen, 103. The authority given by the statute is a strictly limited one. It can be exercised only in pursuance of a \u201cvote of two thirds of the members of each branch of the city council present and voting by yea and nay vote.\u201d There was no competent evidence at the trial of this case that the city of Lawrence had duly exercised any authority under this statute for the celebration of the Fourth of July, when the plaintiff was injured ; or that any one was duly empowered to purchase fireworks in behalf of the city to be used in such celebration. The only competent evidence of any such authority is to be found in the record of the proceedings of the city council kept according to the provisions of law. By the act establishing the city of Lawrence, St. 1853, c. 70, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 10, it is expressly provided that each board composing the city council shall keep a record of its own proceedings, and that a city clerk shall be chosen who shall be the clerk of the board of aldermen. Parol evidence was inadmissible to prove any acts or proceedings of the city council, or that the record of such proceedings as kept by the clerk was erroneous or defective. <em>Mayhew </em>v. <em>District of Gay </em>Head, 13 Allen, 129, 134, and cases cited, There was therefore no legal evidence whatever offered by the plaintiff that the defendants had purchased any fireworks or had authorized any person to use them. The acts of the mayor and other officers of the city who undertook to procure them at the expense of the city, were beyond the scope of their official power or duty, and can in no way be held to be the foundation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>charging them in this action. Upon this ground, without determining the question whether the city could be held liable, even if it had appeared that the purchase of the fireworks was duly authorized, the entry must be, in conformity to the agreement of the parties, <em>Judgment for the defendants.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
