It was dated January 20, 1865, and approved by the magistrate January 23, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-7\">\u201c The judge ruled that the bond was admissible in evidence, and that the facts stated in the testimony offered by the defendant would not constitute a defence to the action; and thereupon a verdict was taken, by the direction of the court, for tire plaintiff, for a sum which it was agreed was the amount due, if any sum could be recovered and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-8\"><em>A.

After its rejection by the magistrate, no rightful delivery of the bond could be made, as against the defendant, without notice to him. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>7 Pick. 93. <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>Metcalf, </em>8 Mass. 238. <em>Mussey </em>v. <em>Rayner, </em>22 Pick. 223. <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>12 Pick. 135. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Eastman, </em>4 Greenl. 526. This bond, not being essential in legal proceedings, but only allowed for the convenience of the defendant, requires a stamp.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-9\"><em>I. Knowles, Jr., </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APX\">cited <em>Deardorff </em>v <em>Foresman, </em>24 Ind. 481; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>4 Pick. 520; <em>York County Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>51 Maine, 506.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AyR\">The defendant\u2019s own statement as to the circumstances under which the bond was executed and delivered shows that it was signed by him and accepted by the magistrate. The fact that the magistrate would not approve it as sufficient until strengthened by the addition of a third surety did not exonerate either of those who signed it originally.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">No stamp is required upon such a bond under the laws of the United States. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
