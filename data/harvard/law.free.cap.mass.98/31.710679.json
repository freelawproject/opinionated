Cutter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>did not perform the condition set forth therein, the plaintiff asked judgment for the penalty. But the defendants contended that the instrument was insufficient and void, and in form a mere record of certain proceedings had before the master and not a recognizance; and further that the plaintiff could not recover, because his declaration did not specially allege that the master was authorized to take the recognizance, although it set forth all the facts necessary to give the magistrate jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">Judgment was entered for the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-6\"><em>J.

Gray, 4 Gray, 444, and argued that the instrument did not conform to the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>124, \u00a7 10, either in substance or form, and was void for uncertainty in not setting forth explicitly in its condition what examination was to be had and before what magistrate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b41-8\">Chapman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alb\">1. The declaration sets forth all the facts which are necessary to give the magistrate jurisdiction, and it is not necessary to add to them an averment that he had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">2. The paper declared on is in form a recognizance. It states the sum in which the recognizors bound themselves, and the condition of the obligation; and this is prefaced by a statement of the facts which authorized the magistrate to take the recognizance. It conforms to the provisions of the statute (Gen. Sts. c. 124, \u00a7 10,) and indicates sufficiently what examination is to be had, and before what magistrate it is to take place. The defendants\u2019 counsel does not ooLit out any material variance from the words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
