McKeon, Jr., appeals from the order of the Law Division of April 27, 2005, affirming the Burlington County Prosecutor\u2019s denial of his admission into the State\u2019s Pretrial Intervention (PTI) program, <em>N.J.SA. </em>2C:43-12. The question presented is whether a defendant may be excluded, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g, from entry into PTI solely because the defendant previously received benefit of a supervisory treatment program, or its equivalent, in another state when charged with an offense that would not have been a crime in this State. Because we find that an otherwise qualified defendant should not be barred from PTI, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>In 2002, defendant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in the State of Pennsylvania, contrary to 75 <em>Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 3731.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The offense constituted a misdemeanor under Pennsylvania law. The charge was resolved by defendant entering the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) program, a form of pretrial diversion authorized in Pennsylvania. 75 <em>Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 3807 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant was charged with a second DUI offense in Pennsylvania in December 2003, and pled guilty to the offense in September 2004. Other than the two DUI offenses in Pennsylvania, and the present matter, defendant has never been charged with any other conduct considered under the laws of this State or any other state, to be a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On October 19, 2004, a Burlington County Grand Jury charged defendant under Indictment No. 2004-10-1183-1 with a single count of third-degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance (cocaine), contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(l). On January 31, 2005, defendant applied for PTI. On February 18, 2005, the Criminal Case Manager rejected his application determining that he was statutorily barred because of his prior diversionary treatment in Pennsylvania. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g. On March 22, 2005, the prosecutor rejected his application for the same reason, and defendant appealed to the Law Division. Concluding \u201cthat it was the legislative intent to limit defendants to one diversionary program regardless of where that diversionary program occurs,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the motion judge denied defendant\u2019s appeal on April 27, 2005. Under a plea agreement preserving his right to appeal from the denial of PTI, defendant pled guilty to the charge on May 16, 2005. Defendant was sentenced to one-year probation, and a six-month suspension of his driving privilege. All appropriate fines, fees and penalties were also assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The issue concerns construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-M\">g. Limitations. Supervisory treatment may occur only once with respect to any defendant and any person who has previously received supervisory treatment under section 27 of P.L. 1970, c. 226 (C. 24:21-27), shall not be eligible for supervisory treatment under this seetion. However, supervisory treatment, as provided herein, shall be available to a defendant irrespective of whether the defendant contests his guilt of the charge or charges against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Defendant argues that because he has never been diverted into PTI, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-12, or received supervisory treatment, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-27, or <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:36A-1, the successor statute to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-27, that he is not barred from admission into PTI under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g. Defendant contends that the statutory prohibition in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g, applies only when the prior treatment was received under the laws of this State. Alternatively, he asserts, that even if the prohibition is applicable when a defendant received prior diversionary treatment in another state, the prohibition is limited to where the charge in the other state constitutes a crime under the laws of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The State, citing the unreported decision of <em>State v. Meehan, </em>A-2500-80T4 (App.Div. Oct. 19, 1981),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> counters that \u201csupervisory treatment which constitutes a bar to a second diversion may be one which is afforded under the law of this State or another state with a comparable program.\u201d (slip op. at 3). The State argues that the \u201crationale behind the legislative intent is to prohibit supervisory treatment for those defendants who have already demonstrated that they are not amenable to rehabilitation through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>supervisory treatment; their prior supervisory treatment has not deterred them from engaging in subsequent criminal activity.\u201d The State asserts that whether the offense, for which a defendant may have received supervisory treatment in another state, constitutes a crime in New Jersey is not relevant to the exclusionary provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">PTI \u201crepresents a procedural alternative to the traditional system of prosecuting and incarcerating criminal suspects, and was intended as a response to deficiencies in that system.\u201d <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>85, 92, 363 A.2d 321 (1976) <em>(Leonardis </em>I). <em>See also State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 581, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996); <em>State v. Lagares, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>20, 28, 601 A.2d 698 (1992); and <em>State v. Bulu, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 341, 560 A.2d 1250 (1989). \u201cPretrial intervention is a discretionary program diverting criminal defendants from formal prosecution\u201d and \u201c[a]ny defendant charged with a crime is eligible for [the program].\u201d <em>State v. Caliguiri, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>28, 35-36, 726 A.2d 912 (1999). \u201cThe [Court Rule] Guidelines and the statute ... provide the prosecutor and criminal division manager with specific criteria to apply in reviewing a PTI application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 726 A.2d 912. \u201cThe decision to grant or deny diversion to a defendant carries with it an obligation to fairly exercise the broad discretion given to the prosecutor, in light of the potential consequences to persons charged with criminal offenses.\u201d <em>State v. Maldonado, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>539, 544, 715 A.2d 996 (App.Div.1998). \u201cTherefore, in a number of situations in which the prosecutor is vested with a broad measure of discretion, in order to pass constitutional scrutiny, certain prosecutorial decisions have been held to be subject to judicial review for arbitrariness.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\u201c[T]o reverse the denial of an application for PTI[,] a defendant must clearly and convincingly establish that the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to consent to admission to the program was based upon a patent and gross abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 715 A.2d 996. \u201cA \u2018patent and gross abuse of discretion\u2019 is more than just an abuse of discretion as traditionally conceived; it is a prosecutorial decision that \u2018has gone so wide of the mark sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>accomplished by PTI that fundamental fairness and justice required judicial intervention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 582-83, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Ridgway, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118,130, 504 A.2d 1241 (Law Div.1985)). \u201cTo overturn a prosecutor\u2019s decision!,] a party must show that th[e] decision either failed to account for all the relevant factors, was based on irrelevant or inappropriate factors, ... or constituted a \u2018clear error in judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>143, 145, 455 A.2d 1117 (1983) (quoting <em>State v. Bender, 80 N.J. 84, </em>93, 402 A.2d 217 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">An appellate court\u2019s scope of review of a trial court\u2019s determination is limited. When the appellate court is satisfied that the findings of the trial court could reasonably have been reached on sufficient, credible evidence in the record, \u201cits task is complete and it should not disturb the result, even though it has the feeling it might have reached a different conclusion were it the trial tribunal.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). However, \u201c[a] [motion judge\u2019s] interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty v. Manalapan Tp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The State argues for a literal interpretation of the phrase \u201c[supervisory treatment <em>may occur only once with respect to any </em>defendant&gt;\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g (emphasis added), contending that the statute bars any defendant who has previously been admitted into PTI, or its equivalent in another state, even if the act charged in the other state would not constitute a <em>crime </em>in New Jersey. Although when read literally, the statutory language provides some support for the State\u2019s argument, we conclude that was not the Legislature\u2019s intent when it enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">In construing a statute, the function of a court is to determine the intent of the Legislature and, \u201cgenerally, the best indicator of that intent is the statutory language.\u201d <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005). \u201cA clear and unambiguous statute is not open to construction or interpretation....\u201d <em>Watt v. Mayor &amp; Council of Franklin, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>274, 277, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>121 A.2d 499 (1956). \u201cSuch a statute is clear in its meaning and no one need look beyond the literal dictates of the words and phrases used for the true intent and purpose in its creation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is not the function of a court to \u201cpresume that the Legislature intended something other than that expressed by way of the plain language.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell v. State, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>484, 488, 795 A.2d 857 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Equally recognizable is the principle that \u201cstatutes are to be read sensibly rather than literally[,] and the controlling legislative intent is to be presumed as \u2018consonant to reason and good discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schierstead v. City of Brigantine, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>220, 230, 148 A.2d 591 (1959) (quoting <em>Morris Canal &amp; Banking Co. v. Central R.R. Co. of N.J., </em>16 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>419, 428 (Ch. 1863)). Additionally, \u201cwhere a literal reading of the statute leads to absurd consequences, \u2018the court must restrain the words\u2019 and seek the true legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, 148 A.2d 591 (quoting <em>In re Merrill, </em>88 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>261, 273,102 <em>A. </em>400 (Prerog.Ct.1917)). Stated another way, \u201c \u2018[w]here a literal rendering will lead to a result not in accord with the essential purpose and design of the act, the spirit of the law will control the letter.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Eligibility of Certain Assistant Union County Prosecutors to Transfer to PFRS, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 558, 694 A.2d 289 (App.Div.1997) (quoting <em>N.J. Builders, Owners and Managers Ass\u2019n v. Blair, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>330, 338, 288 A.2d 855 (1972)) (alteration in original). \u201cWe are ... obliged to construe the statute consonant with the breadth of its objectives and the commonsense of the situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559, 694 A.2d 289. In construing a statute, \u201c[w]e should assume the Legislature intended a reasonable approach, and we should construe the statute to provide one if we can.\u201d <em>Roman v. Sharper, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>338, 341, 250 A.2d 745 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We are satisfied that defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute is more consistent with the policies underpinning PTI than that of the State. Generally, the PTI eligibility criteria are intended to be flexible in their application, as \u201cindividualized evaluation is at the heart of the program.\u201d <em>State v. Mickens, </em>236 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>272, 277, 565 A.2d 720 (App.Div.1989). The criteria must be applied with the aim of furthering the purposes of PTI, \u201c[to] divert\u00ed ] eligible defendants out of the criminal process\u201d to the advantage of the defendant, society, and the criminal justice system, <em>ibid.; </em>to deter \u201cfuture criminal behavior through the receipt of early rehabilitative services;\u201d and to relieve \u201coverburdened criminal calendars.\u201d <em>State v. DeMarco, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>562, 566-68, 527 A.2d 417 (1987). <em>See State v. Hoffman, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>149, 156-57, 539 A.2d 1254 (App.Div.1988); <em>see also Leonardis I, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 100, 363 A.2d 321 (holding that \u201cthe eligibility criteria [for PTI] must be both comprehensive and flexible. Narrow and inflexible criteria, which unduly restrict admissions to the program would be self-defeating, and would undermine the efficiency of PTI.\u201d). We view the prohibition contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g as an exception to the general flexible rule governing admission criteria. The statutory bar is applicable to defendants who have already received, at the expense of this State, the benefit of a state-approved diversionary program tailored to the defendant\u2019s individual needs. Accordingly, we conclude that the term \u201c[s]upervisory treatment,\u201d found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g refers to diversionary programs under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12 and to conditional discharges under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-27, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:36A-1, not to diversionary programs under the laws of other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Support <em>for our </em>construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g is found in the PTI Guidelines established by the Supreme Court under <em>Rule </em>3:28.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State argues that Guideline 3(g) of <em>Rule </em>3:28 supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>its interpretation of the statute asserting that the Guideline contains language similar to the statute under review: \u201cSupervisory treatment may only occur once with respect to any defendant who has previously been enrolled in a program of pretrial intervention or conditionally discharged, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-27 or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:36A-1.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The sentence relied upon by the State only lends support to its argument if read in isolation from the remainder of the Guidelines. The next sentence in the same Guideline supports our construction of the statute. The second sentence of the Guideline provides that the term \u201cprogram of pretrial intervention\u201d means a New Jersey PTI program established under the laws of this State: \u201cAll applications for enrollment in a PTI program must proceed in accordance <em>with the rules of the Supreme Court and these Guidelines </em>after reference to the Pretrial Intervention Registry established pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:28(e) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-21(a).\u201d Guideline 3(g) of <em>R. </em>3:28 (emphasis added). It is this State\u2019s PTI program that is in accord with the Court Rules, not programs of other states. Also, the \u201cRegistry\u201d referenced in the Guideline was established for the purpose of listing defendants who have been enrolled in this State\u2019s PTI program. <em>See Rule </em>3:28(e), providing in pertinent part: \u201cThe Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish and maintain a Pretrial Intervention Registry for the purpose of determining applications, enrollments and the degree of completion thereof by a defendant <em>in a program approved by the Supreme Court </em>in accordance with Paragraph (a).\u201d (emphasis added). See also Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on Guideline 3(g) (2006), which provides that \u201cGuideline 3(g) creates a bar against admission into a PTI program for those defendants who have previously been diverted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12 et seq. or conditionally discharged pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-27 or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:36A-1.\u201d The comment refers to programs established under the laws of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>We hold that the Legislative intent in enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g, is to provide a single opportunity for a defendant to enroll in a PTI program in New Jersey, not to bar an otherwise eligible defendant from PTI solely because he was previously admitted to a pretrial diversionary program in another state. This does not mean that a defendant\u2019s prior out-of-state pretrial diversion cannot be taken into consideration when evaluating the defendant for admission into PTI. In an appropriate case, prior admission to an out-of-state diversionary program may be considered as a factor in determining whether the defendant should be admitted, e.g., \u201c[t]he extent to which the applicant\u2019s crime constitutes part of a continuing pattern of anti-social behavior.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. 2C:43-12e(8).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Although the unreported decision of <em>State v. Meehan, supra, </em>is not binding on this court, we did consider the decision, and respectively disagree with its holding \u201cthat supervisory treatment which constitutes a bar to a second diversion may be one which is afforded under the law of this State or another State with a comparable program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In <em>Meehan, </em>the defendant was indicted for unlawful possession of a weapon without a firearm purchaser identification card, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:151-41(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant applied for acceptance in PTI. The prosecutor rejected defendant\u2019s admission to PTI because defendant had previously been arrested in New York, and the charges were dismissed pursuant to a conditional discharge. The prosecutor \u201creasoned that while the statute[,] <em>{N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g,] refers to supervisory treatment under New Jersey\u2019s statutory provisions, it made no logical difference whether the diversion occurred in this State or in other states.\u201d <em>Meehan, supra, </em>slip op. at 2. Defendant appealed, and the trial court reversed directing defendant\u2019s admission into PTI agreeing with defendant\u2019s argument that since the statute only \u201creferred to prior supervisory treatment under New Jersey law, the New York conditional discharge should not be considered.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The State appealed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>and another panel of this court reversed \u201cconcluding] that supervisory treatment which constitutes a bar to a second diversion may be one which is afforded under the law of this State or another State with a comparable program.\u201d <em>Meehan, supra, </em>slip op. at 3. In reaching its decision, the <em>Meehan </em>court relied upon this court\u2019s prior decision in <em>State v. Collins, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 434 A.2d 628 (App.Div.1981), <em>aff'd, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>449, 448 A.2d 977 (1982), where this court held that a defendant who had previously been diverted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-27 was barred from admission into PTI pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12g. We disagree with the <em>Meehan </em>court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Collins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\"><em>Collins </em>did not address the present issue. The court in <em>Collins </em>construed the statute as barring admission of an individual who had previously received the benefit of a diversionary program under the laws of this State, the then Controlled Dangerous Substance Act referenced in the statute. <em>Collins, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 205, 434 A.2d 628. We concur with that interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">We find comfort in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision affirming <em>Collins. Collins, supra, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>449, 448 A.2d 977. In discussing enrollment into PTI of an individual who had previously received the benefit of a diversionary program under <em>N.J.S.A </em>24:21-27, the Court held: \u201c[t]he Code in section 12(g), explicitly referring to the [Controlled Dangerous Substance] Act\u2019s Section 27, bars re-enrollment of anyone previously enrolled either under the Code or under the [Controlled Dangerous Substance] Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 448 A.2d 977. Both diversionary programs referenced by the Court are under the laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Assuming the State\u2019s argument is correct that the statute is meant to bar admission to New Jersey\u2019s PTI program of anyone who has previously been diverted into a diversionary program, including those of another state, we determine that the bar would only apply if the act charged in the other state constitutes a crime under the laws of New Jersey. To construe the statute otherwise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>could result in disparate treatment between defendants charged with similar acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">A defendant convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in New Jersey may not be barred from PTI solely because of the prior DWI conviction \u201cbecause motor vehicle violations are not \u2018crimes,\u2019 but rather only petty offenses, ... and thus are distinct from violations intended to constitute \u2018offenses\u2019 under the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice.\u201d <em>State v.
