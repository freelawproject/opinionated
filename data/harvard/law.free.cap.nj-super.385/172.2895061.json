The insurer that originally issued the policy discontinued coverage at the end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>1993, at which time defendant United States Life Insurance Company (U.S. Life) issued a replacement policy providing similar coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The coverage provided under the U.S. Life policy included the cost of care in a \u201cconvalescent home.\u201d However, the definition of \u201cconvalescent home\u201d excluded any facility that is \u201cused mainly for the aged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Defendant Albert H. Wohlers &amp; Co. was the administrator for the group policy U.S. Life issued to members of Women\u2019s American ORT. Beginning in 1995, Wohlers sent a series of notices to policyholders, including Laufer, which indicated that the U.S. Life policy provided \u201cnursing home\u201d benefits. In February and March of 1995, Wohlers sent a notice that stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">* IMPORTANT NOTICE *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">Your Catastrophe Major Medical Insurance Plan now includes an increased Nursing Home Benefit!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">Recently, you elected to increase your Nursing Home coverage by adding a new, <em>increased </em>NURSING HOME BENEFIT RIDER to your Catastrophe Major Medical Insurance Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">By adding this increased coverage to your current Catastrophe Major Medical Plan, your nursing home benefit has been improved! The Nursing Home Benefit Rider increases your coverage ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-12\">Up to $500 per week in benefits payable for convalescent or custodial care for a covered confinement in a nursing home. (Previously, this benefit provided you with up to $400 per week of coverage.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-13\">\n<em>Enclosed is the RIDER outlining your improved Nursing Home benefit. ...</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">In September 1996 and again in February 1997, Wohlers sent another notice that stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-15\">Currently, your Catastrophe Major Medical Insurance Plan provides up to $1,000,000 in protection. IF YOU ADD THE ENHANCED BENEFIT RIDERS ... your benefits will be INCREASED \u2014 providing you with up to $2,000,000 in total protection. PLUS ... your Nursing Home benefit will be increased by $100 Per Week....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">In addition, the bills that Wohlers sent to policyholders indicated that the coverage provided under the U.S. Life policy included a \u201cnursing home benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>In response to Wohlers\u2019 solicitations, Laufer increased her coverage under the U.S. Life policy, for which she paid additional premiums. According to Laufer, she had major medical insurance coverage through her employer, and the only reason she continued her coverage under the U.S. Life policy was to maintain the nursing home benefit she thought it provided. However, Laufer learned in late 2002 that the policy did not provide any nursing home benefit. As a result, she discontinued her coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Thereafter, Laufer brought this action against U.S. Life and Wohlers, alleging that Wohlers\u2019 communications regarding the \u201cnursing home\u201d benefit provided under the U.S. Life policy violated the Consumer Fraud Act. Laufer\u2019s complaint alleges that she had suffered an \u201cascertainable loss\u201d as a result of those deceptive communications, for which she seeks monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Laufer\u2019s complaint was brought not only on her own behalf but also on behalf of a class consisting of \u201call persons in the United States who at any time from May 12,1998 through the present are or have been insured under a group catastrophe major medical insurance policy underwritten by [U.S. Life] ... and ... administered by [Wohlers].\u201d The complaint does not allege that other members of the class suffered any \u201cascertainable loss,\u201d and it seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief on their behalf. Specifically, the complaint seeks a declaration that Wohlers\u2019 communications regarding the purported nursing home benefit provided under the U.S. Life policy violated the Consumer Fraud Act and \u201can injunction compelling defendants to send written notice to all class members, notifying them in plain and prominent language that they do <em>not, </em>and have not had, nursing home coverage, and notifying them that the Court has declared that all the representations made by [Wohlers] on behalf of [U.S. Life] to the effect that there was a nursing home benefit included in class members\u2019 coverage were deceptive in violation of the ... Consumer Fraud Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Laufer filed a motion for class certification under <em>Rule </em>4:32-1(b)(2), which provides for class certification in cases where \u201cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole[.]\u201d The trial court issued a comprehensive written opinion that denied the motion insofar as it sought certification of a nationwide class, but granted the motion with respect to all New Jersey residents \u201cwho at any time from May 12, 1998 through the present are or have been insured under a group catastrophe major medical insurance policy underwritten by [U.S. Life] and administered by [Wohlers].\u201d In concluding that this is an appropriate case for class certification under <em>Rule </em>4:32 \u2014 1(b)(2), the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">There is little question that U.S. Life is alleged to have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class. Its Plan applies generally to all members of the putative class, and its administrator\u2019s communications with class members appears consistent, if not uniform. Since this case involves the use of form contracts and mass mailings, it is particularly appropriate to use the class action procedure----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">... I agree with Laufer\u2019s assertion that defendants\u2019 alleged violations of the [Consumer Fraud Act] likely would affect every potential class member similarly and therefore defendants have acted in [a] way which is \u201cgenerally applicable to the class.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">We granted U.S. Life\u2019s motion for leave to appeal from the order certifying the dass. Laufer did not seek leave to cross-appeal from the denial of her motion for certification of a nationwide class.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">On appeal, U.S. Life argues that Laufer\u2019s complaint does not satisfy the requirements for class certification under <em>Rule </em>4:32-1(b)(2). U.S. Life also argues that the class certification Laufer seeks would violate the section of the Consumer Fraud Act that limits private causes of action to consumers \u201cwho suffer[] any ascertainable loss,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19, because the complaint does not allege that class members, other than Laufer herself, suffered any ascertainable loss. We reject both arguments and affirm the order granting class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">To maintain a class action, a putative class representative must satisfy the general prerequisites set forth in <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(a), which are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defense of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">These prerequisites of a class action are often referred to as \u201cnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.\u201d <em>See In re Cadillac V8-6-1 Class Action, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>412, 425, 461 A.2d 736 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In addition, the putative class representative must satisfy one of the prerequisites for maintenance of a class action set forth in <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(b). Laufer seeks class certification under <em>Rule </em>4:32-1(b)(2), which authorizes maintenance of a class action where \u201cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">U.S. Life does not dispute that Laufer has satisfied the requirements of numerosity and commonality set forth in <em>Rule </em>4:32-1(a)(1) and (2). However, U.S. Life argues that Laufer has failed to show the typicality of her claim and adequacy of representation required by <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(a)(3) and (4) or that her claim qualifies for class certification under <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(b)(2). We consider each of these arguments in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The claims of a putative class representative are typical if they \u201chave the essential characteristics common to the claims of the class.\u201d <em>In re Cadillac, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 425, 461 A.2d 736 (quoting 3B James W. Moore et al., <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 23.06-2 (2d ed. 1982)). \u201cSince the claims only need to share the same essential characteristics, and need not be identical, the typicality requirement is not highly demanding.\u201d 5 James W. Moore et al., <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 23.24[4] (3d ed. 1997). \u201cIf the class representative\u2019s claims arise from the same events, practice, or conduct, and are based on the same legal theory, as those of other class members, the typicality requirement is satis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>lied.\u201d Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 23.24[2]. \u201c[C]ases challenging the same unlawful conduct which affects both the named plaintiffs and the putative class usually satisfy the typicality requirement irrespective of the varying fact patterns underlying the individual claims.\u201d <em>Baby Neal v. Casey, </em>43 <em>F.</em>3d 48, 58 (3d Cir.1994). \u201cActions requesting declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy conduct directed at the class!,]\u201d which is the primary relief sought in a class action brought under <em>Rule </em>4:325 \u2014 1(b)(2), \u201cclearly fit this mold.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Although Laufer\u2019s complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the other members of the class and ancillary monetary relief for herself only, Laufer\u2019s claims on behalf of the class and herself are all based on the same alleged unlawful conduct \u2014 Wohlers\u2019 mailing of notices to U.S. Life policyholders containing alleged deceptive statements that their coverage included nursing home benefits \u2014 and they rely upon the same legal theory \u2014 that those statements violated the Consumer Fraud Act. Therefore, Laufer\u2019s claims \u201chave the essential characteristics common to the claims of the class!,]\u201d <em>In re Cadillac, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 425, 461 A.2d 736, and thus satisfy the typicality requirement of <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">In determining whether the putative class representative will be able to \u201cfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class!,]\u201d as required by <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(a)(4), \u201ccourts consider the adequacy of both the named representative and class counsel.\u201d Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 23.25[3][a]. U.S. Life does not dispute that Laufer\u2019s counsel has the qualifications, experience and ability to conduct this proposed class action. U.S. Life\u2019s argument is directed solely at whether Laufer can properly represent the interests of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The determination whether a putative class representative can fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>closely related to the requirement of typicality. <em>See In re Cadillac, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 425, 461 A.2d 736. To satisfy this requirement, \u201cthe plaintiff must not have interests antagonistic to those of the class.\u201d <em>Delgozzo v. Kenny, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 188, 628 A.2d 1080 (App.Div.1993) (quoting <em>In re Asbestos Sch. Litig., </em>104 <em>F.R.D. </em>422, 430 (E.D.Pa.1984)). However, this does not mean that \u201cthe interests of the class representative and the absentee class members [must] be identical.\u201d Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 23.25[4][b][i]. \u201c[T]he named representative only needs to be adequate[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Laufer\u2019s interest in demonstrating that Wohlers\u2019 communications to U.S. Life policyholders violated the Consumer Fraud Act is identical to that of other class members. Laufer\u2019s proof of this violation, which is the sole basis for her monetary claim against U.S. Life, would also establish the required foundation for the declaratory and injunctive relief she seeks on behalf of other class members. Although Laufer would be required to prove the damages she suffered as a result of that alleged violation to obtain monetary relief, there is no basis for concluding that her need to prove damages would in any way detract from her ability to represent the other class members. Moreover, even though Laufer does not seek injunctive relief on her own behalf, the pursuit of that relief on behalf of other class members is not antagonistic to Laufer\u2019s pursuit of monetary relief for herself. It also would require only limited, if any, additional work on the part of class counsel. Therefore, Laufer has established the adequacy of representation requirement of <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">When a putative class representative seeks class certification under <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(b)(2), a preliminary showing must be made that \u201cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole[.]\u201d The only reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>appellate decision in this State interpreting <em>Rule </em>4:32 \u2014 1(b)(2) is not relevant to the class certification issue presented in this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where there is no New Jersey case law relevant to a class certification issue, \u201cour courts have consistently looked to the interpretations given the federal counterpart for guidance.\u201d <em>Del-gozzo, supra, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 188, 628 A.2d 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1966 amendment to <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>23(b)(2), from which <em>Rule </em>4:32-1 (b)(2) was derived, <em>Muise v. G.P.U., Inc., </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 31, 851 A.2d 799 (App.Div.2004), state that \u201c[a]ction or inaction\u201d is considered to have been \u201cdirected to a class ... even if it has taken effect or is threatened only as to one or a few members of the class, provided it is based on grounds which have general application to the class.\u201d <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>23 Advisory Committee Note, 39 <em>F.R.D. </em>73, 102 (1966). Thus, a class action may be maintained under <em>Rule </em>4:32-1(b)(2) even though defendant\u2019s conduct is not \u201cdamaging to every member <em>o\u00ed </em>the class.\u201d <em>Baby Neal, supra, </em>43 F.3d at 58. \u2018What is important is that the relief sought by the named plaintiffs should benefit the entire class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59; <em>see generally </em>7AA Charles Alan Wright, Arthur E. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1775 (3d ed. 2005); Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 23.43 to 23.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Wohlers\u2019 alleged deceptive written notices, which indicated that the U.S. Life group accident and sickness policy provided coverage for nursing home benefits, were sent to all policyholders. Consequently, these alleged deceptive statements were potentially damaging to every member of the putative class, even though some class members may not have read the notices or relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the purported nursing home benefits in determining whether to maintain the coverage provided by the policy. Therefore, the limited injunctive relief sought by Laufer \u2014 notice to all other class members that \u201cthey do <em>not, </em>and have not had, nursing home coverage, ... and that the court has declared that all the representations made ... to the effect that there was a nursing home benefit included in class members\u2019 coverage were deceptive in violation of the Consumer Fraud Act\u201d \u2014 would clearly \u201cbenefit the entire class.\u201d <em>Baby Neal, supra, </em>43 F.3d at 59. If Laufer proves that the notice Wohlers sent to U.S. Life policyholders violated the Consumer Fraud Act, and all class members are informed of this violation, some of them may then make individual decisions to discontinue coverage or to seek monetary relief against U.S. Life based on their own individual circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that Wohlers\u2019 form notices to all policyholders under the U.S. Life group accident and sickness policy constituted \u201c[action] generally applicable to the class\u201d that Laufer seeks to represent, and if those notices are found to have violated the Consumer Fraud Act, it may be appropriate to grant the \u201cfinal injunctive relief ... with respect to the class as a whole\u201d that Laufer seeks. Consequently, this case qualifies for class certification under <em>Rule </em>4:32 \u2014 1 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">U.S. Life also argues that Laufer\u2019s complaint cannot be maintained as a class action because a private cause of action under the Consumer Fraud Act may be pursued only by a consumer who suffered \u201cascertainable loss,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19, and Laufer\u2019s complaint does not allege that other class members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>suffered \u201cascertainable loss\u201d as a result of U.S. Life\u2019s alleged consumer fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u201cAs originally enacted, the [Consumer Fraud] Act was exclusively enforced by the Attorney General, who was provided with broad powers to ... seek injunctions prohibiting fraudulent conduct and orders of restitution to make whole any person damaged by conduct violating the Act[.]\u201d <em>Meshinsky v. Nichols Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>464, 472-73, 541 A.2d 1063 (1988). However, the Act was amended in 1971 to authorize private actions. <em>See L. </em>1971, c. 247, \u00a7 7. The section of the Act authorizing private actions now provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">Any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of moneys or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of any method, act, or practice declared unlawful under this act ... may bring an action ... in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any action under this section the court shall, in addition to any other appropriate legal or equitable relief, award threefold the damages sustained by any person in interest. In all actions under this section, including those brought by the Attorney General, the court shall also award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, filing fees and reasonable costs of suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Thus, by the express terms of this section, a private plaintiff who establishes a violation of the Consumer Fraud Act may obtain not only monetary relief, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, but also \u201cequitable relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">The Supreme Court has described consumers who bring private actions under the Consumer Fraud Act as \u201cprivate attorneys general.\u201d <em>Lemelledo v. Beneficial Mgmt. Corp., </em>150 <em>N.J. 255, 268, </em>696 A.2d 546 (1997). Consequently, a private action may seek to remedy a Consumer Fraud Act violation not only as it affects the named plaintiff but also other consumers. Consistent with this view of the legislative intent in authorizing private consumer fraud actions, the Court has indicated that \u201cthe class action rule should be construed liberally in a case involving allegations of consumer fraud.\u201d <em>In re Cadillac, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 435, 461 A.2d 736; <em>see also Strawn v. Canuso, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>43, 68, 657 A.2d 420 (1995) (\u201c[A] class action is the superior method for adjudication of consumer-fraud claims[.]\u201d); <em>Riley v. New Rapids </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>Carpet Ctr., </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>218, 226-28, 294 A.2d 7 (1972) (\u201c[A] court should be slow to hold that a suit [under the Consumer Fraud Act] may not proceed as a class action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The only prerequisite for maintenance of a private action to remedy a violation of the Consumer Fraud Act is that \u201c[the] plaintiff must present a claim of ascertainable loss.\u201d <em>Weinberg v. Sprint Corp., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>233, 251, 801 A.2d 281 (2002). This is purely a \u201cstanding\u201d requirement. <em>Ibid. </em>The Act does not require a private plaintiffs claim of ascertainable loss to \u201cultimately prove successful.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff is only required to \u201cplead a claim of ascertainable loss that can survive a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 801 A.2d 281. Once this threshold standing requirement is satisfied, the plaintiff can pursue \u201call available remedies, including an injunction, ... even if the plaintiff ultimately loses on his damage claim but does prove an unlawful practice under the Act.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In a class action, only the putative class representative is required to satisfy any applicable standing requirement. \u201c[Unnamed plaintiffs] need not make any individual showing of standing [in order to obtain relief], because the standing issue focuses on whether the plaintiff is properly before the court, not whether ... absent class members are properly before the court.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>343, 395, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2174, 2201, 135 <em>L.Ed.M </em>606, 646 (1996) (Souter, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (quoting Alba Conte &amp; Herbert Newberg, <em>Newberg on Class Actions </em>\u00a7 2.07 (3d ed. 1992)). \u201cOnce [the named plaintiffs] standing has been established, whether [he] will be able to represent the putative class, including absent class members, depends solely on whether he is able to meet the additional criteria encompassed [by the rules governing class actions].\u201d <em>Fallick v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>162 F.3d 410, 423 (6th Cir.1998). Therefore, only the named plaintiff, Laufer, is required to satisfy the threshold standing requirement of \u201ca'claim of ascertainable loss that can survive a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Weinberg, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 253, 801 A.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>In support of its argument that a class action asserting a Consumer Fraud Act violation may be maintained only if the complaint alleges that not only the putative class representative but also all other class members suffered \u201cascertainable loss,\u201d U.S. Life relies upon <em>Thiedemann v. Mercedes-Benz USA, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>234, 251-54, 872 A.2d 783 (2005); <em>Weinberg, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 253-54, 801 A.2d 281; and <em>N.J. Citizen Action v. Schering-Plough Corp., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8,16, 842 A.2d 174 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>249, 837 A.2d 1092 (2003). However, the issue in those cases was whether the named plaintiff had made the showing of ascertainable loss required to obtain standing under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19, not whether the action could be pursued by the named plaintiff on behalf of other unnamed class members. Therefore, those cases provide no support for U.S. Life\u2019s argument that a putative class representative must allege that the unnamed class members suffered ascertainable loss to maintain a class action under the Consumer Fraud Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Furthermore, it is insufficient under <em>Weinberg </em>for a complaint simply to allege ascertainable loss. The plaintiff must be able to present sufficient evidence of such loss to survive a motion for summary judgment. <em>Weinberg, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 253, 801 A.2d 281. A class representative is not generally in a position to present evidence that unnamed class members suffered ascertainable loss as a result of an alleged consumer fraud. Consequently, if the Consumer Fraud Act were construed to require a showing that not only the putative class representative but also the unnamed class members suffered an ascertainable loss, this would create a significant obstacle to the maintenance of class actions under the Act. However, as previously noted, our courts have consistently indicated that class actions for the vindication of rights protected by the Consumer Fraud Act should be encouraged. Therefore, we decline to construe the \u201cascertainable loss\u201d prerequisite for maintenance of a private action in a manner that would significantly undermine the availability of class actions to remedy violations of the Consumer Fraud Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In sum, the requirement that a plaintiff in a private action under the Consumer Fraud Act suffer \u201cascertainable loss\u201d is solely a standing requirement. In a class action, the putative class representative is the only party who must satisfy any applicable standing requirement. Thus, if Laufer can make a sufficient showing of \u201cascertainable loss\u201d to survive a motion for summary judgment, this showing does not have to be made with respect to other unnamed class members. Once the class representative establishes standing, the determination whether the action may be maintained as a class action turns solely on whether the requirements of <em>Rule </em>4:32-1 have been satisfied. For the reasons set forth in section I of this opinion, Laufer has shown that this action satisfies the requirements of <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(a) and that U.S. Life\u2019s alleged violations of the Consumer Fraud Act constitute \u201caction generally applicable to the class\u201d she seeks to represent, which may be remedied by the \u201cfinal injunctive relief\u2019 she proposes, thus satisfying the requirements of <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(b)(2). Therefore, the trial court properly granted Laufer\u2019s motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> That decision, <em>Mac Neil v.
