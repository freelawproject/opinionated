In a brief, which was unnecessarily lengthy, defendant advances ten errors allegedly committed by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>court during defendant\u2019s Cape May County jury trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The excessively wordy and repetitive 104 page \u201cbrief\u2019 made it more difficult for us to discern whether defendant was advancing any meritorious allegations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After our careful review of the record, however, we conclude that several errors were made that require reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction and a new trial. We deal only with those errors, which include the preclusion of admissible evidence and the absence of an instruction regarding the appropriate use of fresh complaint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The pertinent facts are as follows. Defendant and J.B.\u2019s mother divorced in 1990. In 1993, when J.B. was eight years old, she was, unfortunately, molested by her paternal grandmother\u2019s husband who was subsequently convicted of these crimes. J.B. stopped visiting with her father during this period, but resumed visitation approximately one year later in the fall of 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">After contact with her father resumed, J.B. and her brother R.B.III, who was eighteen months younger than his sister, generally had overnight visitation on weekends with their father and his current wife. It was during the overnight visitation at her father\u2019s house that J.B. asserts she was once again molested, this time by her own father.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">She could not recall precisely when the incidents occurred or exactly when they stopped, but it was believed that they occurred sometime between 1998 and 2000. J.B. reported that the incidents occurred in the mornings, while her brother and defendant\u2019s wife were at the store and J.B. and defendant were alone in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">J.B. testified that in the morning defendant would come into the bedroom she shared with her brother, while she was alone watching television or listening to music. Defendant would lock the bedroom door and then proceed to have sex with her for about one hour. J.B. testified that defendant would touch her chest and, put his penis inside of her, ejaculating on her stomach. J.B. would wipe the ejaculate off of her stomach and then get dressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">According to J.B., neither she nor defendant said anything to each other during the encounters and J.B. did not tell defendant to stop. J.B. testified that on one occasion defendant\u2019s wife came home while defendant was still in J.B.\u2019s bedroom. The wife knocked on the door, and defendant told her to \u201chold on.\u201d Defendant dressed and left the room, explaining to his wife that he was helping J.B. fix something. After the encounters, defendant would give J.B. money and instruct her not to tell anybody. J.B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>testified that after the incidents occurred she \u201cwould keep it together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">J.B. explained that she did not tell her brother about the abuse because she didn\u2019t want him to know and she felt her brother and her mother \u201c[didn\u2019t] need to know.\u201d J.B. stopped visiting her father \u201cmaybe two or three years\u201d before the trial, when she was fourteen, and did not explain to her mother why she no longer wanted to visit her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Defendant\u2019s current wife testified that she never observed any \u201cunusual or untoward conduct\u201d between defendant and his daughter. It was her custom to shop on Fridays when she picked up the children. If she had to pick something up on the weekends, she would go to a nearby market within minutes of the house. She did not recall any incident where defendant was in the bedroom with J.B. and instructed her to wait outside or not to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">R. B.III testified that he and his sister had a good relationship and were \u201cpretty open\u201d with each other. R.B.III stated that his sister never disclosed any allegations of abuse by defendant and he never saw anything that aroused his suspicions, except that J.B. \u201ccried a lot\u201d and one time, when he was about ten years old, he saw his sister naked in the bathroom. She appeared to be upset and crying while speaking with defendant. He could not see his father, nor could he hear what was said.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">S. B., defendant\u2019s aunt, testified that she also had a close relationship with J.B. She explained that two summers before trial, after the alleged abuse, J.B. expressed a desire to live with defendant because she was upset with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">S.B.\u2019s husband, J.B.\u2019s uncle, confirmed his wife\u2019s testimony, and also explained that when he had discussed with defendant the previous sexual assault against J.B. by her grandmother\u2019s husband, defendant exclaimed that \u201che felt that he let his daughter down\u201d and \u201cat one point he wanted to kill [the abuser].\u201d According to S.B.\u2019s husband, defendant was \u201cvery emotional\u201d about his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>daughter\u2019s previous abuse and defendant \u201chas never recovered from that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">A licensed private detective hired by the defense testified that R.B.III reported that defendant would not send anybody to the store on weekends, \u201cbecause he would generally be sleeping.\u201d R.B.III specifically told the investigator that when he occasionally went out with defendant\u2019s current wife to get food or coffee, it generally took about ten minutes, and when they returned, defendant was usually asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">J.B.\u2019s best friend in 1998 and 1999 testified that during the relevant time period she would spend the night at defendant\u2019s house \u201cbasically every weekend [J.B.] was [at defendant\u2019s house],\u201d and thirty percent of the time she would stay over both Friday and Saturday nights. During the time she was staying with J.B., she did not observe anything unusual between J.B. and defendant, and J.B. never said anything about defendant molesting J.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">About nine months before defendant\u2019s trial began, and about two years after the alleged abuse, J.B. told her cousin that her father had molested her. This disclosure took place in the \u201cmiddle of the night\u201d after her cousin had revealed that she had been physically abused. J.B.\u2019s cousin testified that J.B. was \u201cvery upset\u201d when she divulged the sexual abuse and was sitting with \u201cher knees in her hands, like, rocking back and forth,\u201d and crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The cousin advised J.B. to tell her mother, but J.B. asked her cousin not to tell anyone because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to go and do anything\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to put [her] family through it.\u201d The cousin promised to keep the secret, but the next morning, she told her aunt, J.B.\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">When confronted by her mother, J.B. was upset with her cousin for telling and refused to confirm the abuse. Upon being questioned by the police, however, J.B. admitted that \u201cher dad had had sex with her\u201d at his house and the incidents had \u201cgone on for two or three years\u201d but had stopped about two years prior. J.B. was \u201chysterical,\u201d \u201ccrying,\u201d \u201cupset,\u201d and \u201cvery reluctant to give details.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Upon being arrested, defendant responded by saying \u201che couldn\u2019t believe it and he couldn\u2019t recall anything. He kept on saying that there was nothing there.\u201d During a formal statement, defendant stated that he didn\u2019t recall anything happening and if it did it would have occurred \u201c[pjrobably when I was drunk, if it did happen.\u201d Defendant stated \u201cI don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t recall anything. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The jury convicted defendant and he has been incarcerated since November 6,2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The central and controlling issue in this case was J.B.\u2019s credibility. Except for one ambiguous occurrence, where J.B.\u2019s brother saw her naked in the bathroom talking with her father, there was no evidence apart from the victim\u2019s testimony of any suspicious behavior between defendant and J.B. and no witness to the alleged abuse of J.B. by defendant. Therefore, any error that impacted upon the jury\u2019s ability to fairly assess J.B.\u2019s credibility would necessarily be prejudicial. That is the case, unfortunately, with each of the mistakes we discuss in the following sections of this opinion, and consequently we are constrained to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction. Because we are directing a new trial, it is not necessary to decide the other claims defendant has advanced, but it should be noted that all of the alleged errors we do not specifically address in this decision were either without merit or well within the trial judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">To attack J.B.\u2019s credibility, defendant offered evidence that J.B. had told her paternal grandmother and \u201cmany family members\u201d that she had been sexually assaulted by her coworkers at Burger King and that they had been fired. After the family spoke to her supervisor at the restaurant and the supervisor indicated that J.B. had never made any such reports, J.B. admitted to her family that she had lied. The court ruled the evidence inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>We acknowledge that a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are \u201centitled to deference\u201d and will not be reversed unless the court not only abused its discretion but was also clearly wrong. <em>State v. Marrero, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>469, 483-84, 691 A.2d 293 (1997). We also acknowledge that the court was legitimately angry with defense counsel who appeared on the day of trial with a list of numerous witnesses who had not previously been disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Normally, except for prior convictions, \u201ca trait of character cannot be proved by specific instances of conduct.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>608. However, two years after defendant\u2019s trial and while defendant\u2019s appeal was pending, our Supreme Court established \u201ca narrow exception to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>608,\u201d that permits a defendant to challenge a victim-witness\u2019 credibility by introducing evidence that the victim has made prior false criminal accusations. <em>State v. Guenther, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>129,154, 854 A.2d 308 (2004). Although the Rape Shield Law restricts a defendant\u2019s ability to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s \u201cprevious sexual conduct,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-7, a prior false allegation is not subject to the Law because the false allegation does not constitute \u201cprevious sexual conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Bray, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>485, 496, 813 A.2d 571 (App.Div.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Under <em>Guenther, </em>the trial judge must determine at a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing, \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, whether the defendant has proven that a prior accusation charging criminal conduct was made by the victim and whether that accusation was false.\u201d <em>Guenther, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 157, 854 A.2d 308. If defendant meets this burden, then the trial judge must consider specific factors, enumerated by the Court, to determine admissibility of the evidence. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">These factors include whether the victim\u2019s credibility is \u201cthe central issue,\u201d \u201cthe similarity of the prior false accusation to the crime charged,\u201d \u201cthe proximity of the prior false accusation\u201d to the current charges, \u201cthe number of witnesses, the items of extrinsic evidence,\u201d the \u201ctime required for presentation of the issue,\u201d and whether the false accusation\u2019s probative value \u201cwill be outweighed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>by undue prejudice, confusion of the issues, and waste of time.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The State argues simply that <em>Guenther </em>is inapplicable because it was decided after defendant\u2019s trial. Defendant merely argues that <em>Guenther </em>is directly on point and should be applied by this court on appeal. In fact, in over 200 pages of \u201cbriefs\u201d neither the State nor defendant specifically addresses our jurisprudence governing retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The first step in determining whether to apply a decision retroactively is to analyze whether a \u201cnew rule\u201d has been created. <em>Knight, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 249, 678 A.2d 642. We must determine whether the decision \u201c \u2018breaks new ground\u2019\u201d and \u201c \u201cwas not dictated by precedent, existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250-51, 678 A.2d 642 (quoting <em>State v. Lark, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>331, 339, 567 A.2d 197 (1989)). Thus, only \u201c \u2018sudden and generally unanticipated repudiation of a long-standing practice,\u2019 \u201d qualifies as a \u201cnew rule.\u201d <em>State v. Afanador, </em>151 <em>N.J. 41, 58, </em>697 A.2d 529 (1997) (quoting <em>State v. Cupe, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 12, 672 A.2d 1233, <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>589, 677 A.2d 761 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">If the decision is a \u201c \u2018new rule,\u2019 we look to three factors in deciding the extent of its retroactive application.\u201d <em>State v. Natale, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>458, 493, 878 A.2d 724 (2005). These three factors include the purpose of the rule, the extent of reliance upon the old rule, and the effect of retroactive application upon the justice system. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In this case, we first question whether <em>Guenther </em>established a \u201cnew rule.\u201d <em>Guenther </em>announced \u201cwe are not creating a new rule of evidence, but merely carving out a narrow exception to the common law rule embodied in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>608.\u201d <em>Guenther, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 159, 854 A.2d 308. In addition, <em>Guenther </em>pointed out that \u201cmany jurisdictions already allow the impeachment of a witness who has made a prior false criminal accusation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Furthermore, related precedents exist in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In <em>State v. Ross, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>246, 592 A.2d 291 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, State v. V.R., </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>389, 599 A.2d 165 (1991), we ordered a remand to determine whether a ten-year-old child\u2019s prior claim of abuse was admissible. In that case, the prosecutor had argued that the victim was too young and too inexperienced to fabricate the allegations against defendant. The prosecutor made this argument despite knowing that the child had made prior accusations of abuse against another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Although <em>Ross </em>can obviously be distinguished from the situation herein, <em>Bray, supra, </em>856 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 485, 813 A.2d 571, is more closely related and clearly foreshadowed <em>Guenther. </em>In <em>Bray, </em>we found that a hearing should have been conducted to determine whether the child victim had made prior allegations that \u201cwere probably false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495-97, 813 A.2d 571. We instructed the trial court to determine admissibility by considering factors quite similar to those directed by the Supreme Court in <em>Guenther. Id. </em>at 497, 813 A.2d 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">However, <em>Bray, </em>like <em>Guenther, </em>was also decided after defendant\u2019s trial in this case. Although <em>Ross </em>alone raises some question as to whether <em>Guenther </em>established a new rule, we assume that with regard to this case, <em>Guenther </em>specifically announced an \u201cexception to the common law rule embodied in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>608,\u201d which had not previously existed in this State. <em>See Guenther, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 159, 854 A.2d 308. The Court\u2019s pronouncement that its decision was not \u201ccreating a new rule of evidence,\u201d was directed toward assuring the Legislature that it intended to follow the \u201cprescribed statutory procedure\u201d to conform the evidence rules to the Court\u2019s decision. <em>See State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 351-52, 537 A.2d 667 (1988). Consequently, we proceed to apply the retroactivity factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The purpose of the evidence exception established by <em>Guenther </em>was to \u201cpromote fairness in the trial process\u201d by enhancing \u201cthe truth-seeking function\u201d of the jury. <em>Guenther, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 150,160, 854 A.2d 308. Such a purpose would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>furthered by retroactive application because any injustice caused by a strict application of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>608 could then be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">However, there was widespread and lengthy reliance upon the pertinent evidence rule. For many years, our courts have followed the general principle contained in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>608 and the preceding version, <em>Evidence Rule </em>22, which prevent the use of specific instances of conduct, such as prior false accusations, to challenge a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>E.g., State v. Mondrosch, </em>108 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 4-5, 259 A.2d 725 (App.Div.1969), <em>certif. denied, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>600, 264 A.2d 71 (1970); <em>State v. Hummel, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 427-28, 334 A.2d 52 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>102, 335 A.2d 54 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Neither party has indicated the extent of disruption that would ensue from retroactive application of this decision, though we assume that any retroactive application of a new principle will cause some disruption. We are uncertain, however, how many prior cases involved <em>\u201ca </em>victim-witness whose credibility was the central issue in the case\u201d and who had made a false criminal accusation against another that was ruled inadmissible under the existing evidence rules. Given the nature of sexual abuse cases, we must also acknowledge that any previous proceedings that meet this limitation probably involve emotionally distraught victims who are not eager to relive any prior painful experiences through additional testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In weighing the three retroactivity factors, we conclude that the <em>Guenther </em>exception to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>608 should be applied retroactively to this case, which was \u201cin the pipeline\u201d at the time <em>Bray </em>and <em>Guenther </em>were decided. <em>See Natale, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 494, 878 A.2d 724 (explaining a new rule may be applied purely prospectively; prospectively to all cases except that in which the Rule was announced; or retroactively to cases \u201cin the pipeline,\u201d meaning on direct appeal at the time the new Rule was announced; or fully retroactively to all cases); <em>see also Knight, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 249, 678 A.2d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Here, when J.B. was confronted by the prosecutor with defendant\u2019s charge that she had made a prior false accusation of sexual abuse, J.B. denied ever having made such a statement to her family or, for that matter, reporting her co-workers. The court, without conducting any <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing, announced that it would not allow defendant\u2019s mother \u201cto testify about something that never occurred.\u201d Proper application of <em>Guenther </em>would require that a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing be conducted to determine whether the false statement was made and if so whether it would be admissible. Such a hearing must be conducted on the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">In addition, the court in this case denied defendant\u2019s request to introduce evidence of J.B.\u2019s virginity and lack of sexual knowledge after the alleged onset of abuse. Without complying with the procedural requirements of the Rape Shield Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20.14-7a, defense counsel indicated on the morning of the first trial date that J.B.\u2019s aunt would testify that J.B. \u201cconfided to her that she had lost her virginity to a boy named [C.] in 1999 and began practicing birth control during that time period.\u201d The trial court appropriately held such evidence \u201ccompletely inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Defense counsel then indicated he would present J.B.\u2019s ex-boyfriend to testify that she had told him she was a virgin during the relevant time period. The court abruptly precluded this testimony as well, obviously viewing defendant\u2019s last minute machinations as a \u201cgigantic stall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">On the third day of trial, the defense again attempted to present evidence of J.B.\u2019s chastity through a different witness. This time, defense counsel indicated that J.B.\u2019s aunt would testify that \u201csomewhere between 1999 and 2001\u201d J.B. told her she was a virgin and asked her \u201cwhat sexual intercourse feels like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">The court responded that it did not find this type of evidence \u201cappropriate rebuttal material at the eleventh and a half hour, where the conversation is subject to so many interpretations and isn\u2019t clearly exculpatory to your client.\u201d After providing defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>counsel repeated opportunity to explain the purpose of the proffered evidence, the court refused to permit introduction of the evidence and explained that the \u201cRape Shield Act Motion should have come in months ago,\u201d but such a motion \u201cnever was supplied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The failure of counsel to comply with the procedural requirements of the Rape Shield Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-7a, undoubtedly created much of the confusion regarding the admissibility of this evidence. This was not newly discovered evidence of the type that might excuse defense counsel\u2019s failure to make this motion before \u201ctrial or preliminary hearing.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The purpose of the Law was to eliminate the sexist assumption that \u201c \u2018unchaste women are more likely to consent and lie under oath than their virtuous sisters.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Budis, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>498, 506, 580 A.2d 283 (App.Div.1990), <em>aff'd, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>519, 593 A.2d 784 (1991) (quoting Harriett R. Galvin, <em>Shielding Rape Victims in the State and Federal Courts: A Proposal For the Second Decade, </em>70 <em>Minn.L.Rev. </em>763 (1986)). \u201c[0]nly in situations where the relevance and probative worth of prior sexual experience are clear and substantial should the Rape Shield Law bend to the confrontation rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Cuni, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>584, 608, 733 A.2d 414 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">In this instance, the court should have separated the evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct from the evidence alluding to her lack of sexual experience. \u201c[E]vidence that the victim of a sexual assault is not a virgin is the precise kind of evidence which the Rape Shield Law was intended to ordinarily exclude.\u201d <em>State v. Ogburne, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>113, 121, 561 A.2d 667 (App.Div.1989). When and with whom the victim lost her virginity was subject to the Rape Shield Law and, given the late proffer, was correctly excluded by the trial court. <em>Cuni, supra, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>at 598, 733 A.2d 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">However, the evidence that the victim claimed to be a virgin after the alleged attacks by her father began in 1998 does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>not implicate the Rape Shield Law, because it is not evidence of prior sexual conduct but is evidence of the lack of any prior sexual conduct. <em>State v. Burke, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>97, 102-03, 804 A.2d 617 (Law Div.2002). The alleged disclosure to J.B.\u2019s aunt directly contradicts J.B.\u2019s charge that defendant raped her beginning sometime in 1998, and would have been probative of her credibility. The evidence was ruled inadmissible without the court properly determining its precise nature and whether the probative value of the evidence would be substantially outweighed by any countervailing factors. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Besides precluding potentially admissible evidence offered by the defense, the court also allowed the State to present evidence through J.B.\u2019s cousin about J.B.\u2019s complaint of sexual abuse without instructing the jury on the proper use of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u201c[T]o qualify as fresh complaint [evidence], the victim\u2019s statement to someone she would ordinarily turn to for support must have been made within a reasonable time after the alleged assault and must have been spontaneous and voluntary.\u201d <em>State v. L.P., </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 380, 800 A.2d 207 (App.Div.2002) (quoting <em>State v. Hill, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>150, 163, 578 A.2d 370 (1990)). Even though this complaint was made several years after the alleged abuse ceased, neither party contends that the evidence was not \u201cfresh complaint.\u201d <em>See L.P., supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382-84, 800 A.2d 207 (explaining the allowance of additional time for children to complain and the relationship of this doctrine to the Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u201cFresh-complaint evidence serves a narrow purpose. It allows the State to negate the inference that [because of her silence] the victim was not sexually assaulted.\u201d <em>State v. Hill, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>150, 163, 578 A.2d 370 (1990). Its purpose \u201cis to allow the State to meet in advance the negative inference which would be drawn from the absence of evidence that the victim reported the incident to one to whom she would naturally turn for comfort and advice.\u201d <em>State v. J.S., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 256, 536 A.2d 769 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>588, 546 A.2d 513 (1988). Fresh complaint evidence is \u201cto prove only that the alleged victim complained, not to corroborate the victim\u2019s allegations concerning the crime.\u201d <em>State v. Bethune, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>137, 146, 578 A.2d 364 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Because of the limited nature of this evidence, it is crucial for the trial court to instruct the jury on how to utilize such evidence. <em>State v. Buscham, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super </em>346, 359, 823 A.2d 71 (App.Div.2003). The victim\u2019s delay in reporting or silence may be considered by the jury in assessing the victim\u2019s credibility, but the jury must also be told that the \u201csilence or delay, in and of itself, is not inconsistent with a claim of abuse.\u201d <em>State v. P.H., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>378, 396-97, 840 A.2d 808 (2004). The evidence can be considered by the jury in opposition to credibility concerns that may develop regarding the victim\u2019s truthfulness because of a failure to complain to a confidant, but the evidence cannot be used to support the fact of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">We acknowledge that the record reflects that defense counsel briefly cross-examined J.B.\u2019s cousin about some of the details of the abuse complaint, which could not have been admitted by the State. This was an apparent attempt to show that the abuse could not have occurred because what J.B. told her cousin was discordant with her testimony. Defense counsel also argued forcefully before the jury that JJB.\u2019s delay in reporting the alleged abuse indicated that the abuse did not occur. The State argues that the absence of an instruction did not prejudice defendant because a proper charge would have informed the jury that it could still find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>abuse despite the delay in reporting. While this may be so, that is not the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The jury convicted defendant, and we do not know how the jury reacted to defendant\u2019s argument or cross-examination of J.B.\u2019s cousin. In the absence of an instruction, and especially considering the conviction, we must assume that the jury was not impressed with defense counsel\u2019s argument or cross-examination and, most significantly, may have improperly used the fact of the complaint as corroboration of J.B.\u2019s testimony that she was abused by her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">As we have said numerous times, \u201c[appropriate and proper charges to a jury are essential for a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>281,287, 430 A.2d 914 (1981). \u201cErroneous instructions on matters or issues that are material to the jury\u2019s deliberation are presumed to be reversible error in criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>State v. Jordan, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>409, 422, 688 A.2d 97 (1997). Here, the absence of an instruction constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Finally, comments of the trial judge and prosecutor during a sidebar conference were inadvertently played to the jury during a playback of the testimony of R.B.III. The court indicated that the improper exposure was only \u201ctwo or three seconds\u201d and it believed that the jury could not have heard the comments. Defense counsel countered, however, that he \u201cheard fairly loud and clearly [the judge\u2019s] voice indicating that the boy couldn\u2019t be any more heartbroken. I heard that very clearly and I don\u2019t hear the best.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The reference by the judge during the sidebar apparently related to the brother\u2019s demeanor when he testified about seeing his naked sister talking to his father in the bathroom. If the jury heard the judge\u2019s comment regarding R.B.III\u2019s credibility, the defendant could have been prejudiced. Since the jury asked for the playback, the brother\u2019s testimony must have been considered significant. Because a new trial must be granted, we simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>advise that care must be taken to ensure that such an error does not occur again.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In conclusion, even disregarding the possible mischief that ensued from the mistaken playback, the three errors referenced above were prejudicial and deprived defendant of a fair trial. The mistakes either deprived the jury of probative evidence that should have been available to assess J.B.\u2019s credibility or allowed the jury to consider credibility evidence for an improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-6\"> Defendant\u2019s alleged points of error are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">Point I. The interests of justice demanded that defense counsel\u2019s repeated and legitimate requests for a postponement should have been granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">Point II. The trial court committed reversible error by disallowing the defense to present evidence of contemporaneous false allegations of sexual abuse made by the alleged victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">Point III. Improper application of the rape shield statute deprived the defendant of favorable evidence, altered the evidence in the State\u2019s favor, and denied the defendant a lair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">Point IV. The trial court committed reversible error by disallowing the defense to impeach the so-called fresh complaint witness and J.B. concerning Marijuana use and false sworn statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">Point V. The trial court erred by disallowing the defense to present consentually recorded conversations while allowing the State\u2019s witnesses to reference them out of context and in a misleading manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-12\">Point VI. The trial judge's failure to provide a limiting instruction as to the jury\u2019s use of the fresh complaint evidence constituted plain error. (Not raised below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">Point VII. The prosecutor\u2019s comments as to J.B.\u2019s lack of motive to bolster her credibility mandate a new trial. (Not raised below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-14\">Point VIII. The court committed plain error by not declaring a mistrial or providing any limiting instruction after the trial judge\u2019s and prosecutor\u2019s prejudicial side bar comments were inadvertently made privy to <em>the </em>juiy during a play back of testimony. (Not raised below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-15\">Point IX. The verdict must be reversed because it was against the weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-16\">Point X. The accumulation of judicial errors in this case warrants a new trial. (Not raised below).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-17\"> Because we have struggled through the overly long opposition brief of the State, we see no reason, at this time, to deny its motion to file a 109 page responsive brief.
