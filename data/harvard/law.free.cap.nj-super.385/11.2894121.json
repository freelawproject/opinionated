Plaintiffs appeal that judgment. We now affirm, although on somewhat narrower grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The Law Division judge initially noted that the individual, named officers all had withdrawn from the lawsuit, and thus no factual issue was before the court respecting reasonable suspicion to order each drug test. The sole question presented, as framed by the judge and agreed to by the parties, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">[Wlhether the County Prosecutor had the authority, <em>absent the assent or request of the chief executive officer of the Taw enforcement agency by whom an officer within the county is employed, </em>to order reasonable suspicion drug testing of an individual officer not employed by the prosecutor\u2019s office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">The judge answered that question in the affirmative and placed the reasons for his decision on the record following oral argument on January 11,2005:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">It is apparent to this Court at least that a county prosecutor has the authority, absent the approval of the chief executive officer of the employing law enforcement agency, to order law enforcement officers, employed by a law enforcement agency within the county, to provide urine specimens for drug testing if there\u2019s reasonable suspicion of drug use pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s Policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">The judge concluded that the Prosecutor possessed such authority under the statute delegating to each county prosecutor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Attorney General\u2019s authority, citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158-5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The final order incorporated those reasons. We affirm the order granting summary judgment and dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. We do so, however, based on the actual consent of the chief executive officers involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">The Attorney General\u2019s Law Enforcement Drug Testing Policy <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides, at Paragraph III. C.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">1. Each municipal law enforcement agency shall include in its rules and regulations as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A14-118,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] and every county and state law enforcement agency shall include in appropriate standard operating procedures, a provision that individual law enforcement officers will be ordered to submit to a drug test when there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that the officer is illegally using drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">2. Before an officer may be ordered to submit to a drug test based on reasonable suspicion, the agency shall prepare a written report which documents the basis for the reasonable suspicion. <em>The report shall be reviewed by the county prosecutor or the chief executive officer of the law enforcement agency before a reasonable suspicion test may be ordered. </em>Under emergent circumstances, approval may be given for a reasonable suspicion test on the basis of a verbal report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">3. The agency\u2019s rules and regulations or appropriate standard operating procedures shall also provide that a negative result is a condition of employment as a sworn officer and that a positive result will result in: a) the officer\u2019s termination from employment; b) inclusion of the officer\u2019s name in the central drug registry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>maintained by the Division of Stale Police; and c) the officer being permanently barred from future law enforcement employment in New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">4. The agency\u2019s rules and regulations or appropriate standard operating procedures shall further provide that officers who refuse to submit to a drug test based on reasonable suspicion after being lawfully ordered to do so are subject to the same penalties as those officers who test positive for the illegal use of drugs. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The operative provisions of Paragraph III. C. 1. are that reasonable suspicion that any law enforcement officer is using drugs illegally triggers the officer\u2019s obligation to submit to a drug test, and that every law enforcement agency \u2014 municipal, county, and state \u2014 will enact rules and regulations so providing. Those provisions are not in dispute. The issue presented by this appeal arises from the second above-quoted paragraph of the Policy, Paragraph III. C. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Plaintiffs contend that only an officer\u2019s employing agency is empowered to \u201cprepare a written report which documents the basis for the reasonable suspicion\u201d; such a report must be prepared \u201c[b]efore an officer may be ordered to submit to a drug test based on reasonable suspicion\u201d; and therefore the County Prosecutor cannot initiate the order for reasonable suspicion drug testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">In this case, no written report of reasonable suspicion was prepared by any law enforcement agency, other than the Prosecutor\u2019s Office itself, before the Prosecutor\u2019s drug testing orders were issued to the individual officers involved in this case. The record includes, however, the Affidavit of James F. Avigliano, Passaic County Prosecutor, submitted in support of the Prosecutor\u2019s summary judgment motion. That affidavit referred to and attached an internal document dated August 19, 2004, entitled \u201cNarcotics Task Force Investigation.\u201d The report described the circumstances of a Task Force Investigation focusing on a specific gym, located in Wayne, to establish \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d justifying the August 19 drug testing orders that prompted this lawsuit. Although the affidavit stated that orders for \u201cthe drug tests in question\u201d were consented to by the County Sheriff and by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Wayne Police Chief, the judge declined to rule on the basis of such consent, but instead addressed the Prosecutor\u2019s power in the absence of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The Prosecutor contends that the office\u2019s broad powers and responsibilities over law enforcement in the county, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158-4 and -5,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> supersede the administrative provisions of the drug testing policy. The Prosecutor relies upon <em>State v. Winne, </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>152, 167-69, 96 A.2d 63 (1953), and <em>Gerofsky v. Passaic County SPCA, </em>376 <em>N.J.Super. </em>405, 416-17, 870 A.2d 704 (App.Div.2005), to support the claimed authority of the office. In <em>State v. Winne, </em>the Court reinstated an indictment charging the Bergen County Prosecutor himself with criminal nonfeasance in office for failing to \u201cdetect, arrest, indict and convict\u201d allegedly known gambling operators as well as allegedly corrupt officials known to be involved in gambling operations. The indictment had been dismissed as insufficient because there was no allegation of corruption against the Prosecutor. 12 <em>N.J. </em>at 162, 96 A.2d 63 and <em>passim. </em>The inference suggested is that if the prosecutor can be criminally liable for failure to act respecting known criminal activity, especially on the part of public officials, then the prosecutor must have the power to do so. <em>In Gerofsky, </em>we upheld the County Prosecutor\u2019s \u201csupervisory authority over all law enforcement activity in the county,\u201d including but not limited to \u201ccounty and municipal ... police officers.\u201d <em>Gerofsky, supra, </em>376 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 417, 870 A.2d 704 (addressing the Prosecutor\u2019s authority over those members of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals who had law enforcement responsibilities).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The Prosecutor also calls our attention to the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that a police officer who is authorized to carry a gun, and who is involved with illegal drug use, poses a serious threat to public safety. <em>Rawlings, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 189, 627 A.2d 602. The motion judge cited that threat in reaching his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that only a law enforcement officer\u2019s employing agency may initiate a drug testing order, the judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">The Plaintiffs contend in this action that the County Prosecutor of Passaic County did not have the authority to order the reasonable suspicion drug tests because the tests were not directly ordered by the employer of the individual officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">In enacting the Criminal Justice Act of 1970 <em>[N.J.S.A </em>52:17B-97 to -115], the New Jersey Legislature did establish a comprehensive statutory scheme or system for the administration of criminal justice throughout the State of New Jersey. Specifically, the declared purpose of the Act is \u201cto secure the benefits of a uniform and efficient enforcement of the criminal law and the administration of criminal justice throughout the State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-98. The Act designates the Attorney General as the chief law enforcement officer of the State in order to enforce and administer the criminal justice system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">As required by the Act, a county prosecutor has the duty \u201cto cooperate with and aid the Attorney General in the performance of his duties.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17B-112(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">Further, the county and municipal police officers are required to cooperate with and aid the Attorney General and the county prosecutors in performance of their respective duties [referring to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-112(b)J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">Similarly, pursuant to State statute, the Attorney General, as well as the county prosecutors, are given the exclusive jurisdiction over the \u201ccriminal business of the State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A.158-4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">In exercising the powers and duties involved, each prosecutor is vested with the same powers within his or her county as the Attorney General is by law, and he or she \u201cshall use all reasonable and lawful diligence for the detection, arrest, indictment and conviction of offenders against the laws.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:158-5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">As recognized by the Appellate Division, and affirmed by the Supreme Court, those statutes give the Attorney General and county prosecutors plenary jurisdiction to prosecute all criminal matters in this State. It\u2019s clear from the wording in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:158-5 that the words \u201ccriminal business\u201d are not limited to crimes, but include the prosecution of \u201coffenders against the law.\u201d <em>State v. Downie, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207, 209 n. 1, 550 A.2d 1313, (App.Div.1988), <em>aff'd, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>450, 569 A.2d 242 (1990).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">Accordingly, the Attorney General, as chief law enforcement officer of the State is responsible for the general administration of criminal justice in the State. Similarly, a county prosecutor, as chief law enforcement officer of his or her jurisdiction, is vested with coexisting authority and responsibility over the general administration of criminal justice in his or her respective jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-14\">There is case law which delineates the function and authority of the county prosecutor in the criminal justice system. Generally, in a county the prosecutor is the foremost representative of the executive branch of government and the enforcement of criminal law. <em>See State v. Winne, </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>152, 96 A.2d 63 (1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The judge also reasoned that because both the \u201cchief executive officer\u201d of the local law enforcement agency and the County Prosecutor are equally empowered to review a written report of reasonable suspicion before a drug test is ordered, and even a verbal report can be approved when the circumstances are emergent, the Prosecutor must have the power to initiate a reasonable suspicion drug test order. Continuing, the judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">It is clearly reasonable that, in most instances, the report documenting the reasonable suspicion would be prepared by the agency employing that officer and subsequently reviewed by the chief of that agency. However, there is nothing in the Attorney General\u2019s policy to indicate that one within the county prosecutor\u2019s office is without the authority to prepare the requisite report to be reviewed by the county prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">Again, although it may seem more likely that the chief of the officer\u2019s agency would approve the order of a mine sample, the provision expressly provides that the county prosecutor may serve as the approving authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">While there\u2019s no doubt that a municipal police department and/or a county sheriffs department qualify as a law enforcement agency, it follows that a county prosecutor\u2019s office must be similarly deemed a law enforcement agency required to undertake reasonable suspicion drug testing under the Attorney General\u2019s Policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">After referring to the County Prosecutor\u2019s statutory obligation to enforce the criminal law and administer the criminal justice system within the county, citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-98 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-112(a), the judge described a variety of situations that would, as he saw it, virtually require the County Prosecutor to act without waiting for a local agency\u2019s report: for example, if the local agency chief either was unaware or consciously disregarded suspicious drug use, or if a county-wide investigation required action crossing municipal borders, or if the local chief herself or himself was under suspicion. In such cases, apparently taking judicial notice of the speed at which drugs metabolize in the body, and the resulting need for fast action to accomplish meaningful drug testing, the judge concluded that \u201cthe county prosecutor would clearly have such authority.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Finally, while recognizing the lines of administrative authority between municipal civilian officials and law enforcement chief executives as defined by <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118, the judge reasoned that no statute provides that the supervisory power of \u201cvarious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>civilian entities in county and municipal government supersedes the authority of the Attorney General or the County Prosecutor as his alter ego to supervise the administration of criminal justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\">The judge explicitly rejected the argument that an employer-employee relationship was a prerequisite to initiating an order for testing under the Policy. Summarizing his decision, the judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">And, it\u2019s clear to me, that where the employing agency does not act, or where the prosecutor deems it necessary to act expeditiously for fear of either tipping off the suspects, or for fear that the drugs would be metabolized, or where you are dealing with a countywide problem or multi-jurisdictional problem, the prosecutor, as the alter ego of the Attorney General, and chief law enforcement officer of the county, can order reasonable suspicion drug testing, even absent a request by the employer or the appointing authority or chief authority of that police department requesting that to be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">To hold otherwise would thwart the ability of the chief law enforcement officer of the county \u2014 as the alter ego of the Attorney General \u2014 to act for the benefit and protection of the public, and to act quickly and expeditiously wherein, indeed, reasonable suspicion does exist, which is the assumption here in this whole argument and decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The specific facts that triggered the Prosecutor's reasonable suspicion in these cases, and the drug testing orders that followed, are not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Here, where the Wayne Police Chief and the Passaic County Sheriff apparently did consent to the Prosecutor issuing these orders,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we find no reason to go beyond the facts presented. Our decision therefore is limited to holding that the Prosecutor has the power to initiate and issue drug testing orders to law enforcement officers within the county, based upon reasonable suspicion under the Attorney General\u2019s Law Enforcement Drug Testing Policy, <em>either </em>when one of the unusual conditions referred to by the motion judge exists, <em>or </em>when, as here, the chief law enforcement officer in the affected jurisdiction consents to the County Prosecutor initiating the order. We caution that while the County Prosecutor has such power under the Policy, we see no basis for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>routine exercise. Rather, it should be the unusual case where the Prosecutor initiates drug testing orders without the prior consent of the local police chief or county sheriff, or other extenuating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-15\"> Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint states that members of Locals 197 and 286 are law enforcement officers employed by the Passaic County Sheriff's Department, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>members of Local 136 are law enforcement officers employed by the Wayne Police Department.
