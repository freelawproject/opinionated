Shabazz was placed in a halfway house and while there Shabazz was charged with a disciplinary infraction. Shabazz was returned to prison and thereafter found guilty of using abusive or obscene language to a staff member. Shabazz filed a notice of appeal from that determination and, while the appeal was pending, the Department of Corrections (Department) reconsidered its decision and found that he was not guilty of the charge. However, Shabazz was not returned to the halfway house. He argues that he has a liberty interest in remaining in the halfway house that is protected by the Due Process Clause. We disagree and therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">We briefly summarize the relevant facts. Shabazz is presently an inmate at a State correctional facility. He is serving a custodial sentence after having been convicted of aggravated assault, unlawful possession of weapons, possession of controlled dangerous substances and receipt of stolen property. At some point during his incarceration, Shabazz was re-assigned to Tremont House, a halfway house facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>On August 26, 2004, Linda Fulcher (Fulcher), Shabazz\u2019s ex-girlfriend, contacted the Tremont House Service Director Qiyyim Abdul Jabbar (Jabbar) and informed him that Shabazz left threatening messages on her answering machine. An investigation followed immediately. Jabbar listened to Fulcher\u2019s recorded messages and identified Shabazz\u2019s voice. Shabazz was informed of his use immunity rights but he elected not to make a statement at the time. Shabazz was charged with threatening another with bodily harm, which is a prohibited act *.005. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-2.11(c)(2). Because he was charged with a \u201cmajor disciplinary violation,\u201d Shabazz was returned to prison. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.19(d). On August 27, 2004, Shabazz was transferred to the Central Reception and Assignment Facility and later incarcerated at Northern State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Hearing officer Don Wiater conducted a hearing on the charge on September 8, 2004. Shabazz pled not guilty. Shabazz was informed again of his use immunity rights. Shabazz requested a counsel substitute and one was provided. At the hearing, counsel substitute asserted that Fulcher accused him of making threats because she believed that Shabazz had \u201cneglected\u201d her. Fulcher submitted a letter dated September 1, 2004, in which she stated that her allegations were a lie. Fulcher said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">I was very angry with [Shabazz] for messing around. It is not easy letting go of a twenty year relationship. I am very sorry for what I have caused. If there is anything else that you need or that I need to do, please let me know. Again I am truly sorry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The hearing officer modified the charge to prohibited act .304, using abusive or obscene language to a staff member. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-2.11(d)(23). In the adjudication report, the hearing officer noted that, once Fulcher realized that Shabazz could be returned to prison from the halfway house, Fulcher recanted but the hearing officer found that the charge had been proven because Shabazz left a message with abusive language on Fulcher\u2019s answering machine. The hearing officer imposed ten days of detention and 60 days loss of commutation time but suspended the latter sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>On September 8, 2004, Shabazz filed an administrative appeal. Shabazz denied that he threatened anyone. He asserted that the incident occurred because he was breaking off his relationship with Fulcher. Shabazz noted that the charge had been downgraded to using \u201cbad language\u201d with a staff member but Shabazz stated that Fulcher was not a staff member. Moreover, Shabazz asserted that Fulcher fabricated the story \u201cbecause she was hurt knowing that I would not take her back.\u201d Shabazz said that Fulcher admitted to lying and fabrication. He asked that all charges be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">On September 8, 2004, the Assistant Superintendent upheld the hearing officer\u2019s finding that Shabazz had committed prohibited act .304. He refused to dismiss the charges but modified the hearing officer\u2019s decision by reducing the sanctions to 5 days detention and 60 days loss of credit time, with the latter sanction suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Shabazz filed an appeal to this court on November 4, 2004. On February 9, 2005, Gary J. Sheperd, Chief Hearing Officer, advised Shabazz that he had decided to order a rehearing of the charge. The hearing was held on March 16, 2005 and Shabazz was found not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In this appeal, Shabazz argues that he was denied due process in the disciplinary proceeding. Shabazz contends that the hearing officer abused his authority and violated his right to due process when he modified the charge from *.005 to .304. Shabazz additionally asserts that the hearing officer erred by finding him guilty on the charge because he made no threat and did not use abusive language to a staff member. Shabazz contends that the hearing officer\u2019s finding of guilt was a foregone conclusion and the administrative appeal process was little more than a \u201crubber stamp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The State contends that Shabazz\u2019s appeal from the decision finding him guilty of using abusive or obscene language to a staff member is moot. We agree. \u201cA ease is moot if the disputed issue was resolved, at least with respect to the parties who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>instituted the litigation.\u201d <em>Advance Electric Co., Inc. v. Montgomery Tp., </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>160, 166, 797 A.2d 216 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>364, 807 A.2d 195 (2002)(citing <em>DeVesa v. Dorsey, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>420, 428, 634 A.2d 493 (1993)(Handler, J., concurring) and <em>Oxfeld v. New Jersey State Board of Educ., </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>301, 303-04, 344 A.2d 769 (1975)). Because Shabazz was found not guilty, the sanctions have been set aside and the charge expunged. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:4-11.8; <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:4-9.26(b). Clearly, the dispute between Shabazz and the Department in respect of the finding of guilt and the imposition of sanctions has been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">However, as we stated previously, because he was charged with a \u201cmajor disciplinary violation,\u201d Shabazz was removed from the halfway house and returned to prison. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:20-4.19(d). Shabazz asserts that his custody status was thereafter changed from \u201cfull minimum\u201d to \u201cgang minimum.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shabazz was no longer eligible for halfway house placement. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:20-4.4(a)(requiring \u201cfull minimum\u201d status for participation in \u201cresidential community programs\u201d). Consequently, Shabazz contends he was unable to earn certain \u201cgood time\u201d credits, could not continue working at his job and was \u201cdropped\u201d from Essex County College where he had been enrolled. In our view, these collateral consequences are sufficient to raise a justiciable controversy as to whether Shabazz has a liberty interest in continuing his halfway house placement notwithstanding the Department\u2019s finding that he was not guilty of the disciplinary charge. <em>See Cinque v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 244, 618 A.2d 868 (App.Div.1993)(noting that an appeal will not be mooted by subsequent administrative action if the inmate is subject to \u201csubstantial collateral consequences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>We turn then to Shabazz\u2019s contention that he has a liberty interest in continued placement at the halfway house that is protected by the Due Process Clause. Shabazz seeks an order mandating his immediate return to the halfway house, restoration of his \u201cgood time\u201d credits \u201cat the same rate in which they were being accrued,\u201d and an award of $14,300 for lost wages, less adjustments for \u201cboard.\u201d We are convinced that these contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>472, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2293, 132 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>418 (1995), the Court held that an inmate\u2019s placement in disciplinary segregation did not create a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. The Court explained that due process safeguards are only required when a change in an inmate\u2019s custody status \u201cimposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484,115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2300,132 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In <em>Sandin, </em>due process protections were not required because disciplinary confinement was not an \u201catypical, significant deprivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2301, 132 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 431. A comparison of the conditions in and out of disciplinary segregation indicated that placement of the inmate in disciplinary segregation for thirty days \u201cdid not work a major disruption\u201d in the inmate\u2019s prison environment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">We applied the <em>Sandin </em>test in <em>Moore v. Department of Corrections, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 761 A.2d 107 (App.Div.2000), where the inmate\u2019s \u201cminimum custody status\u201d was revoked because he failed to participate in a substance abuse program. <em>Id. </em>at 105, 761 A.2d 107. We held that the change in custody status did not require due process safeguards. We concluded that the change did not represent an \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d upon the inmate when considered in relation to \u201cthe ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109, 761 A.2d 107 (quoting from <em>Sandin, supra, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>at 484, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2300, 132 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 430). We stated, \u201cThere is no constitutionally protected interest in reduced custody status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110, 761 A.2d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>We also applied the <em>Sandin </em>test in <em>Muhammad v. Balicki, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 743 A.2d 376 (App.Div.2000). In that case, the inmate had been given reduced custody status which allowed him to enjoy \u201cmore mobility and less supervision in the prison than the general prison population.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 743 A.2d 376. The Department later adopted a new regulation under which the inmate was no longer eligible for reduced custody status. We held that . the inmate\u2019s return to more restrictive custody did not impose an \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate\u201d and, therefore, under <em>Sandin, </em>the inmate had no liberty interest in reduced custody status. <em>Id. </em>at 372, 743 A.2d 376. <em>See also Szemple v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 894 A.2d 698 (App.Div. 2006) (concluding that there is no protected liberty interest in designation of inmate as \u201chigh risk\u201d); <em>White v. Fauver, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>170, 530 A.2d 37 (App.Div.1987)(holding that there is no constitutionally protected liberty interest in reduced custody status).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We have recognized that \u201chalfway house placement does not involve a liberty interest giving rise to due process rights.\u201d <em>Trantino v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 464, 687 A.2d 274 (App.Div.1997), <em>modified in part on other grounds and affirmed, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>19, 711 A.2d 260 (1998). Shabazz therefore did not have a constitutionally protected interest in his initial placement at Tremont House. He similarly had no constitutionally protected liberty interest in remaining there.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Under the Department\u2019s regulations, inmates must meet certain eligibility criteria in order to participate in a Residential Community Release Agreement Program (RCRAP). <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A.20-4.4. A \u201chalfway house\u201d is a RCRAP \u201cwith specific emphasis on employment and educational activities in the context of treatment and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>N.J AC. </em>10A:20-1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">To qualify for admission to a RCRAP, the inmate must be classified by the ICC as \u201cfull minimum\u201d. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A-.20-4.4 (a)(1). The inmate must have a psychological evaluation which addresses \u201cthe inmate\u2019s readiness and ability to adequately adapt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>to the pressures and responsibilities of living outside the correctional facility.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.4(a)(2). The inmate also must have a satisfactory \u201coverall correctional facility adjustment and be seen as not likely to pose a threat to the safety of the community.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.4(a)(5). In addition, a candidate for halfway house placement must be within 18 months of (1) an established parole date, (2) expiration of the maximum sentence, (3) an actual parole eligibility date or (4) an anticipated parole date. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Inmates in a halfway house are subject to significant restrictions on their liberty. They may be tested for prohibited substances. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.20(a). The program must evaluate and approve or disapprove all prospective places of employment. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.27. The program monitors all employment and education sites. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.29. The inmates may not leave the program without the authorization of the program director or the director\u2019s designee. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.37(a). Overnight furloughs are strictly regulated and in some instances not allowed at all. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.35; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.86. The inmates also are subject to disciplinary sanctions for: violations of the law, engaging in sexual acts on the program\u2019s premises, traveling outside of New Jersey, using or possessing alcohol and/or controlled dangerous substances and certain prohibited acts. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.19(d)(l) to -(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The nature and extent of these restrictions establish that inmates in a halfway house setting remain in institutional confinement. The return of an inmate from a halfway house to a prison therefore does not impose an \u201catypical\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d hardship on the inmate. <em>Sandin, supra, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>at 484, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2300, 132 <em>L.Ed.2A </em>at 430. Moreover, an inmate does not have a protected liberty interest in serving his or her sentence in a particular correctional facility. <em>See Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>215, 224, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2532, 2538, 49 L.Ed.2d 451, 459 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">In <em>Asquith v. Department of Corrections, </em>186 <em>F.</em>3d 407 (3d Cir.1999), the court addressed the question of whether a New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Jersey inmate had a liberty interest in remaining in a halfway house that is protected by the Due Process Clause. The <em>Asquith </em>case presented a factual scenario that is substantially the same as is presented in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Asquith was serving a five-year sentence and had been placed in a halfway house operated by the Volunteers of America (VOA). A case aide reported that Asquith smelled of alcohol and he failed a Breathalyzer test. Because he was charged with a major violation, Asquith was immediately returned to prison but, after a hearing, he was found not guilty of the charge. Asquith remained in prison and the Department did not provide Asquith with a hearing on the issue of whether he should be returned to the halfway house. <em>Id. </em>at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The Third Circuit noted that inmates who are paroled have protected liberty interests after their release from institutional confinement. <em>Id. </em>at 410 (citing <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>471, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2593, 33 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>484 (1972)). The <em>Asquith </em>court also noted that in <em>Young v. Harper, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>143, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1148, 137 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>270 (1997), the Court found that an inmate released pursuant to Oklahoma\u2019s Pre-parole Conditional Supervision Program \u201chad a protected liberty interest entitling him to due process before he could be removed from the program.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">However, unlike the parolee in <em>Morrissey </em>and the inmate in the <em>Young </em>case who was released on pre-parole, Asquith \u201cnever left institutional confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">While at the facility, [Asquith] was subject to a curfew and had to \u201cstand count\u201d several times a day. He was also required to submit to urine monitoring and his room could be searched. Asquith could leave the house, but had to sign in and out, and his weekend passes were limited to two nights every seven days. VOA would monitor the time it took Asquith to travel to and from the halfway house, and he was required to take public transportation. While away, he was required to check in by phone several times each day. If he could not be contacted within two hours, he would be deemed an escapee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8U\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">The Third Circuit found that \u201c[t]hese restrictions are dispositive because they amount to institutional confinement.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Brennan v. Cunningham, </em>813 F.2d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The court in <em>Asquith </em>also pointed out that New Jersey\u2019s community release program was different from parole release because there was no implicit promise that halfway house status would only be revoked if the inmate failed to meet certain conditions. <em>Ibid. </em>The court noted that, under the Department\u2019s regulations, an inmate who is merely charged with a major violation will be returned to a correctional facility. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.21). In addition, the Commissioner of Corrections is authorized \u201cat any time [to] transfer an inmate from one place of confinement to another.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting from <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:20-4.2). \u201cThus, Asquith\u2019s continued participation [in the community release program] was dependent upon extrinsic events, and he could have no expectation that he would remain in the program once charged with a major violation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We agree with the Third Circuit\u2019s analysis. We similarly conclude that Shabazz did not have a protected liberty interest in continued placement in the halfway house. His return to the correctional facility did not impose upon him any \u201catypical and significant hardship,\u201d when weighed against the \u201cordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin, supra, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>at 484,115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2300,132 L.Ed.2d at 430. We therefore are satisfied that Shabazz was not entitled to a hearing to determine whether he should be returned to prison <em>from </em>the halfway house.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In support of his appeal, Shabazz relies upon the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Kim v. Hurston, </em>182 F.3d 113 (2d Cir.1999). There, the inmate was placed in a New York work release program, which permitted her to live at home while working at a job but required that she report regularly to a correctional facility. <em>Id. </em>at 115. The court held that the work release program was \u201cvirtually indistinguishable\u201d from traditional parole or the pre-par\u00f3le program considered in <em>Young, supra, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>at 152-53, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1154, 137 L.Ed 2d at 279-80. <em>Id. </em>at 118. Therefore, the court found that the inmate had a liberty interest which could not be deprived without minimal due process protections. <em>Ibid. </em>However, in this case, Shabazz was not permitted to live at home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>and he was subject to a variety of significant restrictions on his liberty which amount to institutional confinement. Thus, Sha-bazz\u2019s reliance upon <em>Kim v. Hurston </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Shabazz also relies upon <em>Tracy v. Salamack, </em>572 <em>F.2d </em>393 (2d Cir.1978). In that case, certain inmates were allowed to participate in a temporary release program as permitted by a New York statute. However, the statute was amended and new eligibility requirements established for the program. The state correctional officials applied the new criteria and the ineligible inmates were returned to a correctional facility. <em>Id. </em>at 394. The Second Circuit held that the inmates had a liberty interest in continuing in the program and the Due Process Clause protected them \u201cagainst removal from the program without a prior hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395. The court concluded that each inmate was entitled to a reevaluation of the inmate\u2019s eligibility under the new statutory criteria, after a due process hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 396. The <em>Tracy </em>case also is distinguishable. Here, Shabazz was not removed from the halfway house because of any change in the program\u2019s eligibility criteria. Furthermore, as the Third Circuit noted in <em>Asquith, </em>under New Jersey\u2019s regulatory scheme, inmates placed in a halfway house have no expectation that they will remain there, even if they are charged and found not guilty of a major violation. <em>Asquith, supra, </em>186 F.3d at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Shabazz also seeks restoration of certain \u201cgood time\u201d credits and an award of wages that he might have earned while placed in the halfway house.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Inmates may be awarded commutation credit for \u201ccontinuous orderly deportment\u201d while incarcerated. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-140; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-5.1(a). Inmates also may be awarded credit for employment in certain \u201cproductive occupations.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4\u2014 92; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:9-5.1(b)(l).
