Because the order failed to meet the requirements of <em>R. </em>4:37 \u2014 1(b) and hindered the fair and efficient administration of justice, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The early history of this case was uneventful. On February 13, 2004, plaintiff Walter Shulas (plaintiff) filed a complaint alleging he suffered personal injuries when, on November 29, 2002, he was performing renovation work on a deck at the home of defendants Joseph and Patricia Estabrook (defendants). Defendants filed an answer on March 26, 2004; their answer included a third-party complaint seeking contribution and indemnification from B.B.J., Inc., plaintiffs employer. The complaint was later amended to allege that the incident occurred on June 6, 2003, and not on November 29, 2002 as asserted in the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">On April 18, 2005, the judge entered an order which extended the previously established discovery end date to May 19, 2005. This order also adjourned the arbitration then scheduled for May 12, 2005 to June 2, 2005. The matter was arbitrated on June 2, 2005; defendants filed a demand for a trial de novo on June 21, 2005. B.B.J.\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted on June 24, 2005, and a trial date of August 22, 2005 was assigned, but later adjourned to September 26, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that B.B.J. was responsible for plaintiffs injuries and also that plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>claim could not be sustained without an expert\u2019s testimony. The motion\u2019s return date of August 5, 2005 was adjourned to September 9,2005 at plaintiffs request.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Without leave of court, on August 5, 2005, plaintiff served for the first time a liability expert report. Defendants predictably and promptly objected. On Tuesday, September 6, 2005 \u2014 three days before the adjourned return date of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment \u2014 plaintiff teleeopied to the court and defense counsel his attorney\u2019s certification as well as a motion for a voluntary dismissal, which purported to be returnable September 9, 2005. These papers were untimely because <em>R. </em>4:46-1 requires that papers in response to motions for summary judgment, including cross-motions, must be filed and served not later than ten days before the return date of the motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his certification, plaintiffs attorney advised for the first time that, on May 27, 2005, he had filed another complaint \u201cwith a new, more recent docket number,\u201d and that he wished to dismiss the complaint, filed in this action and proceed on the new complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Although he argued that his claim did not require expert evidence, plaintiff asserted that he had attempted to communicate with defense counsel in the preceding weeks to deal with what he referred to as \u201cthe logistical issue\u201d concerning his submission of the expert report beyond the discovery end date. After referring to this problem, and the fact that plaintiff was apparently \u201cstill treating and had surgery on May 5, 2005,\u201d plaintiffs counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>represented his purpose for moving for a voluntary dismissal in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">A new complaint was filed in a timely manner. I am asking the [c]ourt to allow the voluntary dismissal of the old complaint. I would prefer it if we could use the discovery in the old lawsuit and perhaps agree on something shorter than the usual discovery period for the new lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">If this motion is granted, it is unnecessary for the [c]ourt to consider the issues raised by defendant\u2019s pending motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Defense counsel telephoned the judge\u2019s chambers on Thursday, September 8, to inquire whether oral argument would be heard the next day. The judge\u2019s law clerk advised that defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion had been rendered moot by plaintiffs voluntary dismissal motion. When defense counsel understandably questioned this, the law clerk stated, according to defense counsel, \u201cthat the [jjudge could not force plaintiffs attorney to prosecute his claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">On September 9, 2005, without hearing oral argument and without explanation, the judge entered an order granting plaintiffs motion. Soon thereafter, defense counsel wrote to the judge and inquired \u201cwhether opinions or findings were placed on the record outside of counsel\u2019s presence and, further, whether the [c]ourt will be filing a statement or opinion pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:5-1(b).\u201d* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, the judge wrote to counsel on September 30, 2005, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">Your motion [for summary judgment] was rendered moot by the voluntary dismissal of the matter by the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">The [c]ourts do not render opinions on matters not before them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">We granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal the September 9,2005 order,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Our examination into the soundness of the order in question is hampered by the trial judge\u2019s failure to adequately explain, as required by <em>R. </em>l:7-4(a), why he permitted a voluntary dismissal and why he granted the motion without imposing terms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The Supreme Court has said that a judge\u2019s failure to comply with <em>R. </em>1:7 \u2014 1(a) \u201cconstitutes a disservice to the litigants, the attorneys and the appellate court.\u201d <em>Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 569-70, 417 A.2d 15 (1980). <em>See also In re Farnkopf, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 390, 833 A.2d 89 (App.Div.2003); <em>Salch v. Salch, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 443, 573 A.2d 520 (App.Div.1990). Here, the judge provided no reasons for granting plaintiffs motion for a voluntary dismissal; instead, only after defendants\u2019 inquiry did the judge state, without explanation, that defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was rendered moot by the voluntary dismissal. This was followed by the judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[cjourts do not render opinions on matters not before them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Notwithstanding the failure to comply with <em>R. </em>l:7-4(a), we discern from his letter of September 30, 2005 that the judge mistakenly believed plaintiff was entitled to unilaterally dismiss his complaint at this stage of the litigation without consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">The voluntary dismissal of a complaint without prejudice is governed by <em>R. </em>4:37-1. Subsection (a) of that rule allows a plaintiff to obtain a dismissal without court approval \u201cby filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service by the adverse party of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment, whichever first occurs.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:37-l(a). Here, by the time plaintiff sought a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>voluntary dismissal, defendants had answered the complaint and moved for summary judgment; in fact, trial was scheduled to occur only seventeen days later.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, subsection (a) was inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">As a result, plaintiffs motion for a voluntary dismissal was governed by subsection (b), which states in pertinent part that in these circumstances \u201can action shall be dismissed at the plaintiffs instance only by leave of court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:37 \u2014 1(b). Whether to dismiss with or without prejudice, whether to impose terms, and the crafting of terms that are fair and just in the circumstances, are all matters that lie within the court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>See Mack Auto Imports, Inc. v. Jaguar Cars, Inc., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 258, 581 A.2d 1372 (App.Div.1990). In exercising that discretion, the court is chiefly required to protect \u201cthe rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Burke v. Central R. Co., </em>42 <em>N.J.Super. </em>387, 398, 126 A.2d 903 (App.Div.1956). As explained by Judge Matthews, <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>41(a)(2) \u2014 upon which <em>R. </em>4:37-1 (b) was patterned \u2014 was adopted to protect defendants from the duplication of litigation costs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">The evil aimed at by the rule \u201cis present in any instance in which a defendant is damaged by being dragged into court and put to expense with no chance whatever (if there is a dismissal without prejudice) of having the suit determined in his favor.\u201d <em>McCann v. Bentley Stores Corporation, </em>34 <em>F.Supp. </em>234 (W.D.Mo.1940). The obvious purport of our rule is to protect a litigant where a termination of the proceedings without prejudice will place him in the probable position of having to defend, at additional expense, another action based upon similar charges at another time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\"><em>[Union Carbide Corp. v. Litton Precision Products, Inc., </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315, 317, 228 A.2d 99 (Ch.Div.1967).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Here, the purpose of plaintiffs motion for a voluntary dismissal is readily apparent and was clearly inconsistent with the intent of <em>R. </em>4:37-l(b), as described in <em>Union Carbide.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s obvious intent was to avoid the consequences of the discovery end date, defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, and the impending trial date, and to relitigate their disputes in a new action. As previously noted, plaintiff filed a complaint on May 27, 2005 \u2014 only eight days after the discovery end date. That he had no intention of immediately pursuing that new complaint was demonstrated by the fact that he did not timely issue a summons, as required by <em>B. </em>4:4-1, nor did he promptly serve defendant with the new complaint. Plaintiff merely filed this other complaint and held it as insurance should the discovery end date later present difficulties for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">When faced with defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, based in part on plaintiffs lack of a liability expert report, and when faced with an imminent trial date at which he would not be permitted, absent court order, to offer expert testimony, plaintiff called down his <em>deus ex machina</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 his device for undoing what had already been done. Although he had been secretive about his new complaint, plaintiff was candid about his reasons for seeking a voluntary dismissal, referring to his \u201clogistical issue\u201d: i.e., the passed discovery end date and his lack of an expert report. There is no doubt that he sought dismissal of this action without prejudice so he could proceed on his new complaint without the encumbrances of the discovery end date, defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and the impending trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">A motion based on <em>R. </em>4:37-l(b) involves three sequential inquiries: (a) whether the matter should be dismissed without prejudice, (b) if so, whether terms should be imposed, and (c) if so, what terms will alleviate any prejudice to the defendant and prevent injury to the efficient administration of justice generated by the ensuing delay and duplication of effort. As we have said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the resolution of these questions rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Mack Auto, supra, </em>244 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 258, 581 A.2d 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">At times, when examining a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion, we have looked beneath the surface of the order in question to inquire whether the plaintiff was inappropriately placed in the position of having to seek a dismissal pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:37-l(b). In <em>Fehnel v. Fehnel, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209,452 A.2d 209 (App.Div.1982), for example, plaintiff\u2019s motion for a voluntary dismissal of her divorce action was granted on the condition she pay defendant $2,000 in counsel fees; the order further barred the filing of a new divorce action until the fee was paid. In examining the proceedings leading up to that order, we determined that plaintiff was placed in the untenable position of proceeding to trial on a custody dispute for which she was justifiably unprepared. We reversed, holding that the term imposed for the institution of a new divorce action was inequitable when, in the circumstances, the trial judge should have simply adjourned the trial for a brief period of time. <em>Id. </em>at 212-13,452 A.2d 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">We viewed the contours of <em>R. </em>4:37-l(b) from a different angle in <em>Mack Auto, supra, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 581 A.2d 1372, where plaintiff appealed a voluntary dismissal <em>with </em>prejudice. As we there observed, at some point in the litigation, the plaintiff became \u201cdissatisfied with the information obtained in discovery,\u201d and moved for, among other things, a voluntary dismissal without prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 581 A.2d 1372. At the same time, plaintiff commenced a similar action in federal court, which reiterated the claims asserted against defendant in state court and included other federal claims as well. The trial judge denied the motion for a voluntary dismissal but granted plaintiffs request to amend its complaint. Thereafter, plaintiff continued to view the discovery permitted as \u201cinadequate,\u201d and in an attempt to establish the finality required to appeal the earlier discovery orders, since we had denied leave to appeal, \u201cplaintiff advised the court that it voluntarily accepted dismissal of the action with prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>257, 581 A.2d 1372. We concluded that plaintiffs attempts to seek our review of the discovery orders by creating finality through a voluntary dismissal were inappropriate. <em>Ibid. </em>However, we held that the earlier denial of plaintiffs motion for a voluntary dismissal without prejudice stood \u201con a different footing,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 258, 581 A.2d 1372, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">Under <em>R. </em>4:37-l(b), plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss an action after a defendant has filed a responsive pleading \u201conly by leave of court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate.\u201d Whether such a dismissal is with prejudice or without prejudice is one of the terms a court may impose in the exercise of its sound discretion. Though a voluntary dismissal terminates the action and may not be appealable so as to reinstate what has been voluntarily terminated, the terms of the dismissal order are appealable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 258, 581 A.2d 1372 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In reviewing the terms of the dismissal order, we observed that dismissal without prejudice should have been ordered because a dismissal with prejudice would have an undue and, perhaps, preclusive impact on the pending federal action. In addition, we held that the trial judge should have imposed \u201con plaintiff all the counsel fees incurred by defendant in this action,\u201d and that \u201c[n]ot to have done so constituted a mistaken exercise of discretion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 259, 581 A.2d 1372, because defendant had \u201cincurred counsel fees defending this action [that it] will have to duplicate ... in the federal action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 260, 581 A.2d 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Our review of a voluntary dismissal order should not just encompass an examination of the surrounding circumstances, as in <em>Mack Auto </em>and <em>Fehnel. </em>The experience of federal courts in considering similar applications based on <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>41(a)(2) demonstrates that the plaintiffs motive as well as the impact of a dismissal without prejudice on the efficient administration of justice must be carefully scrutinized.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">For example, in <em>Shady Records, Inc. v. Source Enterprises, Inc., </em>371 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>394, 397 (S.D.N.Y.2005), the district judge held that a voluntary dismissal without prejudice should not have been ordered when the litigation had reached an advanced stage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALZ\">The ease has been pending for \u25a0well over a year, discovery has been completed, summary judgment motions by all parties adjudicated, pretrial submissions made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>and the ease is ready for trial in less than two weeks. To permit the plaintiff to discontinue the ease at this late stage, and then to reinstate the same action whenever it felt like it in the future, would authorize intolerable manipulation of the Court\u2019s calendar and the defendants\u2019 resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>In re Urohealth Systems, Inc., </em>252 F.3d 504, 508 (1st Cir.2001) presents a similar example. There, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit determined that \u201ca plaintiff cannot conduct a serious product liability claim in a federal court, provoke over a year\u2019s worth of discovery and motion practice, allow the case to reach the stage at which the defendant filed a full-scale summary judgment motion, and then when matters seemed to be going badly for plaintiff simply dismiss its case and begin all over again in a state court in what is essentially an identical proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508. <em>See also Fremaint v. Ford Motor Co., </em>258 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>24, 33 (D.P.R.2003); <em>103 Investors I, L.P. v. Square D Co., </em>222 F.Supp.2d 1263, 1271-72 (D.Kan.2002), <em>affd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>372 F.3d 1213 (10th Cir.2004). In <em>Jorgensen v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Amer., </em>852 <em>F.Supp. </em>255, 260 (D.N.J.1994) it was held that a plaintiffs improper motive warranted the striking of a notice of dismissal without prejudice, pursuant to <em>Fed. R.Civ.P. </em>41(a)(1). There, Judge Debevoise stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">plaintiff filed a similar case in state court the same day he filed his voluntary dismissal. Plaintiff must have known that defendant would remove his new action to the federal court and perhaps hoped that a judge other than myself would be assigned to the case. Thus the dismissal was filed for an improper purpose\u2014 another reason to strike it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\"><em>[Jorgensen, supra, </em>852 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 260.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">We find persuasive the <em>manner in </em>which the federal courts have interpreted <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>41(a) and, because our <em>R. </em>4:37-1 is nearly identical, we conclude that these federal decisions should be followed. <em>See Baumann v. Marinaro, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>380, 390, 471 A.2d 395 (1984); <em>Quick Chek Food Stores v. Springfield Tp., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>438, 446, 416 A.2d 840 (1980); <em>Hodgson v. Applegate, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>29, 35,155 A.2d 97 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Our prior experiences with <em>R. </em>4:37-l(b) in <em>Mack Auto </em>and <em>Fehnel, </em>as well as the guidance provided by the experiences of the federal courts in similar circumstances, instruct that an examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>tion into the propriety of a voluntary dismissal without prejudice requires an investigation into the reasons why the order was sought as well as the actions or inactions of the parties that preceded its entry. Our review of the order in question is further illuminated by the rule changes that resulted from the project known as \u201cBest Practices.\u201d Indeed, the presence of these rule changes is of critical importance because it undoubtedly was out of a concern for the effect of the discovery end date, which the \u201cBest Practices\u201d rule changes have given far greater rigidity than before, that led plaintiff to pursue his present course.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">As we have indicated, at the time plaintiff faced defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and moved for a voluntary dismissal in response, the discovery end date had passed. At that point, absent court order, plaintiff was prohibited from offering his late expert report in opposition to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and from offering expert testimony at the time of trial. Instead of confronting this difficulty directly \u2014 by seeking an extension of discovery pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:24-l(c) \u2014 plaintiff opted for a solution that, when granted, severely prejudiced defendants by guaranteeing the unnecessary duplication of past efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The permission given to plaintiff to pursue a new, identical complaint without consequence also served to minimalize the central purpose of our court rules: the fair and efficient administration of justice. <em>See Ragusa v. Lau, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>276, 283, 575 A.2d 8 (1990); <em>Handelman v. Handelman, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 109 A.2d 797 (1954). Were we to endorse the order in question, we would legitimize a gaping loophole in the \u201cBest Practices\u201d rule amendments, which were intended to \u201cimprove\u201d and not frustrate \u201cefficiency and expedition of the litigation process.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>1:1-2 (2006). The process authorized by <em>R. </em>4:37-l(b) cannot be the means of avoiding the requirements of <em>R. </em>4:24-1 (c) or the means for creating a less efficient or an uneven method for adjudicating disputes. Our modern procedures could not have evolved to the present day only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>to prove irrelevant and ineffectual when faced with an artifice such as plaintiff created here.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Plaintiffs claim to relief from his \u201clogistics problem\u201d should have been pursued directly, not disingenuously. Instead of resorting to the charade of a voluntary dismissal coupled with the unveiling of a new complaint waiting in the wings, plaintiff should have first been obligated to seek relief from the discovery end date. Because plaintiff opted not to pursue that proper course, we conclude that the trial judge erred in granting a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, which had the undesirable effect of unraveling all that had been accomplished in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In reversing the order of dismissal without prejudice, and in mandating the denial of that motion on remand, we return this action to where it was when defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was still pending. In light of what we have said, plaintiff should be given an opportunity to move for an extension of discovery pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:24-l(c). Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment should be held in abeyance pending resolution of the motion for an extension of discovery. Should the motion for an extension of discovery be granted,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the impetus for plaintiffs pursuit of a voluntary dismissal without prejudice will have evaporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Should the motion for an extension of discovery be denied, plaintiff may again seek a voluntary dismissal. If the motion for a voluntary dismissal is renewed, the trial judge should first determine whether there is a legitimate basis for granting that relief\u2014 and the skirting of a denial of a discovery extension is <em>not </em>a legitimate basis. The trial judge should also insure that the granting of a dismissal without prejudice does not unduly prejudice the efficient administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">If there is a legitimate basis for granting a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, the trial judge should impose such terms as are appropriate. Those terms should at least encompass plaintiffs payment of the counsel fees incurred by defendants for services that will be duplicated should plaintiff be permitted to pursue the new complaint. In so holding, we do not mean to suggest that no other terms would be appropriate if the action takes this alternative course; a proper exercise of discretion requires that the judge balance the interests of the parties, but the judge must take particular care to protect defendants from the cost or other prejudice resulting from the duplication of their previously expended efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">We lastly remind the judge of his obligation to thoroughly describe on the record the reasons for his disposition of any of the matters that will hereafter come before him in this action as mandated by <em>R. </em>1:7 \u2014 4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\"> Assuming we should not view plaintiff's motion as a cross-motion, then it should have been filed and served not later than sixteen days before the specified return date. <em>R. </em>l:6-3(a). Whether governed by <em>R. </em>4:46-1 or <em>R. </em>l:6-3(a), plaintiff's papers were untimely. And, although a party may seek permission to file a motion on short notice, there is no indication in the record on appeal that plaintiff sought relief from these time requirements. Plaintiff merely forwarded the tardy motion to the court and counsel without seeking prior approval and without an explanation for his delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\"> The new complaint was never served on defendants \u2014 even informally \u2014 until defendant received it as part of the motion for a voluntary dismissal served on September 6, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-14\"> R. 2:5-1 (b) permits a trial judge to amplify an earlier decision within fifteen days of service of a notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b125-16\"> Because the voluntary dismissal order disposed of all remaining issues, it was a final order. Defendants did not require our leave to file an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b126-11\"> We are further troubled by the fact that the judge permitted the filing of plaintiff\u2019s motion for a voluntary dismissal on short notice without ascertaining whether defendants had any valid objection, without permitting defendants to respond to the tardy motion, and without entertaining oral argument. <em>See, e.g., Filippone v. Lee, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 306, 700 A.2d 384 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b127-10\"> Subsection (a) also permits an action to be voluntarily dismissed without court approval through the \"filing [of] a stipulation of dismissal specifying the claim or claims being dismissed, signed by all parties who have appeared in the action.\u201d No such stipulation was filed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\"> This Latin phrase (translated as \"god from the machine\") refers to a common construct in ancient Roman and Greek theater when, toward the end of the play, a god-like character was lowered onto the stage by a crane, or machine, in order to untangle a convoluted plot or resolve a protagonist's hopeless dilemma.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> We intimate no view as to how any future motion for an extension of discovery should be decided although we do emphasize that plaintiff must be required to demonstrate \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d since a trial date had been set at the time the erroneous voluntary dismissal was granted. That is, plaintiff should not be entitled to take advantage of our earlier holding that a less onerous standard applies to a motion to extend discovery where there is no scheduled trial date. <em>See Ponden v. </em>Ponden, 374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 863 A.2d 366 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. denied, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>212, 871 A.2d 90 (2005). At the time the trial judge mistakenly granted a voluntary dismissal, a trial date was scheduled to occur only seventeen days later. That is the setting in which any future motion for a discovery extension should be examined even though there is now no scheduled trial date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
