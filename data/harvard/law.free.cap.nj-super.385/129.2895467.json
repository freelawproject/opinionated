REISNER, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Charged with absconding from parole, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5b, defendant Jose Pineiro entered a plea of guilty on the second day of trial, after the jury was selected and sworn. Almost a month later, prior to sentencing, defendant filed motions to withdraw his guilty plea, to relieve assigned counsel, and to proceed pro se. The trial judge denied the motions and sentenced him to five years imprisonment with a two and one-half year parole bar, to be served concurrent to any sentence imposed for violation of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">These are the most pertinent facts. On September 21, 2001, defendant was convicted for conspiracy to possess a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was paroled on March 14, 2002. On April 23, 2002, he was indicted for absconding from parole.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Before trial, defendant\u2019s counsel advised the trial judge that defendant refused to wear street clothes and insisted on appearing before the jury in his prison clothing. On the second day of trial, defense counsel told the judge that he had refused his client\u2019s request to file a motion to dismiss the indictment, and that defendant was dissatisfied with his representation. Defendant had also rejected a plea offer of three years \u201cflat\u201d because it would not include credit for time served after he was returned to prison for parole violation. After defense counsel explained to the judge his understanding that jail credit was not available in this situa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>tion, the judge asked if the jury should be recalled. The following colloquy took place among the court, defense counsel, and defendant, who was speaking through an interpreter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">THE COURT: Shall we recall the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">MR. SMITH: Do you want to enter a plea or do you want to proceed to trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APU\">MR. PINEIRO: Whatever plea you want to give me now, give it to me, I\u2019ll go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anl\">MR. SMITH: Judge, I\u2019m not sure what Mr. Pineiro is asking. Perhaps you can inquire as to whether or not he wishes to enter a plea at this point or proceed to trial____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">INTERPRETER: Tell him that I don\u2019t want to go to trial and I\u2019ll plead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">THE COURT: I am not inclined at this point to accept this defendant\u2019s plea of guilt. I am convinced that this trial should proceed in this defendant\u2019s interest. There is a single charge, it is a straightforward charge, and I am not able to imagine at this point this defendant entering ... an acceptable credible, honest factual basis for the plea, and without such a basis, I am not permitted to accept [a] plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">After explaining to the court that his client was \u201cobviously extremely distraught,\u201d defense counsel requested a break to speak to his client. The judge agreed, reminding counsel that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_R\">I will not accept a plea should your client explain ... that he is doing this to get it over with, that he doesn\u2019t like his lawyer, that he doesn\u2019t understand ... [U]nless he is prepared to be sworn and offer a factual basis which in his own words establishes his guilt freely, voluntarily, soberly, I will not accept the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">After the break, defendant advised the court that his client wished to plead guilty \u201cwithout a plea bargain.\u201d The prosecutor agreed, after reiterating on the record that defendant was \u201cextended-term eligible\u201d and \u201ccould conceivably receive a 10-year state prison sentence with a 5-year parole ineligibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">The judge then addressed the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">Q: Why do you now wish to plead guilty in the middle of this trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-14\">A: Okay, Your Honor, I know that in this \u2014 in this case and this indictment, okay, I never report I move from room 9 to Wildwood, I never see my parole officer, I never called him, nothing, Your Honor. I know I\u2019m guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">The judge read the indictment to defendant, who indicated that he understood it and wished to plead guilty to absconding. When asked if he had consumed any \u201cmedicine or other substance that might affect your ability to think clearly,\u201d defendant responded that he took \u201cpsych medication.\u201d He indicated that he took the medication at night and \u201chad one last night but not today.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>purpose of the medication, according to defendant was \u201cto sleep at night, and also to keep me calm so that I don\u2019t ... hear voices.\u201d But he indicated that he was \u201cthinking clearly now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The following factual basis was then placed on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">BY MR. SMITH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">Q. [0]n August 6th of 2001 were you placed upon parole as a result of a conviction that you received in Cape May County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">Q. At the time you were placed under parole you were given certain rules and regulations that you were to comply, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">Q. And, in fact, you signed a certificate of parole indicating what the conditions of your parole would be, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">Q. You understood those conditions when you signed it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">Q. One of those conditions was that you were to report to your parole officer, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-17\">Q. And subsequent to signing those parole conditions did there come a period of time during March and April of 2002 when you failed to report to your parole officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-19\">Q. Did there \u2014 was there also a condition of your parole that was explained to you that you were to report to your parole officer or to the parole office any change in residence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-20\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-21\">Q. And did there come a time when you were living at the Economy Motel, which was your approved residence in Cape May County, and that you moved from that residence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-22\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-23\">Q. And did you fail to report that change of residence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-24\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-25\">Q. \u2014to your parole officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-26\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-27\">The trial judge then asked defendant why he failed to report the change of residence, leading to the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-28\">THE COURT: Why did you fail to report the change?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-29\">MR. PINEIRO: Your Honor, I had a lot of things on my mind at that time. When I came out from prison they suppose ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>INTERPRETER: When I got out of jail they were supposed to give me a medication to hold me over for a month. I didn\u2019t have that medication. I had no money to buy food to eat. I had no money to take transportation. They wanted me to go to the welfare office but I have a record. I have a criminal record and welfare doesn\u2019t \u2014 and welfare is not going to help me because of the record that I have. And that was one of the reasons why I went to Wildwood, and I tried to survive the best way I could, but I didn\u2019t look for any problems and I didn\u2019t hide. I never hid. I never left the state, I kept \u2014 I stayed in Wildwood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">BY MR. SMITH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">Q. But you also didn\u2019t call your parole\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">A. Yes, that\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">Q. \u2014officer, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">A. That\u2019s true, I never called my parole officer, that\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">Q. And \u2014 and you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">THE COURT: Never wrote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">MR. PINEIRO: Hmm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-14\">THE COURT: Never wrote?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">MR. PINEIRO: I\u2019ll be honest with you, I did try to call him a couple times but every time I call him he never in the office or else I\u2019ll forget and I never call him back, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-16\">THE COURT: Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-17\">MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-18\">THE COURT: Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-19\">MR. CARROCCIA: Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be a problem but, you know, what he\u2019s saying is that he violated his parole, not necessarily he absconded. Absconded means that he did hide, he did go into hiding and he did it to avoid supervision. He\u2019s saying he didn\u2019t hide and, frankly, it\u2019s my fault, Your Honor, I would have asked Mr. Smith to ask him if when he did go into hiding he did it to avoid supervision. What he said was that he violated his parole. They often obviously go hand in hand but he just said he didn\u2019t hide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-20\">THE COURT: Well, they\u2019re not necessarily the same thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-21\">MR. CARROCCIA: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-22\">THE COURT: Mr. Smith</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-23\">MR. SMITH: Judge, I believe he\u2019s satisfied the factual basis. The statute makes it unlawful for him to fail to report and or to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-24\">MR. PINEIRO: Communication to parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-25\">MR. SMITH: \u2014 or to go into hiding with the purpose of avoiding supervision. The case law that I have read indicates that there is ... an inference that can be drawn by the fact if one fails to report and by the fact that one fails to notify the change of residence, that that purpose was, in fact, to avoid the ramifications of parole, and I believe he\u2019s indicated a factual basis for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-26\">QUESTIONING BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-27\">Q. Mr. Pineiro</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">Q. \u2014when you were living at the Econolodge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">MR. SMITH: Economy Motel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">BY THE WITNESS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">Q. Economy Motel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">A. Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">Q. Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">Q. Okay. Were you working at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">A. No, Your Honor ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-15\">Q. Okay. Let me ask my\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-16\">A. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-17\">Q. \u2014question. Who was helping you pay the rent there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-18\">A. Okay, Your Honor, when I came in from the street [my] parole officer gave me a check for $150 so I can pay the rent in the room. That room cost a week $150. Q. Okay. And you stayed at the Economy Hotel how long?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-19\">A. I stay for a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-20\">Q. Okay. At the end of that week where did you go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-21\">A. I go to Wil \u2014 Your Honor, three days I stay in Wildwood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-22\">Q. Okay. And you failed to tell your\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-23\">A. I \u2014 that\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-24\">Q. \u2014parole officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-25\">A. Yes, I failed to my parole officer to \u2014 communication to my parole officer to tell him I moved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-26\">Q. Did you know that by not telling your parole officer that you had moved he or she would not be able to find you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-27\">A. I know, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-28\">THE COURT: Okay. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-29\">MR. CARROCCIA: Your Honor, it\u2019s up to your discretion. He said he wasn\u2019t hiding. That\u2019s part of the indictment. The State acknowledges he didn\u2019t leave the State. They have to go into hiding to avoid supervision. I certainly don\u2019t want to make this \u2014 drag this out, it\u2019s been a day-and-a-half, but he said he did not hide. MR. SMITH: Judge, the statute doesn\u2019t say that he has to hide by putting [himself] in a dark closet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-30\">THE COURT: I am satisfied, counsel, of the following. The model jury charge specifically, as it relates to the second of the three elements of the offense, relates to the element of hiding or leaving the state, and the jury charge which I would have presumptively been required to read to the jury states in pertinent part, and I\u2019ll quote,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u201cHiding means to conceal one\u2019s whereabouts. It is not enough for the State to prove only that the defendant failed to keep appointments with his parole officer.\u201d This record contains more facts than mere failure to keep appointments with parole officer[s].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">This defendant has testified that he knew that by failing to contact his parole officer, his parole officer would not be able to find him. I\u2019m satisfied that that satisfies the \u201cintent\u201d component, the \u201cintent to hide\u201d component of this offense. In the absence of any further questions, I am prepared to make findings of fact and conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Defendant appeals, raising the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">POINT I: DEFENDANT\u2019S PLEA WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY AN ADEQUATE FACTUAL BASIS AND WAS NOT VOLUNTARILY ENTERED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad2\">POINT II: DEFENDANT HAD A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PROCEED <em>PRO SE, </em>AND THE COURT\u2019S DENIAL OF HIS APPLICATION TO BE RELIEVED OF ASSIGNED COUNSEL THUS WAS ERRONEOUS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">POINT III: DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aj-dedup-0\">POINT TV: DEFENDANT\u2019S FIVE YEAR SENTENCE, WHICH EXCEEDED THE THEN-EFFECTIVE PRESUMPTIVE TERM FOR THIRD DEGREE OFFENSES BY ONE YEAR, IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">Defendant\u2019s primary contention is that his plea was not supported by an adequate factual basis. A court may accept a guilty plea only after personally addressing the defendant and determining \u201cby inquiry of the defendant ... that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:9-2; <em>State v. Smullen, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>408, 415, 571 A.2d 1305 (1990). The requirement is designed in part to protect a defendant who is willing to plead guilty \u201c \u2018without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Barboza, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>415, 421, 558 A.2d 1303 (1989) (citation omitted). As the Supreme Court stated in <em>State v. Sainz, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>283, 526 A.2d 1015 (1987), \u201c[t]he essential thing is that the defendant is in fact guilty of the crime for which he is being sentenced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 526 A.2d 1015. To that end,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">[t]he factual basis for a guilty plea must obviously include defendant\u2019s admission of guilt of the crime or the acknowledgement of facts constituting the essential elements of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">[Id. at 293, 526 A.2d 1015.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The crime of absconding from parole consists of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">A'person subject to parole commits a crime of the third degree if the person <em>goes into hiding or leaves the State with a purpose of avoiding supervision ... </em>Abandoning a place of residence without the prior permission of or notice to the appropriate supervising authority shall constitute prima facie evidence that the person intended to avoid such supervision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2C:29-5b; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The crime consists of two distinct elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">(1) the act of \u201cgo[ing] into hiding or leaving] the State,\u201d <em>and </em>(2) the intent of \u201cavoiding [parole] supervision.\u201d The \u201c[ab]andoning [of] a place of residence\u201d without prior permission or notice provides \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d of only the second element of this offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\"><em>[State v. Graham, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>413, 414, 665 A.2d 769 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>378, 676 A.2d 1092 (1996); citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Whereas parole revocation is not considered a criminal proceeding, \u201c[p]rosecution for absconding from parole under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5b, on the other hand, is clearly intended to punish violators of that criminal code provision.\u201d <em>State v. Black, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>438, 452, 710 A.2d 428 (1998). Proof of intent to avoid parole supervision is critical to a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">The critical element of the absconding offense is the act of going into hiding or leaving the state for the purpose of avoiding parole supervision. In contrast, the mere finding of a violation of a condition of parole, absent any showing of the parolee\u2019s intent, can constitute a basis for revocation of parole. Clearly, the crime of absconding from parole is intended to reach conduct evincing a higher level of culpability than that minimally sufficient for the administrative sanction of parole revocation. The targeted conduct of the crime of absconding from parole evokes parallels to the crime of escape. It is only the purposeful avoidance of parole supervision that the legislature determined to criminalize for the purposes of deterrence and retribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 453, 710 A.2d 428; citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">Hiding consists of something more than merely leaving an assigned residence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-14\">[T]he abandonment of an approved residence without permission or notice would not by itself constitute \u201cgo[ing] into hiding.\u201d For example, if a parolee left a drug treatment facility and returned to a permanent residence known to parole officials, that act could not reasonably be described as \u201ca withdrawal from one\u2019s usual haunts to evade authority.\u201d To the contrary, such a parolee could be said to have returned to his \u201cusual haunts.\u201d Thus, even though the abandonment of an approved residence would be a violation of a condition of parole that could justify a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>revocation of that parole, it would not constitute the predicate act required to convict a parolee of absconding. Instead, the State would have to show that after leaving an approved residence, the parolee somehow attempted to avoid parole supervision or apprehension, such as by residing at a location that was unknown to parole officials and failing to communicate with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\"><em>[Graham, supra, </em>284 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 416, 665 A.2d 769.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Defendant contends that his guilty plea did not include the essential elements of intentional \u201chiding\u201d or \u201cpurposeful avoidance of parole supervision,\u201d and that his statements at the plea hearing actually negated these elements. <em>Black, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 452, 710 A.2d 428. In considering his contentions we first review two somewhat similar cases, <em>State v. Eisenman </em>and <em>State v. Graham.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">In <em>State v. Eisenman, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>462, 710 A.2d 441 (1998), the defendant, who had been paroled on condition that he spend a year at a residential drug program, left the program after a month \u201cand thereafter had no contact with parole authorities until his arrest____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465, 710 A.2d 441. He pled guilty to absconding from parole. The Supreme Court, sua sponte, raised the issue of the sufficiency of the plea and found the following colloquy to be \u201cbarely sufficient to establish a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5b,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 470, 710 A.2d 441:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">Q. All right, the indictment charges on escape, March 26,1993 you did commit the crime of escape by absconding from parole that was imposed three different times, September 25, [19187 and December 4, [19]87 and November 18, [19]88. Tell me what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">[A] I was released on parole to the Institute of Human Development Drug Program. I was there for about 31 days. I was on a furlough. I came back several hours late. They said they were going to dismiss me from that program and that they, I guess, notified my parole officer at which time I packed and left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">Q. You left. Did you ever contact your parole officer after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">Q. How long were you supposed to be there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-15\">A. They said a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-16\">Q. A year. And how long were you there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-17\">A. Thirty-one days, approximately that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-18\">Q. And then you had no contact with anybody in parole until you were picked up in May?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-19\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-20\">Q.

Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 471, 710 A.2d 441]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">[w]e are satisfied that defendant\u2019s answers to the court\u2019s questions were minimally sufficient to establish a factual basis from which the court could conclude that defendant purposefully avoided parole supervision after leaving the Institute of Human Development Drug Program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">In <em>State v. Graham, supra, </em>defendant successfully moved to dismiss his indictment for absconding, and the State appealed. We first reviewed the extremely deferential standard applied in judging the sufficiency of an indictment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">\u201cAn indictment should not be dismissed unless its insufficiency is palpable.\u201d Consequently, \u201c[i]n determining the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the indictment, every reasonable inference is to be given to the State.\u201d \u201c[T]he evidence need not be sufficient to sustain a conviction, but merely sufficient to determine that there is <em>prima facie </em>evidence to establish that a crime has been committed.\u201d Therefore, a defendant who challenges an indictment must \u201cdemonstrate that evidence is clearly lacking to support the charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\"><em>[Graham, supra, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 416, 665 A.2d 769; citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Applying that deferential standard, we concluded that the following facts were insufficient to sustain defendant\u2019s \u201cheavy burden,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 417, 665 A.2d 769, to overturn the indictment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-13\">The State presented evidence to the grand jury that defendant not only left the drug rehabilitation program to which he had been paroled but also deliberately evaded parole officials for the next six months. This evasion took the form of defendant failing on two occasions to comply with the parole officer\u2019s demands that he \u201cturn himself in\u201d and fleeing on four occasions from parole officers and/or other law enforcement officials when they encountered him on the streets of Asbury Park. Such conduct provided a more than adequate foundation for the grand jury to infer that defendant concealed himself for a substantial period of time in order to evade parole supervision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\"><em>[Id. </em>at 417, 665 A.2d 769.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">We next consider the facts of this case, viewed in light of <em>Eisenman </em>and <em>Graham. </em>Up to the point at which the judge asked defendant why he left the motel, defendant\u2019s statements arguably set forth a factual basis as \u201cminimally adequate\u201d as that in <em>State v. Eisenman, supra. </em>Like the defendant in <em>Eisenman, </em>he left his assigned place of residence and failed to notify his parole officer of his whereabouts, thus triggering the statutory rebuttable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>presumption that he \u201cintended to avoid such supervision.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5b. But defendant\u2019s subsequent explanation for leaving the motel and failing to notify his parole officer negated the presumption. Defendant explained that he became homeless because he did not have his medication, and could not afford to live in the motel on the $150 the parole officer gave him. Further, once he was homeless, he tried unsuccessfully to call his parole officer \u201ca couple times but ... he [was] never in the office.\u201d He stated unequivocally that \u201cI never hid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The subsequent efforts by the court and counsel to salvage the plea were unavailing. The facts that defendant \u201cfailed\u201d to communicate with his parole officer and that he knew \u201cthat by not telling your parole officer that you had moved he or she would not be able to find you,\u201d are not a sufficient factual basis in light of the other exculpatory information that defendant placed on the record. Taken in context, his statements established that he was penniless, mentally ill, needed psychiatric medication that he did not have, and that he tried unsuccessfully to contact his parole officer once he was living on the streets of Wildwood. Unlike the defendant in <em>Graham, </em>he did not resist demands to turn himself in or repeatedly flee from his parole officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">While we understand the frustration that the trial judge and counsel may have experienced in dealing with an obviously difficult defendant, the record does not satisfy us of the most essential criteria of a guilty plea: \u201cthat the defendant is in fact guilty of the crime for which he is being sentenced.\u201d <em>State v. Sainz, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 292, 526 A.2d 1015. We imply no criticism of the trial judge in asking questions after defendant initially stated the factual basis for the plea. The judge was quite properly attempting to fulfill his obligation to \u201cindependently satisfy [himself] \u2018that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Smullen, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 415, 571 A.2d 1305. But when it became clear that defendant denied an essential element of the crime, the judge should have followed his initial instinct and refused to accept the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Consequently, we vacate the conviction and the sentence and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. <em>State v. Barboza, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 427, 558 A.2d 1303. In light of our disposition we need not address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-11\"> Defendant was also administratively charged with violating parole and was returned to prison to serve the remaining portion of his original sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
