The injuries did not result in \u201cimpairment of physical condition\u201d nor was there any proof that Vitale suffered \u201csubstantial pain\u201d, both of which are required to prove \u201cphysical injury\u201d within the meaning of both subdivision 2 of section 140.30 and subdivision 6 of section 120.05 of the Penal Law (see <em>People v Morales, </em>75 AD2d 745).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">We have examined the remaining contentions by defendant and find them to be without merit.
