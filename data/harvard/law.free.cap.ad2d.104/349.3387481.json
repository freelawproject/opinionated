As so modified, judgment affirmed, without costs or disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Orders entered February 2, 1982 and February 9, 1983, respectively, affirmed, without costs or disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">After reviewing the voluminous record in this matter, we are satisfied that both parties have established their causes of action for divorce. In computing the amount due plaintiff in arrears under a <em>pendente lite </em>order, however, Special Term should have accepted the parties\u2019 stipulation that the amount of the claimed arrears was $4,600. Special Term should not have considered the $1,400 allegedly stolen from defendant, since there was no proof that the money was taken by plaintiff. Special Term should, however, have credited plaintiff, pursuant to its authority under section 234 of the Domestic Relations Law, with her interest in the Israeli bonds owned jointly by the parties and with the amount of <em>pendente lite </em>counsel fees defendant admitted he had not paid. The judgment is modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We have considered the remaining arguments advanced by the parties and have found them to be without merit. Brown, J. P., Rubin, Boyers and Lawrence, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
