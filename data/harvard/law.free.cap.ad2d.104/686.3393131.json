However, since defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree was reversed by the Court of Appeals and the matter remitted for a new trial <em>(People v West, </em>62 NY2d 708), petitioner is not entitled to the relief sought (CPL 40.30, subd 3; <em>People v Ercole, </em>4 NY2d 617). Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Main, Casey and Weiss, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
