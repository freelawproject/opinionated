Memorandum: By entering a plea of guilty to a violation of subdivision 2 of section 1192 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law as a felony, defendant waived his claim that the People were not ready for trial within the time prescribed by CPL 30.30 <em>(People v Savage, </em>54 NY2d 697; <em>People v Friscia, </em>51 NY2d 845).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">While a plea of guilty entered under circumstances demonstrating a knowing and voluntary waiver of the constitutional right to a speedy trial may also operate as a waiver of that right <em>(People v White, </em>32 NY2d 393, 399; <em>People v Nelson, </em>79 AD2d 1093), it may not be said here that defendant\u2019s conduct spelled out such a waiver (see <em>People v Chirieleison, </em>3 NY2d 170, 173-174). His motion to dismiss on this ground was properly denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>however, because his moving papers were factually and legally insufficient to support the claim (see <em>People v Taranovich, </em>37 NY2d 442) and no hearing was required (see CPL 210.45, subd 5, par [a]). (Appeal from judgment of Monroe County Court, Mark, J. \u2014 driving while intoxicated.) Present \u2014 Dillon, P. J., Doerr, Green, Moule and Schnepp, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
