We agree and would, therefore, vacate the judgment of sentence and grant appellant a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>On January 15, 1975, appellant entered pleas of guilty to forgery<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and indecent assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court sentenced appellant to a one to two year term of imprisonment on the indecent charge and to a consecutive six to thirty-six month term of imprisonment on the forgery charge. On March 17, 1977, appellant filed a petition to withdraw his guilty pleas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 27,1977, the lower court denied appellant\u2019s petition and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Appellant alleges that the record does not establish that his guilty pleas were voluntarily and knowingly entered because it does not reflect the lower court\u2019s compliance with Pa.R.Crim.P. 319, 19 P.S.Appendix. Rule 319(a) precludes acceptance of a guilty plea unless a colloquy appears on the record which establishes that the defendant\u2019s plea is voluntarily and understanding^ made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Comment to the Rule states that at a minimum the judge must ask questions to elicit the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u201c(1) Does the defendant understand the nature of the charges to which he is pleading guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">\u201c(2) Is there a factual basis for the plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">\u201c(3) Does the defendant understand that he has the right to trial by jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u201c(4) Does the defendant understand that he is presumed innocent until he is found guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">\u201c(5) Is the defendant aware of the permissible range of sentences and/or fines for the offenses charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201c(6) Is the defendant aware that the judge is not bound by the terms of any plea agreement tendered unless the judge accepts such agreement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Moreover, Pennsylvania courts have frequently stated that \u201cin order to insulate pleas from attack, a colloquy should be conducted which satisfies the court that the \u2018defendant understands the nature of the charges, his right to a jury trial, the acts sufficient to constitute the offenses for which he is charged and the permissible range of sentences.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth ex rel. West v. Rundle, </em>428 Pa. 102, 106, 237 A.2d 196, 198 (1968).\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Maddox, </em>450 Pa. 406, 407-408, 300 A.2d 503, 504 (1973); <em>Commonwealth v. Jackson, </em>450 Pa. 417, 299 A.2d 209 (1973). In <em>Commonwealth v. Ingram, </em>455 Pa. 198, 203, 316 A.2d 77, 80 (1974), the Supreme Court held that: \u201ca valid guilty plea may not be accepted in the absence of a demonstration of defendant\u2019s understanding of the charges. ... In order to demonstrate that a defendant possesses such understanding, he certainly must be told more than just that he has been charged with murder or robbery, for example. While such terms clearly connote some meaning to the layman, this meaning does not always embrace the basic legal elements of the crime. If this were not the case, there would be no need for instructions to a jury on such points, for certainly, an average defendant cannot be presumed to understand more than an average juror. Thus, for an examination to demonstrate a defendant\u2019s understanding of the charge, the record must disclose that the elements of the crime or crimes charged were outlined in understandable terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Recently, in <em>Commonwealth v. Willis, </em>471 Pa. 53, 369 A.2d 1190 (1977), the Supreme Court reiterated the holding in <em>Ingram, </em>supra, and held that failure to satisfy the minimal requirements as set forth in the cases and in the comment to Pa.R.Crim.P. 319, will result in reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In the instant case, the following colloquy occurred at the guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u201cMR. BARO: [District Attorney] I believe the first count of forgery on Bill of Indictment 869 of 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cMR. NOCH: [Public Defender] Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u201cMR. BARO: And then on the Bill of Indictment 939 of 1974, I believe the plea is to the second count, indecent assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cMR. DOUGHERTY: [Chief Adult Probation Officer] That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">\u201cMR. NOCH: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">\u201cMR. BARO: And upon entry of his guilty plea to the charges, the District Attorney\u2019s Office would then move for the dismissal of the second count, criminal conspiracy on Bill of Indictment 869 of 1974 and also to the first count of criminal attempt on Bill of Indictment No. 939 of 1974. Am I correct on this, Mr. Dougherty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">\u201cMR. DOUGHERTY: That is correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Now, Mr. Stolle, do you understand what the facts are in the two charges against you, forgery and indecent assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: And do you understand that you have the right to have your guilt or innocence on these charges determined by a jury trial, at which trial there is a presumption of innocence in your favor with the burden on the Commonwealth to prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and at which trial you are entitled to be represented by counsel and counsel free to you if you cannot afford your own, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Further, do you understand that by pleading guilty, you are admitting the correctness of the charges and that you will be sentenced, the sentence could be as such as 10 years imprisonment on forgery and two years on the indecent assault, do you understand that, plus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>substantial fines and imposition of court costs, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Let me ask whether you are making these pleas of your own free will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: What, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Are you making these pleas of your own free will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Have you consulted your counsel before doing so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Have you talked with Mr. Noch about this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-12\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I am satisfied that the defendant is pleading voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly, and I will accept the pleas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">It is clear that the trial court failed to obtain a factual basis for the pleas. The court did not ask any questions designed to reveal what conduct by appellant resulted in the instant charges. In fact, the instant record is also barren of any outline or explanation of the elements of either offense charged. Finally, the court also failed to inform appellant that it is not bound by the terms of any plea agreement tendered unless it accepts such agreement. Because the on-the-record colloquy prior to the guilty pleas failed to comply with the requirements of Pa.R.Crim.P. 319 and Pennsylvania case law, we find that appellant\u2019s pleas were not voluntarily and knowingly entered. Therefore, we reverse and remand for trial. Judgments of sentence reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-15\">WATKINS, former President Judge, did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b546-16\">PRICE and VAN der VOORT, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\">.
