The trial court accepted the appellee\u2019s contention that an arresting officer may not also administer a breathalyzer test. Two reasons are suggested by appellee. The first is that section 316.1932, Florida Statutes (1983) prohibits an officer from performing both acts, because the statute directs that the test is incidental to the arrest and shall be administered at the request of an officer. The second reason is that if the same officer is permitted to both arrest and test the appellee, the appellee\u2019s due process rights would be violated, because such action violates fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The question was raised by a motion to dismiss, stipulated to be a motion to suppress, which was granted, resulting in suppression of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. We have concluded that the language of the statute does not prohibit an arresting officer who possesses the qualifications to do so from administering the test, and that the failure of the statute to require separate persons to perform those acts does not, as a matter of law, violate the appellee\u2019s right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">BARAD and FEDER, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
