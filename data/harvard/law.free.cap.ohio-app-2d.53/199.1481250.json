C. 2907.32(A)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, defendant filed his motion to suppress evidence pursuant to Crim. R. 12(B)(3). After a hearing the motion was overruled and Miller was found guilty as charged and duly sentenced, all of which culminated in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">There are other basic facts in the scenario. The films <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>were exhibited at 1213 Tennessee Ave., Cincinnati, a business-type building which includes an assembly room or auditorium. A witness identified it as the \u201cReal Estate Building.\u201d The two officers who'ultimately arrested Miller wore casual civilian clothes when they entered the subject building. Although the record \u25a0 reveals the two officers were unknown to the ticket-takers, after some superficial screening directed to discovering how the officers learned of the event, they were admitted for eight dollars each. After admission, at least one of the officers purchased a scotch and water drink. Several minutes later three other Cincinnati police officers entered the building and within a brief period of time the defendant Miller, operated a movie projector which showed two reels of film subsequently determined by the trial court, after reviewing them, to be obscene. The three police officers who arrived on the scene after the first two officers were recognized and as the three were being escorted out, identified themselves. Miller, the projectionist, was arrested and the films seized; After Miller had shown the films, he placed them inside a bag and took them into the kitchen area of a downstairs room, prompting one of the officers to conclude, as he testified, that the film exhibition had concluded for the evening. Officer Seiffert testified at the trial below, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">\u201cQ. Did you have \u2014 were you able to observe, have any knowledge, that there was to be a subsequent exhibition or showing or projection of these films ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201cA. No sir. My observations led me to believe this was the end of the films. There was going to be some live entertainment \u2014 that was what they were setting up for * # # \u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">It was conceded by counsel for appellant that this was a \u201cone-shot\u201d affair; this was the only occasion these films had been or were to be exhibited. The films were seized without a search warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The single assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the seized motion picture films from evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The following is the appellant\u2019s view of the issue presented here for review and argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\">\u201cWhere motion picture films are seized without the intervention of a magistrate and the issuance of a search warrant, such seizure is unreasonable and repugnant to the First, Fourth \u2022 and Fourteenth Amendments of . the Constitution of the United States and such seized films cannot be introduced into evidence at the trial of the cause where an appropriate motion to suppress has been filed prior to trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Appellant relies upon <em>Roaden </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1973), 413 U. S. 496, in which a county sheriff viewed a sexually explicit film at a local drive-in theater, at the conclusion of which he arrested the theater-manager for exhibiting an obscene film in violation of Kentucky law, and seized one copy of the film as evidence without a warrant . A conviction ensued which the United States Supreme Court reversed, holding, according to the case headnote, which is an accurate distillation of the opinion itself, that \u201cthe seizure by the sheriff, without the authority of a constitutionally sufficient warrant, was unreasonable under Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment standards.\u201d Counsel also invite our attention to <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969), 394 U. S. 557 which held a Georgia statute' unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, insofar as it made mere private possession of obscene matter a crime. The obscene matter in question consisted of films seized in a desk drawer in a bedroom of the defendant\u2019s home. The Supreme Court stated in <em>Stanley \\ \u25a0 </em>'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cWhatever may be the' justifications for other statutes regulating obscenity, we do not .think they reach-into , the <em>privacy ' of one\u2019s own home:\u201d </em>(Page 565.) (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABm\">The matter <em>sub judice </em>seems to Us. to present a fact pattern different from that in either <em>Roaden </em>or <em>Stanley. </em>Perhaps the matter now confronting us amounts to a situation 'Somewhere-betwixt the facts in <em>Roaden </em>(warrantless arrest in \u00e1 commercial drive-in theater regularly' open to the public) and <em>Stanley </em>(an. arrest for possession of films <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>in defendant\u2019s own house). Regardless, the state of facts here unmistakably differs from both <em>Boaden </em>and <em>Stanley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Although <em>Roaden\u2019s </em>facts are distinguishable, the Supreme Court incorporates language therein which clearly applies to such facts as those before us. In <em>Boaden </em>the court states the following, at page 505:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u201cMoreover, ordinary human experience should teach that the seizure of a movie film from a commercial theater with <em>regularly scheduled performances, </em>where a film is being played and replayed to paid audiences, presents a very different situation from that in which contraband is changing hands or where a robbery or assault is being perpetrated. In the latter settings, the probable cause for an arrest might justify the seizure of weapons, or other evidence or instruments of crime, without a warrant. Cf. <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U. S. 752, 764 (1969); <em>id., </em>at 773-774 (White, J., dissenting); <em>Preston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964). <em>Where there are exigent circumstances in which police action literally must he \u2018now or never\u2019 to preserve the evidence of the crime, it is reasonable to permit action without prior judicial evaluation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In footnote six, on the same page, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201c* * * [W]here films are scheduled for exhibition in a commercial theater open to the public, procuring a warrant based on a prior judicial determination of probable cause of obscenity need not risk loss of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">If a rule of law requires police officers, circumstanced as here, to secure a warrant predicated on prior judicial evaluation of the films, a violation of the states\u2019 anti-obscenity laws is inevitable because if the officers left the building to secure a warrant \u2014 a procedure under the circumstances presenting quite substantial obstacles \u2014 reason dictates that upon their return the projectionist and films would be elsewhere. If the exhibition of such films in such an exigent fact pattern as here falls within the area of legitimate law enforcement \u2014 and the U. S. Supreme Court has so held<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 enforcement would be impossible if a war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>rant based upon a prior judicial determination of obscenity were required. We view the instant situation as possessing exigent circumstances in which, as <em>Roaden </em>explains, police action \u201cliterally must be \u2018now or never\u2019 to preserve the evidence of the crime.\u201d Therefore, we decide that the court below did not err in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the seized motion picture films, thus prohibiting their introduction into evidence. They were properly in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-4\">Shannon, P.
