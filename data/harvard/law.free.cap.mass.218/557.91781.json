The judge of the Superior Court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> made a finding to the effect that he was not satisfied of the truth of the allegations contained in the motions, and for that reason denied them and refused as inapplicable certain requests for rulings presented by the plaintiff. In substance, the conclusion of the trial judge was that he did not believe that the facts set forth in the affidavits in support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the motions were true. Most of the affiants had been before him in some capacity during the trial. Manifestly he was in a better position to decide upon their credibility and upon all matters set forth in the affidavits than any one else. His findings on the facts will not be disturbed. The rulings requested related either to facts or to matters rendered immaterial in view of the findings. <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>137 Mass. 183. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>147 Mass. 76.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b584-5\"><em>M.
