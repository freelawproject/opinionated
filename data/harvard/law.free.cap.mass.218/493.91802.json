Kilburn for causing the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate on April 8, 1912, on South Street in Holyoke, a public highway between the buildings of the Germania Mills, at the side of which was a branch railroad track operated by the defendant, by reason of the collision of certain cars of the defendant, that were kicked down the track by a switching engine, and a large motor truck driven by the intestate from which he had delivered a package at the main building of the mills; and the second action by the owner of the motor truck for injury to the truck by the same collision. Writs dated July 2, 1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-4\">In the Superior Court the cases were tried together before <em>Aiken, </em>C. J. The facts that could have been found upon the evidence which are necessary to an understanding of the opinion are there stated. Payette, mentioned in the opinion, accompanied Kilburn in the motor truck as a helper. The Chief Justice refused to order a verdict for the defendant or to make certain rulings requested by the defendant, and submitted the cases to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the first case in the sum of $5,000 and a verdict for the plaintiff in the second case in the sum of $1,050. The Chief Justice then asked the jury whether they found \"that the way across the tracks to the mill door was a way by invitation or a way by license.\u201d The foreman answered, \"Invitation,\u201d and the other jurors acquiesced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-5\">The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-6\">The cases were submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-7\"><em>W.

It has all been carefully considered, and we are of opinion that the questions, whether Kilburn, the driver of the truck, was a licensee or an invitee while entering upon the defendant\u2019s track, and whether the defendant was negligent, were clearly for the jury. The special finding that he was an invitee was justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">The question whether Kilburn was in the exercise of due care is close, but upon the evidence the jury properly may have found that as he drove out of the yard into South Street he looked up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the street to see whether there was any approaching train; that even if he saw the cars standing upon the track several hundred feet away there was no engine in sight, and that to a person in his situation the cars would appear to be freight cars standing for the time being upon the track and apparently not soon to be moved; that he was justified in thinking that he could back across the track and deliver at the shipping room the few articles remaining on his truck before the cars would be started by an engine or in any other way; that by reason of the noise made by the wind and the action of the truck his attention was not attracted by the noise of the cars after they started and by the shouting of the brakeman; and that in view of all these circumstances, taken in connection with the other evidence, he was in the exercise of due care even if he relied upon himself alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">There was also evidence upon which the jury might have found that he and Payette were engaged in the same work; that to a certain extent he relied on the latter for information as to whether there was danger in backing upon the crossing, and that under all the circumstances Payette acted with due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In a word, the evidence justified a finding that, whether Kilburn relied upon himself alone or to any extent upon Payette, due care was exercised for his protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">We see no error in the manner in which the presiding judge dealt with the rulings requested. In each case the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
