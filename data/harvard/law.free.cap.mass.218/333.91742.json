L. c. 189, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, which provided that such an action might be brought by trustee process and, if so brought, should be brought in the county where a trustee dwelt or had a usual place of business.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-15\">Tort, by trustee process, for personal injuries alleged in the declaration to have been received in Malden in the county of Middlesex and to have been caused by negligence of the defendant.

Writ dated November 5, 1913.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_r\">The defendant moved to dismiss the action on the ground that it was improperly brought in the county of Suffolk, under St. 1904, c. 320; which, so far as material, reads as follows: \u201cAn action against a city, town, person, or corporation to recover for injury or damage received in this Commonwealth by reason of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>negligence . . . shall be brought in the county in which the plaintiff lives or has his usual place of business, or in the county in which the alleged injury or damage was received.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">The motion was allowed by <em>Crosby, </em>J.

It was to relieve the courts of those counties in which defendants in actions of negligence usually have a place of business from the trial of actions where the act of negligence happened in another county to plaintiffs residing or having a place of business in other counties. If (as is contended by the plaintiff) it were still possible' to begin the action (in such cases) by a trustee writ, the purpose of the enactment to a large extent would be nullified. We are of opinion that the Legislature meant what it said when it provided that such actions \u201cshall be brought\u201d in the county where the plaintiff lives or has his usual place of business, or in the county in which the injury was received, and that R. L. c. 189, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, were to that extent impliedly repealed. See in this connection <em>Kilby Bank, petitioner, </em>23 Pick. 93; <em>Merchants Bank </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>4 Pick. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The order for judgment dismissing the action must be affirmed; and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
