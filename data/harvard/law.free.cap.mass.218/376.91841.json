Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated August 31, 1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-13\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>White, </em>J. The defendant Sokolowitz moved to amend his answer by alleging \"that prior to the indorsement of the note in question in this suit the plaintiff and defendant mutually agreed that the defendant indorse the same without recourse to him in any event, that said indorsement upon said note was obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>by the plaintiff through false and fraudulent representations.\u201d The motion was denied. The bill of exceptions recites:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">\u201cSignatures of the maker and indorsers of said note having been admitted, the plaintiff offered in evidence said note and certificates of protest and rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">\u201cThe defendant offered evidence tending to show the defendant, Max Sokolowitz, indorsed said note, but before and at the time of the indorsement, it was agreed, orally, that said indorsement was to be without recourse to him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\">The defendant Sokolowitz offered no further evidence and the judge ordered a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $407.24. The defendant Sokolowitz alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-8\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-9\"><em>II.

The denial of the motion to amend the defendant\u2019s answer was wholly within the discretion of the presiding judge, and is not open to exception. <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>6 Allen, 61. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>100 Mass. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">2. If the amendment had been allowed the evidence offered did not set up a legal defense to the note. When the defendant Sokolowitz, who will hereinafter be called the defendant, placed his signature upon the back of the note without qualification he became an indorser. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 80. If the defendant\u2019s only intention was to indorse the note for the purpose of transferring title to the plaintiff, without incurring any personal liability, he could have accomplished that purpose by adding to his signature the words \u201cwithout recourse,\u201d or any words of similar import. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 55. Having indorsed the note without qualification he became liable to the plaintiff for the amount due thereon. Evidence of an oral agreement that at the time the defendant indorsed the note such indorsement was to be without recourse as to him was rightly excluded. Such evidence would tend to vary and control a written instrument absolute in its terms by paroi, and was clearly incompetent. <em>Wooley </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>165 Mass. 503. <em>Essex Co. </em>v. <em>Edmands, </em>12 Gray, 273, 279. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>9 Gray, 337, 339. <em>Prescott Bank </em>v. <em>Caverly, </em>7 Gray, 217. This conclusion is not at variance with <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>173 Mass. 122, and <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Vahey, </em>215 Mass. 80, relied on by the defendant. There is no question that indorsers upon a note may make among themselves a valid agreement that the liability of either shall be different from that which the law otherwise would impose, but that principle has no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
