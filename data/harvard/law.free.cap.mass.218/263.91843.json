Sawyer, Esquire, as auditor, and afterwards was tried before <em>McLaughlin, </em>J., upon the auditor\u2019s report. The plaintiff did not contend that he was entitled to recover under the third and fourth counts of his declaration, and the defendant admitted that the plaintiff was entitled to recover under the first and fifth counts of his declaration the sum of $138 for rent due, being the sum found by the auditor, but denied the right of the plaintiff to recover any larger sum, and denied the right of the plaintiff to recover under the second count of his declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-12\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-13\">\u201c2.

The defendant is not liable for any alterations or changes made with the consent of the plaintiff, express or implied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-16\">\u201c7. If the jury find that the plaintiff knew that the various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>changes and alterations in the building and machinery for which the plaintiff claims to be compensated were being made by the defendant at the time they were made and that the plaintiff made no objection thereto, then the plaintiff has waived all claim for such alterations and changes and cannot recover on account thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">\u201c8. The measure of damages for alterations and changes made in the building or machinery, under the circumstances of this case, is the lessened value of the premises in consequence thereof, and not the cost of replacing them in the condition in which they were before such changes and alterations were made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-6\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings, and ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, under the second count of his declaration, an amount which would enable him at the expiration of the term to put the premises in the condition they were in upon October 21, 1901, the beginning of the term limited in the lease, and that certain evidence, contained in an agreement between the counsel at the trial, relating to the cost of replacing the building and machinery, was competent, and further ruled that the defendant was not entitled to be credited on the sum due for rent the rental value of the premises during the time they were unfit for use after the fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-7\">It was agreed by the counsel that, if the rulings of the judge were correct in law, it would be the duty of the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff on the first and fifth counts of his declaration in the sum of $138 and interest thereon from the date of the writ, and for the plaintiff on the second count of his declaration in the sum of $700 and interest thereon from the date of the writ, and that, subject to the defendant\u2019s exceptions to rulings of the judge, the judge should order the jury to return such a verdict; and a verdict accordingly was ordered and returned for the plaintiff in the sum of $262.29 on the first and fifth counts of his declaration and in the sum of $976.53 on the second count of his declaration.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJa3\">This is an action of contract in which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages for an alleged breach by the defendant of certain covenants contained in a written lease between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>parties, for a term to begin on October 21, 1901, and bearing that date but in fact executed on March 8, 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\">The first point to be determined is the date to which the words \u201cas the same now are\u201d in that part of the covenant which requires the lessee to deliver up the premises at the end of the term in \u201cas good order and condition ... as the same now are,\u201d refer, that is, whether they refer to the time when they were in fact used on March 8, 1902, after changes and alterations had been made, or refer to the date named in the lease which is also the beginning of the term, October 21, 1901, before the alterations and changes were made. It is familiar law that, when parties have put their contract in writing, all previous or contemporary oral negotiations are merged in the written instrument, which conclusively is presumed to express the bargain made. This is not only a rule of evidence, but is founded upon the substantive rights of the parties. If the terms of the agreement are ambiguous, or the sense of a word employed is obscure, oral evidence is admissible to show all the circumstances attending the transaction in order that the writing may be interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties at the time it was made. But, where there is no uncertainty about the instrument, oral evidence is not admissible. <em>Butterick Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>203 Mass. 122, 133. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Puffer, </em>203 Mass. 534. <em>Rochester Tumbler Works v. Mitchell Woodbury Co. </em>215 Mass. 194, 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Construing the lease in the case at bar according to the terms used, it does not appear to be uncertain or open to doubt. When the date of a lease and the beginning of its term are the same there is no room for construction as to the meaning of words expressing present time. The word \"now\u201d as matter of construction must refer to the date of the instrument and the beginning of the lease unless a mistake is apparent on the face of the papers, which is not the case here. \u201cNow\u201d has sometimes been held to mean the beginning of the term, when that is different from the date of the lease. <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>116 Mass. 155. <em>White </em>v. <em>Nicholson, </em>4 Man. &amp; G. 95. <em>Chesapeake Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>107 Md. 485. These cases do not control the case at bar, but tend to confirm the conclusion here reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">A further question turns on the meaning of the words \u201c as good order and condition\u201d in the covenants by the lessee, \u201cTo quit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>deliver up the premises to the lessor ... at the end of the term, in as good order and condition, reasonable use and wearing thereof, fire and other unavoidable casualties excepted, as the same now are.\u201d These words in leases have acquired no inflexible significance. They have not become words of property with a fixed and technical definition. They are to be interpreted as words used in written instruments commonly are interpreted in accordance with general usage and understanding. They seem to be reasonably plain. They impose on the lessee the obligation to make whatever repairs may be necessary in order that at the end of the term the estate may conform to the standard at the time fixed in the lease. <em>Jaques </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>4 Cush. 384, 388. The covenant, however, is only to deliver the premises in \u201cas good order and condition as\u201d at the beginning of the lease. This involves a comparison with the standard established by the lease. It does not require that they be delivered in \u201cthe same shape and condition\u201d as in <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>196 Penn. St. 337, nor in a \u201clike condition\u201d as in <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Moross, </em>27 Mich. 203, nor in the \u201csame state\u201d as in <em>White </em>v. <em>Nicholson, </em>4 Man. &amp; G. 95. The signification of the difference between these and such like phrases substantially prohibiting any change in the condition of the premises, and the words in the present covenant, may be measured by reference to the further stipulation by the lessee that he will not \u201cmake or suffer to be made any alteration therein, but with the approbation of the lessor thereto, in writing . . . first obtained.\u201d This clause indicates a purpose in the minds of the parties that if both agree the lessee may make alterations. \u201cAlteration\u201d as applied to a building usually denotes a change or substitution in a substantial particular. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>211 Mass. 296. The repair and alteration clauses construed together manifest an intent that the building at the expiration of the term shall be returned to the lessor in a state of repair as good as it was in at the beginning as to both its original construction and also such changed state as it may be transformed into in accordance with the express terms of the lease. But it does not mean that alterations so made must be eliminated and the initial condition restored. E that had been in the minds of the parties, words indicating identity with the former condition and not comparative excellence would have been employed. <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>135 Iowa, 320, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>323. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>J. L. Mott Iron Works, </em>207 Mass. 501; <em>Pfister &amp; Vogel Co. </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick Shoe Co. </em>197 Mass. 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\">There is nothing in <em>Watriss </em>v. <em>First National Bank of Cambridge, </em>124 Mass. 571, 576, inconsistent with this view. Although the same words occurred in the covenant in the lease under consideration in that case as in the one at bar, no such issue was involved as is presented here and the description of the covenant at page 576 as being one to deliver up the premises \u201cin the same condition\u201d was by \"way of reference and not of analysis or definition. A chance phrase used for one purpose in illustration or in the course of a chain of reasoning cannot be wrested out of its context and seized upon as stating a fundamental proposition of general application. See <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Leathem, </em>[1901] A. C. 495, 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The defendant made alterations in the building and changes in the position and arrangement of machinery. It was found by the auditor that these were made with the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff who waived the provision of the lease that no alterations should be made but with his approbation first obtained in writing. Under these circumstances the lease does not require of the lessee a restoration to the original condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The plaintiff had a right to demand under this covenant in the lease that the tenant leave the premises, as they have been altered during the term with his knowledge and consent, in as good order and condition (with the exceptions stated)' as they were in at the beginning of the term. This is the extent of his right'. He cannot require that they be restored to their original condition so far as they have been altered or changed with his consent during the term. The defendant\u2019s requests for rulings numbered 6 and 7 should have been given in substance. As this was not the rule of law adopted at the trial, the exceptions upon this point must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">If it should be found that there was a breach of the covenant as thus construed, the measure of damages would be such a sum of money as at the end of the term would put the premises in the condition in which the tenant was bound to leave them. <em>Watriss </em>v. <em>First National Bank of Cambridge, </em>130 Mass. 343. <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>Marx, </em>191 N. Y. 81, 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The defendant is not entitled to the deduction of $50 from the amouut of rent due under the first and fifth counts of the declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>tian, being the proportional part of the rental for the period during which the premises were unfit for use by reason of the fire. The parties settled this matter by agreement indorsed upon the lease, whereby a concession was to be allowed to the tenant upon, completing the terms of the purchase, which concession included \u201call loss sustained by said Jean under the within agreement in consequence of said fire.\u201d These are comprehensive words and cover all the damage sustained by the tenant in this respect. If he was willing to make an agreement which plainly limited his right in this respect to an allowance upon the purchase price, he cannot now seek to have it changed because the purchase has not been made. <em>Gaston </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>208 Mass. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
