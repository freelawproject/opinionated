Writ dated October 21, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-10\">In the Superior Court the case was heard without a jury by <em>Jenney, </em>J. It was agreed at the trial that at the date of the plaintiff\u2019s writ the defendant owed the plaintiff the amount claimed in the declaration; that the defendant previously had been adjudicated a bankrupt; that the plaintiff had proved this claim before the referee in bankruptcy, by whom it had been allowed; that no dividend was paid by the bankrupt\u2019s estate, and that the bankrupt was refused a discharge by the United States District Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-11\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that all the claims and demands sought to be recovered in this suit became merged in a judgment of the United States District Court by their proof and allowance against the estate in bankruptcy of the defendant, that there could be no recovery under the declaration- in this action, and that upon the evidence the finding must be for the defendant under the pleadings. The rulings were refused. The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $642.42; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-12\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-13\"><em>J.
