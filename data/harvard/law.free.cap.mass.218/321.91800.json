Thereafter, seven wells were driven on this land and water was pumped from these wells into a standpipe and the service pipes of the town, which had been constructed and laid under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">As we understand the report, it was admitted that the petitioner was the owner of a mill pond which was fed by the water of Ten Mile River and by waters which fed that river. On the nineteenth day of August, 1910, he brought a petition for damage caused to this min pond by the pumping of water from the seven driven wells mentioned above, and at the trial he offered to prove \"that the water in the defendant\u2019s well [wells] came by percolation from the Ten Mile River, above the dam of the petitioner and from water intercepted by said wells, which would otherwise have flowed into the said Ten Mile River and into the petitioner\u2019s mill pond above said dam; and that he had suffered material damage to his property thereby.\u201d The presiding judge, being of the opinion that the petitioner could not maintain his petition, directed a verdict for the defendant and reported the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The defense set up in this case is: \u201cThat no certificate of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>taking of said land was ever filed in the Registry of Deeds for the comity of Norfolk, and that no certificate of the taking of any water or water rights of the petitioner was ever so filed\u201d as required by \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We are of opinion that the petitioner is entitled to maintain his petition on the principle of <em>Cowdrey </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>136 Mass. 409, and also on the principle of <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>172 Mass. 180, <em>Penney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>173 Mass. 507, and <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>189 Mass. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The doctrine of <em>Cowdrey </em>v. <em>Woburn, ubi supra, </em>is that where a person has done an act which can be justified only on the assumption that he has taken the property of another, the owner of the property can proceed against that person on the ground that the property has been taken, and that it does not lie in the mouth of that person to set up in defense that he has not done the formal act which the Legislature required him to do if he took the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In the case at bar the defendant town did not have the rights of an owner with respect to percolating waters within the six acres which it obtained by deed. <em>Cowdrey </em>v. <em>Woburn, ubi supra. Hittinger Fruit Co. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, ante, </em>220.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The second principle on which the petitioner is entitled to recover in this action is that St. 1908, c. 404, under which the respondent acted is a statute which gives compensation to persons who are in fact damaged by \"anything done . . . under authority of this act,\u201d whether their property is taken or not, as was decided in <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, Penney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>and <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Fall River, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">It is not necessary to consider with particularity the question \u2022 when in the case at bar the two years began to run within which petition for damages must be brought. The wells here* in question were driven after August 22, 1908, and the petition was brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>on August 19, 1910. The driving of test wells in July or the first of August, 1908, being for temporary purposes, was not a taking. <em>Gloucester Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>179 Mass. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In accordance with the terms of the report the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\n<em>Verdial set aside; new trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\"> \u201cSection 3. Said town shall, within ninety days after the taking of any lands, rights of way, water rights, water sources or easements as aforesaid, otherwise than by purchase, file and cause to be recorded in the registry of deeds for the county and district within which such land or other property is situated, a description thereof sufficiently accurate for identification, with a statement of the purpose for which the same were taken, signed by the water commissioners hereinafter provided for.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
