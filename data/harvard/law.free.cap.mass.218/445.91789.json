L. c. 135, \u00a7 1, which requires that a will should be attested \u201cby three or more competent witnesses,\u201d if an instrument presented for proof as a will contains a bequest of $300 to a church on the condition that it be \u201capplied to the reduction of the present mortgage on the property of said church,\u201d a person who is one of the guarantors of the mortgage note given by the church is not a competent witness to the will, although the amount due on the note is small and is exceeded greatly by the value of the mortgaged property.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-13\">Appeal from a decree of the Probate Court for the County of Essex allowing a certain instrument as the last will of Charles Rodrick, late of Swampscott.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-14\">The appeal was heard by <em>Be Courcy, </em>J. The justice found that the instrument presented for proof was executed by Rodrick as his last will on August 7, 1912, in the presence of three attesting witnesses, Albert H. Barrows, Loring Grimes, and Frank O. Ellis, that they signed in his presence, that he was of sound and disposing mind and memory and that the execution of the will was not procured by undue influence. The justice found also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the facts which are stated in the opinion. He ruled that by guaranteeing the mortgage note of the Chapel Congregation of the Church of Christ of Swampscott there described Ellis was not rendered incompetent to act as a witness to the will. Accordingly he ordered that a decree be entered allowing the instrument in question as the last will of Charles Rodrick, and remanding the case to the Probate Court for further proceedings. At the request of the parties, the justice reported the case for determination by the full court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-6\"><em>E.

The note was a promise to pay a certain sum \u201cin one year from date,\u201d and interest so long as any part of the principal should remain unpaid. As to interest at least, it was a continuing promise. The guaranty was as broad as the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>It is urged, however, by the petitioner that since the mortgaged estate was worth much more than the amount due on the note Ellis was not interested in its payment. But the holder could look solely to the note, nevertheless, and collect of the guarantors without reference to the value of the estate. The liability of the guarantors remained the same. It is also urged by the petitioner that the guarantors had a perfect defense in the statute of limitations. But this position is untenable. The guarantors are liable to pay the interest which may arise in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">It is plain, therefore, that at the time of the execution of the will Ellis had a direct pecuniary interest in the subject matter of this bequest. This interest was small, but as was said by Wilde, J., in <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>9 Pick. 350, 356, \u201csuch an interest, however minute, will disqualify a witness.\u201d See also the authorities cited in 3 Dane Abr. c. 90, art. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Although many changes have been made by our statutes in the rules of the common law as to the competency of witnesses, no statute has been passed which allows a person having a direct, private, pecuniary interest in a legacy such as Ellis here had, to be a competent witness to the execution of a will. See, as bearing generally upon this branch of our law, in addition to the authorities hereinbefore cited, Sts. 1783, c. 24; 1792, c. 32; Rev. Sts. c. 94, \u00a7 54; St. 1852, c. 312, \u00a7 60; and the subsequent codifying statutes, including R. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a720, 21; <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>9 Pick. 350; <em>Haven </em>v. <em>Hilliard, </em>23 Pick. 10, and cases there cited; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>106 Mass. 474; <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>182 Mass. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">It follows that the ruling that Ellis was a competent witness was erroneous. It becomes unnecessary to consider the other questions raised by the report. The decree admitting the will to probate should be reversed, and the case remanded to the Probate Court; and it is -</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
