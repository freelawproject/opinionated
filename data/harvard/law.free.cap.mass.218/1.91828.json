The Industrial Accident Board upon an agreed statement of facts found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-4\">Emily Sundine, the employee, in the employ of one Olsen named below, was injured on November 29, 1912, while coming down a flight of stairs leading from the third floor to the second floor of the building numbered 376 on Washington Street in Boston. She was coming from the workroom of F. L. Dunne and Company on the fourth floor of the building at about noon. At the time of the accident she was on her way out to luncheon and was descending to the street, accompanied by another woman. She felTfrom the secondlFtLird step from the top of the flight of stairs to the bottom and sprained her right ankle. The stairs were of wood and the treads of the stairs were somewhat worn. There was no artificial light for these stairs and the upper part of the flight was dark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">This was the only flight of stairs by which the employee could reach or leave the workroom;* there was no elevator for her to uSe7=at\u00f3\"itawasTecSsaryTOT^h\u00e9FTo==uH\"tInsTEgEFFf-stairs in going to ancT from her work!

L. Dunne and Company on the day of the accident were the lessees of the workroom in which the employee worked on the fourth floor, being sublessees from A. H. Howe and Sons, who were the lessees of the whole building. The workroom was used exclusively for making clothing for F. L. Dunne and Company, who were tailors and let out their work to different men who were paid a stipulated price per garment, F. L. Dunne and Company furnishing the goods. One of the men who made clothing for F. L. Dunne and Company in this room was Olsen, and Olsen paid the employee her weekly wages of $12 a week for assisting him in making clothing for F. L. Dunne and. Company. F. L. Dunne and Company were covered by insurance under the workmen\u2019s compensation act by the London Guarantee and Accident Company, Limited. Olsen was not covered by insurance under the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-8\">The employee was out of work from November 29, 1912, to February 24, 1913, which was the earliest date at which she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>able to go to work. The attending physician\u2019s bill for the first two weeks\u2019 services was $24.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">The decision of the board was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">\u201cWe find that it was a necessary incident of her employment to use the flight of stairs upon which she was when she was injured andj tEerefore, rule that the injury arose out of and in the coiirse of her employment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">\u201cIt also appears from the statement of facts that Olsen, for whom the employee was working, was a contractor for F. L. Dunne and Company within the meaning of Part III, \u00a7 17, of the workmen\u2019s compensation act, and we rule that she is entitled to compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-8\">\u201cIt was agreed that her average weekly wages were $12. We, therefore, find that she is entitled to compensation at the rate of $6 a week from the fifteenth day after her injury, to wit, from December 13, 1912, to the 23rd day of February, 1913, inclusive, amounting in all to sixty-two dollars and fifty-seven cents, together with her physician\u2019s bill for medical services for the first two weeks after the injury, which it was agreed was $24, amounting in all to $86.57.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-9\">The judge made a decree in accordance with the decision of the Industrial Accident Board, ordering that the insurer should pay to the employee the total amount of $86.57. The insurer appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-10\"><em>IT. iS.

By the word \u201cassociation\u201d is meant the Massachusetts Employees\u2019 Insurance Association, Part V, \u00a7 2, of the sa\u00edne act; and this insurance company is under the same liability that the association would have been. St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 17. It follows that the petitioner has the same rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>against this insurance company as if it had directly insured her employer Olsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\">The insurer does not deny this, but it contends that the petitioner\u2019s injury did not arise \u201cout of and in the course of\u201d her employment within the meaning of Part II, \u00a7 1, of the act first referred to. This is because she was injured at about noon, after she had left the room in which she worked for the purpose of getting a lunch, and upon a flight of stairs which, though affording the only means of going to and from her workroom, was yet not under the control either of Olsen, her employer, or of F. L. Dunne and Company, for whose work Olsen was an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The first contention, that she was not in the employ of Olsen while she was going to lunch, cannot be sustained. Her employment was by the week. It would be too narrow a construction of the contract to say that it was suspended when she went out for this merely temporary purpose and was revived only upon her return to the workroom. It was an incident of her employment to go out for this purpose. <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Columbian Fire Proofing Co. </em>182 Mass. 93, 102. The decisions upon similar questions under the English act are to the same effect. <em>Blovelt </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>[1904] 1 K. B. 271, which went on the ground that the dinner hour, though not paid for, was yet included in the time of employment. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Manchester Liners, </em>3 B. W. C. C. 527, where the House of Lords reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal, reported in [1909] 1 K. B. 417, and held, following the dissenting opinion of Moulton, L. J., that a temporary absence by permission, though apparently of longer duration than would have been likely in the case before us, did not suspend the employment, and that an injury occurring during such a temporary absence arose \u201cout of and in the course of\u201d the employment. <em>Gane </em>v. <em>Norton Hill Colliery Co. 2 </em>B. W. C. C. 42, and [1909] 2 K. B. 539. <em>Keenan </em>v. <em>Flemington Coal Co. </em>40 Sc. L. R. 144. <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>Coltness Iron Co. </em>41 Sc. L. R. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Nor do we regard it as decisive against the petitioner that she was injured while upon stairs of which neither Olsen nor.F. ,L. Dunne\" and~Company had control, though they and their employeesThad the right to use them. These stairs~were the only~ means available for going to aHcTfrom the premises where she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>was employed, the means which she practically was invited by OIsen andljy^.LJ^imne and'Company to use. In this^respecf/tEe case resembles <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Manchester Liners, ubi supra; </em>and that case, decided under the English act before the passage of our statute, must be regarded as of great weight. <em>McNicol\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 497, 499. It is true that before the passage of St. 1911, c. 751, the petitioner could not have held her employer for this injury. <em>Hawkes </em>v. <em>Broadwalk Shoe Co. </em>207 Mass. 117. But that now is not a circumstance of much importance; for one of the purposes of our recent legislation was to increase the right of employees to be compensated for injuries growing out of their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">It was a necessary incident of the employee\u2019s employment to use these stairs. We are of opinion that according to the plain and natural meaning of the words an injury that occurred to her while she was so using them arose \u201cout of and in the course of\u201d her employment. The decree of the Superior Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
