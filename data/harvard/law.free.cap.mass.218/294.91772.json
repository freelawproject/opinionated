The testimony of the plaintiff, who could understand or talk little if any English, was as follows upon the issue of the slander alleged in the declaration: He had entered the defendant\u2019s store for the purpose of examining and purchasing goods. \u201cBefore I went two steps a hand grabbed me and I asked \u2018What is the matter?\u2019 He didn\u2019t give me no answer but called with the hand (indicating) to some other to come. I didn\u2019t understand what he said nor what language he spoke. He did not speak in Greek. There came a man to the men who were holding me and they were in conversation in English which I didn\u2019t understand. The Greek clerk (M\u00edralos) said to inc, \u2018This gentleman here accuse you that you steal a handkerchief and that you have it in your possession.\u2019 This is what the Greek salesman said to me. \u2018You have a handkerchief and have it in your possession, you steal it.\u2019 . . . There were fifty or sixty men around there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">The testimony of Joseph Carrier, a clerk of the defendant, on the same subject was as follows: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anybody else around there when I came to where he was excepting him. I asked him if he did n\u2019t want to pay for what he had taken. I got no reply from him and I sent for the young Greek clerk (M\u00edralos) and told him what I had seen. The Greek clerk talked Greek, which I could not understand. . . . Two women went by. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>When M\u00edralos came up I said to him, \u00a3I think he has taken a handkerchief from that box, will you speak to him?\u2019 And George (M\u00edralos) spoke to him. I called his attention that I thought the man (the plaintiff) had taken the handkerchief in these words: \u2018I think that man has taken a handkerchief, ask him about it.\u2019\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">The testimony of George Miralos, the Greek salesman, on the same subject was as follows: \u201cMr. Carrier called me and I came nearer and he say, \u2018Ask this man if he took any handkerchief from this box that he did not pay for?\u2019 I asked him if he took any handkerchief from this box and he say \u2018Search me.\u2019 . . . Mr. Joe Carrier told me all about it. I say, \u2018You know what he said? \u2019 Well, he say, \u2018Yes, he says I take a handkerchief,\u2019 and he opened his coat and he say \u2018Search me.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">At the conclusion of the evidence the plaintiff asked the judge to rule as follows: \u201cIf the salesman of the defendant (Carrier) acting in the belief that he was protecting the property of his employer, falsely and publicly accused the plaintiff of theft, in any words conveying that plain meaning, his act was that of his employer and makes the employer liable for all injuries to the plaintiff resulting naturally from his words.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">The judge refused to give the ruling asked for, ruled that there was no evidence for the jury on the third count, and submitted the case to the jury on the first two counts only. The jury found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-8\"><em>W. H. Bent, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-9\"><em>F. N. Wier, </em>(J. <em>M. O\u2019Donoghue </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-10\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ape\">We do not find it necessary to decide whether the two statements relied on by the plaintiff could have been found to be accusations of larceny. If it be assumed that such a finding could have been made, the judge was right in directing the jury to find a verdict for the defendant because there was no evidence of publication of either of them. See <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>112 Mass. 237; <em>Rumney </em>v. <em>Worthley, </em>186 Mass. 144. There was no evidence that anybody but the plaintiff was present when Carrier spoke to the plaintiff in English. There was no publication of this statement made in English, because on the evidence the words could not have been heard by any one but the plaintiff. <em>Sheffill </em>v. <em>Van Deusen, </em>13 Gray, 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Nor was there any evidence of publication of the Greek words spoken by M\u00edralos. For, although there was evidence that they were spoken in the presence of others, there was no evidence that any one could understand them but the plaintiff. <em>Sheffill </em>v. <em>Van Deusen, ubi supra, </em>at page 305, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Under these circumstances we do not have to consider the question whether Carrier and M\u00edralos could have been found to be acting within the scope of their employment by the defendant in making the two statements relied upon, as to which see <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Boston Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>200 Mass. 265, 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
