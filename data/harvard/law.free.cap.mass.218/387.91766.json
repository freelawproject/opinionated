Other allegations of the bill as amended were in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">The defendant corporation was organized in December, 1905, under R. L. cc. 78,123, \"with nine incorporators (six of whom were defendants) for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a cemetery. Immediately after organization it was capitalized at $50,000, divided into five hundred shares of the par value of $100. Two hundred and fifty-one of the shares were sold at par and the proceeds, $25,000, were paid into the corporation treasury. The plaintiffs own a majority of the two hundred and fifty-one shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">After such two hundred and fifty-one shares were issued and sold, the defendants, without the knowledge or consent of the association or of its stockholders or of the plaintiffs, and without any just reason or lawful authority, issued and gave to each of the officers and incorporators ten shares out of the remaining unissued capital stock of the association, ninety shares in all. The defendants received and at the time of the filing of the bill held sixty of the ninety shares, which gave to them the majority nf the issued and outstanding capital stock of the association. They had received several dividends and had voted upon such shares. Such shires were issued \u201cin order that said officers would have, and thereby they have had and do now have, the complete control and management of said association, and in order that they could manage, and thereby they have managed and do now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>manage its business and affairs for their own personal benefit, and not for the benefit of said association.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-3\">The defendants, \u201cever since the organization of the association, have acted, and are now acting, under certain alleged by-laws that provide, in substance and in effect, that the entire government and control and management of said association shall be vested in said officers and in successors to be selected by them, and that said officers shall be elected by and from said officers and incorporators, and that any vacancy shall be filled by the remaining officers, and that the stockholders of said association and your petitioners are not eligible to hold any office or to vote at any meeting or at any election of officers; that said by-laws were intended by said officers to perpetuate them, and do perpetuate them, and their successors to be selected by them, in the control and management of said association, by usurping the powers of said association and its stockholders and denying the rights to said stockholders and your petitioners which are guaranteed by the laws of said commonwealth; that said by-laws were never submitted to or approved or adopted by said association or by its stockholders or at any meeting of said officers or incorporators.\u201d The defendants had excluded the plaintiffs from any participation in the business affairs of the corporation, and they refused to make any report or give any information about the association to any of the stockholders, except the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-4\">\u201cGreat sums of money, approximating $100,000, have been received and paid out by the defendants, ... a large part of which is the money paid into the association by the plaintiffs. Without any lawful authority the defendants have paid, and are now paying, to themselves and to others, excessive compensation and fees for alleged services and expenses, and as gratuities for which no service was rendered, or being rendered, or expense incurred.\u201d The defendants \u201care conducting the association for their own personal and private gain and profit in a way that will bring scandal upon said association.\u201d The plaintiffs alleged that they could not give further specifications \u201cfor the reason that said officers refuse to make any report on the transactions, or to account therefor, except to themselves, and they refuse to answer questions, or to allow their books of account to be examined by your petitioners.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>On March 19, 1913, St. 1913, c. 292, was enacted.

L. c. 78, \u00a7 1, and c. 123, for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a cemetery, the incorporators had no authority to create a capital stock of $50,000 divided into five hundred shares with a fixed par value of $100 each, and to issue certificates for two hundred and fifty-one shares to themselves and to the plaintiffs, who by purchase are averred to have become and now are the holders of a majority of the shares thus issued. R. L. c. 78, \u00a7 7. <em>Monumoi Great Beach </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>1 Mass. 159, 163, 165. <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>Boston Catholic Cemetery Association, </em>146 Mass. 163, 166. <em>Packard </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>168 Mass. 92. But \u00a7 2 of c. 78 provides, that such corporations shall be subject to the provisions of R. L. c. 109. By \u00a7 3 of this chapter, which is a re-enactment of Rev. Sts. c. 44, \u00a7 23, Gen. Sts. c. 68, \u00a7 41, Pub. Sts. c. 105, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, \u201cAll corporations which are organized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>under general laws shall be subject to such laws as may be hereafter passed affecting or altering their corporate rights or duties or dissolving them.\u201d It was doubtless under this reserved power that upon the partly diverse petitions of the plaintiffs and the defendants the Legislature enacted the St. of 1913, c. 292, which provides, that, \u201cThe by-laws of the Italian Catholic Cemetery Association, a corporation duly established in the year nineteen hundred and five under the general laws and situated in the city of Boston, and the acts of said corporation in voting to issue and in issuing shares of capital stock and fixing the par value and the rights of stockholders thereof, are hereby confirmed and made valid to the same extent as if at that time the said corporation had authority to issue said stock and to fix the par value thereof and to adopt by-laws.\u201d The corporation having been organized while the R. L. c. 109, \u00a7 3, were in force, it is subject to those provisions, and is bound by any reasonable amendment and alteration which the Legislature might impose. <em>Roxbury </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence Railroad, </em>6 Cush. 424, 432. And in <em>Commissioners on Inland Fisheries </em>v. <em>Holyoke Water Power Co. </em>104 Mass. 446, 451, where the Gen. Sts. c. 68, \u00a7 41, were considered, it was said, \u201cThis statute, first introduced into the general legislation of the Commonwealth by St. 1830, c. 81, . . . has been as much a part of all charters since granted as if inserted therein; and was manifestly adopted with the intention of reserving for the future a fuller parliamentary or legislative power than would otherwise be consistent with the effect to be allowed to the special terms of particular charters, under the judicial construction of the constitutional prohibition against impairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d It is then said, that while it is unnecessary to define the extreme limits of the power, \u201cit at least reserves to the Legislature the authority to make any alteration or amendment in a charter granted subject to it, that will not defeat or substantially impair the object of the grant, or any rights which have vested under it, and that the Legislature may deem necessary to secure either that object or other public or private rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">The act manifestly on the face of the bill occasions no breach of contract or impairment of lawfully vested rights of property. <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Old Colony &amp; Fall River Railroad, </em>5 Allen, 230, 241, 242, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>243. <em>Agricultural Branch Railroad </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>13 Allen, 29, 33. <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Marginal Freight Railway, </em>123 Mass. 32, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The purposes for which the association was incorporated are fully-preserved. Its title to the cemetery lands and their management is untouched. The plaintiffs and other purchasers of stock are given their just rights by membership in the corporation where under the averments of the bill the defendants before enactment of the statute had solicited and obtained funds, not as gifts but as investments, under conditions or representations which were unauthorized. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>201 Mass. 301. And any discussion as to the rights of the plaintiffs against the corporation or the individual defendants independently of the St. of 1913, c. 292, is unnecessary. See <em>Ginn </em>v. <em>Almy, </em>212 Mass. 486, 505, 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The demurrer, of course, admits every essential allegation of the bill. It appears that the defendants have purchased land and established a cemetery wherein interments have been made, and, the statute being constitutional, the plaintiffs as stockholders are entitled under the allegations of the bill to an accounting for the stock which the defendants issued to themselves as a gratuity, and for the dividends declared and paid thereon, as well as for the moneys they have received and disbursed in the management of the association for which they have refused to account, and the fees and compensation paid to themselves, alleged to have been far in excess of any reasonable emolument or rightful demands. <em>Von Arnim </em>v. <em>American Tube Works, </em>188 Mass. 515, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The bill also asks for the abrogation of the by-law alleged to have been devised by the individual defendants to perpetuate in office themselves, or those whom they might choose to fill vacancies, and that a meeting of the stockholders may be ordered. The enabling statute recognized this by-law as if it had been passed by the stockholders, but, having placed the association upon a basis with corporations organized with a fixed capital divided into transferable shares represented by certificates, the plaintiffs are entitled to attend and vote at corporate meetings held for the election of officers, with the right to participate in dividends and profits. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Essex Bank, </em>5 Gray, 373, 378. The corporation is not insolvent, and the act in question is not a scheme to secure primarily the payment of creditors to which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>until accomplished, the rights of stockholders properly may be subordinated as in <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Eastern Railroad, </em>138 Mass. 122, 126, relied on by the defendants. It is furthermore apparent that our laws relating to the ownership of stock are applicable. R. L. c. 109, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 39. <em>Boston Music Hall Association </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>129 Mass. 435, 436. If the defendants refuse to call a meeting for the choice of officers and the adoption of by-laws adapted to the reorganized association, no longer composed of the original incorporators or their successors, but of stockholders, the appropriate remedy is mandamus. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners, </em>188 Mass. 338, 340. <em>Saltman </em>v. <em>Nesson, </em>201 Mass. 534. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Atwater, </em>65 Conn. 355. <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>72 N. Y. 433. It is for a majority of the lawful stockholders present at the meeting to decide under R. L. c. 109, \u00a7 5; c. 123, \u00a7 7, what the by-laws of the corporation shall be, subject, however, under c. 78, \u00a7 9, to the approval of the State board of health of any by-law which relates to the reception and cremation of the bodies of the dead, and the disposition of the ashes thereof. And until it is manifest that no change can be effected through appropriate corporate action, there is no occasion to determine whether the present by-law is so unreasonable and oppressive as to be invalid. See <em>Saltman </em>v. <em>Nesson, </em>201 Mass. 534, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">The demurrer, however, being a single demurrer to the whole bill, must be overruled. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>15 Gray, 184. <em>York </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>116 Mass. 482. 1 Danl. Ch. Pl. &amp; Pr. (5th Am. ed.) 597. <em>Emans </em>v. <em>Emans, </em>1 McCarter, 114. If injunctive relief is also necessary to protect the plaintiffs\u2019 property rights from further impairment until the account is stated, and the title to the stock alleged to have been fraudulently issued is determined, application may be made to a single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">By the terms of the reservation the case is to stand for hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
