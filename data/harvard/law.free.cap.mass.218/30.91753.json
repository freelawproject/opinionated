W. Silsbee, Tr.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-21\">The note sued upon in the second case was identical in form and language with the one printed above, except that the time of payment was \u201cNovember 15th after date\u201d and the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>was $5,000. The words \u201cas per terms of contract\u201d in both notes were in the defendant\u2019s handwriting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-3\">The defendant set up and relied upon the defense that at the time the note was indorsed and delivered to the plaintiff by the Pleasant River Lumber Company, that company had made with the defendant an agreement in writing dated March 15, 1910, by which it agreed to deliver to the defendant a certain large amount of lumber, that it failed to deliver the lumber as agreed and on October 18, 1910, was adjudicated a bankrupt, and that the notes were not negotiable but were made conditional on the performance of the contract by the words \u201cas per terms of contract,\u201d which the defendant testified were written by him on both of the notes at the time they were made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-4\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to rule that the notes were not negotiable and that judgment should be ordered for the defendant. The judge refused to make these and other rulings requested by the defendant, and ruled, as requested by the plaintiff, that the defendant\u2019s liability was to be determined under the provisions of the negotiable instruments act, R. L. c. 73, \u00a7\u00a7 18 <em>et seq., </em>that the plaintiff was a \u201cholder in due course\u201d within the meaning of that phrase as used in the act, that the notes were negotiable instruments as defined in the act, containing an unconditional promise to pay a sum certain in money at a fixed future time, that the words \u201c as per terms of contract\u201d did not relate to the promise to pay, but either related to the consideration or constituted a statement of the transaction which gave rise to the instruments, and therefore did not render the notes non-negotiable. The judge further ruled that upon all the evidence the plaintiff was entitled to recover the amounts of both the notes with interest from the dates of their maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">In accordance with these rulings the judge found for the plaintiff in each of the cases, and at the request of the parties reported the cases for determination by this court, it being agreed, that if the notes in suit were held to be negotiable instruments, or in case they should be held to be non-negotiable instruments but that the defense of breach of contract was not available to the defendant, judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for the several amounts of the notes with interest from the maturity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>each and costs, and that, if the notes were held to be non-negotiable instruments and the defense of breach of contract was available to the defendant, the cases should be recommited to the Superior Court for such action as was just and proper.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-3\"><em>A. Sanford, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-4\"><em>W. M. StocJcbridge, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-5\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">We assume, as the counsel for the respective parties have assumed at the argument and in their briefs, that the promissory notes in suit were delivered to the payee in this Commonwealth and are governed by our negotiable instruments act found in the R. L. c. 73. <em>Nashua Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Sayles, </em>184 Mass. 520, 522. <em>American Malting Co. </em>v. <em>Souther Brewing Co. </em>194 Mass. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">The plaintiff bank is the indorsee, and the presiding judge was warranted upon the evidence in finding, that it is a holder in due course unless the words \u201cas per terms of contract\u201d written by the defendant on the face of each note after the words \u201cValue received\u201d make his promise as maker conditional upon the performance by the payee of the preceding contract between them appearing in the record for the sale and shipment of lumber. The defendant urges, that, the words having been placed upon the notes before delivery, the original parties must have intended to incorporate this contract, and that negotiability is lacking, because a sum certain is not payable at a time fixed in the future. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>127 Mass. 293. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 18, cl. 3. If the words had been, \u201csubject to the contract for lumber,\u201d or even \u201csubject to the contract,\u201d the principle inv'oked would have been applicable. The notes would not have been the defendant\u2019s unconditional promise to pay a definite sum. <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Mosely, </em>11 Gray, 170. <em>American Exchange Bank </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>7 Allen, 333. <em>Sloan </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>134 Mass. 245. But, while the defendant doubtless intended to guard against the payment of money for which in the future he did not receive an equivalent, and the payee has gone into bankruptcy, the language used does not affect the payment of the amounts shown by the notes. By their position, the words well might lead the plaintiff, who is not charged with actual notice, to understand that they were not to be disconnected and applied to an independent outstanding agreement by which the promise was to be modified or restricted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>but that they referred solely to the consideration for which the notes were given. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 69. We are unable consequently to. distinguish the case at bar from <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>109 Mass. 36, where the phrase relied on to destroy negotiability was, \u201cfor value received. On policy No. 33,386.\u201d It was said by Chief Justice Chapman in delivering the opinion of the court: \u201cThe words ... do not express any contingency as to the payment of the notes, or refer to any fund out of which they are to be paid, but appear to refer to the consideration for which they were given. Such a reference may be for mere convenience, or for any other reason, but it cannot be interpreted as a modification of the promise.\u201d See also <em>Chicago Railway Equipment Co. </em>v. <em>Merchants\u2019 National Bank, </em>136 U. S. 268, 283, 285; <em>Jury </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>El., Bl. &amp; El. 459. By the terms of the report judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff for the amount of each note with interest from maturity and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
