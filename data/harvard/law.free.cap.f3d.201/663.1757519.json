JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">Mark Eric Wright (\u2018Wright\u201d), Texas prisoner # 635367, appeals the district court\u2019s final judgment dismissing his civil rights action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Gayle Hollingsworth (\u201cHollingsworth\u201d) and Sara Thompson (\u201cThompson\u201d). We are constrained to vacate and remand the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wright\u2019s claim against Hollingsworth for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies; but we encourage the Fifth Circuit to reconsider <em>Whitley v. Hunt, </em>158 F.3d 882 (5th Cir.1998), <em>en banc </em>in order to reconcile this circuit\u2019s interpretation of the exhaustion requirement of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1997e with the explicit language and policy of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), which amended \u00a7 1997e. The Attorney General of Texas, representing Hollingsworth, has provoked consideration of this important question. General Cornyn points out that because <em>Whitley </em>was an appeal from the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal, the state was not a party or represented in that case and had no opportunity to urge that the PLRA be construed to maximize the effectiveness of the state\u2019s prison grievance procedures. Because the proper handling of thousands of inmate grievances annually is of vital interest to both the states and the federal courts, and there are strong arguments that <em>Whitley </em>may have misinterpreted the PLRA, <em>en banc </em>reconsideration should be undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">While in prison in 1997, Wright\u2019s eardrum was ruptured during an altercation with another inmate. Wright sought medical treatment at the prison infirmary. Wright alleges that Hollingsworth, a registered nurse working at the Telford Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (\u201cTDCJ\u201d), and Thompson, a clerk at the infirmary, refused to treat his ruptured eardrum. As a result, Wright sued Holl-ingsworth and Thompson under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. Wright\u2019s complaint sought only monetary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Hollingsworth and Thompson both moved for summary judgment. The district court granted Thompson\u2019s motion for summary judgment but denied Hollings-worth\u2019s motion. Hollingsworth then filed a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Since Wright admitted that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, the magistrate judge recommended that Hollingsworth\u2019s motion to dismiss be granted and that Wright\u2019s suit be dismissed as frivolous. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation over Wright\u2019s objections and entered final judgment, dismissing the suit as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. Wright timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A_o\">A. Wright\u2019s appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">As amended by the PLRA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 1997e(a) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1997e(a) (West Supp.1999). Since Wright filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint after the effective date of the PLRA, amended \u00a7 1997e applies to his complaint. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 293 (5th Cir.1998), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 119 S.Ct. 1809, 143 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Relying on <em>Underwood, </em>the district court interpreted amended \u00a7 1997e(a) to require that an inmate completely exhaust all administrative remedies before filing an action in federal court. The district court dismissed Wright s claim against Hollings-worth for failure to exhaust. On appeal, Wright argues that he had no administrative remedy to exhaust because the TDCJ grievance procedure does not permit an award of monetary damages, the only type of relief he sought. Whether or not Wright's claim was correctly dismissed depends on the interpretation of the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">Before the enactment of the PLRA, this court held that \u00a7 1997e does not require a state prisoner seeking only monetary damages to exhaust all administrative remedies if the prison grievance system does not afford a monetary remedy. <em>Marsh v. Jones, </em>53 F.3d 707, 710 (5th Cir.1995). Although the PLRA amended \u00a7 1997e in several significant ways, this court has held that the PLRA did not change the holding in <em>Marsh. See Whitley, </em>158 F.3d at 887. Whereas an inmate seeking monetary <em>and </em>injunctive relief must exhaust all administrative remedies given <em>Underwood, Whitley </em>holds that an inmate seeking only monetary relief is not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit if the prison grievance system does not authorize that type of relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-15\">Thus, since Wright\u2019s argument is supported by <em>Whitley, </em>the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Wright\u2019s claim as frivolous under \u00a7 1915. <em>See Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (a district court necessarily abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law); <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). This court must vacate and remand the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wright\u2019s claim against Hollingsworth for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>B. Request for <em>en bane </em>hearing to reconsider <em>Whitley</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Although bound by <em>Whitley, </em>this panel urges the Fifth Circuit to reconsider <em>Whitley en banc </em>and to consider adopting the Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 1997e(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An <em>en banc </em>hearing is appropriate only if \u201c(1) <em>en banc </em>consideration is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the court\u2019s decisions; or (2) the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 35(a). A proceeding may involve a question of exceptional importance if \u201cit involves an issue on which [a] panel decision conflicts with the authoritative decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35(b)(1)(B). As noted, <em>Whitley </em>conflicts with the interpretation of amended \u00a7 1997e(a) given by three other circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Furthermore, determining the proper scope of the exhaustion requirement in \u00a7 1997e will significantly affect the docket of this court, in which over 40% of annual appeals derive from prisoner civil rights complaints, and the dockets of the district courts in this circuit in which thousands of prisoner suits are filed. The question of exhaustion is important to the State of Texas because administrative remedies may be more efficient at the outset than litigation to remedy complaints about prison conditions and because of the state\u2019s expressed willingness to promote administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Finally, without <em>en banc </em>reconsideration, the state of Texas will have been foreclosed from any opportunity to brief and argue the PLRA\u2019s approach to exhaustion of prison grievances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>En banc </em>consideration of <em>Whitley </em>is appropriate for this court\u2019s internal purposes, but it is the sole means to give the state of Texas a day in court on an issue of vital importance to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">The panel in <em>Whitley </em>did not have the benefit of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s subsequent, detailed analysis of the statutory changes to \u00a7 1997e occasioned by the PLRA or of two other circuit court decisions consistent with the Eleventh Circuit. Those cases advance strong arguments why requiring exhaustion of all administrative remedies (even if an inmate is seeking only monetary damages) is consistent with the changes made to the statutory language of \u00a7 1997e(a) by the PLRA, better implements the legislative purpose of the PLRA, and furthers the policies supporting exhaustion. The state should be permitted to make its case to this court. Its access depends on our granting <em>en banc </em>review of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Wright\u2019s claim as frivolous. While we also urge <em>en banc </em>reconsideration of our current interpretation of \u00a7 1997e of the PLRA, and encourage General Cornyn again to request <em>en banc </em>review, the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>against Hollingsworth is vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\">.

In his brief, Wright does not challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Thompson. As a result, Wright has waived his claim against Thompson on appeal, <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993) (issues not briefed on appeal are waived), and this court affirms the district court's granting summary judgment to Thompson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\">. <em>See Brown v.
