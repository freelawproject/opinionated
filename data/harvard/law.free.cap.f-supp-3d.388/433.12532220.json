C.S.A. \u00a7 8371 by denying Plaintiff its benefits and/or failing to pay for this loss. Defendant moves to dismiss these claims based on the suit limitation provision in the relevant policy, requiring that Plaintiff bring a legal action within two years of the date of loss, and based on the two-year statute of limitations for claims of bad faith under \u00a7 8371.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, on or about March 17, 2015, an ink cartridge refill machine used in Plaintiff's business was \"misappropriated.\" ECF No. 6 at \u00b6 11. Plaintiff alleges this machine was insured by Allstate Insurance Company (\"Allstate\" or \"Defendant\"), through a Commercial Property Insurance Policy [the \"Policy\"], which included \"coverage for theft of machinery and equipment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Plaintiff alleges that the Policy was \"in force at all times relevant hereto,\" but also that \"a full copy\" of the Policy \"was never given to [P]laintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Plaintiff alleges that the \"Policy [is] a contract of adhesion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that it \"discovered the misappropriation\" of the machine on April 6, 2017, when it saw the machine listed for sale on eBay by an entity unknown to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Plaintiff alleges that it never received any compensation for the sale of the machine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Plaintiff alleges that it \"reported the machine as stolen to the Pennsylvania State Police and filed a claim with defendant Allstate under the Policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Plaintiff does not allege the date that it filed a claim with Allstate nor the result of that claim.

Plaintiff alleges it gave \"prompt, timely and reasonable notice to [D]efendant of its losses and/or claim for loss of property and provided all required notices ... required by the applicable statute and laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant \"failed to promptly offer and/or pay any monies in satisfaction of the [P]laintiffs' claim for loss of property\" and \"failed to properly and promptly respond to\" Plaintiff's claim and \"has failed to make any adequate offers,\" which Plaintiff alleges are a \"breach of [D]efendant's duty, obligation, and/or agreement with [P]laintiff\" arising from the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bad Faith Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant was \"under a covenant and/or duty of good faith and fair dealing with the [P]laintiff regarding claims for loss or property benefits under the\" Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.

PARTIES' ARGUMENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant has moved to dismiss the breach of contract claim based on the two-year suit limitation provision in the Policy and the bad faith claim based on the two-year statute of limitations for claims under 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 8371. ECF No. 7-2 at 4. Defendant admits that, taking the facts of the Amended Complaint as true, the machine would be \"Covered Property\" under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Defendant argues, however, that the Policy also requires insureds to bring a legal action within two years of the date of loss:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. LEGAL ACTION AGAINST US\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   No one may bring a legal against us under this Coverage Part unless:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1.

Defendant argues that the provision limiting the insured's right to sue is enforceable under Pennsylvania law and constitutes an absolute bar to Plaintiff's claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Defendant further argues that Plaintiff's allegation that the loss was discovered on April 6, 2017 is \"insufficient to render Plaintiff's claim timely\" because this claim is unsupported by the pleadings and does not affect the contractual suit limitation set forth in the Policy, which runs from the date of loss and not the date of discovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant attaches to its Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Sworn Statement in Proof of Loss, which was signed on August 6, 2015. ECF No. 7-7. Defendant additionally attaches a letter from Allstate denying Plaintiff's claim for insurance on February 3, 2016. ECF No. 7-8. Defendant finally argues that the bad faith claim is subject to a two-year statute of limitations and is thus untimely, as the denial of coverage occurred in February 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff responds that Defendant cannot enforce the suit limitation in the Policy without a showing of prejudice, based on the holding in\n   <em>\n    Brakeman v.

Plaintiff claims that all cases cited by Defendant stating that prejudice is not necessary for enforcement of a suit limitation provision distinguish\n   <em>\n    Brakeman\n   </em>\n   based on a suit limitation provision for fire insurance policies mandated by the legislature and not by contract, including\n   <em>\n    Schreiber v.

Even if it were considered, Plaintiff argues that the letter was never communicated to the Plaintiff and thus discovery would be needed to establish \"the transmission of [the denial letter] and the date on which it was communicated to [P]laintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lastly, Plaintiff argues that its claim for breach of good faith and fair dealing is subject to a four-year limitations period because the common law bad faith claim sounds in contract, unlike the remedies provided under 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 8371 for bad faith, and thus would not be barred by the statute of limitations under \u00a7 8371.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its reply, Defendant argues that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals distinguished the\n   <em>\n    Brakeman\n   </em>\n   holding with respect to suit limitation provisions, holding that \"the\n   <em>\n    Brakeman\n   </em>\n   rule does not apply to limitation of suit clauses.\" ECF No. 11 at 2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hospital Support Services, Ltd. v.

Defendant further argues that the Court is permitted to consider Defendant's rejection of Plaintiff's insurance claim, because it is \"referenced repeatedly throughout Plaintiff's Amended Complaint,\" and \"Plaintiff cannot avoid the statute of limitations simply by not attaching this correspondence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff replies that \"the federal courts must apply state law to the matter at issue,\" and therefore the Court must apply the holding in\n   <em>\n    Brakeman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schreiber\n   </em>\n   and extend their holdings to contractual suit limitation provisions, instead of following the later-published Third Circuit decision in\n   <em>\n    Hospital Support Services\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   predicting the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's conclusion.
