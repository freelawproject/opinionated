BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This litigation arises from the death of Juan Humberto Martinez. According to the Plaintiffs' Amended Original Petition, the live pleading, Martinez sought medical treatment on April 19, 2016, for pain he experienced in his buttocks after he attempted to lift a heavy object at work. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1.) His pain was initially treated with Tylenol and muscle relaxers. When Martinez's pain did not improve, he was given intramuscular injections of the drug Toradol beginning on April 30, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Martinez developed a muscular abscess, infections, and sepsis, and suffered renal failure which resulted in his death on May 30, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following Martinez's death, the Plaintiffs, individually and as representatives of Martinez's estate, filed suit against the Defendants in the 293rd Judicial District Court of Maverick County, Texas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) The Plaintiffs assert a cause of action for negligence against the Defendants Lewis S. Christian, M.D., Denise V. Nemeth, P.A., Alejandro Maldonado, and their employer, South Texas Urgent Care Center of Eagle Pass, LLC d/b/a South Texas Urgent Care Center (\"South Texas Urgent Care\"), and further claim that South Texas Urgent Care bears vicarious liability for its employees' negligence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-56.) The Plaintiffs assert a negligence cause of action against the Defendants Patrick Schaner, M.D., Russell Jones, N.P., Gabriel Martinez, R.N., and their employer, Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center, L.P. d/b/a Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center (\"Fort Duncan\"), and further claim that Fort Duncan bears vicarious liability for its employees' negligence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-59.) The Court will refer to the aforementioned defendants collectively as the\n   \"Healthcare Defendants.\" Against the Defendants Pfizer, Inc., Hospira Inc., Hospira Worldwide, Inc., and Hospira Worldwide, LLC, collectively the \"Pharmaceutical Defendants,\" the Plaintiffs assert causes of action for: (1) negligence; (2) fraud and negligent misrepresentation; (3) negligence per se; (4) failure to update labeling; (5) intentional misrepresentation; (6) concealment; (7) design and manufacturing defects; and (8) failure to provide medication guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-53.) The Plaintiffs claim that all the Defendants were grossly negligent and seek wrongful death and survival damages as well as punitive damages for wrongful death and survival along with interest and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 18, 2018, the Pharmaceutical Defendants removed this suit based upon the claim that federal jurisdiction over this suit exists because there is a sufficient amount in controversy and complete diversity of citizenship among the parties because the Healthcare Defendants are improperly joined, fraudulently misjoined, and discretionarily severable, meaning that their non-diverse state citizenship may be disregarded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 28-40.) Simultaneous with the removal, the Pharmaceutical Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and alternative motion for a more definite statement. (ECF No. 7.) Thereafter, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand arguing that a remand is required because federal diversity jurisdiction over this action does not exist since the Healthcare Defendants are properly joined, non-diverse defendants. (ECF No. 19.) Judge Garcia filed a Report and no party filed objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The improper joinder doctrine is a \"narrow exception\" to the complete diversity requirement and permits a court to disregard the state citizenship of an improperly joined, non-diverse defendant.\n   <em>\n    McDonal v. Abbott Labs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8953690\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/177/#p183\">\n    408 F.3d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 183 (5th Cir. 2005). \"The removing party bears the burden of establishing that federal jurisdiction exists.\"\n   <em>\n    De Aguilar v.

Here, the Pharmaceutical Defendants have not met that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First, complete diversity does not exist. The Plaintiffs are citizens of Texas. All the Healthcare Defendants are citizens of Texas. (ECF No. 1-1 at 6-7.) The Pharmaceutical\n   Defendants are citizens of Delaware, New York, and Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unless there is a finding that each and every Healthcare Defendant was improperly joined, complete diversity jurisdiction does not exist, and therefore this Court does not have jurisdiction over this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The removing defendant can establish improper joinder in two ways: \"(1) actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts, or (2) inability of the plaintiff to establish a cause of action against the non-diverse party in state court.\"\n   <em>\n    Smallwood v. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319446\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/568/#p573\">\n    385 F.3d 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573 (5th Cir. 2004). The Pharmaceutical Defendants are not alleging actual fraud, so the Court need only assess whether the Plaintiffs failed to establish a cause of action against each and every Healthcare Defendant. After reviewing Judge Garcia's thorough analysis, this Court agrees that the Plaintiffs have clearly alleged a specific cause of action against at least one of the non-diverse defendants-the Healthcare Defendants. Based on the details of Martinez's treatment and ultimate death, the Plaintiffs have clearly laid out a negligence cause of action under the Texas Medical Liability Act against at least one of the Healthcare Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the alternative, the Pharmaceutical Defendants argue that the Healthcare Defendants have been fraudulently misjoined or that the claims against them should be severed from those against the Pharmaceutical Defendants. The Court is not convinced. For any of the claims against any Healthcare Defendant to be fraudulently misjoined, first the Court looks to whether the claims are joined appropriately under state law. Then, only if it concludes that joinder is inappropriate, the Court determines whether the joinder is fraudulent. In Texas, defendants may be joined if: (1) \"there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences\" and (2) at least \"one question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action.\" TEX. R. CIV. P. 40(a). The Plaintiffs' negligence claims against the Healthcare Defendants arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as their products liability claims against the Pharmaceutical Defendants, specifically when examining the administration and prescription of the drug Toradol on Martinez. Finally, the Court does not find severing the claims against the Pharmaceutical Defendants and the Healthcare Defendants to be appropriate or efficient and therefore, declines to do so. Since the Pharmaceutical Defendants have failed to show that this Court has jurisdiction because the Healthcare Defendants have been improperly or fraudulently joined, the Court will not take the extreme step of severing the claims, as the Supreme Court has said to use this power \"sparingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Newman-Green, Inc. v.

As to Defendants Lewis S. Christian, Jr., M.D. and Patrick Schaner, M.D., Plaintiffs have alleged that they are physicians licensed to practice medicine in Texas, which falls within the statutory definition of a \"health care provider\" and allege a \"health care liability claim\" against them through the assertion that they were negligent in failing to use ordinary care in treating Martinez, appropriately supervising assistants, and permitting the off-label administration of Toradol injections. (Pls.' Orig. Am. Pet. 2, 3, 53, 56-57.) Likewise, Defendant Gabriel Martinez, R.N. is alleged to be a registered nurse which falls directly under the TMLA's definition of \"health care provider.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code 74.001(a)(12)(A)(I). The claims against R.N. Martinez sound in negligence with the suggestion that he failed to use ordinary care in the administration of Toradol, and also meet the requirements for a \"health care liability claim.\" (Pls.' Am. Orig. Pet. 3, 58.) Texas courts treat physician's assistants and nurse practitioners as \"health care provider[s]\" under the TMLA,\n   <em>\n    Kelly Ryan Cook, P.A. v.

(Pls.' Orig. Am. Pet. 2, 3, 54, 57.) As a medical assistant, Defendant Alejandro Maldonado also is a \"health care provider\" by statutory definition because the definition includes \"employee[s] ... of a 'health care provider' or physician acting in the course and scope of the employment or contractual relationship,\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 74.001(a)(12)(B)(ii), and the Petition alleges that Maldonado is an employee of a \"health care provider.\" (Pls.' Am. Orig.

App.-Corpus Christi 2006, no pet.) (applying TMLA provisions to suit involving the alleged negligence of an orderly based upon orderly's status as an employee of a health care provider). As will be explained shortly, Maldonado's employer, Defendant South Texas Urgent Care qualifies as a \"health care provider\" under the TMLA. And there are allegations against Maldonado that he was negligent because he failed to use ordinary care in the administration of Martinez's Toradol injections, (Pls.' Am. Orig. Pet. 55), which assert a \"health care liability claim.\" Defendant South Texas Urgent Care also fits the TMLA's definition of a \"health care provider\" as the term has been defined to reach \"any person,\n   partnership, professional association, corporation, facility, or institution duly licensed, certified, registered, or chartered by the State of Texas to provide health care ....\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 74.001(a)(12)(A). Plaintiffs' negligence allegations against South Texas Urgent Care are that it failed to adequately train staff, enforce policies, and provide Martinez with a medication guide, which fall within the coverage of the TMLA's definition of a \"[h]ealth care liability claim,\" and Plaintiffs also assert that South Texas Urgent Care is vicariously liable for the negligence of its employees, Dr. Christian, P.A. Nemeth, and M.A. Maldonado. (Pls.' Am. Orig. Pet. 54-56.) Finally, Defendant Fort Duncan is a hospital and meets the statutory definition of a \"[h]ealth care institution,\" Tex. Civ.

Code \u00a7 74.001(a)(11)(G), and thus also is a \"[h]ealth care provider\" by definition,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8476894\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/198/810/#p814\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 74.001(a)(12)(A)(vii), and Plaintiffs' negligence allegations against Fort Duncan involve a \"health care liability claim\" since they concern Fort Duncan's alleged failure to adequately train staff, failure to enforce adequate policies and procedures, and failure to provide Martinez a required medication guide in addition to Plaintiffs' assertion that For Duncan is vicariously liable for the negligence of its employees, Dr. Schaner, N.P.

The elements of a basic\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   cause of action are that (1) the plaintiff was injured as the result of a tort, (2) the tortfeasor was an employee of the defendant, and (3) the tort was committed while the employee was acting within the course and scope of employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baptist Mem'l Hosp.

In particular, as to vicarious liability, Plaintiffs contend generally that Martinez was injured as the result of the medical negligence of Dr. Schaner, N.P. Jones, and R.N. Martinez previously described in this Report and Recommendation, that these individuals were employed by Fort Duncan, and that the medical negligence occurred within the course and scope of their employment at Fort Duncan. (Pls.' Am. Orig. Pet. 56-59.) Thus there are allegations pertaining to each and every element of a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim against Fort Duncan. With respect to Fort Duncan's direct liability, Plaintiffs assert that Fort Duncan failed to adequately train its staff, failed to have or enforce adequate policies and procedures, and failed to provide Martinez a medication guide as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.24\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result of these deficiencies, Plaintiffs contend, Martinez suffered the injuries that ultimately led to his death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59.) These sufficiently set forth a direct liability claim against Fort Duncan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As to South Texas Urgent Care, Plaintiffs assert that Dr. Christian, P.A. Nemeth, and M.A. Maldonado all committed acts or omissions of medical negligence during the course and scope of their respective employment for South Texas Urgent Care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-55). Combined with the allegations detailing the medical negligence at issue, these are sufficient to state a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim against South Texas Urgent Care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sampson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11842337\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/969/945/#p947\">\n    969 S.W.2d at 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 949 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Battaglia v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Am. Orig. Pet. 56.) But the undersigned cannot conclude, based on the petition's allegations, that a direct liability claim against South Texas Urgent Care has been sufficiently set forth. For present purposes however, this is inconsequential because if even one claim is properly alleged against a non-diverse defendant such as South Texas Urgent Care, that one claim is adequate to deprive a federal court of diversity jurisdiction over the suit. In this context, Plaintiffs' vicarious liability claim based upon\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   is adequate to state a claim against South Texas urgent care and show it is not an improperly joined defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To summarize, when the background factual allegations describing the medical treatment Martinez received and his demise are coupled with the specific causes of action that Plaintiffs allege against the Healthcare Defendants, it is readily apparent\n   that the petition on which the removal was based adequately states a claim by reference to federal pleading standards against at least one of the Healthcare Defendants and very nearly states a claim against all of them. Plaintiffs' description of each of the Healthcare Defendants' acts and omissions and their individual role in providing Martinez with medical care are significantly more than \"naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement,\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and state facially plausible claims against them. The petition contains factual content that allows the Court to draw the reasonable inference that the Healthcare Defendants are liable for the misconduct alleged and the descriptions of the alleged breaches of their duties to use ordinary care in the providing the medical treatment given to Martinez, including in the prescribing and administering of Toradol injections to Martinez, in the supervision and training of employees, and in the enforcement of policies and procedures related to the use of Toradol, show more than a sheer possibility that the Healthcare Defendants acted unlawfully.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Pharmaceutical Defendants' main argument in support of their contention that the Healthcare Defendants are improperly joined is that the gravamen of Plaintiffs' suit is their product liability claims brought against the Pharmaceutical Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Not. of Removal paras. 35-40.) Whether true or not, this is beside the point. In the Fifth Circuit, under\n   <em>\n    Smallwood\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, if the plaintiff states a single viable cause of action, by reference to federal pleading standards, against a non-diverse defendant, that is adequate to show that the non-diverse defendant is not improperly joined, that the common state citizenship may not be ignored, and that federal diversity jurisdiction is lacking. The Pharmaceutical Defendants further contend that if Plaintiffs' contentions concerning the Pharmaceutical Defendants' liability are taken as true, that necessarily negates the possibility that the Healthcare Defendants acted negligently with respect to their use of Toradol. (Resp. to Pls.' Mot. to Rem. 8, ECF No. 25.) This argument is a red herring. Pleading in the alternative, even where legal theories may be inconsistent, is a common and long-accepted practice in both the federal courts and Texas's state courts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fed.

In the petition, Plaintiffs assert medical negligence claims against the Healthcare Defendants and product liability claims against the Pharmaceutical Defendants. Considering the first step of the inquiry - whether there is a common transaction or occurrence and a common question of law or fact - the claims asserted against the Healthcare Defendants and Pharmaceutical Defendants are sufficiently related to satisfy the logical relationship test. One example of a common area of factual inquiry implicated by Plaintiffs' claims asserted against all of the Defendants concerns the prescription and administration of Toradol, particularly with respect to what information was or was not available from the Pharmaceutical Defendants for the use by the Healthcare Defendants. Another may involve common questions of law and fact as to the relative liability of the Defendants as well as the extent to which damages may be attributable to a particular Defendants' liability. Given that the logical relationship test takes a \"broad realistic interpretation\" of the claims \"in the interest of avoiding a multiplicity of suits,\" these common questions show a common fact issue and demonstrate that the claims arise out of the same occurrence or series of occurrences. Thus, they are not misjoined.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Xarelto (Rivaroxaban) Prods. Liab.

The situation presented by Plaintiffs' joinder of their claims against the Healthcare Defendants and the Pharmaceutical Defendants lies far from the outer limits of courts' willingness to apply\n   <em>\n    Tapscott\n   </em>\n   and conclude that a misjoinder arises to fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For these reasons, the Healthcare Defendants are not fraudulently misjoined and their Texas citizenship cannot be disregarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Severance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As their primary argument in support of the removal of this suit, the Pharmaceutical Defendants invoke Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 20 and 21 and assert that the District Court should employ them to sever the claims asserted against the Pharmaceutical Defendants from those asserted against the Healthcare Defendants and retain diversity jurisdiction over the suit that proceeds against Pharmaceutical Defendants. (Not. of Removal paras. 28-31; Resp. to Pls.' Mot. to Remand 4-7.) In the undersigned's view, for numerous reasons only the primary of which will be very briefly discussed here, employing such a procedure under the current circumstances is inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Xarelto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204409555\">\n    2016 WL 4409555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20110644\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

The Pharmaceutical Defendants have not pointed to any authority from the Fifth Circuit that would authorize the Court to do what it asks them to do via these contentions, nor have they identified a single Texas federal district court doing so either. (Not. of Removal paras. 28-31; Resp. to Pls.' Mot. to Remand 4-7.) The Supreme Court has approved of the practice of a court of appeals' dismissal of a non-diverse, dispensable party to perfect jurisdiction, but it emphasized that such authority should be used \"sparingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Alfonzo-Larrain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p837\">\n    490 U.S. at 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p837\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In arriving at this conclusion, the Supreme Court relied heavily on practical concerns and the preservation of the parties' resources,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p837\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p837\">\n    at 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p837\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and noted that their approval of the practice was an exception to the general rule that the existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist at the time suit is filed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p837\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p837\">\n    at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p837\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Caterpillar, Inc. v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court permitted a judgment to stand that was rendered in a case improperly removed to federal court on the purported basis of diversity jurisdiction after the original jurisdictional defect was cured by the post-settlement dismissal of the non-diverse party.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594783\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/61/#p73\">\n    519 U.S. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594783\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/61/#p73\">\n    117 S.Ct. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594783\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/61/#p73\">\n    136 L.Ed.2d 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). Recently, the Fifth Circuit invoked these general principles and acknowledged that \"[d]ismissals of non-diverse parties allow for the exercise of diversity jurisdiction, and the propriety of remand in a properly removed case is judged on the basis of the district court's jurisdiction over the claims remaining at the time of remand, not the time of removal\" before it concluded in an unusual case that a district court lacked \"discretion to remand this case if the remaining parties were diverse at the time of removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Jefferson v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's London\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=658%20Fed.%20Appx.%20738\">\n    658 Fed. Appx. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 743 (5th Cir. 2016) (per curiam). But there is no authority that shows it is permissible to do what the Pharmaceutical Defendants ask, that is, to create diversity jurisdiction to support a removal by dismissing non-diverse defendants where the generally accepted method of doing so in the Fifth Circuit, showing improper joinder under\n   <em>\n    Smallwood\n   </em>\n   , has failed, and the less common alternative supporting argument based\n   <em>\n    Tapscott\n   </em>\n   and fraudulent misjoinder, also has failed. For\n   these reasons, the undersigned sees no basis for the District Court to sever the Healthcare Defendants pursuant to Rule 21, particularly given that the Courts of Appeals have been admonished by the Supreme Court to use their power to do so \"sparingly,\" there are not concerns about attempting to conserve judicial or party resources at this point in this litigation as the merits of the case have yet to be heard, and the Pharmaceutical Defendants are not be entitled to the result they seek under an ordinary improper joinder analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because the Court lacks diversity jurisdiction over this suit, it should be remanded. Given the Fifth Circuit's clear statement that District Courts only have jurisdiction to consider their jurisdiction until an improperly joined, non-diverse party is dismissed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Energy Ventures Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251041\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/193/#p210\">\n    818 F.3d at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that is not the case in this cause, the Court lacks jurisdiction to act on Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Relevant here,\n    <em>\n     Smallwood\n    </em>\n    instructs district courts that they may evaluate claims of improper joinder by considering whether the allegations of the complaint are sufficient to state a claim against the in-state defendant in a \"Rule 12(b)(6)-type\" analysis.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251041\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/193/#p210\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Smallwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319446\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/568/#p573\">\n     385 F.3d at 573\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Smallwood\n    </em>\n    imposes no requirement that a defendant come forward with any evidence, let alone clear and convincing evidence, of the plaintiff's inability to recover against the in-state defendant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Smallwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319446\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/568/#p573\">\n     385 F.3d at 573\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (resolving uncertainty over the standard and proper means for evaluating whether a reasonable basis to predict recovery under state law).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Plaintiffs' motion to remand briefing erroneously relies on Texas's more liberal \"fair notice\" pleading standard for determining whether the petition's allegations are sufficient to permit the District Court to determine whether there is a reasonable basis to predict that Plaintiffs might be able to recover against the non-diverse Healthcare Defendants. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Mot. to Remand 5-6.) While formerly there was an open question in the Fifth Circuit about which pleading standard applied in this context, the issue definitively has been settled in favor of the use of the federal pleading standard for nearly three years.\n    <em>\n     Int'l Energy Ventures\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251041\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/193/#p210\">\n     818 F.3d at 208\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Our precedent is clear: A federal court must apply the federal pleading standard.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Plaintiffs' failure to specifically invoke the TMLA as the basis of their negligence causes of action in the petition does not render the TMLA inapplicable or mean that Plaintiffs have asserted only an \"ordinary\" negligence claim against the Healthcare Defendants. Under Texas law, a plaintiff cannot bring a negligence claim in addition to or as an alternative to a healthcare liability claim when the facts underlying the claim are covered by the TMLA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Yamada v. Friend\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319873\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/335/192/#p193\">\n     335 S.W.3d 192\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 193-94, 197 (Tex. 2010). The TMLA applies to all \"health care liability\" claims which are defined as claims brought \"against a health care provider or physician for treatment, lack of treatment, or other claimed departure from accepted standards of medical care, or health care, or safety or professional or administrative services directly related to health care, which proximately results in injury to or death of a claimant.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 74.001(a)(13). Plaintiffs' claims against the Healthcare Defendants fall within the ambit of the TMLA because their allegations against these individual Healthcare Defendants, in general, are that they failed to use ordinary care when treating Martinez's conditions and used Toradol in an off-label manner. (Pls.' Am. Orig. Pet. 53-58.) Such clams unquestionably fall within the TMLA's definition of a \"health care liability claim.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
