STANTON, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Landol Fletcher brought this putative class action, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, against Defendants for violations of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for lack of class standing and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are as alleged in the Amended Complaint (Dkt. No. 26) and accompanying exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Fletcher is a participant in the Central States, Southeast, and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (\"Central States Plan\"), an ERISA defined-benefit employee pension plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants are a group of related entities that provide brokerage and transition management services. ConvergEx Holdings LLC is a Delaware corporation and the parent of ConvergEx Group LLC. ConvergEx Group LLC is a Delaware corporation and the parent of ConvergEx Global Markets Ltd. (\"Global Markets\"), G-Trade Services LLC (\"G-Trade\"), and ConvergEx Execution Solutions LLC (\"CES\"). Global Markets is an offshore affiliate located in Bermuda, and G-Trade and CES are headquartered in New York City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From October of 2006 through December of 2011, Defendants executed trade orders for the purchase and sale of securities for ERISA plans, including the Central States Plan. Defendants represented that they would act as agents on behalf of the ERISA plans and only charge disclosed commissions for their services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When G-Trade or CES received a trade order for a customer, they routed it to Global Markets' order management system in Bermuda. That routing was unnecessary, as many of the trade orders were for the purchase and sale of stocks listed on U.S. exchanges, and CES was ConvergEx's U.S. trading arm and a member of the U.S. exchanges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After receiving the order, Global Markets executed the trade on its own account as a principal through a local broker. Global Markets then added unauthorized and undisclosed markups or markdowns to the price of the security - an increased price for a purchase and a decreased price for a sale. G-Trade or CES reported to the customer the increased or decreased price instead of the actual market price at which Global Markets executed the trade. The markups and markdowns created a gap or \"spread\" between the actual price and the reported price, which Defendants retained as trading profits (\"TP\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For example, if CES received a trade order to purchase 500 shares of Company A stock for an ERISA plan, CES entered the order into Global Markets' order management system. Global Markets then purchased the 500 shares in Bermuda at $1.00 per share, but added a markup of $0.10 to the price. CES reported to the customer the increased price of $1.10 per share, or $550 total instead of $500, and Defendants kept the undisclosed $50 spread as TP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The amount of TP Defendants earned generally equaled or exceeded roughly ten times Defendants' disclosed commissions on the trades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result of their \"double-charging scheme,\" Defendants earned millions of dollars, and the Central States Plan suffered losses, increasing the risk that Mr.\n   Fletcher and his peers would not receive their benefits under the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Fletcher brought this action on December 27, 2013, alleging ERISA violations of breach of fiduciary duties of prudence and loyalty, engaging in self-interested transactions with plan assets, and co-fiduciary liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court dismissed this action on February 17, 2016 for lack of standing by Mr. Fletcher. On April 11, 2017, the Second Circuit vacated that ruling, ruled that Mr. Fletcher had standing to sue on behalf of the Central States Plan but perhaps not the others, and remanded to this court \"to determine in the first instance whether the conduct alleged by Fletcher relating to the Central States Plan 'implicates the same set of concerns' as the conduct by Convergex that is 'alleged to have caused injury' to putative class members who are not participants in that Plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss the Amended Complaint for (1) Mr. Fletcher's lack of standing to sue on behalf of participants of ERISA plans other than his own and (2) failure plausibly to allege that Defendants functioned as fiduciaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Class Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Fletcher seeks to represent a class of participants, beneficiaries, and named fiduciaries of all ERISA plans that were charged undisclosed markups and markdowns by Defendants. Defendants argue that Mr. Fletcher lacks class standing to assert claims on behalf of other ERISA plans in which he never participated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[I]n a putative class action, a plaintiff has class standing if he plausibly alleges (1) that he 'personally has suffered some actual ... injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant,' and (2) that such conduct implicates 'the same set of concerns' as the conduct alleged to have caused injury to other members of the putative class by the same defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    NECA-IBEW Health &amp; Welfare Fund v.

The SEC order attached to the Amended Complaint describes how Defendants' conduct varied: \"Respondents' [Defendants'] decision whether to take TP, and the amount of TP to take, depended largely on whether Respondents thought that CGM [Global Markets] could take TP without the customer detecting it.\" Am. Compl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 24. Defendants \"assessed the 'sensitivity' of their customers to determine whether a particular customer was paying attention to execution quality,\" and \"did not take TP on trades for 'sensitive' customers\" or when they \"knew customers were scrutinizing their executions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28. They \"took TP when customers were asleep during market trading hours because of time zone differences\" but \"did not take TP from customers who actively monitored executions throughout the day through the receipt of real-time trade information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. They \"did not take TP on trades if customers, prior to trading, requested a 'time and sales' report\" to analyze \"the times of execution and prices received on the individual executions underlying a customer's order\" but \"resumed taking TP after they were told that the customer was no longer conducting the analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. When the risk of detection was low, they \"took TP in an amount that resulted in customers buying at a price equal to the market high of the day and selling at a price equal to the market low of the day, where better prices could have been provided.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The SEC order also states, \"Some customers asked Respondents to handle their trades on a fiduciary basis. When customers requested fiduciary treatment, Respondents did not take TP on those customers' trades and typically charged those customers higher disclosed commission rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 n.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Because Defendants' conduct of taking TP and the amount of TP taken differed based on the customers' \"sensitivity\" and scrutiny of the trades or the time of day, determining when and in what amount Defendants took TP in transactions for the Central States Plan will not determine when and in what amount Defendants took TP in transactions for other plans. Thus, Mr. Fletcher does not have a personal or concrete stake in litigating other ERISA plan participants' claims, which do not implicate the same set of concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Retirement Board\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055610\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/154/#p161\">\n    775 F.3d at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the plaintiffs did not have class standing to represent absent class members who purchased certificates issued by trusts in which no named plaintiff invested because\n   \"in contrast to\n   <em>\n    NECA\n   </em>\n   , where the defendants' alleged Securities Act violations inhered in making the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   misstatements across multiple offerings, BNYM's alleged misconduct must be proved loan-by-loan and trust-by-trust,\" as \"whether Countrywide breached its obligations under the governing agreements (thus triggering BNYM's duty to act) requires examining its conduct with respect to each trust,\" \"Whether it was obligated to repurchase a given loan requires examining which loans, in which trusts, were in breach of the representations and warranties,\" and \"whether a loan's documentation was deficient requires looking at individual loans and documents\") (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    In re: LIBOR-Based Fin.

Compl. Ex. 1 \u00b6 7; n.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Mr. Fletcher argues that Defendants had control and authority over the disposition of plan assets because they unilaterally\n   determined the amount of compensation they received in TP from ERISA plans. \"[A]fter a person has entered into an agreement with an ERISA-covered plan, the agreement may give it such control over factors that determine the actual amount of its compensation that the person thereby becomes an ERISA fiduciary with respect to that compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    F.H.

Defendants' taking of TP was undisclosed and unauthorized, and could not have been included in their agreement with a plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The amount of TP Defendants retained depended on multiple factors that they did not control, such as the \"sensitivity\" of the customer, the time of day, the type and amount of securities the customer wanted to buy or sell, and the market price of the securities at which Global Markets executed the trade.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517601\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/214/#p223\">\n    895 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   226 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The facts pleaded here do not admit an inference that defendants \"exercised unhampered discretion\" in establishing their compensation for the FX transactions at issue. Even assuming that defendants' alleged market manipulations allowed them to secure higher compensation for the FX transactions they conducted than a free market would have indicated, the scheme nevertheless depended on so many different persons and manipulations as to preclude an inference that defendants had an unfettered ability to dictate their compensation for each transaction. Moreover, such an inference is belied by the fact, already noted, that the Plans' independent investment managers initiated the FX transactions at issue and provided instructions for their execution, which themselves informed defendants' compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patrico v.
