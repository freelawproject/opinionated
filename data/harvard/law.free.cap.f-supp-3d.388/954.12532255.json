On March 26, 2019, the Court granted a motion by Defendants Newcorp, LLC, and Save-a-lot Knoxville, LLC to join in the motion to dismiss. (Doc. 27.) Plaintiff Larry McCloud has responded in opposition to the motion to dismiss (Doc. 30), and Defendants Moran Foods, LLC, Save-a-lot, LTD., Newcorp, LLC, and Save-a-lot, Knoxville, LLC (\"Defendants\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) have replied (Doc. 33). Also before the Court is a motion by Plaintiff for oral argument on the motion to dismiss, as well as an amended motion for oral argument on the motion to dismiss. (Docs. 34, 35.) Defendants have responded in opposition to Plaintiff's motions for oral argument.

For the following reasons, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss (Doc. 20) and will\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   this action\n   <strong>\n    WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 15, 2018, Plaintiff filed this case as a putative class action, alleging in a one-count complaint that Defendants violated the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (\"FACTA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 1.)

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants printed at least the first six and the last four digits of the credit or debit card number on receipts given to Plaintiff and putative class members. Plaintiff has\n   attached a redacted receipt to his response brief showing that he made a purchase at a Save-A-Lot store in Knoxville, Tennessee for a total of $ 23.53 in goods on April 6, 2018.

Plaintiff seeks statutory damages, punitive damages, costs, and attorney's fees, all of which are made available by FACTA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 12, 2019, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or alternatively, under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.

Plaintiff's Alleged Injuries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The parties dispute whether Plaintiff has alleged an injury in fact. Plaintiff's complaint and responsive brief state that Defendants injured Plaintiff, as well as those similarly situated, in two primary ways. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1, 30.) First, Defendants allegedly violated FACTA by printing at least the first six digits and the last four digits of the card number on receipts given to Plaintiff, as well as to purported class members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Plaintiff's complaint argues that this is not a \"trifling matter\" because the violation exposed Plaintiff and class members to \"at least an increased and material risk of identity theft and credit card and or debit card fraud.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9.) Plaintiff supports this argument by referencing Congress's reasons for protecting credit card numbers, as well as through information from computer scientists about hacking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) Second, Plaintiff alleges that purported class members and himself were burdened with an\n   \"additional inconvenience\" of taking \"steps to ensure the safety of his or her identity\" because \"he or she may not simply crumple the receipt and throw it into a nearby trash can, but must review it to assess what was printed, hold on to it, and perhaps shred it or cut it up later.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Notably, the majority of Plaintiff's complaint does not focus on Plaintiff at all. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1.) Rather, Plaintiff's allegations focus on the intent of Congress in passing FACTA, the ability of hackers to use credit card information to engage in cyberattacks, and the complex problem of identity theft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff does not allege, however, that his\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   receipt was lost or stolen, or that\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   has been a victim of identity theft or credit card fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Indeed, Plaintiff does not even allege that someone else has\n   <em>\n    viewed\n   </em>\n   the partially redacted card digits on his receipt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is also notable that Plaintiff brings no claims sounding in state law, but only alleges one count of the violation of FACTA. Because Plaintiff has not alleged he suffered any actual injury \"in the flesh-and-blood or dollars-and-cents sense of the term,\" nor has he alleged that it was \"certainly impending\" that his identity would be stolen, the Court begins by assessing whether Plaintiff's allegation of a FACTA violation created a \"procedural or intangible injury.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521066\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/923/458/#p463\">\n    923 F.3d at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

L. No. 110-241, 122 Stat 1565 (June 3, 2008). Congress stated that the purpose of the Clarification Act was \"to ensure that consumers suffering from any\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   harm to their credit or identity are protected while simultaneously limiting abusive lawsuits that do not protect consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173065\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/724/#p725\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   While Defendants' point is valid, Plaintiff still argues that he suffered from actual harm, and that his lawsuit does protect consumers because it is based on the more important part of FACTA-the portion which requires credit or debit card number truncation. While this is a far more nuanced argument than one based, for instance, on an allegation that Plaintiff's identity was stolen, it is still an alleged injury which\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   could potentially recognize as constituting an injury in fact.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.

This sort of conclusory allegation does not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    O'Bryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329146\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/361/#p376\">\n    556 F.3d at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that the first six and last four digits of a card number, either alone or in conjunction with other information, can be used to bolster the credibility of a criminal who is making pretext phone calls or engaging in email phishing scams. This allegation is based on the idea that a criminal may \"pick off\" different bits of information from different\n   sources. Defendant also discusses a study by computer scientists showing that \"even starting with no details at all other than the first six digits [of a card number] a hacker can obtain the three essential pieces of information to make an online purchase in as little as six seconds.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   While Defendants contest these claims by arguing that the first six digits of a credit or debit card only identify the card issuer and give an identity thief no more information than Congress already permitted to be printed on receipts, the Court is mindful that it must take all well-pleaded allegations in Plaintiff's complaint as true.\n   <em>\n    Gentek Bldg.

For instance, the fact that some computer scientists have found that hackers have the\n   <em>\n    capability\n   </em>\n   to use the first six digits of a card number to quickly make an online purchase does not entail that this practice is currently being engaged in by hackers in any sort of threatening mass. Nor does the study mention that these hackers tend to be dumpster-divers or trash-pickers, thereafter using information that they have gathered from discarded transactional receipts. The allegation only notes that the six-digit method of hacking was \"likely to have been used\" in a recent cyberattack. In addition, an article which Plaintiff attaches regarding the hacking technique itself notes that the team of scientists only found the VISA network to be particularly vulnerable, but not the Mastercard network. (Doc. 1-6 at 4.) Plaintiff does not allege whether his card was issued by the VISA network, or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff additionally makes no allegation about how common it is for hackers to pick off pieces of information-in specific, using the partially disclosed digits of a consumer's credit card from a discarded printed receipt-in order to engage in making pretext phone calls or e-mail phishing scams. Again, just because a criminal is\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of engaging in criminal behavior in a certain specific method does not entail that the same method is common enough such that Plaintiff was exposed to a \"material\" risk of a crime being committed against him by Defendants' alleged violation of FACTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In no way is the Court suggesting that identity theft is uncommon, nor does the Court wish to understate the havoc it can wreak in a consumer's life. The Court merely observes that Plaintiff has not alleged that he was exposed to a material risk of harm of identity theft through his receipt from Save-A-Lot, LLC in his complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, Plaintiff has the burden of clearly alleging facts which demonstrate each element of the standing doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.

GC Services Limited Partnership\n   </em>\n   , where the Sixth Circuit recently analyzed a procedural violation of a provision of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the \"FDCPA\"). The portion of the FDCPA at issue required debt collectors to provide consumers with a notice stating that if the consumer opted to contest the debt in writing, additional debtor protections would be triggered. The Sixth Circuit reasoned that Congress conferred those procedural rights in order to protect the plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   concrete interests in being free from abusive debt-collection practices.\n   <em>\n    Macy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517874\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/747/#p753\">\n    897 F.3d at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In evaluating whether the plaintiff faced a material risk of harm by the defendant's violation of the statute, the Sixth Circuit noted that courts use the standard of the \"least sophisticated consumer\" when evaluating the impact of an FDCPA violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517874\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/747/#p753\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barany-Snyder v.

Because the defendant violated the FDCPA by failing to let plaintiffs know about the additional protections they could receive by contesting their debt in writing, every single plaintiff (presumed to be the \"least sophisticated consumer\") who was sent a deficient notice undoubtedly experienced a material risk that they, themselves, would unintentionally waive their FDCPA debt validation rights. The Sixth Circuit concluded that, \"Plaintiffs were placed at a materially greater risk of falling victim to 'abusive debt collection practices.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 758 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ).

Instead, there was a material risk that each plaintiff would harm him or herself by waiving their FDCPA debt-collection rights because each plaintiff was presumed to be the least sophisticated consumer. Here, Plaintiff instead relies on a theory resting on conjecture about the decisions of independent, criminal actors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    568 U.S. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We decline to abandon our usual reluctance to endorse standing theories that rest on speculation about the decisions of independent actors.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   More recently, the Sixth Circuit also compared the FDCPA violation in\n   <em>\n    Macy\n   </em>\n   to an FCRA violation more similar to the case here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huff v.

In\n   <em>\n    Macy\n   </em>\n   , Congress did not trespass on Article III because the statutory violation was closely connected to real economic harm and thus amounted to an injury in fact. In this instance, Congress crossed the line. It has not shown how a deprivation of information that neither holds consequences for the consumer nor imposes a real risk of harm creates an injury.

Tenn, Apr. 18, 2017) (\"Plaintiff has failed to plead facts that establish a causal chain between the FACTA violation alleged here and an increased risk of identity theft\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiff presents three primary counter-arguments to the Court's conclusion regarding risk of harm. First, Plaintiff makes several references to Congress's observations about the dramatic increase in instances of identity theft which were taking place at the time of the adoption of FACTA. For instance, Plaintiff's reply brief references a 2003 report from the United States House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services which cited the need to \"provide consumers with the tools they need to fight identity theft[,]\" and found that identity theft had \" 'reached almost epidemic proportions' with the FTC fielding over 160,000 calls about identity theft in 2002 alone.\" (Doc. 30 at 2-3 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 108-263, at 1 (Sept. 4, 2003)).) It logically follows that Congress would not have required credit or debit card number truncation on receipts unless that information was materially contributing to identity theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On this point, however, the Court agrees with the Third Circuit, which observed,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   the congressional \"[f]act-[f]inding\" Kamal relies on is not particularized to his alleged injury. Kamal does not point us to any part of the congressional record that considers the risk of identity theft when only the first six and last four digits of a consumer's credit card are printed on a receipt. Instead, he notes\n   that \"[e]xperts ... recommended [to Congress] that card numbers not be printed in full on receipts, because card numbers are particularly dangerous in the hands of sophisticated criminals.\" Because Kamal has not alleged that J. Crew printed his card number \"in full,\" these congressional findings of risk are not tailored to the FACTA violation he has pleaded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Kamal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520372\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/102/\">\n    918 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   116 n.5 (internal citations omitted). In general, statistics cited by Congress\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the adoption of FACTA addressed the harm of printing a credit or debit card number on a receipt in full. Congress did not have occasion to consider whether a consumer would face a material risk of real harm when the first six and last four digits of a credit or debit card number appear on a receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that there is no \"chain of causation\" which the Court should concern itself with because Plaintiff's harm occurred \"at the point of the transaction\"-that is, immediately when Plaintiff was provided his receipt. Plaintiff states, \"[b]y requesting the Court to focus only on events\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff took possession of the unlawful receipt, Defendants urge the Court to ignore or disregard Congress' [sic] judgment that merchants must protect their customers by truncating card numbers on receipts given\n   <em>\n    at the point of sale.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. 30 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   At the point of sale, Plaintiff was given a receipt with some of his own credit card digits reflected on it. Plaintiff surely already knew the full number on his card, or could easily reference the number on the card itself. The Court does not see how Plaintiff suffered any type of arguable harm at that point in time without there being some sort of material risk that something would happen with the card information later on. Plaintiff may fear further exposure of his information due to the receipt, but the Court discusses why this fear is also insufficient below. Because Plaintiff does not successfully allege that he was exposed to a material risk of real harm of his identity being stolen later on, Plaintiff cannot have alleged any injury in fact at the time of the transaction. While the Court acknowledges \"Congress's judgment\" in requiring card number truncation at the point of sale, the Court remains mindful that \"Congress cannot erase Article III's standing requirements by statutorily granting the right to sue to a plaintiff who would not otherwise have standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.

The panel then cited a 2009 case decided by its own court which observed that \"a small injury, 'an identifiable trifle[,]' \" can be sufficient to confer standing-such as being required to present a photo identification when voting in\n   person.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520890,12520891\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1175/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684374\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1340/#p1351\">\n    554 F.3d 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1351 (11th Cir. 2009) ).\n   <em>\n    Billups\n   </em>\n   , however, said nothing about how large the\n   <em>\n    risk of harm\n   </em>\n   to a plaintiff's concrete interest needs to be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Billups\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684374\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1340/#p1351\">\n    554 F.3d at 1351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Going further, the\n   <em>\n    Muransky\n   </em>\n   court stated, \"[i]n our view, if Congress adopts procedures designed to minimize the risk of harm to a concrete interest, then a violation of that procedure that causes\n   <em>\n    even a marginal increase in the risk of harm\n   </em>\n   to the interest is sufficient to constitute a concrete injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Muransky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520890,12520891\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1175/\">\n    922 F.3d at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). This Court finds that following those observations would only alter the rule established by the Sixth Circuit that a plaintiff must show a \"material risk of real harm\" to his or her concrete interest, not a \"marginal increase\" in the risk of harm to his or her concrete interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Macy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517874\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/747/#p753\">\n    897 F.3d at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit also observed that the plaintiff had standing based \"on the similarity between the harm he allege[d] and the common law tort of breach of confidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Muransky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520890,12520891\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1175/\">\n    922 F.3d at 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This was significant to the panel because\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   described it as \"instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S. Ct. at 1549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The panel observed that a \"common law breach of confidence lies where a person offers private information to a third party in confidence and the third party reveals that information[,]\" and found that the defendant had engaged in a similar practice by printing more credit card digits than FACTA allows.\n   <em>\n    Muransky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520890,12520891\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1175/\">\n    922 F.3d at 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even then, the panel recognized that \"the match\" between the two types of actions is \"not exact[,]\" and recognized that \"unlike a common law breach of confidence, a merchant need not disclose a credit card number to anyone in order to violate FACTA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520890,12520891\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1175/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520890,12520891\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1175/\">\n    at 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Eleventh Circuit still found \"sufficient similarity\" between a FACTA violation and a breach of confidence such that the court found that the plaintiff had alleged an injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Here, Plaintiff makes similar arguments, proposing that FACTA's truncation requirement bears a close relationship to analogous common law torts such as invasion of privacy, breach of confidence, and breach of an implied bailment agreement. The Court, however, is convinced by the Third Circuit's observation that a plaintiff's alleged injury does not have a close relationship with traditional privacy tort actions when the plaintiff does not allege any disclosure of his information to a third party.\n   <em>\n    Kamal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520372\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/102/\">\n    918 F.3d at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In all of the traditional privacy torts, the Third Circuit observed, harm transpires when a third party gains unauthorized access to a plaintiff's personal information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520372\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/102/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Absent disclosure to a third party, as is the case with Plaintiff's allegations here, Plaintiff's injury is unlike those harms recognized by traditional causes of action. Because of this, the Court rejects Plaintiff's arguments that the harm he suffered has a close relationship to a harm traditionally regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts, and disagrees with the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning on those grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Taken together, the Court sees no reason to follow the reasoning of the Eleventh Circuit and depart from the majority of courts finding that a plaintiff does not allege a sufficient injury by pleading that a defendant violated FACTA by printing the first six and last four digits of his or her credit or debit card number on a receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Burden of Destroying or Retaining Receipt\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that he was burdened by having to either safeguard his\n   receipt through retaining it or through \"disposing of it in a manner that does not display his card number\"-presumably, through tearing it up or shredding it. (Doc. 30 at 16.) Either way, Plaintiff argues, he \"is not able to simply crumple the receipt and throw it away.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court finds that this argument still hinges on whether Plaintiff faced any material risk of his identity being stolen. Because the Court has observed that Plaintiff did not allege a material risk of his identity being stolen, the Court is not convinced that Plaintiff had any real burden to protect or destroy his receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   While Plaintiff may be a very cautious person who chooses to take the extra step of retaining or destroying his receipt regardless of his true exposure to risk, he cannot manufacture his own injury based on speculation about a threat which does not present any material risk of real harm. In\n   <em>\n    Clapper v. Amnesty International, USA\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court observed,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   respondents cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.... If the law were otherwise, an enterprising plaintiff would be able to secure a lower standard for Article III standing simply by making an expenditure based on a nonparanoid fear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    568 U.S. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). As such, this secondary argument is simply a \"repackaged version\" of Plaintiff's first, failed, theory of standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court similarly rejects it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Having addressed both of Plaintiff's alleged injuries, and having found that Plaintiff does not allege an injury in fact, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss (Doc. 20) and will\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   this action\n   <strong>\n    WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    An Order Will Enter.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Plaintiff has also named as Defendants to this action Does 1 through 10, inclusive.
