The offer letter stated that the \"offer of employment is contingent on ... A satisfactory background and reference check.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On July 24, 2013, Defendant USH requested that ADP perform a background check, ordering a social security number check, a criminal history report from Alameda County, and a \"smart scan.\" (Arnds Decl., Exh.

Plaintiff brought four causes of action based on Defendants' alleged failure to: (1) make proper disclosures in violation of FCRA \u00a7 1681b(b)(2)(A); (2) give a proper summary of rights in violation of FCRA \u00a7\u00a7 1681d(a)(1) and 1681g(c); (3) make proper disclosures in violation of California's Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (\"ICRAA\"); and (4) make proper disclosures in violation of California's Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act (\"CCRAA\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-34, 49-50, 52-57, 66, 81.) Plaintiff also brings a cause of action for violation of California's Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"), which \"incorporates by reference\" Plaintiff's other four causes of action. (Compl. \u00b6 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 4, 2017, Defendants removed the case to federal court based on federal question jurisdiction. (Not. of Removal \u00b6 5, Dkt. No. 1.) On May 1, 2018, the Court held a case management conference, setting the fact discovery deadline for November 30, 2018. (Dkt. No. 17.) On December 19, 2018, the Court granted the parties' stipulation extending the fact discovery deadline to February 1, 2019. (Dkt.

On April 2, 2019, the parties filed a case management conference statement, in which Plaintiff for the first time suggested that the Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case because there was no Article III standing. (Dkt. No. 41 at 2.) On April 8, 2019, Plaintiff filed her motion to remand. (Plf.'s Mot. to Remand, Dkt. No. 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 15, 2019, Plaintiff filed her opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment. (Plf.'s Opp'n, Dkt. No. 51.) On April 16, 2019, Plaintiff filed a motion to extend the fact discovery cut-off. (Dkt. No. 55.) On April 22, 2019, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiff's motion\n   to remand and their reply in support of their motion for summary judgment. (Defs.' Opp'n, Dkt. No. 58; Defs.'

After receiving his offer, the plaintiff was required to fill out a consent form, which stated that federal law required BANA to ensure that individuals assigned to BANA did not have certain criminal convictions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The consent form also requested consent to being fingerprinted and the preparation of an investigative consumer report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff was later fingerprinted, and background checks were performed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on these facts, the district court concluded \"that by the time plaintiff began his assignment with BANA, plaintiff had constructive notice that BANA had procured a background check\" because he would have known that a background check would be obtained before he started his assignment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. The district court also noted that the fact that the plaintiff had his fingerprints taken put him on notice that BANA would obtain a background check.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Here, when applying for a position with Defendants, Plaintiff agreed to allow Defendants to verify the information provided. (Arnds, Exh. A at 4.) Plaintiff also agreed that Defendants may procure a consumer report in considering her candidacy as an employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Plaintiff then received a job offer, which stated that the \"offer of employment is contingent on the following: ... A satisfactory background and reference check.\" (Arnds Decl., Exh. I.) Thus, like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Berrellez\n   </em>\n   , by the time Plaintiff started her employment on July 26, 2013, Plaintiff had at least constructive notice that Defendants had pulled a consumer report on Plaintiff because she would not have been able to start her position otherwise, as Plaintiff's employment was conditioned on the successful background check. A reasonably diligent person would therefore have understood that Defendants had pulled a consumer report, starting the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff makes several arguments in response. First, Plaintiff contends that she \"she did not discovery [sic] the violation\n   when she signed the forms because since she was not mailed a copy of her report she had no reason to believe that Defendants had obtained one.\" (Plf.'s Opp'n at 4.) As an initial matter, Defendants do not argue that the violation occurred when Plaintiff signed the form; as the Ninth Circuit has explained, the violation occurred when Defendants obtained the consumer report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Syed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277080\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/492/#p499\">\n    853 F.3d at 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the fact that Plaintiff was not mailed a copy of her report is irrelevant; the mailing of the consumer report does not trigger the statute of limitations, and Plaintiff cites no authority that would suggest otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, Plaintiff contends that she did not know that a background check was performed. (Plf.'s Opp'n at 5.) Plaintiff fails to address the fact that she was given a job offer that was contingent on a satisfactory background check, and that she then started that job, facts that would lead a reasonable person to understand that a background check was performed by the time Plaintiff started her position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205099509\">\n    2018 WL 5099509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 n.6 ;\n   <em>\n    Berrellez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205947221\">\n    2016 WL 5947221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7. Plaintiff does not explain why a reasonable person in those circumstances should not be deemed to have known that a background check had been performed. Instead, at the hearing, Plaintiff focused primarily on whether Plaintiff actually knew, rather than whether Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have known. Plaintiff also pointed to no evidence suggesting she or a reasonable person would not understand from the documents, such as the job offer, that the start of her job was contingent on the successful background check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Third, Plaintiff argues that even if she knew a background check was performed, she did not know at the time that the original disclosure was inadequate. (Plf.'s Opp'n at 5.) Even if Plaintiff was not aware that a violation had occurred, however, Plaintiff was aware of the\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   that gave rise to her claim.

The California Court of Appeal disagreed, explaining that even if\n   <em>\n    Shively\n   </em>\n   stood for the proposition that \"the discovery rule does not apply when the basis for a cause of action is contained in information accessible to the general public ... we nevertheless conclude that holding does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply to a cause of action subject to a limitations period under section 338, subdivision (d).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 349,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2038\">\n    84 Cal.Rptr.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This was because \"[a]n exception to the general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of action is\n   <em>\n    the discovery rule.\n   </em>\n   It\n   <em>\n    may be expressed by the legislature or implied by the courts.\n   </em>\n   It postpones accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 349-50,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2038\">\n    84 Cal.Rptr.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation and modifications omitted).

This is consistent with Supreme Court precedent, which has explained that when legislators use the word \"discovery\" in a statute, \"state and federal courts have typically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual discovery, but also to the\n   <em>\n    hypothetical discovery\n   </em>\n   of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know.\"\n   <em>\n    Merck &amp; Co., Inc. v.

Thus, courts have considered when a plaintiff\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have known the facts that form the basis for\n   her claim in ICRAA cases in determining when the statute of limitations starts to run.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berrellez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205947221\">\n    2016 WL 5947221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7 (dismissing ICRAA claims based on whether the plaintiff had constructive notice that BANA had procured a background check);\n   <em>\n    Alibris v.

Fla. Aug. 28, 2015) (finding that the ICRAA \"appl[ies] the 'discovery rule, pursuant to which a claim accrues when the litigant first knows or with due diligence should know facts that will form the basis for an action\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues that \"[i]f Defendants' argument that receipt of an inadequate disclosure triggers the running of the statute of limitations was accepted, it would lead to absurd results.\" (Plf.'s Opp'n at 5.) Again, Plaintiff misapprehends Defendants' argument. Defendants do not argue that the receipt of the inadequate disclosure triggered the statute of limitations, but that Plaintiff was put on notice that Defendant had requested the consumer report when she\n   <em>\n    started\n   </em>\n   her employment with Defendant. This is because Plaintiff's employment itself was contingent on the successful background check. Thus, the fact that Plaintiff was able to start working meant Plaintiff should have known a consumer report was procured because she would not have been able to start working otherwise. This limited situation would not render the five-year statute of limitations inapplicable in all cases, as Plaintiff suggests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) If an applicant who received inadequate disclosures from an employer was given a job offer that was not contingent on a successful background check, that applicant would have no reason to know that a consumer report was procured even when she started working. In that scenario, the plaintiff would have five years to bring a case from the time the consumer report was procured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because Plaintiff brought this case more than four years after she knew or should have known a consumer report was procured by Defendants, Plaintiff's claims are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's motion to remand, and GRANTS Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The parties dispute who actually employed Plaintiff.

No. 51.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    A \"consumer report\" is defined as \"any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living\" for certain purposes, including employment purposes. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Whether the allegations of economic damage are adequately pled to satisfy Rule 12(b)(6) is not before the Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The Court acknowledges that in support of her motion to remand, Plaintiff relies on two cases which granted similar motions to remand.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kirkland v. Estes Forwarding Worldwide, LLC\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 18-cv-7324-LB, Dkt. No. 15;\n    <em>\n     Rivera v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 17-cv-6885-JD, Dkt. No. 39. In both cases, however, the defendants did not oppose the motions to remand and the district court did not review the motions on the merits.\n    <em>\n     Kirkland\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 18-cv-7324-LB, Dkt. No. 15 (\"the court grants the unopposed motion to remand\");\n    <em>\n     Rivera\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 17-cv-6885-JD, Dkt. No. 39 (\"In light of the fact that defendant does not oppose the motion to remand, the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.\"). Thus, neither case analyzed whether there was economic harm based on the UCL allegations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The Court also observes that the\n    <em>\n     Kirkland\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Rivera\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs were represented by Plaintiff's counsel here, and that the motions to remand were granted on January 13, 2019 and February 8, 2019, respectively. Plaintiff, however, did not move to remand the instant case until April 8, 2019, after Defendants filed their motion for summary judgment. Such delay suggests inappropriate gamesmanship.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    On the day of the hearing, Plaintiff also provided the Court with\n    <em>\n     Moore v. United Parcel Service, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 18-cv-7600-VC. The Court notes, however, that while a UCL claim was brought, the district court did not appear to consider the UCL claim issue. In any case,\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    is not binding on this Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
