Catastrophic economic losses occurred throughout the country, and, \"[b]y the mid-1930's, the lifetime savings of millions of people had been wiped out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. Faced with an aging population on the brink of \"living their remaining years\n   in destitution,\" Congress acted by passing the Social Security Act of 1935 (\"the Act\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in signing the Act into law on August 14, 1935, stated: \"This law, too, represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means complete.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Much of the industrial revolution was quite literally fueled by coal mined from Kentucky and West Virginia's mountains. With dangerous work comes increased physical injury. Much of Appalachia has spent the greater part of the twentieth century enduring hard, physically exhausting, and dangerous labor to provide energy for the United States. American growth and prosperity was borne on the backs of these blue collar workers. As disability rates increased across the country, in 1956, Congress expanded the Social Security system to include payments to disabled workers. Now, every year, millions of Americans receive Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") and Disability Insurance Benefits (\"DIB\"). These benefits are often the only means by which disabled individuals can provide food and shelter for their families. Given the importance of these benefits, Congress and the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") have established a complex administrative system to determine (and redetermine) whether individuals are properly receiving benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This administrative system is overseen by the SSA, but it is moored by the procedural due process requirements of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While this case comes to the Court by way of a request for judicial review, it is not the typical administrative appeal that this Court sees on a daily basis; instead, this case presents important questions of due process and administrative procedure related to the SSA's redetermination process. Specifically, this case involves a massive fraud scheme perpetrated by attorney Eric Conn, two corrupt ALJs, and several doctors. After the SSA uncovered and pursued this scheme, it discontinued the benefits of thousands of attorney Conn's clients and required them to have their benefits redetermined. Plaintiff was one of those clients, and the SSA discontinued his benefits, finding that his benefits were based on a fraudulent medical report. Yet, despite the critical importance of whether this report was accurate or inaccurate, the SSA prohibited Plaintiff from challenging its determination that the report was fraudulent. Plaintiff contends that due process requires more, and this Court agrees. Prior to addressing Plaintiff's claims, the Court turns to the lengthy history underlying this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

To the contrary, it took the SSA nearly a decade to begin to close the book on the Conn scheme. \"The SSA first learned about possible wrongdoing involving Daugherty and Conn as far back as 2006, when a senior case technician\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a master docket clerk\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the SSA's Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (which houses the ALJs) raised concerns that Daugherty was reassigning Conn's cases to himself and rapidly deciding them in the claimants' favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519324\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/786/#p793\">\n    909 F.3d at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

Former ALJ Daugherty found that Plaintiff suffered from the following severe impairments: Arnold-Chiari Syndrome, Bell's Palsy, Sciatica, and Low Back Pain, and had the \"residual functional capacity to lift 8-10 pounds occasionally and 5 pounds frequently, stand/walk 2-3 hours per work day, sit 3 hours per work day, only occasionally crawl and never climb.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Former ALJ Daugherty found \"that the information provided by Dr. Huffnagle most accurately reflects [Plaintiff's] impairments and limitations,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   gave little weight to the State agency medical consultants' physical assessments, and\n   limited Plaintiff to \"sedentary work at best.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. Accordingly, former ALJ Daugherty found that Plaintiff has been under a disability as defined in the SSA since December 1, 2006, and issued a written decision on November 2, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 15. Thereafter, Plaintiff began receiving benefits from the SSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After OIG notified the SSA that there was reason to believe fraud was involved in certain cases involving Mr. Conn, the Appeals Council informed Plaintiff on May 18, 2015 that it was redetermining former ALJ Daugherty's decision awarding Plaintiff benefits. Thereafter, the Appeals Council reviewed Plaintiff's case, disregarded Dr. Huffnagle's opinion at the direction of OIG, and determined that former ALJ Daugherty's decision was not supported by the remaining evidence. ECF No. 43-4 at 19-21. On August 19, 2015, the Appeals Council vacated former ALJ Daugherty's decision and remanded the case to a new ALJ for a new hearing and further redetermination proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the new proceeding, the new ALJ was charged with determining whether Plaintiff \"was entitled to and eligible for benefits on November 2, 2009, the date SSA initially allowed the claim.\" ECF No. 43-3 at 20. By law, the new ALJ was prohibited from considering any evidence from Dr. Huffnagle in the redetermination proceeding, and Plaintiff was not permitted to challenge the exclusion of that evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 8, 2016, Plaintiff's counsel submitted a detailed Pre-Hearing Memorandum outlining Plaintiff's history of serious medical issues. ECF No. 43-7 at 93- 102. In this Memorandum, Plaintiff's counsel objected to the procedures being used in the redetermination process. Specifically, Plaintiff's counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Plaintiff] also objects that the procedures used in these redetermination proceedings violate his right to due process. First, there was a more than four year delay between the discovery of Mr. Conn's alleged fraud and the decision to hold a new hearing in [Plaintiff's] case. This delay has materially prejudiced [Plaintiff's] ability to present his case. In addition, [Plaintiff] has not been given a sufficient chance to object to the exclusion of the report of Dr. Frederic Huffnagle, M.D. For these reasons, [Plaintiff] respectfully asks the Court to order that his disability benefits be continued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94. The remainder of the Memorandum details Plaintiff's medical history during the relevant time period and contains substantive legal argument as to Plaintiff's disability claim and due process concerns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98-102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 10, 2016, the new ALJ held a video hearing, where Plaintiff was represented by counsel. On January 13, 2017 or\n   January 20, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the new ALJ issued an unfavorable decision finding that Plaintiff was not disabled during the relevant time period. The new ALJ determined that Plaintiff only suffered from severe impairments of anxiety and depression, and did not concur with former ALJ Daugherty's findings of numerous other severe impairments. ECF No. 43-3 at 24. The new ALJ found that Plaintiff's other impairments \"have been responsive to treatment, cause no more than minimal vocationally relevant limitations, have not lasted or are not expected to last at a 'severe' level for a continuous period of 12 months, are not expected to result in death, or have not been properly diagnosed by an acceptable medical source.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. Great weight was \"given to the assessment of... Mark Burns, M.D., the internal medicine consultative examiner,\" who opined that Plaintiff \"had no limitations in functions such as sitting, standing, lifting, or carrying.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. In contrast, little weight was \"given to the assessments of the State agency medical consultants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on the record (absent Dr. Huffnagle's report), the new ALJ found that Plaintiff \"had the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels but with the following nonexertional limitations: [Plaintiff] could tolerate occasional, superficial contact with the general public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. Based on this determination, the new ALJ found that Plaintiff \"was capable of performing past relevant work as a financial clerk and carpet measurer\" and was, therefore, not disabled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After the new ALJ's denial, Plaintiff requested review from the Appeals Council. Plaintiff's counsel submitted a detailed Memorandum of Law in Support of Request for Review, which again contained a detailed medical history, legal argument about Plaintiff's disability claim, and legal argument about Plaintiff's due process concerns. ECF No. 43-8 at 2-13. Plaintiff's counsel argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Plaintiff] is not guilty of any wrongdoing. He simply had the misfortune of hiring an attorney who allegedly did not live up to the ethical standards of the legal profession, and of having [his] case heard by an ALJ who decided to aid and abet Mr. Conn's misconduct. The fraud in this case was more or less out in the open from its inception, and it became public knowledge as early as 2011. As far as the Commissioner has revealed, there was no Department of Justice investigation that required a delay in re-determining the Conn cases. In light of all the facts and circumstances, [Plaintiff] would submit that the Commissioner failed to satisfy the statutory requirement that the reconsideration proceeding be conducted \"immediately.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. On June 20, 2017, the Appeals Council denied review of the new ALJ's decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History of Plaintiff's Request for Judicial Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On August 17, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in this Court, alleging five causes of action. ECF No. 1. Count I alleges violations of the SSA and accompanying regulations, Count II alleges violations of Plaintiff's due process rights,\n   Count III alleges violations of the APA, Count IV alleges that the ALJ's redetermination decision is unsupported by substantial evidence, and Count V alleges that the Appeals Council's decision is unsupported by substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. The following day, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, seeking to reinstate his DIB and SSI benefits during the pendency of this case. ECF No. 7. Defendant filed a Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction on November 21, 2017, and filed a Partial Motion to Dismiss on November 29, 2017. ECF Nos. 17, 21. Defendant's Partial Motion to Dismiss seeks dismissal of Counts I-III of Plaintiff's Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). ECF No. 21. Plaintiff filed a Response in Opposition to this Motion and a Reply in support of his Motion for Preliminary Injunction on December 13, 2017. ECF Nos. 23, 24. Defendant filed a Reply in support of her Partial Motion to Dismiss on December 19, 2017. ECF No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   These Motions were referred to United States Magistrate Judge Paige J. Gossett, who held a hearing on February 7, 2018. ECF No. 38. Counsel for the SSA participated in the hearing by telephone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On February 20, 2018, Judge Gossett issued a Report and Recommendation (\"Report\") recommending that Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction be denied. ECF No. 40. The Report acknowledged that several district courts have addressed the procedural due process issue, but emphasized that all but one have found no constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Plaintiff filed Objections to the Report, and Defendant filed an Answer to Plaintiff's Complaint. ECF Nos. 41, 42.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the parties filed briefs on the merits of Plaintiff's claims. ECF Nos. 52, 54, 61. Additionally, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Amend Complaint, seeking to challenge the appointment of the SSA's ALJs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On January 16, 2019, Magistrate Judge Gossett issued an Order staying the case and holding all pending motions in abeyance pending final resolution of a series of identical cases by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. ECF No. 70. The Order recognized that the Sixth Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Hicks v. Commissioner of Social Security\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519324\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/786/#p793\">\n    909 F.3d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2018), that the SSA \"had violated the claimants' procedural due process rights and the formal-adjudication requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Nonetheless, Magistrate Judge Gossett noted that the Sixth Circuit opinion contained a dissent and was not yet final because the SSA would likely be seeking rehearing\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On April 3, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Suggestion of Final Decision, informing the Court that the Sixth Circuit issued an Order denying the SSA's Petition for Rehearing En Banc. ECF No. 73. Defendant then filed a Supplemental Brief Regarding the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals Decision. ECF No. 74. By and large, Defendant's Supplemental Brief simply argued that the Sixth Circuit's majority opinion was incorrect and asked this Court to disregard its reasoning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In light of the uncertainty as to whether the SSA would seek certiorari in the Supreme Court, the lengthy process that would entail, the age of this case, and the need for Plaintiff to receive a final determination of his claims, the undersigned lifted the stay. ECF No. 76. Additionally, this Court assumed responsibility for determining the merits of Plaintiff's Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the Court held a telephonic status conference with the parties on May 16, 2019. ECF No. 82. During the call, the Court informed the parties that it would be assuming responsibility for disposition of this case, scheduled a final hearing for June 7, 2019, and directed that an attorney from the SSA should be present at the final hearing. ECF No. 82, 83. The Court heard oral arguments from all parties at the final hearing on June 7, 2019, and informed the parties that it would issue a ruling by written order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As detailed above, Plaintiff raises five claims in his Complaint. After reviewing the relevant law, the Court finds that the due process claim is dispositive of this case and limits its discussion to that issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Court has grave concerns about whether the SSA complied with the Act's \"immediacy\" requirement and the APA, the Court need not reach those issues to grant Plaintiff the relief he seeks in this case. For the reasons set forth below, the Court adopts the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   in toto and finds that the SSA's redetermination process violates the minimal requirements of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff's due process challenge focuses on the SSA's refusal to afford him an opportunity to rebut the OIG's determination that Mr. Conn procured Dr. Huffnagle's report by fraud. As an initial matter, this Court must determine what the appropriate test is for evaluating Plaintiff's due process claim. The Sixth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   adopted the claimants' argument that the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976), is not entirely dispositive of the unique claims in this case. Instead, the Sixth Circuit held that \"the SSA's procedures violate long-standing principles of procedural due process that predate the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   test.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519324\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/786/#p793\">\n    909 F.3d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Sixth Circuit alternatively held that \"[e]ven under\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ... plaintiffs would prevail.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519324\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/786/#p793\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After reviewing the arguments made by Plaintiff and Defendant in this case, the Court cautiously adopts the approach used by the Sixth Circuit. In doing so, the Court is nonetheless guided by the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , and finds no discord between the Sixth Circuit's approach and a more explicit application of\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   . It is often said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and, in accordance with that principle, the Court restates and incorporates by reference the relevant analysis by the Sixth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Long before\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized the 'immutable' principle that 'where governmental action seriously injures an individual, and the reasonableness of the action depends on\n   fact findings, the evidence used to prove the Government's case must be disclosed to the individual so that he has an opportunity to show that it is untrue.' \"\n   <em>\n    Greene v.

Not so. The Sixth Circuit did not hold that\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   is no longer good law.

Again, the SSA misses the point. Plaintiff is being completely precluded from rebutting a very material factual assertion about his case, i.e., that the Conn-related evidence was procured by fraud. It is unrealistic to require a claimant to be able to reconstruct their medical history from a decade ago, particularly within the short time table allotted by the SSA. Many, if not most, claimants provide the only copies of their medical records to their attorneys during the claims process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As the SSA acknowledges, Mr. Conn destroyed many of these records. But that is not the whole story. When Mr. Conn went to prison, \"approximately 6,000 to 7,000 client files relating to claims for social security benefits remained in his former Kentucky law office,\" which was forfeited to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Court Appoints Receivers to Inventory and Distribute Client Files of Lawyer Involved in Largest Social Security Fraud Scheme in History\n   </em>\n   , United States Department of Justice (Nov. 1, 2008).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, the Government did not provide these files-which indisputably belong to the clients-or even acknowledge their existence until after the initial redetermination hearings concluded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Distribution of these files brings along with it a host of problems, including locating thousands of Mr. Conn's clients who now may be homeless, destitute, and without a working telephone number. This highlights the fundamental unfairness in prohibiting Plaintiff, and other claimants, from challenging the SSA's apparently infallible determination that all of the records associated with the four doctors were procured by fraud. What if, for example, one of the doctors administered a quantitative IQ test to help demonstrate that a claimant met the applicable listing for intellectual disability? Should that claimant have the ability to prove that the objective test was scored correctly? Procedural due process dictates the answer to that question-a resounding, \"Yes.\" The risk of erroneously depriving Plaintiff of a fair hearing absent an opportunity to rebut the SSA's finding of fraud is simply intolerably high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, the burden on the Government in permitting Plaintiff to challenge the determination that Dr. Huffnagle's records are fraudulent is minimal when viewed in the context of the SSA's handling of this\n   scheme. Certainly, there will be a burden to the SSA in permitting Plaintiff to cross examine an OIG investigator about his or her determination of fraud. But the degree of that burden is largely of the SSA's own doing. The factual record is clear that the SSA was dilatory in taking any action to put an end to Mr. Conn's fraud. No one claims that Plaintiff had any knowledge of Mr. Conn's scheme, yet the SSA asks the Court to deprive Plaintiff of the opportunity to challenge the SSA's belated finding of fraud due to the effect it would have on the public fisc. Nonetheless, viewing the case as a whole, we do not \"believe that forcing OIG investigators to testify in over 1,500 redetermination hearings would be particularly onerous given that SSA investigators would have to do the same thing if they developed a 'reason to believe' fraud existed in 1,500 applications for benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519324\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/786/#p793\">\n    909 F.3d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (u) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Turning to the question of what remedy is appropriate, the Court finds that remand of Plaintiff's case to the SSA is proper. It is important to note, however, that the Court is expressly reversing the SSA's prior redetermination decision. Therefore, the Court is remanding this case to the SSA under Sentence Four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405g. As Judge Thapar wisely opined: \"If a process cannot be trusted, neither can its result. And a process that violates due process-as [Plaintiff's] redetermination process did-cannot be trusted. Its results therefore cannot stand.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks v.
