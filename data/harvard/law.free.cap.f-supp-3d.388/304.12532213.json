Defendants have counterclaimed, alleging that Starr has breached the insurance policy by refusing coverage, and seek a declaratory judgment that the insurance policy covers the Loss. Both parties move for partial summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Starr moves for partial summary judgment on the following issues: (1) that, to the extent there is a conflict between New York and Florida law, New York law applies to this dispute; (2) that a $3 million limit of liability applies to the German Warehouse; (3) that the Policy's Errors and Omissions Clause only applies to insured risks, and cannot be construed to add or extend coverage not already agreed to by Starr; and (4) that Starr's interpretation of terms contained in the Policy's \"Misappropriation Exclusion Clause\" is correct. In its motion, Brightstar seeks a ruling that the Misappropriation Exclusion Clause is inapplicable to the Loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the following reasons, this Court finds that there is no conflict between New York and Florida law as to any issue in this case and thus it will apply New York law, grants plaintiff summary judgment on the question of whether the German Warehouse was an \"unnamed location\" with a $3 million limit of liability, and rules that the Policy's Errors and Omissions Clause only applies to already-insured risks. The Court also grants defendants' motion for partial\n   summary judgment, ruling that the Misappropriation Exclusion Clause is inapplicable to the Loss at the German Warehouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Brightstar Corp. is incorporated in the state of Delaware and maintains its headquarters in Miami, Florida.

See Excerpts of Videotaped Deposition of Peter Scrobe, dated Nov. 4, 2016 (annexed as Ex. 5 to Durbin Decl.) (\"Scrobe Dep.\"), 53. In 2011, Starr issued a marine cargo insurance policy to Brightstar. See Brightstar Corporation Marine Cargo Insurance Policy, effective as of Mar. 26, 2011 (annexed as Ex. 3 to O'Malley Decl. and as Ex. 5 to Edwards Decl.) (the \"Policy\"), at 6, STARR 15574. Marsh USA acted as Brightstar's insurance broker in connection with the 2011 issuance of the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Jeffrey Factor in Support of Plaintiffs' Joint Motion to Compel Defendants (annexed as Ex. 46 to O'Malley Decl.) (\"Factor Decl.\"), \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Policy provided that it was \"continuous and cover[ed] all shipments of goods and/or merchandise and/or property made on/or and after 12:00 A.M. March 26, 2011 and on all goods and/or merchandise and/or property at locations on and after said time and date.\" Policy at 6, STARR 15574. The Policy did not contain a termination date, but was rather continuous unless cancelled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Also, it contained no choice of law or forum selection clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Policy contained a clause regarding the insurance of goods stored in warehouses in \"Endorsement No. 2,\" which is annexed to the Policy and shares its March 26, 2011, effective date. Policy at 36, STARR 15604. Endorsement No. 2 covered \"goods and merchandise which are owned by or held by the Assured in trust ... while temporarily detained in stores or warehouses, at any location worldwide.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Clause 9 of Endorsement No. 2 stated: \"The stores or warehouses to which these Assurers hereby extend approval and the limits of liability at each location are as follows.....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37, STARR 15605. Following this clause was a nine-page chart listing the names and addresses of particular warehouses, with individual corresponding limits of liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-47, STARR 15605-15. The German Warehouse was not included in this chart. Endorsement No. 2's Clause 11 stated \"[t]he un-named location limit of $3,000,000 is\n   provided without prior approval.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38, STARR 15606.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As to the adding of new locations, Endorsement No. 2 provided for \"[a]utomatic coverage up to $25,000,000 ... for new locations upon an affirmative representation by Brightstar to Marsh of specific location minimum standards noted below,\" and listed those \"minimum standards\" in a bullet-point list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47, STARR 15615 (emphasis omitted). Included in the \"minimum standards\" list was the clause: \"Submission to Marsh for review and notification to This Company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Endorsement No. 2 also included a requirement that stated \"[u]pon notification by the Insured and/or Marsh, Starr Marine will immediately order a location loss control survey and forward resulting recommendations for compliance as soon as received.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48, STARR 15616. During the term of Endorsement No. 2, additional warehouses were added to the Policy by separate endorsements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Endorsements Nos. 7-14, Policy at STARR 15628-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After Starr issued the Policy, certain of its terms and conditions were adjusted on an annual basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 23; Am. Ans. and Counterclaim, Am. Ans. \u00b6 23. As part of this annual adjustment, new warehouse endorsements were issued, beginning one year after March 26, 2011, which was the effective date of Endorsement No. 2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Endorsement No. 17, Policy at STARR 15638-44 (\"Endorsement No. 17\"); Endorsement No. 40, Policy at STARR 15701-04 (\"Endorsement No. 40\"). Arthur J. Gallagher (\"Gallagher\") replaced Marsh as Brightstar's insurance broker as of January 10, 2012, and negotiated Endorsements Nos. 17 and 40.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply to Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Endorsement No. 17 was signed by Starr on June 15, 2012, Policy at STARR 15644, but states that it is \"EFFECTIVE: MARCH 26, 2012,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15638. Endorsement No. 17 listed individual warehouses it insured in a schedule contained in its Clause 11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15639-43. The German Warehouse is not among them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Similar to Endorsement No. 2, Endorsement No. 17 stated: \"[a]utomatic coverage up to $25,000,000 ... is provided for new locations upon an affirmative representation of specific location minimum standards noted below, subject to receipt of quarterly statement of values.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15643. Once again, those \"minimum standards\" were contained in a bullet-point list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15643-44. Warehouses added during the term of Endorsement No. 17 were listed in separate endorsements amending Clause 11 of Endorsement 17, as were warehouses whose limits were increased during the course of Endorsement No. 17.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Endorsements Nos. 22, 24, 26, 27, 2934, Policy at STARR 15653-57, 15659-62, 15665-66, 15667-70, 15677-95. Endorsement No. 17 also contained a clause stating that \"[u]pon notification of any new location, Starr Marine will order a loss control survey and forward the resulting recommendations for compliance as soon as received.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15644.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Endorsement No. 40 was signed by Starr Marine on September 9, 2013,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15704, but states that it is \"EFFECTIVE: March 26, 2013,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15701. Unlike Endorsements Nos. 2 and 17, rather than listing all of the warehouses insured in a schedule contained in the Policy, Endorsement No. 40 states that it provides a \"25,000,000 Limit per occurrence at all locations as per schedule on file with underwriters, subject to Quarterly Statement of Values Report with actual values in storage at each location.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15702. As to new locations, Endorsement No. 40 stated the following: \"$25,000,000 Limit per occurrence for all newly [sic] locations (maximum 90 days to report) if they meet the minimum standards,\n   as stated below.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As in Endorsements Nos. 2 and 17, a number of requirements were listed in bullet points under the heading \"Minimum Standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15703. As was true for Endorsement No. 17, Endorsement No. 40 contained a clause providing that \"[u]pon notification of any new location, Starr Marine will order a loss control survey and forward the resulting recommendations for compliance as soon as received.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   All three endorsements, No. 2, No. 17, and No. 40, provided that any \"unnamed\" or \"unscheduled\" location would be insured up to $3,000,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15606, 15639, 15702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addition to the Policy, Brightstar maintained two excess insurance policies, the first of which was issued by Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, and the second of which was issued by Great American Insurance Company of New York, XL Specialty Insurance Company, Catlin Syndicate Limited, Montpelier at Lloyd's Limited, and Axis Specialty Europe SE (collectively the \"Excess Insurers\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint,\n   <em>\n    Great Am.

July 15, 2014) (Docket # 2) (\"Certain Underwriters' Compl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 7, 38, 40-41.

Starr argues that it never agreed to extend $25 million in coverage to the German Warehouse, under either Endorsement No. 17 or Endorsement No. 40, that the German Warehouse was not covered by the automatic coverage provisions of either endorsement, and that the German Warehouse was accordingly an \"unnamed location\" entitled to only $3 million in coverage, subject to applicable exclusions. Brightstar asserts that, under a number of different theories, a reasonable jury could find that it did obtain $25 million in coverage for the German Warehouse under the Policy. To evaluate each side's arguments, we first provide an overview of the facts relating to actions and discussions regarding the German Warehouse among the parties and Brightstar's insurance broker, Gallagher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The first reference to the German Warehouse in the record occurs during the term of Endorsement No. 17. It is contained in an email dated February 20, 2013, from Kevin O'Brien, Brightstar's Director of Global Security and Loss Prevention, to Peter Scrobe, Starr's Head of Loss Control Services. Email from Kevin O'Brien to Peter Scrobe, dated Feb. 20, 2013 (annexed as Ex. 20 to Durbin Decl.) (\"O'Brien Feb. 20, 2013, Email\"). In the email, O'Brien states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Pete,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   You were right, it is in Frankfurt. Here is the address to schedule the site survey &amp; point of contact. We are planning on beginning operations at the end of February, so we will have to move on this one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The email then provides the address of the German Warehouse and contact information\n   for Klaus Freese, a Brightstar Germany employee who O'Brien identifies as the point of contact for the German Warehouse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Several hours after receiving the email from O'Brien, Scrobe forwarded the email to Jeffrey Factor, the underwriter with Starr responsible for the Brightstar account, with copies to two other Starr employees, Maria Roman and Matthew Davis, and with the importance level marked to \"high.\" Email from Peter Scrobe to Jeffrey Factor, dated Feb. 20, 2013 (annexed as Ex. 21 to Durbin Decl.) (\"Scrobe Feb. 20, 2013, Email\"). In the email, Scrobe writes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Jeff, please note comments below, from Kevin O'Brien regarding new German operation.

While in previous years all of the insured warehouses had been listed in a chart contained in the relevant endorsement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Endorsement No. 2; Endorsement No. 17, this time Factor wanted to handle things differently. In the past, the amount of insurance coverage for each warehouse had been based on the amount of value in storage; if the amount of value increased, the limit would have to be changed through the issuance of a formal endorsement to the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Factor Dep. at 217. Factor \"wanted to try to streamline the process\" and wanted \"to cut down on the requirement for issuing endorsements,\" because, as Factor put it, Brightstar was \"a long-term partner, who was growing and who was constantly entering into and changing warehouses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead of listing all warehouses in a schedule contained in the warehouse endorsement and reporting limit change requests as the amount of value stored changed, Factor wanted Starr to insure each warehouse up to a limit of $25 or $50 million, \"subject to quarterly reporting,\" which \"would show [Starr] what was actually in storage at that time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 216; Email from Jeffrey Factor to Matthew Davis, dated Jan. 15, 2013 (annexed as Ex. 15 to Durbin Decl.)

First, Starr argues that Endorsement No. 17 did not provide automatic coverage of up to $25,000,000 to the German Warehouse because there is no evidence that the German Warehouse met several minimum standards, and because there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Brightstar made a required \"affirmative representation\" to Starr or Gallagher stating that the minimum standards were satisfied. Pl. Mem. at 24-25. Next, Starr argues that it never agreed to extend coverage to the German Warehouse during the term of Endorsement No. 17, and that accordingly the German Warehouse was an \"unnamed location\" under Endorsement No. 17.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-27. Brightstar responds that during Kevin O'Brien's March 7, 2013, security assessment trip, he determined that the German Warehouse did meet the Policy's minimum standards. Def. Opp. Mem. at 26. Brightstar also points to the opinions of one of its experts to suggest that a reasonable jury could conclude that the German Warehouse was covered by the Policy during the term of Endorsement No. 17. See id. at 17. Brightstar also argues that a reasonable jury could find that the German Warehouse was covered during the term of Endorsement No. 17 pursuant to what the parties have called an informal \"held coverage agreement.\" See id. at 10-11, 35-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Automatic Coverage Under Endorsement No. 17\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Clause 12 of Endorsement No. 17 of the Policy states: \"[a]utomtaic coverage up to $25,000,000 ... is provided for new locations upon an affirmative representation of specific location minimum standards noted below, subject to quarterly statement of values.\" Policy at STARR 15643. Included in the bullet-point list of minimum standards are the following requirements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   \u2022 Facility equipped with central station alarm - hot wired to local police and alarm company with line security\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   \u2022 Facility protected by guards 24/7 with call in times to a central station every hour - after hours, weekends, and holidays\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at STARR 15644.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As described above in Section I.B, though Brightstar conducted a security assessment of the German Warehouse and produced a report with its findings, there is no evidence in the record that anyone at Brightstar sent this report or otherwise communicated its findings to Starr, either directly or through Gallagher. The unambiguous language of Clause 12, however, requires that for \"[a]utomatic coverage\" to attach, there must be an \"affirmative representation of specific location minimum standards noted below,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in the listing of \"Minimum standards.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy at STARR 15643.

Though Starr acknowledges that there was no provision in Endorsement No. 17 or elsewhere in the Policy for adding a new warehouse location to the Policy,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25, Starr argues that Brightstar and Gallagher understood that Starr required particular information to add a new warehouse location to the Policy,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. This information consisted of the full name,\n   complete address, COPE details, limit required, and current value of inventory for the new warehouse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Starr argues that it had informed Gallagher of this requirement in July 2012, and that Brightstar had received similar information from both Gallagher and its prior broker, Marsh, in the past.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Starr argues that this information was also required before a warehouse could be covered under the parties informal \"held coverage\" agreement, whereby warehouses would be insured before a formal endorsement to the Policy was issued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply Mem. at 8. While this procedure was not written into the Policy, Starr argues, in essence, that the parties' communications and course of performance under the Policy supplemented the Policy to add these requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Brightstar focuses most of its argument in opposition by arguing that a reasonable jury could find that the German Warehouse was part of the schedule \"on file\" under Endorsement No. 40 (discussed in Section III.B.3.b below), but also appears to argue that the German Warehouse was covered under Endorsement No. 17. Brightstar states that its \"expert Michael Fitzgerald, who has more than forty years of experience in the marine industry ..., opines that the Frankfurt Warehouse was insured under the 2012 Starr Policy as a matter of industry standards and practices and the reasonable expectations of an insured like Brightstar.\" Def. Opp. Mem. at 17. Brightstar also suggests that this Court should find that the warehouse was covered pursuant to the informal \"held coverage\" arrangement at some point during the period when Endorsement No. 17 was in effect, suggesting that the \"held coverage\" agreement at some point applied to all of Brightstar's warehouses that were not yet listed in an official endorsement to the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. Mem. at 10-11 (arguing that in 2012, \"Starr agreed to insure warehouses before issuing formal endorsements, and without knowing precisely what warehouses were covered\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   To summarize, the parties acknowledge that the German Warehouse was not insured at the inception of Endorsement No. 17, and that there was no method outlined in the Policy for the addition of new warehouses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

In order to determine whether a reasonable jury could find that the German Warehouse was added to the Policy during the term of Endorsement No. 17, this Court must determine what the parties' agreement was relating to the addition of warehouses - in essence to supply the \"omitted term\" as to the method by which new locations were added.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \"When the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 204 (Am.

According to Starr, this \"required information\" included \"full name, complete address, COPE details, limit required and current value of inventory\" for each new warehouse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. Starr would then \"confirm its agreement to add a new named location by issuing an endorsement amending Clause 11 in Endorsement No. 17.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Starr also argues that Gallagher was required to send Starr the required information before a warehouse could be insured pursuant to the informal \"held coverage\" arrangement that was in place to cover warehouses whose coverage was being negotiated before a formal warehouse endorsement was issued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

An email sent from Jeffrey Factor at Starr to Robin Thompson at Gallagher on July 23, 2012, confirms that Starr did in fact state to Gallagher that it required certain information - including \"COPE Details\" - \"\n   <em>\n    [b]efore\n   </em>\n   we can add a location to the schedule.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Jeffrey Factor to Robin Thompson, dated July 23, 2012 (annexed as Ex. 8 to O'Malley Decl.) (emphasis added). The record also reflects that Gallagher communicated these requirements to Brightstar during the term of Endorsement No. 17. Thus, on January 21, 2013, in response to an email from a Brightstar employee asking what information Gallagher would need to provide to obtain coverage for additional retail locations (which were covered under Endorsement No. 17 in addition to warehouses),\n   Lisa Rodriguez at Gallagher responded: \"We need the same underwriting information we usually request for all your locations. You can use the same spreadsheet you have in the past. This includes: values per location, type of construction, type of security measures, area in meters or square feet at the location, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Lisa Rodriguez to Enrique Rodriguez, dated Jan. 21, 2013 (annexed as part of Ex. 9 to O'Malley Decl.). Emails in the record also indicate that Brightstar's previous broker, Marsh, required similar information each time Brightstar sought to add a new warehouse location to the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Email from Jason Wilson to Dario Guerra, dated June 17, 2011 (annexed as Ex. 6 to O'Malley Decl.) (\"Not able to proceed in placing additional cover at this location, until we receive the below requested information. As of right now, the unnamed location limit would apply, per policy terms and conditions.\"). Indeed, Brightstar's Kevin O'Brien, who sent the February 20, 2013, email about the German Warehouse, is copied on the email chain from Marsh regarding the information required to add a new warehouse to the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   In the end, there is simply no evidence that any location was ever added to the Policy as a scheduled location without COPE or security information first being supplied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   While it is ultimately not necessary to our decision, we note that Starr is also correct that any requests for changes in coverage under the Policy came from Gallagher, rather than directly from Brightstar. Other than the February 20, 2013, email from O'Brien - which is at the heart of this dispute - there is no record of any request to Starr to add a location from anyone at Brightstar itself. Also, during her deposition, Lisa Rodriguez recalled that during the course of the Policy, either she or Robin Thompson would receive information from Brightstar to transmit to Starr, and that \"[i]f there was going to be, for example, a change in the coverage required by the information being transmitted, [Brightstar] would probably come to me, so that we could add coverage, tweak coverage.\" Videotaped Deposition Testimony of Lisabet Rodriguez, dated Sept. 9, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Rodriguez Dep.\"), at 117-19. Rodriguez explained that when Brightstar required a change in the scope of its coverage, she \"would be talking to Starr and working with them\" to configure the specific wording to cover the specific exposure involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 119. Emails sent from Rodriguez's email address contained a disclaimer below the signature block, which stated: \"Please remember that coverage will not be bound, altered or changed bound until confirmation is provided in writing by this office.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Email from Lisa Rodriguez to Michael J. Mahoney et al., dated Oct. 18, 2013 (annexed as Ex. 92A to O'Malley Reply Decl.). Emails from Robin Thompson's email address contained the disclaimer \"Please note that coverage cannot be bound, altered or cancelled via email. Coverages and changes are effective once confirmed in writing by the carrier.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibits 92 B, C, D and E to O'Malley Reply Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   With respect to its position on the \"held coverage\" arrangement, Brightstar points to a single sentence in Factor's deposition in which he discusses whether there was coverage prior to a formal endorsement being issued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. Mem. at 11, 17 (citing Factor Dep. at 168-69). The testimony is confusing but appears to refer to the period that occurs \"days\" or \"weeks\" \"after binding,\" inasmuch as this is how\n   the question was put to Factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Factor Dep. at 167-69.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that Brightstar points to no other information on what the \"held coverage\" arrangement meant, or any other practice or written or oral understanding between the parties, we do not believe that a reasonable jury could conclude that Factor's testimony demonstrates the existence of some new or different method of adding a warehouse beyond the repeated practices of the parties just discussed. As already explained, the record shows that Gallagher had conveyed to Brightstar that \"values per location, type of construction, type of security measures, area in meters or square feet at the location, etc,\" was the information necessary for underwriting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Indeed, it appears that during the term of Endorsement No. 17, Brightstar did its part to follow this protocol with the respect to the German Warehouse by providing the information to Gallagher, but that Gallagher, for whatever reason, failed to forward the information to Starr.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rodriguez German Warehouse Email. As described in Section I.B above, on March 23, 2013, Enrique Rodriguez at Brightstar forwarded an email with COPE information for the German Warehouse to Thompson and others at Gallagher, and stated \"Please update accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This request, however, was never transmitted to Starr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   With respect to the \"held coverage\" arrangement, Brightstar does not point to any evidence in the record to suggest that there was some course of conduct or prior agreement under which it could obtain coverage by directly notifying Starr about a new warehouse without providing COPE details. Thus, the evidence in the record does not support Brightstar's contention that \"Starr agreed to insure warehouses before issuing formal endorsements ... without knowing precisely what warehouses were covered,\" Def. Opp. Mem. at 10 - that is, that the \"held coverage\" arrangement covered all warehouses that were ultimately added to the Policy before Starr had basic information or notice of those warehouses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In support of its position, Brightstar states that \"the list of warehouses in the 2012 warehouse endorsement that was ultimately signed and issued by Starr on June 15, 2012, effective March 26, 2012,\" - that is, those included in Endorsement No. 17 - \"is different from the list in the quote Starr sent to AJG on March 9, 2012.\" Def. Opp. Mem. at 11 (citing Endorsement No. 17 and Email from Jeffrey Factor to Lisa Rodriguez and Robin Thompson, dated Mar. 9, 2012 (annexed as Ex. 3 to Durbin Decl. and originally filed under seal as Ex. 14 to Durbin Decl.). However, as Starr points out in its briefing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply Mem. at 6-7, several days after Gallagher sent its first email to Starr with an attached schedule of locations, Gallagher sent on a revised schedule of locations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Email Chain (annexed as Ex. 76 to O'Malley Supp. Reply Decl. and originally filed under seal as Ex. 76 to O'Malley Reply Decl.), which ultimately became the list of locations included in Endorsement No. 17, except that Gallagher and Starr ultimately agreed to omit all locations with values under $500,000,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Cargo Quote (annexed as part of Ex. 76 to O'Malley Reply Decl.), at STARR 28995-99,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Policy at STARR 15640-43. A look at this entire chain of\n   correspondence shows that while Endorsement No. 17 was not issued until July 2013, Starr had notice of information for all of the warehouses included in Clause 11 of Endorsement No. 17 before the endorsement's effective date of March 26, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In the end, Brightstar does not point to any course of performance, course of dealing, or other evidence of interactions between Starr and Brightstar that would allow a jury to find an agreement under which coverage could be extended to a warehouse under Endorsement No. 17 simply by Brightstar sending an email, such as the O'Brien February 20, 2013, Email, to Starr. Rather, Brightstar relies on its expert, Michael Fitzgerald, whom they cite as concluding that \"the Frankfurt warehouse was insured under the 2012 Starr Policy as a matter of industry standards and practices and the reasonable expectations of an insured like Brightstar.\" Def. Opp. Mem. at 17. In the portion of his report cited by Brightstar,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Expert Report of Michael T. Fitzgerald, dated Mar. 14, 2018 (annexed as Exs. 15A and 15B to Edwards Decl.) (\"Fitzgerald Report\"), at 12, Fitzgerald states this conclusion, but it is not based on any explanation of industry standards that illuminate the arrangement the parties had reached. Rather, as Brightstar's brief concedes, it relies on Fiztgerald's view that, \" '[a]s a matter of industry custom and practice, had Starr complied with its own policy provisions, Brightstar's warehouse location in Germany would have been scheduled and insured under the Policy starting February 2013.' \" Def. Opp. Mem. at 17 (quoting Fitzgerald Report at 12). This statement refers to the fact that Starr never ordered a loss control survey following receipt of O'Brien's February 20, 2013, email as was contemplated by the new location clause of Endorsement No. 17. Thus, Fitzgerald seems to be asserting that this Court should engraft a provision into the Policy which states that in the event that Starr fails to order a survey upon notification (in any form) of a new location, then Starr should be responsible for any loss that occurs at that location, because the failure to formally schedule the location is Starr's fault. However, Fitzgerald never opines that there is an industry standard or practice with regard to the failure to perform a site survey when contractual language contemplates one - let alone one that would govern in the face of the contractual language here and the previous course of dealing between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Case law, too, shows the flaw in Brightstar's argument. To the extent Brightstar argues that industry custom should supply a term omitted from the contract, \"[g]enerally, evidence of industry custom is probative only if both parties to the pertinent contractual dealings knew or had reason to know of it.\"\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

In fact, Brightstar attempted to follow the process Starr asserts governed with respect to the German Warehouse, but Gallagher inexplicably failed to send the necessary information on to Starr. Because there is no evidence in the record suggesting that COPE and other required information was sent to Starr during the course of Endorsement No. 17, or that Starr agreed to insure the German Warehouse during the term of Endorsement No. 17, we find that no reasonable jury could find that the German Warehouse was covered by Endorsement No. 17, and that the German Warehouse was accordingly an \"unnamed\" location during the term of Endorsement No. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Coverage Under Endorsement No. 40\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Starr next moves for summary judgment with respect to several questions related to coverage under Endorsement No. 40. First, Starr argues that no reasonable jury could find that the German Warehouse qualified for automatic coverage under Endorsement No. 40 because there is no evidence in the record that it met two of the required minimum standards. Pl. Mem. at 28. Next, Starr argues that the German Warehouse was not \"on the schedule on file\" with Starr, but rather was an \"unnamed location,\" and thus was not entitled to $25 million in coverage under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Brightstar opposes Starr's request for summary judgment regarding coverage under Endorsement No. 40 on several grounds. First, Brightstar argues that there is at least a question of fact as to whether the German Warehouse met the minimum standards based on the conclusions Kevin O'Brien made after conducting his security assessment. Def. Opp. Mem. at 39-40. Brightstar also argues that even if the German Warehouse did not meet minimum standards, the Florida \"anti-technical\" statute would result in coverage because the minimum standards that were purportedly not met would not have increased\n   the hazard of a loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. Brightstar also argues that under a variety of theories, a reasonable jury could find that the German Warehouse was \"on file\" with Starr at the time of the loss and thus was covered up to $25 million. Finally, Brightstar argues that even if the German Warehouse did not meet minimum standards and was not \"on file\" with Starr, Starr should be deemed to have waived these requirements, or should be estopped from arguing that the Warehouse does not qualify for $25 million in coverage, because it failed to order a survey and add the German Warehouse to its schedule despite the February 20, 2013, email from O'Brien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46.

However, Brightstar does not point to any portion of O'Brien's deposition testimony in which he states that such a system was in place at the German Warehouse. Nor does Brightstar point to any provision in the Security Assessment that suggests that the German Warehouse had such a system in place. Brightstar notes, with respect to the second minimum standard, that the Security Assessment does state that the warehouse \"had an onsite 24/7 security guard operation supported by external alarm monitoring.\" Def.

While this is true, Brightstar does not point to any provision in the Security Assessment indicating that the guards at the German Warehouse had \"call in times to a central station every hour - after hours, weekends, and holidays,\" and there is no indication in the Security Assessment that this part of the minimum standard was met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Brightstar cites a portion of Oscar Fumagali's deposition testimony in which he\n   states that O'Brien specifically determined, during his March 7, 2013, visit, that the German Warehouse complied with the minimum standards in Endorsements Nos. 17 and 40.\n   <em>\n    The Florida Anti-TechnicalSee\n   </em>\n   Def.

In response to the question of how Brightstar determined that the minimum standards were met, Fumagali testified that \"we are very familiar with the security requirements and standards set by C.V. Starr,\" as Brightstar had \"been operating with C.V. Starr for a number of years, and with Peter Scrobe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response to the question of whether O'Brien's report represented that the German Warehouse met minimum standards, Fumagali explained that O'Brien \"represented to everyone, including Arthur Gallagher, and myself, and our operations people, that it did meet the requirements, and we could start operations there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 210. When asked whether O'Brien took the minimum standards off the policy and checked off, one by one, whether the German Warehouse met each of the minimum standards, Fumagali stated that he did not know.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 213-14. Fumagali explained that if \"Mr. O'Brien, who was a director in the company, and a professional security person who had significant credibility with [Starr's] Peter Scrobe ... said that the location, after his inspection, met the requirements, it met the requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 214-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In his own deposition testimony, O'Brien states that he never used actual \"insurance binders\" - that is, documents containing the minimum standards in the Endorsements - for the purpose of \"security practices.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Brien Dep. at 59. O'Brien affirmed that it was his job to ensure that all of Brightstar's warehouses met the \"minimum standards of care\" contained in the marine cargo policy,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 222, and that he performed this function by visiting warehouses and ensuring that requirements contained in \"the appendixes\" and the required \"warranties\" were met.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In light of the above, Brightstar has not pointed to any evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find that either of the disputed minimum standards were met. While O'Brien testified that it was his job to ensure that Brightstar's warehouses met minimum standards,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   O'Brien Dep. at 222, Brightstar does not point to any portion of O'Brien's testimony in which he states that the German Warehouse's alarm system was \"hot wired\" to law enforcement, or that its guards had \"call in times to a central station every hour - after hours, weekends and holidays.\" Brightstar provides an excerpt of O'Brien's testimony in which he discusses his understanding of the meaning of having a \"direct line to a police station,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. Mem. at 40, but does not point to any testimony as to whether O'Brien knew such a system to be in place at the German Warehouse. Fumagali's conclusory statements, unsupported by any personal knowledge, that the German Warehouse met minimum standards are clearly insufficient to support a jury finding that the minimum standards were met. Accordingly, because there is no evidence that these conditions precedent to coverage were satisfied, no reasonable jury could find that coverage attached pursuant to the automatic coverage provision of Endorsement No. 40 unless compliance with these conditions can be deemed to be excused.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oppenheimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4437818\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/86/685/#p690\">\n    86 N.Y.2d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4437818\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/86/685/#p690\">\n    636 N.Y.S.2d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4437818\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/86/685/#p690\">\n    660 N.E.2d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the nonoccurrence of the condition may yet be excused by waiver, breach or forfeiture\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    The Florida Anti-Technical Statute\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Brightstar argues that even if the German Warehouse did not comply with minimum standards, Starr is \"estopped from denying coverage for the Frankfurt warehouse, even if it was not 'on file' with Starr or even if it did not comply with the minimum standards in the Starr Policy ... for three independent reasons.\" Def.

Because the German Warehouse was not on the spreadsheet attached to the March 19, 2013, email, and because Gallagher did not send Starr the required information prior to the Loss and confirm that coverage was bound, Starr argues that the German Warehouse was not part of the \"schedule on file\" prior to the Loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Brightstar first contends that a reasonable jury could find that the German Warehouse was \"on file\" with Starr because Starr made a number of changes in Endorsement No. 40: specifically, Starr no longer required Brightstar's \"master spreadsheet\" but rather insured all warehouses that were \"on file\"; Starr did not have to approve the addition of new warehouses to the Policy; and, because the premium charged to Brightstar was based on sales and revenue generated by sales - including sales associated with the German Warehouse - no additional premium for the German Warehouse was required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. Mem. at 33-36. Second, Brightstar points to its expert reports to argue that the O'Brien February 20, 2013, Email to Scrobe \"was sufficient to amend the schedule on file with Starr as a matter of industry custom and practice and the reasonable expectations of insureds like Brightstar.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.607\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, Brightstar argues that a reasonable jury could find that Starr's receipt on November 5, 2013, of Brightstar's updated quarterly SOV, including the German Warehouse, operated to add the German Warehouse to the schedule on file.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.607\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Brightstar also opposes Starr's application for summary judgment on the question of whether the German Warehouse was an unnamed location, asserting that \"[n]o reasonable finder of fact could conclude that the Frankfurt location was an unnamed location.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.607\">\n    at 42-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   We next address these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    The Meaning of the Phrase \"Schedule on File With Underwriters\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   In order to determine whether the German Warehouse was part of the \"schedule on file with underwriters,\" we must first determine the meaning of that phrase.

Taking these provisions into account, the only reasonable interpretation of a \"schedule on file with underwriters\" of \"all locations\" which receive a \"$25,000,000 Limit per occurrence,\" is that the \"schedule on file with underwriters\" is an exhaustive list of all warehouse locations that are insured above the unnamed/unscheduled location limit under the renewal endorsement, analogous to the schedules actually contained in Endorsement No. 2 and Endorsement No. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Brightstar implicitly argues that the phrase \"schedule on file with underwriters\" means every location of which Starr had notice, regardless of whether the location was included in a list or simply in the email account of a Starr underwriter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. Mem. at 33. Brightstar argues that the parties' intention to move from insuring specific warehouses listed in schedules to insuring all warehouses that were \"on file\" - in any manner - with Starr is evidenced by the language of Endorsement 40.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202738,6050022\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/63/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But this position is unsupportable. In advancing its position, Brightstar repeatedly ignores the word \"schedule,\" asserting that warehouses that were somehow \"on file\" with Starr were insured up to a $25 million limit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33, 34, 36, 39, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47. But the clear language of Endorsement No. 40 provided $25 million in coverage for all locations that were part of the \"\n   <em>\n    schedule\n   </em>\n   on file\" with underwriters. If the parties had wanted eschew the use of an actual list of warehouse locations, they would not have used the word \"schedule,\" which, as noted above, is used consistently throughout the Policy to refer to an actual list. Indeed, Brightstar, by ignoring the word \"schedule\" in its argument, implicitly acknowledges that its argument does not apply if the enhanced coverage in Endorsement No. 40 applies to warehouses on a \"schedule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Incorporation by Reference\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Though the $25 million limit applied to \"all locations as per schedule on file with underwriters, subject to Quarterly Statement of Values Report with actual values in storage at each location,\" no\n   \"schedule\" was listed in Endorsement No. 40, as had been the case with Endorsement No. 2 and Endorsement No. 17.

See\n   Email from Mauricio Cabello to Robin Thompson and Jessica Azucena, dated Sept. 9, 2013 (annexed as part of Ex. 23A to O'Malley Decl.).

Email from Jessica Azucena to Jeffrey Factor, dated Oct. 3, 2013 (annexed as part of Ex. 26B to O'Malley Decl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The parties' course of performance consistently shows that to add a new warehouse location to the Policy, Brightstar would supply information for the new location, including COPE information, to Gallagher, who would then forward the information to Starr, and Starr would then verify with Gallagher that Brightstar wanted coverage to be \"bound\" for a certain additional premium.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carol B\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3800624,3788439,3788495\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/54/653/\">\n    54 A.D.3d at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788495\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/54/653/3788495/\">\n    865 N.Y.S.2d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The parties' course of conduct under a contract is persuasive evidence of their agreed intention.\"). Brightstar points to nothing that suggests that the parties followed any other process for adding locations during this period. And Brightstar does not suggest that it followed this process (or anything remotely resembling it) for the German Warehouse during the Endorsement No. 40 period. Certainly, Starr never had an exchange in which it informed Brightstar or Gallagher of the additional premium for the German Warehouse and never confirmed with Brightstar or Gallagher that coverage would be \"bound.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Brightstar's position is that the move to insuring all locations \"as per schedule on file with underwriters\" rather than listing each insured warehouse in an actual schedule, in the Policy was a \"significant and dispositive change\" that resulted in the German Warehouse being part of the \"schedule on file\" at the inception of Endorsement No. 40.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. Mem. at 33. In essence, Brightstar's argument is that while under Endorsement No. 17 the only \"scheduled\" locations were those locations actually listed in the Policy (or insured pursuant to the \"held coverage\" agreement before a formal endorsement was issued), under Endorsement No. 40 all locations of which Starr had any notice were considered scheduled locations because they were in some sense \"on file\" with Starr.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788495\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/54/653/3788495/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Brightstar thus attempts to argue that the German Warehouse was \"on file\" with Starr because the warehouse had been referenced in the O'Brien February 20, 2013, Email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   It is of course telling that Brightstar repeatedly makes the argument that the German Warehouse was \"on file,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def. Opp. Mem. at 7, 17, 19-20, 26, 32-33, 43, without referring to the actual language of Endorsement No. 40 itself, which is \"schedule on file.\" Using the more amorphous - and ultimately irrelevant - concept of whether the German Warehouse was somehow \"on file,\" Brightstar points to several different types of extrinsic evidence to support its position. In its most simplistic argument, Brightstar argues that the German Warehouse was \"on file\" with Starr, because Factor at one point in his deposition stated that Starr sometimes kept hard copies of emails \"filed in the file\" for a particular account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. Mem. at 33 (citing Factor Dep. at 66). Specifically, Starr kept hard copy binders for each client account, which included six sections, one of which would contain emails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Factor Dep. at 66. Factor also testified that Starr maintained an electronic file for each client which would contain \"relevant documents, like the quotes and the binders,\" as well as ratings contained in Excel spreadsheets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 67. Factor explained that he would usually just file emails in relevant folders in his email system, rather than include them in his electronic or paper file for each client.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-68. This portion of Factor's deposition testimony makes no reference to any \"schedule on\n   file.\" Rather, Factor appears to be explaining Starr's filing system for organizing various documents related to client accounts, as well as his personal method of organizing his emails. No reasonable jury could find this deposition testimony to provide any support for Brightstar's contention that because of this practice, the O'Brien February 20, 2013, Email constituted part of \"the schedule on file with underwriters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Brightstar tries to counter the evidence regarding the consistent practice of how new locations were added to the Policy under Endorsement 40 by arguing that the email exchange concerning the addition of the Sri Lankan warehouses \"do[es] not support [Starr's] contention that any 'approval' was required after Starr was notified of new locations in 2013.\" Def. Opp. Mem. at 34. Brightstar implies that an email from Gallagher to Starr stating \"Attached please find information on new warehouses in Sri Lanka for your file\" shows that notification was enough to bind coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Brightstar also points out that while Gallagher's email referred to an \"endorsement/invoice,\" no endorsement for Sri Lanka was made to the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, Brightstar references Factor's email in which he states that \"[f]or warehouse additions, there is no need to endorse the policy,\" and instructs Gallagher to ensure that the new locations are included in the next quarterly SOV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   These arguments, however, ignore the fact that, as described above, the email chain includes COPE information for the new locations, includes an email from Factor quoting additional premium of $2,034 for the locations and asking Gallagher to \"confirm if [Starr] should bind coverage, and includes an email from Factor providing a finite list of new locations, with corresponding dates of coverage and additional premium charged. The lack of any need to \"endorse\" the policy is simply Factor reminding Thompson that Endorsement No. 40 did not contemplate a need to issue a formal endorsement. No reasonable jury could find this email exchange to indicate that Starr's approval was no longer required for new locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   In support of its contention that the German Warehouse was part of the \"schedule on file\" with Starr, Brightstar also argues that premium was paid for the German Warehouse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. Mem. at 34. Brightstar points to deposition testimony of Gallagher's Lisa Rodriguez, in which she states that \"the premium was rated 100 percent based on sales,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (citing Rodriguez Dep. at 170), and notes that \"in 2013, those sales included sales for Germany associated with the Frankfurt Warehouse,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   There is certainly some confusion as to what degree Brightstar's total sales figured into the premium that was charged at the time of the renewal in 2013. In her deposition testimony, Rodriguez explains that \"the policy has traditionally been rated 100 percent based on sales and not on exposures at risk in warehouses.\" Rodriguez Dep. at 170. However, Rodriguez explained that before the 2013 adjustment, Starr \"took the rate that they had provided, which is the same rate that the policy had from its inception, and they split the rate and backed into a flat premium for the static\" - that, is for the warehouses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 170-71. Rodriguez ultimately testified that the premium rate for 2013 was based on the \"rate that [Starr] had provided, which [was] the same rate the policy had from its inception,\" and that rate was used to \"back[ ] into a flat premium for the static.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   This is consistent with Factor's deposition testimony and the report of Brightstar's expert Jeffrey Posner, which both state that the premium for the 2013 adjustment was based largely on what Brightstar was willing to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Factor Dep. at 269-70 (stating that \"[w]e basically knew from the broker, what Brightstar was willing to pay,\" and explaining how Starr considered the amount of value in storage to arrive at a premium number for warehouses that was \"commensurate with the risk\" that Brightstar would be willing to pay, and noting that sales were used to calculate the transit premium); Expert Report of Jeffrey M. Posner, dated Mar. 14, 2018, annexed as Ex. 25 to Durbin Decl. (\"Posner Report\"), at 8 (\"Starr [did not] use any statement of values to calculate the 2013 policy year. The underwriter, Jeffrey Factor, testified that the premium was based on his discussions with AJG regarding what premium would be acceptable to Brightstar.\"). In his March 19, 2013, email, Factor states that \"we can agree to a FLAT warehouse premium of $1,750,000,\" for \"[a]ll locations currently listed\" in the annexed spreadsheet, which did not include the German Warehouse. Factor March 19, 2013, Email. In the end, Brightstar has not pointed to evidence that would allow a jury to find that the premium actually would have been less had sales from the German Warehouse not been included in information provided to Starr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   In any event, this issue is a red herring for two reasons. First, even if revenue from the German Warehouse had been included in the calculation of the premium, this would be consistent with the fact that the German Warehouse was still covered under the Policy as an unnamed location and would not prove that it was part of the \"schedule on file.\" Second, when new locations were added during the Endorsement No. 40 period through the process already described, an additional premium was always charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rodriguez Dep. at 173 (answering \"[y]es\" to the question \"[i]sn't it also true that if any new warehouses were added after the inception of the 2013-2014 policy, there would be an additional premium charged?\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Email from Jeffrey Factor to Jessica Azucena, dated Oct. 11, 2013 (annexed as part of Ex. 28 to O'Malley Decl.). That Gallagher was well aware of this was further demonstrated by the fact that Gallagher sought to pay additional premium retroactively to cover the German Warehouse after the Loss occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rodriguez Nov. 20, 2013, Email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Brightstar also points to the reports of its experts, who opine that the German Warehouse was added to the schedule on file prior to the loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Posner purports to speak to the meaning of the phrase \"schedule on file\" with respect to the customs of the insurance industry. In his report, Posner explains that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   [t]he phrase \"schedule on file with underwriters\" is used frequently in first party insurance policies, such as property insurance policies and marine cargo insurance policies. Insurance companies use the phrase \"statement of values on file with underwriters\" to convey the same concept - that the insurer has been provided with notice of the locations to be insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Posner Report at 7-8. While stating that the term conveys the \"concept\" that an insurer has been provided notice of a location, Posner nowhere suggests that the term \"schedule on file with underwriters\" has a \"fixed and invariable meaning\" or is \"notorious\" in the industry and thus applies to its usage in any contract. Instead he talks about how the phrase is used \"frequently\" in a certain manner.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802920\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/107/#p134\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is insufficient to allow a trier of fact to conclude that the phrase \"schedule on file\" had such a meaning that would require the finder of fact to ignore the evidence in the record as to its meaning in Endorsement No. 40. Posner goes on to speak vaguely of \"custom, practices, and/or standards\" of the insurance industry regarding notification of a new location,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, but without providing specifics as to their prevalence or application, let alone their invariability or notoriousness. For example, with respect to amending the \"schedule on file with underwriters,\" Posner talks in vague terms about what a policyholder will \"typically\" do to notify an underwriter of additions, deletions, or material changes in values at locations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, even Posner concludes as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   When notifying an underwriter of changes during the course of the year, a policyholder may not actually change the initial or current statement of values (or schedule depending upon how one refers to it) but may do it by sending an email, which includes\n   <em>\n    the required information\n   </em>\n   such as the location address, the estimated values and\n   <em>\n    possibly COPE information if that is required.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In other words, Posner does not provide support for Brightstar's\n   contention that the \"schedule on file\" necessarily means every warehouse of which an insurer has any notice irrespective of the terms of the policy. Rather, his report suggests that the \"schedule on file\" generally constitutes a list that is updated when the insured provides \"required information\" about new locations to the underwriter during the term of the Policy. Neither in this paragraph or elsewhere in his report does Posner qualify his statement about the need for the insured to provide \"required\" information to update the initial schedule on file. He also does not grapple at all with whether any custom and practice would still apply where the insurer requires the insured to verify the completeness of a schedule prior to binding coverage and no change is made to that schedule. Nor does he address the situation where a consistent course of performance was undertaken to add new locations. In the end, a reasonable jury could not use Posner's report to find that the \"schedule on file with underwriters\" means any warehouse of which Starr was given notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Brightstar also argues that Gallagher is Starr's agent, and accordingly Gallagher's receipt of the required information for the German Warehouse in March 2013 should be imputed to Starr.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Def. Opp. Mem. at 39.

Rather, the term \"schedule on file with underwriters\" consists only of those warehouses contained in the spreadsheet attached to Factor's March 19, 2013, email, as updated by additional warehouses that Starr agreed to insure after receiving required information from Gallagher and charging additional premium. The parties' course of performance under Endorsement No. 40, evidenced by numerous emails, shows a consistent practice for adding new warehouses to the schedule, which was not followed for the German Warehouse.

Def. Opp. Mem. at 35-36. Essentially, Brightstar argues that Factor's failure to order a survey or otherwise follow up on the Scrobe February 20, 2013, Email should waive the requirements that the warehouse be part of the \"schedule on file\" or comply with the minimum standards, or should otherwise estop Starr from denying full coverage for the German Warehouse.

Brightstar contends that this provision obligated Factor to order a survey of the German Warehouse upon receipt of the Scrobe February 20, 2013, Email, and that his failure to do so resulted in a waiver,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.

There are several reasons why it was \"unreasonable\" for Brightstar to conclude that coverage for the German Warehouse would be bound, without more, based on the February 20, 2013, email and the above-described clause. Most strikingly, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that it would have been reasonable for Brightstar to believe that the German Warehouse was covered shortly after O'Brien sent his email, having heard nothing to the contrary from Starr, Brightstar could not reasonably have relied on Starr's non-response to the O'Brien February 20, 2013, Email after Factor sent his March 19, 2013, email containing a full list of warehouses to be verified by Brightstar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply Mem. at 35. At this point, Brightstar was put on unmistakable notice that Starr had not included the German Warehouse in its schedule of locations, and any assumption that the German Warehouse had been \"added\" was no longer reasonable. What is more, Starr explicitly asked Brightstar, through Gallagher, to \"please confirm that all locations are listed,\" Factor March 19, 2013, Email, and indeed Brightstar assigned someone to verify the list,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fumagali Dep. at 232. Starr was never informed that Brightstar believed that the German Warehouse was included.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   In addition, as we have discussed, the record indicates that it was the parties' course of performance for a survey to be conducted after Starr agreed to add a new warehouse to the Policy after receiving COPE and other required information, such that it would not be reasonable for Brightstar to believe that a survey would be ordered without sending the required information first.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.3.b.iii above. Numerous emails contained in the record, which were sent during the terms of Endorsements Nos. 17 and 40, demonstrate this course of performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Jeffrey Factor to Robin Thompson, dated July 23, 2012 (annexed as Ex. 8 to O'Malley Decl.) (advising Thompson of the information required to \"add a location to the schedule,\" and stating that \"\n   <em>\n    once added\n   </em>\n   , we will need contact details for a possible survey\") (emphasis added); Email from Jeffrey Factor to Robin Thompson, dated May 1, 2012 (annexed as Ex. 79 to O'Malley Supp. Reply Decl. and originally filed under seal as Ex. 79 to O'Malley Reply Decl.) (in response to email chain from Brightstar sending on COPE information to add a new location to the Policy, and email from Gallagher asking\n   for confirmation that the location is covered, stating \"[t]hanks Robin, you can move forward with this location, we will order a survey and all recommendations must be complied with within thirty days of request\"); Email from Jeffrey Factor to Jessica Azucena, dated Oct. 3, 2013 (annexed as Ex. 27 to O'Malley Decl.) (in email chain regarding the addition of a new warehouse to the Policy, which included Brightstar sending COPE and other required information to Gallagher to be forwarded to Starr, statement from Factor saying \"[o]nce we have your confirmation, we will order survey and list Robin [Thompson's] name as the contact\"); Email from Jeffrey Factor to Robin Thompson, date omitted (annexed as part of Ex. 24A to O'Malley Decl.) (stating that if Gallagher agrees to Starr's proposed terms for adding additional warehouses to the Policy, \"I will order the surveys with you as the contact\"). Brightstar points to no evidence to suggest that Starr had in the past ordered a survey immediately upon receiving any type of notice about the existence of a new warehouse. Further, the record shows that Starr would not require surveys for locations below the unnamed location limit, which undermines Brightstar's implicit contention that a survey was required upon any type of notice of any warehouse location. Indeed, Kevin O'Brien informed other Brightstar employees that \"[y]ou can store up to $3 million [in value in a warehouse] without a survey.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Kevin O'Brien to Con Limogiannis, dated Nov. 28, 2013 (annexed as Ex. 90 to O'Malley Reply Decl.). And, even though O'Brien's February 20, 2013, email specifically mentions a survey, there is no evidence in the record that the parties ever commenced the addition of a warehouse to the Policy in such a manner. In light of these circumstances, and in light of the fact that the parties had a clearly established course of performance for adding a new warehouse location to the Policy, detailed in Section III.B.3.b above, no reasonable jury could find that it was \"reasonable\" for Brightstar to rely on Starr's lack of a response to the O'Brien February 20, 2013, Email as an indication that coverage was bound for the German Warehouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   The cases that Brightstar cites in support of its contention that \"silence or acquiescence by an insurer has frequently been held to be a proper basis for waiver, estoppel and/or agreement by the insurer,\" Def.

The parties have stipulated that the loss was caused by \"misappropriation, secretion, conversion, infidelity or a dishonest act.\" Letter from Mark L. Durbin, filed May 8, 2018 (Docket # 123), at 2.

We address next only the meaning of \"controlled\" because it is sufficient to dispose of the parties' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Starr argues that \"[i]n the context of this case, a warehouse 'controlled by the Assured' is one that the assured exercises influence over.\" Pl. Opp. Mem. at 7. Starr argues, in essence, that the contractual rights Brightstar obtained through its contracts with getgoods is the type of \"control\" over \"warehouses\" contemplated by the Misappropriation Exclusion Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-11. Brightstar argues that the Misappropriation Exclusion Clause \"plainly uses the term 'control' to mean dominion, or physical control,\" over an entire warehouse, \"not merely to goods stored within those warehouses or merely to areas within warehouses where such goods are stored.\" Def. Mem. at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Agreements Between Brightstar and getgoods\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Because Brightstar's relationship to the German Warehouse arose only through Brightstar's contractual arrangements with getgoods, we first look to the two documents that governed the relationship between Brightstar and getgoods regarding the storage of Brightstar's goods at the German Warehouse. One was the \"Master Agreement for Performance of Logistics Services\" (annexed as Ex. 65 to O'Malley Opp. Decl.) (\"Master Agreement\"). The other was Brightstar's \"Standard Operating Procedure for 3PL Warehousing, Frankfurt (Oder) - Germany\" (annexed as Ex. 66 to O'Malley Opp. Decl.) (\"SOP\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   The Master Agreement provides that \"getgoods shall perform logistics services on behalf of the Client in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\" Master Agreement at 1.1. The Master Agreement contains several \"annexes,\" including Annex A, which governed warehousing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at BSupp00000267. Annex A \"govern[ed] the warehousing of goods of the Client [Brightstar] and the activities to be performed by getgoods in the field of order picking.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Annex provides, in several instances highlighted by Starr,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. Mem. at 13-14, for Brightstar to give getgoods specific instructions regarding the handling of its goods at the German Warehouse. For example, the Annex provides that \"[t]he Client shall hand over the goods described in the Warehousing Process Description (Annex II.A.1) for warehousing and shall provide getgoods in\n   good time with all information and instructions necessary for appropriate warehousing and treatment.\" Master Agreement at 1.1.1. The Annex also provides that \"getgoods shall assemble consignments for shipment from the warehouse (order picking) on behalf of the Client,\" and that \"[t]hese services shall be performed in accordance with specific instructions from the Client to the extent that such are confirmed by getgoods in the given individual case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.1.5. The Annex provides that getgoods shall perform \"[o]rder picking and removal from storage in accordance with [Brightstar Germany's] written instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.1(c). With respect to Brightstar's rights of access to the warehouse, the Annex provides that Brightstar Germany \"shall be entitled - having provided suitable advance notice - to inspect the warehouse space or have the warehouse space inspected during customary business hours and in the presence of a getgoods employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.1. With respect to \"inbound storage,\" the Annex provides that \"[u]pon inbound storage, getgoods shall record the goods designations, volume and batch number of the goods to be stored and record this information in the warehouse stock programme,\" and that Brightstar Germany \"shall be entitled to inspect the warehouse register in respect of the accuracy and completeness of the goods it has stored.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.3. In sum, the Master Agreement allowed Brightstar to closely direct the way in which getgoods handled Brightstar's own goods, but did not give Brightstar the right to direct getgoods' management of the warehouse and did not give Brightstar the right to direct the manner in which getgoods handled other clients' goods. The Master Agreement also gave Brightstar certain inspection rights, though it did not give Brightstar the right to enter the German Warehouse without prior permission from getgoods and accompaniment by a getgoods employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   As Starr highlights in its briefing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. Mem. at 15-16, the SOP similarly provides, in several instances, for Brightstar's involvement with and supervision of the handling of its goods by getgoods, which is referred to in the SOP as the \"Third Party Logistics Provider.\" The SOP's \"Purpose and scope\" states that \"[t]he purpose of this document is to outline key processes and procedures that Brightstar requires from the designated Third Party Logistics Provider (3PL) [that is, getgoods] to provide to the business in warehouse operations and forward and reverse logistics to the customers channel.\" SOP at 1.0. The SOP provides that getgoods' \"[r]esponsibilities required, but [were] not limited to: ... [p]rovid[ing] efficient Logistic services [i]n line with the stated minimum service levels,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.0, including \"[s]ecure warehousing, onsite guarding for site access, CCTV (storage of recordings is currently a month) in main storage, inwards &amp; dispatch areas and also other areas of operation where our product may be located,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to the arrival of a shipment at the German Warehouse, the SOP lists \"some of the points which Brightstar requires of the 3PL provider at the time of stock arriving at your site,\" including \"[c]heck[ing] the quantity of cartons or pallets when offloading pallet from the truck,\" with \"any discrepancy ... to be reported to Brightstar immediately.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.2(2). The SOP provides that \"[t]he decision to receive or reject a shipment if any loss or damage needs to be agreed upon with a Brightstar representative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.3. The SOP also contains \"Key operating procedures\" that governed \"[r]eceiving and [p]ut away,\" which included, among other procedures, that \"[o]nce received into the 3PL providers' WMS and ready for put away all stock will need to be wrapped or strapped sufficiently for put\n   away within facilities racking system (within 3PL providers OH &amp; S requirements) ... for security and safety purposes,\" and \"[n]o double stacking of the pallets with product on it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.1, 5.3. The SOP also includes site security requirements mandated by Brightstar, such as \"[s]ecure warehousing, including 24 hour on site security and CCTV in storage and working areas of operation,\" \"[s]ite audits by Brightstar and or associated insurance parties ... required with 24 hours notification,\" and a requirement that Brightstar's inventory \"be stored separately from the rest of the 3PL operation,\" with access \"restricted to supervisory or authorized personnel involved with the management of Brightstar's goods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.0-13.3. Thus, the provisions of the SOP highlighted by Starr pertain to the handling and storage of Brightstar's goods as well as some requirements regarding overall site security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Whether the German Warehouse was \"Controlled by the Assured\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Starr argues that language in the Master Agreement and the SOP show that Brightstar \"controlled\" the German Warehouse, Pl. Opp. Mem. at 13, and that \"Brightstar Germany exercised control over Getgoods' employees,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. But, as just discussed, the Master Agreement and the SOP gave Brightstar the right to exercise control over the ways in which getgoods employees handled Brightstar's own goods, not over the way in which the employees managed the warehouse at which the goods were stored. At most, certain provisions of the SOP required the German Warehouse, overall, to comply with certain minimum security requirements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SOP at 2.0, but this contractual obligation is far from sufficient to show that Brightstar \"controlled\" the German Warehouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   While the Policy insures \"goods and merchandise,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Endorsement No. 40, \u00b6 1, Policy at STARR 15701, the Misappropriation Exclusion Clause does not speak to the insured's control over \"goods and merchandise.\" Instead, the clause applies to \"\n   <em>\n    warehouses\n   </em>\n   ... controlled by the Assured.\" By using this language, the clause unambiguously refers to the control of a \"warehouse[ ],\" not to control merely over the manner in which the insured's own goods and merchandise are handled. Starr cites the verb and noun forms of \"control\" contained in Black's Law Dictionary, which are, respectively, \"to exercise power or influence over\" and the \"direct or indirect power to govern the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.\" Pl. Opp. Mem. at 7 (citing CONTROL (verb), and CONTROL (noun), Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014)). But in its discussion of these definitions, Starr fails to address that the Misappropriation Exclusion Clause requires control to be exercised over \"warehouses\" - not the goods stored in a warehouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Starr focuses on the inclusion of the word \"influence\" in the definitions that it and Brightstar cite,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8, but the notion of having \"influence\" over a warehouse (as opposed to a person or circumstance) is nonsensical and thus we do not consider this aspect of the definition. This is made clear by a definition in the Cambridge Dictionary cited by Brightstar, which states that the verb \"control\" means \"the ability or power to decide or strongly influence the particular way in which\n   <em>\n    something will happen or someone will behave\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 11 (emphasis added). A warehouse cannot be a \"someone\" and cannot be a \"particular way in which something will happen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Obviously, Brightstar \"controlled\" how getgoods was to handle its product stored\n   in the warehouse, but this does not equate to Brightstar controlling the \"warehouse.\" We agree with Starr that \"a party may exercise control through a contractual relationship with another party,\" Pl. Opp. Mem. at 8, and that physical control is not the only type of control possible,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. But Brightstar did not have either contractual or physical control of the \"warehouse\" as a whole. Giving both the word \"warehouse\" and the word \"controlled\" their ordinary meanings, the fact that Brightstar had contractual rights to determine the ways in which its goods were handled and stored in a warehouse - especially one that handled others' goods - does not reflect that Brightstar \"controlled\" the warehouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Starr's arguments regarding \"legal control\" are no more convincing. Starr cites several cases that distinguish between \"legal control\" and \"actual physical control,\" arguing that \"control\" within the Misappropriation Exclusion Clause must refer to \"legal control.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   This is so, according to Starr, because \"controlled\" is in the same clause as \"owned, leased or controlled by the Assured,\" and \"owned\" and \"leased\" imply legal control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the cases Starr cites discuss the concept of \"legal control\" and \"actual, physical control,\" they do not support Starr's contention that the type of contractual rights Brightstar had are sufficient to establish \"legal\" control over the warehouse. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Gen. Elec. Credit Auto Lease, Inc. v. Brody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"827970\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-2d/124/805/\">\n    124 Misc. 2d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20N.Y.S.2d%20532\">\n    478 N.Y.S.2d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.Y.

These and other cases cited by Starr have no application here because there was no arrangement giving Brightstar the right to \"physical\" control over the warehouse as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   Starr argues that \"Brightstar admitted that it controlled the German Warehouse\" when in February 2014, after the Loss, Brightstar circulated a draft Insurance Master Schedule in connection with its annual adjustment, which contained a column which read \"Location Owned or Controlled by Brightstar.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. Mem. at 12. The German Warehouse row was marked \"yes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This evidence is not enough to defeat summary judgment, however, simply because there is no evidence that the term \"control\" in the schedule was intended by Brightstar to match the meaning of the term \"control\" in the insurance contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Thus, a reasonable jury could not use this notation to find that Brightstar exercised or had the right to exercise the type of control required by the Misappropriation Exclusion Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Starr also points to the deposition testimony of Brightstar CEO Oscar Fumagali, who served as Brightstar's corporate representative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. Mem. at 12 (citing Fumagali Dep. at 379-89). Upon being asked about the spreadsheet, Fumagali explained that because of the date on which the schedule was sent (during the adjustment process), he \"can't assume that it's a complete schedule or accurate schedule at this point.\" Fumagali Dep. at 388. He also noted that the schedule was sent at this point to be checked and updated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20698\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He offered that the \"controlled by Brightstar?\" column might be checked with respect to the German Warehouse because Brightstar had a contract with getgoods, unlike with other warehouses operated by FedEx, or UPS, for example.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 388-89. This equivocal deposition testimony is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to whether Brightstar \"controlled\" the German Warehouse within the meaning of the Policy. Indeed, the information Fumagali provides simply reaffirms that Brightstar had contractual rights with respect to the German Warehouse. Thus, no reasonable jury could use this evidence to conclude that Brightstar controlled the German Warehouse under the Misappropriation Exclusion Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   In sum, because the meaning of the phrase \"warehouses ... controlled by the Assured\" is clear and unambiguous, and because there is no evidence in the record upon which a reasonable jury could find that the German Warehouse was \"controlled ... by [Brightstar],\" we hold that the Misappropriation Exclusion Clause is inapplicable as a matter of law. But even if Starr's position that Brightstar did \"control\" the German Warehouse through contractual or legal control was a potential reading of that term, that reading would be only one of several reasonable readings available. As noted, when there are multiple reasonable meanings of a term available, an exclusion cannot negate coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westview Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189051\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/334/#p340\">\n    95 N.Y.2d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189051\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/334/#p340\">\n    717 N.Y.S.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189051\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/334/#p340\">\n    740 N.E.2d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
