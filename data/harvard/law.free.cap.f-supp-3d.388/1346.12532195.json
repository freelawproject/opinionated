Doc. 55 at 14. This case stems from a violation notice the City sent Clark regarding signs at the edge of Clark's property. Both parties have filed summary-judgment motions as to all claims. Doc. 78; Doc. 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As to Clark's First Amendment claim, the Court finds that Article 8, \u00a7 4.A.(6) is an unconstitutional content-based restriction and, therefore, grants Clark summary judgment on that count. That provision is severable from the remainder of the City's sign ordinance, which the Court does not evaluate because Clark lacks standing to make that challenge. The Court grants summary judgment to the City on Clark's Fourth Amendment claim (because there was no search of Clark's property), and on\n   Clark's inverse-condemnation claim (because Clark has not established any taking).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 23, 2015, the City's code enforcement officer, Tony De La Torre, sent Clark a \"NOTICE OF VIOLATION\" of the City's sign ordinance. Doc. 79 at 4; Doc. 92-22 at 2. The violation notice stated that Clark was in violation of the City's sign ordinance because he had \"three large barrels, several signs, and other affixed objects\" on the City's \"right of way.\" Doc. 92 at 18. According to the violation notice, the items Clark needed to remove were located within the City's eighty-foot easement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The violation notice requested Clark's voluntary cooperation, but it also informed him a citation could be issued and the items removed if he did not comply. Doc. 92 at 5-6; Doc. 100 at 4; Doc. 92-22 at 2. The violation notice directed Clark to immediately contact the City by phone if he had any questions or believed he received the notice in error; otherwise, \"actions will continue toward resolution.\" Doc. 92-22 at 2. Clark did not call. Doc. 100 at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 16, 2015, De La Torre went to Clark's property to discuss the matter. Doc. 79 at 10-11; Doc. 92 at 12. Clark's house sits back from the road and has a gravel driveway on one side that extends from the road to the back of the house, where it widens into a gravel apron or parking area. Doc. 92 at 14. On the day De La Torre went to Clark's property, there were no \"No Trespass\" signs posted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Clark seldom uses the front door of his house and has trained his family members to go to the back door when they visit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He walked up the driveway and saw that there was no path to the front door and that the door itself was blocked by items on the porch. He then heard someone in the back and started walking that way on the driveway. Doc. 92 at 16-17; Doc. 100 at 19-20. De La Torre then encountered Clark, who got angry and told De La Torre to leave several times in the span of less than a minute. Doc. 92 at 17. Clark then went back into the house and De La Torre left. Doc. 92 at 16; Doc. 100 at 19. De La Torre believes he only proceeded half-way to three-quarters up the driveway and did not leave the driveway or gravel apron/parking area near the back of the house. Doc. 92 at 17; Doc. 100 at 20-21. De La Torre estimates he was on Clark's property for 3-4 minutes; Clark claims it was 5-6 minutes. Doc. 92 at 16; Doc. 100 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Though Clark did not call the City or discuss the violation notice with De La Torre when he went to Clark's property, Clark did send the City some letters in response. Doc. 100 at 22; Doc. 92 at 18-19. Clark disputed that he was in violation of any sign ordinance provision and asserted that the sign ordinance was unconstitutional. Doc. 100 at 22; Doc. 92 at 18-19. In one of those letters, which was labeled a litigation\n   notice, Clark stated that he was fearful of putting up any new objects until the enforcement threat was removed. Doc. 79 at 5; Doc. 92 at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The City has never affirmatively retracted the violation notice. Doc. 79 at 4; Doc. 92 at 10. But after receiving the litigation notice, the mayor spoke with the City's attorney, who advised the City to not continue investigating Clark's alleged violations of the sign ordinance \"further.\" Doc. 92 at 19; Doc. 100 at 22. The mayor discussed the issue with the city council, and the city council agreed to that course. Doc. 92 at 19; Doc. 100 at 22. De La Torre's notes state that the City decided not to take any action on the violation notice \"at this time.\" Doc. 100 at 22; Doc. 79-2 at 23. Four months later, the City suspended its code enforcement officer position due to budget constraints and has had no code enforcement officer since that time. Doc. 79 at 6; Doc. 92 at 19. Clark was aware that the City suspended the position. Doc. 92 at 17. The City also did not reappoint a judge for the City's municipal court and no judge has held a municipal judicial proceeding in the City since May 2016. Doc. 92 at 19; Doc. 100 at 23. The City has indicated that it will not enforce the sign ordinance against Clark or any one else \"during the pendency of this case.\" Doc. 92 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Clark has asserted three claims in this case. Count I and Count II arise under the Constitution and are brought pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They allege, respectively, violations of the First and Fourth Amendments. The third count-for inverse condemnation-is brought under Kansas state law. Doc. 55 at 14-15. Each is discussed in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Clark's First Amendment Allegations (Count I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A complicating factor in analyzing Clark's First Amendment claim is that the parties disagree on the scope of this case. Clark asserts a broad challenge to several provisions of the City's sign ordinance, rather than focusing on the February 23, 2015 violation notice. Doc. 79 at 44-79. By contrast, the City disputes that Clark has standing to challenge\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   provisions of the City's sign ordinance. Doc. 92 at 27-32. But to the extent Clark does have standing, the City limits its analysis to whether the City is entitled to prohibit signs on public property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the City, the \"February 23, 2015 Notice of Violation addressed only Article 8, \u00a7 5 of the City sign regulations.\" Doc. 92 at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court agrees with the City that Clark lacks standing to challenge most provisions in the sign ordinance, as discussed below. But the Court disagrees with the City about what provision is at issue. The violation notice does not cite any specific provision in the sign ordinance by number, let alone Article 8, \u00a7 5. But it did allege that, \"[u]nder the City of Williamsburg's Ordinance, political signs shall not be placed on or otherwise affixed to any public building or sign, right of way, sidewalks, utility pole, street lamp post, tree, or other vegetative matter, Public Park, or other public property.\" Doc. 99-22 at 2. That recites nearly verbatim Article 8, \u00a7 4.A.(6). Article 8, \u00a7 5 is not quoted, paraphrased, or mentioned. Accordingly, to the extent a specific provision is at issue, it is Article 8, \u00a7 4.A.(6)-not Article 8, \u00a7 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Clark's reply clarifies that his standing for a First Amendment challenge is based both on the threatened enforcement action, \"as well as the ordinance's prohibitions\n   which stand as prior restraints.\" Doc. 100 at 37-38. Accordingly, the Court must evaluate Clark's standing to challenge the enforcement action (involving Article 8, \u00a7 4.A.(6)), and his broader challenge to other provisions in the sign ordinance. Those are two different claims, and each must be analyzed for standing separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

It recited nearly verbatim the language of Article 8, \u00a7 4.A.(6) and asked for Clark's \"cooperation in correcting all the violations.\" The violation notice indicated a re-inspection would occur at a later date, and \"[i]f the violations are not corrected a citation may be issued and objects removed from the City easement.\" Doc. 92-22 at 2. Clark never removed the items, and instead sent some letters to the City threatening legal action. As a result, the City opted to not pursue the matter further, or at least \"at this time.\" The City has never affirmatively retracted the violation notice. Doc. 79 at 4; Doc. 92 at 10.

Clark was sent a letter titled \"NOTICE OF VIOLATION.\" The City is correct that the letter did ask for Clark's voluntary compliance. But compliance was voluntary only to the extent that, if Clark did not comply, \"a citation may be issued and objects removed from the City easement.\" Doc. 92-22 at 2. Although the City has stopped\n   pursuing the matter at least for the time being (after Clark threatened litigation), Doc. 92 at 18-19, that decision is not permanent, nor has the City rescinded the violation notice.

This falls far short of showing similarity \"in every material respect.\" Indeed, in response to the City's assertion that the signs on Clark's property were unique in quantity and placement, Doc. 92 at 17, Clark responded by stating that no facts cited or offered by the City can prove that.

To the extent Clark intends that brief statement to be a request to the Court for an injunction, it is wholly without support and is denied. Based on the ruling in this order, it is also largely moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The City frequently refers to both a prohibition of signs on City right-of-ways and on public property in general. But it does not appear that the City is drawing a distinction between the two, as right-of-ways are just a subset of public property; nor does the City's sign ordinance make that distinction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Not only does the Court disagree that Clark was cited for violating Article 8, \u00a7 5, but the Court also disagrees with the City's contention that the sign ordinance flatly prohibits signs on public property. Article 8, \u00a7 5 is titled \"Prohibited Signs.\" Doc. 38-1 at 64. Subsection A of that provision reads, in part: \"Signs on Public Property: Any sign installed or placed on public property, except in conformance with the requirements, shall be forfeited to the public and subject to confiscation.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675071\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/289/554/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Article 8, \u00a7 5.A. does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    say that all signs are prohibited on public property. It says that signs \"placed on public property,\n    <em>\n     except in conformance with the requirements\n    </em>\n    , shall be forfeited and subject to confiscation....\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675071\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/289/554/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added). An obvious reading of Article 8, \u00a7 5 is that signs on public property are simply subject to the general regulations of Article 8 (which includes rules about sign types, zoning district requirements, and size, number, and setback restrictions), and where they are not \"in conformance with the requirements,\" they are subject to confiscation. Clark points this out. The City's only response is that Clark misreads the sign ordinance and that \"Article 8, \u00a7 5 precludes any sign on public right of way.\" Doc. 92 at 33. Putting aside this unfortunate failure to elaborate, the City's interpretation is unconvincing. Nothing in Article 8, \u00a7 5 flatly suggests that all signs on public property are prohibited, even though other provisions of that section specifically do prohibit certain signs under other circumstances. Doc. 38-1 at 64-65 (stating that \"[n]o person shall display upon any sign or other advertising structure any obscene, indecent or immoral matter\" and that \"Flashing signs ... shall not be permitted\"). If the regulation was meant to prohibit signs on public property, it likely would have just said so. But it does not. Nor does it make sense that Article 8, \u00a7 4.A.(6) would carve out a special rule prohibiting\n    <em>\n     political\n    </em>\n    signs on public property (under a heading of \"Exemptions\" no less),\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 63-64, if Article 8, \u00a7 5.A. simply banned\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    signs on public property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The City does not challenge the other two elements of standing, nor do the parties even address them.

At some point after Clark responded to the violation notice, the City suspended its code enforcement program and did not reappoint its municipal court judge. Doc. 92 at 18-19. The Court concludes these facts do not demonstrate that Clark is fully out from under the threat of enforcement given the City's other statements hedging that it does not plan to pursue this matter \"at this time\" or \"for the duration of this case.\" The lack of City staff is similarly temporary in nature.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Clark also suggests he has standing under a \"class-of-one\" theory.

Article 8, \u00a7 4.A.(6) would presumably be in effect all other times.
