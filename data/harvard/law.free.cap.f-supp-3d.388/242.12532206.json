Malcolm (\"plaintiff\") once again has commenced suit against her employer the Rochester City School District (\"RCSD\") alleging violations of federal and state laws. Malcolm is a known litigant in this Court. She is well-known because she is a demonstrable, abusive litigant. This case and two similar cases in this district (\n   <em>\n    Malcolm II\n   </em>\n   (17-CV-6873);\n   <em>\n    Malcolm III\n   </em>\n   (18-CV-6450)) against essentially the same defendants, raise the same or similar claims and all will be dismissed in three separate decisions; filed this date. For several reasons, all of these cases lack merit both procedurally and substantively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff has been sanctioned previously by this Court for filing repetitive and frivolous lawsuits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malcolm v. Bd. of Educ. of the Honeoye Falls-Lima Cent. Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219912\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/737/117/#p120\">\n    737 F. Supp. 2d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120-21 (W.D.N.Y. 2010). Because of her demonstrated history of filing frivolous and harassing litigation, plaintiff was enjoined from filing any other action against the Honeoye Falls-Lima School District and its employees without obtaining prior leave of court.\n   <em>\n    Malcolm v.

Oct. 27, 2011),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3608938\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/517/11/\">\n    517 F. App'x 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As will be discussed below, and in the two other decisions decided today, plaintiff has proceeded against her present employer and a related union just as she had against the Honeoye Falls-Lima School District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   One of the claims in this present lawsuit is that plaintiff was laid off based on improper considerations of age and race. There were approximately 22 employees (CASE employees) who suffered the same fate. As will be discussed, many of those employees were also over the age of 40, hence covered by the Age Discrimination and Employment Act. A few were also African-American, as is plaintiff, but the majority were Caucasian. No discriminatory animus is evident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Furthermore, it is worth noting, as will be pointed out below, that plaintiff and the other laid off employees eventually were later contacted and reemployed. In fact, although plaintiff persists in this litigation, she also has been reemployed and remains with the Rochester City School District to date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and as such she is entitled to some accommodation because of that status. This plaintiff though has abused that position repeatedly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The fact that plaintiff has filed three separate lawsuits against the Rochester City School District and the related union is of note. Two of the lawsuits are virtually carbon copies of the other. Some paragraphs of the complaint appear to simply be copies of a prior pleading and placed in the second lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Malcolm v. Rochester City Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-CV-6873 (W.D.N.Y. 2017);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malcolm v. Rochester City Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-CV-6450 (W.D.N.Y. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As further evidence of plaintiff's harassing tactics, she has filed not one, but five separate claims before the New York State Division of Human Rights. There is no need for that. Several of these matters before the State Division appear to remain unresolved which, as will be discussed, necessitates dismissal of some of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff has created a cottage industry of litigation concerning employers and school districts that have employed her. Plaintiff was sanctioned in the\n   Honeoye Falls-Lima cases because there she had filed a total of four lawsuits in federal court and at least one in state court against the same district.\n   <em>\n    Malcolm v. Bd. Of Educ. of the Honeoye Falls-Lima Cent. Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219912\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/737/117/#p120\">\n    737 F.

All those actions were dismissed and to the extent plaintiff appealed, they were all affirmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Counsel for defendants and this Court are forced to spend a not inconsiderable amount of time dealing with a flurry of cases before agencies and the Court involving baseless arguments, many of which are not responded to or pursued once defendants raise legal challenges on either a motion to dismiss or summary judgment. Such activity must stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PLAINTIFF'S THREE ACTIONS AGAINST THE RCSD AND ITS EMPLOYEES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This action filed on December 20, 2017 is against the RCSD, its then-Superintendent of Schools and a union (ASAR) representing plaintiff and others (\n   <em>\n    Malcolm I\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A second action, 17-CV-6872 (\n   <em>\n    Malcolm II\n   </em>\n   ) was filed on December 19, 2017, virtually the same day as Malcolm I. This is essentially a copycat pleading to\n   <em>\n    Malcolm I\n   </em>\n   , and is also against the RCSD, but different employees than were enumerated in\n   <em>\n    Malcolm I\n   </em>\n   . Finally, on June 18, 2018, plaintiff filed a third action (18-CV-6450 (\n   <em>\n    Malcolm III\n   </em>\n   )) against the RCSD and its then-Superintendent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   All these cases must be dismissed and will be discussed separately in the other decisions filed today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND: MALCOLM I\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , brings this action against defendants Association of Supervisors and Administrators of Rochester (\"ASAR\"), its President, Timothy Cliby (\"Cliby\"), and Vice President, John Rowe (\"Rowe\"), as well as the RCSD and its superintendent, Barbara Deane-Williams (\"Deane-Williams\").

Const. Art. I, \u00a7 11. Plaintiff also asserts multiple state law claims against defendants, including breach of contract, breach of the collective bargaining agreement, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, alleging defendants breached the collective bargaining agreement they operated under.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff is a 61-year-old African-American woman who was first employed with the RCSD in April of 2015, after her tumultuous litigation against the Honeoye Falls-Lima School District. Plaintiff was hired as a Central Office Coordinating Administrator of Special Education (\"CASE\") and was represented by the ASAR in their capacity as a labor union. Not long after she was hired, Plaintiff began to have difficulties with one of her supervisors and made complaints to her supervisors at the RCSD and to ASAR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In March 2017, the RCSD, faced with budgetary concerns, conducted an audit that led them to restructure the special education administrators. This included laying off twenty-two CASE positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff was one of the affected employees. Those employees were then placed on a preferred eligibility list for seven years, meaning they could be recalled and resume employment if a position was open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff was recalled from the preferred eligibility list and rehired by the RCSD on November 20, 2017 in her same position and is currently employed by the RCSD today. She was re-employed about a month before plaintiff filed this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   When plaintiff was laid off in March 2017, she disagreed with the cuts and went to ASAR with her concerns. As stated in plaintiff's complaint, while ASAR disagreed with the layoffs, they told Plaintiff they could not do anything about the restructuring because they determined there was nothing illegal about the layoffs. ASAR advised plaintiff that she also had the right to file a grievance with her direct supervisor at the RCSD as outlined in the collective bargaining agreement without the assistance of ASAR, but she failed to file such a grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff then filed five charges within the New York State Department of Human Rights (\"NYSDHR\"). In the first two charges against the RCSD, the NYSDHR determined there was probable cause, and the case is still pending and is not yet resolved. These two charges were dually filed in the EEOC. The third, fourth and fifth charges against ASAR and RCSD were dismissed with the NYSDHR finding no probable cause, with the EEOC adopting the same findings as the NYSDHR for her federal claims. Upon receipt of her right to sue letter from the EEOC in her third charge, plaintiff then filed the present lawsuit, as well as the other two lawsuits,\n   <em>\n    Malcolm II\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Malcolm III\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In lieu of an answer, the ASAR Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1) and (6), and RCSD Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), 12(b)(4), 12(b)(5) and 12(b)(6). Plaintiff, in her complaint and in her reply papers, requested a stay in the proceedings, and in her response to defendant's motion to dismiss, moved to amend her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, ASAR's motion to dismiss (Dkt. #4) is granted; RCSD's motion to dismiss (Dkt. #9) is granted, and the Complaint is dismissed. Plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint (Dkt. #23) is denied, and plaintiff's request to stay proceedings (Dkt. #1) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION: MALCOLM I\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides that a complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

As for plaintiff's NYSHRL claims against Cliby and Rowe, because plaintiff did not allege direct participation in conduct that gave rise to her discrimination claim anywhere in her complaint, she has not properly pleaded any NYSHRL claim against them.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 62, 89. Plaintiff also makes no factual allegations against Cliby, stating only that he \"did little to remedy the situation\" without detailing any specific situations where he failed to do so.

None of the facts as pleaded suggest that any individual defendant furthered, or directly participated in, a discriminatory employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Similarly, nowhere in plaintiff's complaint does she plead how Deane-Williams is personally involved with the alleged discrimination.
