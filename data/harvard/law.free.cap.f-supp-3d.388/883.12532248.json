(\"ECN-Cap\") and ECN Financial, LLC's (\"ECN-Fin\") Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2). [R. 149.] Plaintiffs Gale Carter and Forbes Hayes (\"Plaintiffs\") responded, [R. 159], and ECN-Cap and ECN-Fin (together \"ECN Defendants\") replied, [R. 160]. Fully briefed, this matter is ripe for adjudication. For the reasons stated herein, ECN Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, [R. 149], is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises out of Gale Carter and Forbes Hayes's previous employment as truck drivers for Paschall Truck Lines, Inc. (\"PTL\"). Further detail about this case can be found in this Court's previous Memorandum Opinion and Order concerning Element Transportation, LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment. [R. 136 at 1-3.] In short, this motion revolves around Paschall Truck Lines, Inc.'s (\"PTL\") relationship with Element Financial Corp. (\"EFC\"), ECN Financial, LLC (\"ECN-Fin\"), ECN Capital (\"ECN-Cap\"), and Quality Equipment Leasing, LLC (\"Quality\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As of March 31, 2014, EFC, a Delaware corporation, entered into a Servicing Agreement under which Plaintiffs allege that \"EFC authorized Quality Equipment Leasing\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to act as its agent in procuring individual drivers and fleets to lease its trucks.\" [R. 159 at 6] (citing [R. 159-2) (3rd Amended Service Agreement).] Plaintiffs claim that, on or around March 12, 2014, \"Defendant PTL entered into a Vehicle Lease Program Agreement with Quality in order to facilitate the operation of its lease-operator program.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other things, Plaintiffs allege that, under the Vehicle Lease Program Agreement, Quality agreed to provide vehicle leasing and financing services to drivers in PTL's lease-operator program. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiffs summarize the details of the agreement as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Quality agreed to assist PTL's personnel with the negotiation of leases and lease documentation, and the closing of lease transactions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under the agreement, Quality would enter into vehicle lease agreements with drivers while PTL would simultaneously enter into Independent Contractor Agreements with said drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. PTL was required to, on a weekly basis, directly remit to Quality all lease payments made by drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PTL was specifically required to \"promote [Quality] as a recognized and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     credible\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   source of lease financing\" for the individual drivers and to give Quality a \"right of first refusal\" for leasing vehicles to PTL's drivers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The working relationship between PTL and Quality is exemplified through the experience of Plaintiffs Gale Carter, Forbes Hays, and Lakendal Harris. All three aver that after they received training from PTL at PTL's headquarters in Murray, KY, they were instructed to travel to Quality's facility in Indianapolis, Indiana to lease a truck. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 159 at 15 (citing Hays Depo); R. 159-17 at 65:17-24, 111:15-112:16\n   (Hays Depo); R. 159-18 at 51:9-11, 84:9-17 (Carter Depo); R. 159-19 at 50:21-23, 84:3-6 (Harris Depo).] According to Plaintiffs, Carter, Hays, and Harris entered into lease agreements with EFC, which were all serviced by Quality. [R. 159 at 9 (citing plaintiffs' lease agreements R. 159-4, R. 159-5, R. 159-6; R. 159-21; R. 159-22; and R. 159-2).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In order to explain ECN-Fin and ECN-Cap's relation to EFC, the Court will quote its previous explanation of this complicated corporate lineage from its previous Memorandum Opinion and Order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 30, 2016, EFC became Element Financial, LLC.

[R. 110-2 at 4; R. 98-1 at 6.] On September 19, 2016, a transaction occurred between Element Financial, LLC and Element Transportation, LLC, another subsidiary of Element Financial, LLC's parent company-Element Financial Corporation.

[R. 110-19 at 49:12-18; R. 98-1 at 7; R. 110-2 at 5.] Plaintiffs states that, with that name change, ECN Financial, LLC was divested from Element Fleet Management Corporation and became a subsidiary of ECN Capital Corp.

[R. 149-1 at 7.] As Plaintiffs only dispute ECN Defendants' argument concerning \u00a7 454.210(2)(a)(1), [R. 159 at 13], the Court will only address the matter as it pertains to that section of the Kentucky long-arm statute.

(holding that the court did not have personal jurisdiction in Kentucky over the defendants when a contract existed between the parties but plaintiff failed to claim that defendants' communications to plaintiff \"were made to further their business and to create continuous and substantial consequences in Kentucky\"). For example, in\n   <em>\n    Shehan v. Turner Construction Company\n   </em>\n   , the Eastern District of Kentucky held that the plaintiff, Shehan, failed to provide specific facts regarding communications between himself and the defendant, the Museum of Natural History (\"Museum\"), that would allow the Museum to reasonably anticipate being haled into court in Kentucky.\n   <em>\n    Shehan\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 18-14-DLB-CJS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201320046\">\n    2019 WL 1320046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.

[R. 159 at 17] (\"[A]ny exercise of jurisdiction in accordance with the Kentucky long-arm statute would comport with the requirements of the due process clause as a matter of simple logic.\"). Indeed, some long-arm statutes run co-extensive with due process.\n    <em>\n     E.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Southern Mach. Co. v.

Looking to the plain language of KRS 454.210, the court recognized that \"the long-arm statute discloses no language indicating that its provisions should,\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    , be construed as coextensive with the limits of federal due process.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319508\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/336/51/#p57\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319508\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/336/51/#p57\">\n     at 56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Following\n    <em>\n     Caesars\n    </em>\n    and its progeny, then, courts applying Kentucky law must engage in a two-part inquiry.
