PAMELA PEPPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Two weeks after the plaintiff purchased a homeowners policy from the defendant, a fire severely damaged the property he had purchased from the City of Milwaukee for $3,750. The plaintiff filed a claim for the policy limits, but failed to timely provide the defendant with all of the supporting documentation. One year to the date of the fire, the defendant denied the plaintiff's claim under the fraud/concealment provision of the policy. At the same time, the defendant extended the one-year limitations period for filing a lawsuit to February 8, 2015. The plaintiff waited until five months after the deadline had passed to file a lawsuit in Milwaukee County Circuit Court. The defendant now moves for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) the lawsuit is time barred and (2) the undisputed facts establish that the plaintiff violated the fraud/concealment provision of the policy. Because the court finds no basis in the record to toll the limitations period or estop the defendant from invoking the bar, the court will grant the defendant's motion and dismiss the plaintiff's breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims as time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

On February 13, 2014, the defendant notified the plaintiff of the plan to thaw the building, but the defendant was notified that the plaintiff had retained counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b611, 12. Defendant's claim file indicates that the defendant's agent left a detailed message with the plaintiff's attorney, Michael Krill, on February 13, 2014. Dkt. No. 56-2 at 42. The defendant warmed the property on February 15 and 16, inspected and extensively documented the damage, and determined there was no salvageable property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 17, 2014, the plaintiff's public adjuster, Dean Rossey, contacted the defendant and demanded that it pay to heat the property again, which the defendant refused to do; the defendant did advise that the plaintiff was free to enter and inspect the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-15. The property was razed in May and June of 2014. Dkt. No. 46-10. The defendant issued the plaintiff a reservation of rights letter on April 28, 2014. Dkt. No. 44-3. At some point during the investigation, the defendant\n   classified the plaintiff's claim using National Insurance Crime Bureau indicators and assigned the plaintiff's claim to the Special Investigative Unit. Dkt. No. 46-2 at 9-12; Dkt. No. 56-2 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant's investigation lasted one year-from the notice of the fire until January 6, 2015. Dkt. No. 60 at 2. The defendant took the plaintiff's recorded statement on February 24, 2014 and Examination Under Oath (\"EUO\") on August 21, 2014. Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 19; Dkt. No. 44-1 and 44-5. In addition, the defendant requested from the plaintiff (1) any photographs of the property prior to the fire; (2) an inventory of damaged or stolen personal property, including bills, receipts or other documentation; (3) closing documents from the plaintiff's purchase of the house; (4) receipts or other documentation for work completed on the house after purchase; (5) the plaintiff's phone records for January 2014; and (6) contact information for individuals the plaintiff indicated had information relevant to his claim. Dkt. No. 44-2. Despite the defendant's numerous inquiries, the plaintiff continually missed deadlines to provide requested documentation and repeatedly requested that his EUO be rescheduled. Dkt. No. 45 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-19. The plaintiff avers that he lost all of his personal property, possessions, records, receipts, photographs, tools and other personal property in the fire; it took him a long time to recreate all of the documents and information he lost to satisfy the defendant's investigation. Dkt. No. 58 at \u00b624.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff submitted additional documents and responses to the defendant on December 2, 2014. Dkt. No. 45-16. Twenty days later, the defendant sent a letter to the plaintiff advising that it would extend the statute of limitations to February 9, 2015,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. On January 6, 2015, the defendant sent the plaintiff a letter denying his claim, reiterating the policy suit deadline of February 9, 2015, dkt. no. 44-4, and citing the concealment of fraud provision in the policy,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , dkt. no. 46-1 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The policy includes the following provision: \"No action shall be brought unless there has been compliance with the policy provisions. The action must be started within one year after the date of loss or damage.\" Dkt. No. 46-1 at 37. In response to an interrogatory requesting the basis for his argument that defendant tolled the statute of limitations, the plaintiff said that he could not bring his lawsuit until he complied with the terms of the policy, and the statute should be tolled because the defendant directed him not to enter the property immediately following the fire. Dkt. No. 46-9 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff never requested-and the parties never engaged in-an appraisal proceeding or an arbitration proceeding related to the subject claim. Dkt. No. 45 at \u00b6\u00b623-24. The defendant extended the statute of limitations from January 6, 2015 to February 9, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant moves for summary judgment on two grounds: (1) the statute of limitation and policy suit limitation bar the plaintiff's breach of contract claim; and (2) there is no genuine issue of material fact that the plaintiff violated the concealment/fraud condition of the policy. Because the plaintiff's case is time barred, the court need not address the second argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant's policy contains the following policy suit limitation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Suit Against Us\n   </strong>\n   . No action shall be brought unless there is compliance with the policy provisions. The action must be started within one year after the date of loss or damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dkt. No. 46-1 at 37. This policy language tracks the Wisconsin statute, which provides that an action on a fire insurance policy must be brought within one year of the loss.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20631.83\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 631.83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The fire destroyed the plaintiff's property on January 6, 2014. The defendant extended the one-year limitations period to February 9, 2015. Despite the additional time, the plaintiff did not file a lawsuit in Milwaukee County Circuit Court until July 8, 2015. As a consequence, the policy and the statute bar the plaintiff's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff first argues that Section 6 of the defendant's policy was amended by the Homeowners Policy Endorsement FE-3548, which addresses the Conditions in Section II of the policy. The Endorsement states that the \"following is added to item 6,\n   <strong>\n    Suit Against Us\n   </strong>\n   \":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   If an action for bodily injury or property damage occurring in the State of Wisconsin is brought in Wisconsin,\n   <strong>\n    Suit Against Us\n   </strong>\n   is replaced by the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   No action shall lie against us unless, as a condition precedent thereto, there shall have been full compliance by you of all terms of this policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dkt. No. 46-1 at 10. The plaintiff asserts this endorsement deleted the one-year statute of limitations language and prevented him from filing a suit because of the mandatory condition precedent language in Section 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The problem with this argument is that Endorsement FE-3548 adds language to Section II-Conditions, which is not relevant to this lawsuit. Section II-Conditions never contained a one-year limitations period. The relevant one-year limitations period appears in Section I-Conditions, which discusses claims by the insured for property losses and first party insurance disputes. Section II, on the other hand, spells out the insured's personal liability in cases where \"a claim or suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this coverage applies.\" Dkt. No. 46-1 at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The policy and the statute set a one-year limitations period, and that one-year begins to run at the time of the loss or damage. Dkt. No. 46-1 at 37;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20631.83\">\n    Wis.

The plaintiff admits there was no other agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The plaintiff also argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant's year-long investigation tolled the statute of limitations.

The defendant recognized that the plaintiff was running up against the deadline and extended the deadline. The defendant's letter denying the claim cited the actual language appearing in Section I regarding the one-year limitations period.

Clearly, State Farm was acting under its contract with Berry to conduct an investigation and held Berry at bay because Berry could not sue State Farm under the terms of the Policy, until the investigation was completed. This question is further complicated by the fact that State Farm, \"by agreement\n   extended the statute of limitation by 30 days. But could State Farm do so under the factual circumstances of its investigation? Was 30 days sufficient under the circumstances? Did State Farm's conduct in engaging in a yearlong investigation estop State Farm from asserting the statute of limitation under these circumstances?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dkt. No. 57 at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The plaintiff does not cite policy language to support his argument that he could not sue under the terms of the policy until the defendant completed the investigation. Section I-Conditions states that no action shall be brought unless there has been compliance with the policy provisions. The next sentence states that the action must be started within one year after the date of the loss or damage. Dkt. No. 46-1 at 37. While it required compliance with the terms and conditions, Section I did not bar the plaintiff from suing before the one-year deadline (or by the February 9, 2015 extension). In addition, the plaintiff complains about the length of the investigation but admits that he continually missed deadlines to provide the requested documentation to the defendant and repeatedly requested that his EUO be rescheduled. Dkt. No. 60 at 2. After he submitted his documents on December 2, 2014, the defendant sent him a letter extending the statute of limitations to February 9, 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8673353\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/97/127/#p135\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The plaintiff proposes no additional facts regarding actions taken or not taken by the defendant that would have led him to believe a lawsuit would not be necessary. He would have liked a longer extension, but the defendant didn't have to grant an extension at all. Nothing that the defendant did or did not do would have suggested to the plaintiff that the clocked stopped running at any time. Rather, the defendant reminded the plaintiff and his attorney that the clock was running and that the deadline was approaching. Even after the deadline passed, the plaintiff inexplicably waited another five months to file the lawsuit. Without any evidence to support the plaintiff's arguments, the one-year limitations period bars the plaintiff's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a final matter, the court notes that it had bifurcated the breach of contract and the bad faith claim. In addition, the plaintiff also filed a claim for promissory estoppel. The plaintiff's claims sound in contract as they arise under the homeowners policy. Because the plaintiff does not allege a promise other than then one made in the contract, the promissory estoppel claim cannot stand under Wisconsin law.\n   <em>\n    Bertha v.
