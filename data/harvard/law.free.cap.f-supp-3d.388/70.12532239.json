He was assigned to conduct preventive rounds at San Jos\u00e9 Ward in Toa Baja and was accompanied by Sergeant F\u00e9lix Rivera and Alexander Gonz\u00e1lez.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9461177\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/172/296/#p305\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While at 16th Street, also known as \"Valle Seco\", PRPD observed a four-door, black Toyota Corolla, with license plate number IRS-191.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. As several weeks prior, a message had been sent by the command center that some individuals in a car that fit said description were committing crimes at shopping centers in the area, PRPD reported the plate of the black automobile through a portable radio to the police command center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The license plate had a notice that the vehicle was in fact stolen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result thereof, Sgt.

Immediately after PRPD Bari opened the door, he observed the defendant had a black pistol in his waistband. He inquired the defendant as to the license to carry the firearm or lack thereof.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendant told PRPD Bari that he did not possess a license, thus, PRPD Bari proceeded to occupy the firearm and placed it on his waistband.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PRPD Bari then proceeded to arrest the defendant and provided him his Miranda warnings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant was asked whether he was alone at the property for safety reasons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. He responded in the affirmative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PRPD Bari then asked the defendant whether there were any additional firearms in the property, and he responded in the affirmative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, when inquired as to the location of the firearms, the defendant informed PRPD Bari that the firearms were in the bedroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PRPD Bari inquired as to the voluntariness of the defendant showing him where the firearms were, and the defendant consented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, the defendant proceeded to show PRPD Bari an armory inside the bedroom including drugs, paraphernalia, as to narcotics, together with bullets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The items seized include a cut-off shotgun, two AK-47, two rifles, ammunition and magazines. He also seized the gun that was in the defendant's person upon his arrest and the keys to the stolen Toyota Corolla in one of his pockets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exhibits 9, 10, 11 and 12.

No. 25) wherein he moves the Court to suppress all the evidence seized from his home, from his person and his statements. In sum, the defendant contends the entry of the police to his house, the search of his house, the search of his person and his arrest (all done without a warrant) were not lawful because there was no probable cause and no exigent circumstances. Whereas, the Government argues the police officers entered the house legally based on probable cause to arrest and exigent circumstances. The Government\n   further avers the defendant gave consent to search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Motion to Suppress\n   </em>\n   was referred to Honorable Magistrate Judge V\u00e9lez-Riv\u00e9 for hearing and Report and Recommendation. The Magistrate is recommending the\n   <strong>\n    DENIAL\n   </strong>\n   of the motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 56. The Magistrate finds that the PRPD officers lawfully reached their vantage point as they were in the area on a routine patrol. Upon finding the vehicle and confirming it was stolen, the officers began canvassing the neighborhood to learn additional information and, as part of this canvas, they approached and knocked on defendant's front door which was ajar. According to the Magistrate, PRPD Bari, saw, through the glass door, that the defendant was armed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the warrantless arrest, the Magistrate Judge concluded that as PRPD Bari asked the defendant whether he had a license to carry the firearm, and the response was in the negative, and the possession of a firearm without license is a violation of Puerto Rico law, probable cause was established. More importantly, an individual who visually displays a firearm violates the Puerto Rico Law even if he possessed a firearms permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The testimony of PRPD Bari, and corroborating testimony of PRPD Gonz\u00e1lez, are uncontested as the defendant did not present witnesses to rebut the government's position. Finally, as to the warrantless search of the home, the Magistrate found the defendant provided valid consent. PRPD Bari's testimony as to defendant voluntarily taking him to a bedroom in the house and showing him the illegal items is uncontested. Thus, defendant willingly took PRPD Bari to the bedroom where additional firearms were located upon his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     DE NOVO\n    </em>\n    SUPPRESSION HEARING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is a well-established fact that \"[a] district judge may not reject a magistrate's findings as to the credibility of a witness without hearing the witness testify first-hand.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In fact, \"if the judge does not hear the witnesses his decisions on credibility issues can only be a blind guess, when it intimates that a district judge may not reject a magistrate's findings without hearing the witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the Court held a\n   <em>\n    De Novo\n   </em>\n   Suppression Hearing, wherein PRPD Bari was produced by the Government in order to clarify the facts surrounding his entrance to the defendant's property on February 23, 2018 while conducting a preventive round at Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. With the benefit of PRPD Bari's testimony as well as supplemental briefs filed by the parties, the Court is now ready to rule upon the instant matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Standing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is well settled that \"the [Fourth] amendment's prohibition against\n   unreasonable searches and seizures extends only to protect those places and interests in which the accused can be characterized as having a legitimate expectation of privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As a result thereof, PRPD Bari began canvassing the area by inquiring the residents of the ward the whereabouts of the owner of the vehicle. None of the residents had information as to the identity of the possessor of the Toyota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Eventually, PRPD Bari approached a residence that was located to the far-left.

PRPD Bari announced his presence and the defendant emerged from the interior right side of the property (to the left of PRPD Bari) and stood in front of the glass from the inside. However, as the Court found that PRPD Bari's testimony as to what happened thereafter was incomplete, a\n   <em>\n    De Novo\n   </em>\n   Hearing was scheduled.

PRPD Bari ultimately opened the door, that was opened only by one (1) foot, identified a pistol in the defendant's waistband after opening the door, and then placed the defendant under arrest and gave him his Miranda warnings. There is no testimony from PRPD Bari that sustains he obtained any sort of consent from the defendant or observed the defendant carrying a firearm prior to opening the door of his residence and putting him under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   When PRPD Bari took the stand for a second time during the\n   <em>\n    De Novo\n   </em>\n   Suppression Hearing, he did not clarify as to the consent he obtained from the defendant, or lack thereof, to enter the property prior to identifying the pistol that was apparently on the defendant's waistband. The applicable standard requires the consent to be freely and voluntarily provided by the defendant when entering the property that is not subject to a search warrant. The defendant ultimately informed PRPD Bari the location of the remaining contraband, but after he had been arrested,\n   <em>\n    not before\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court finds the defendant's action of standing in front of the door is not an act of a free and voluntary consent. Rather, it is a sign that the defendant is protecting his residence from an uninvited intrusion from a police officer.

The Court finds that it does and briefly\n   explains. PRPD Bari is a police officer with 20 years of experience, who prior to working at the Office of Intelligence Section of the Local Police Department worked in the City of Bayamon Stolen Vehicles Unit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 53, p. 37, l. 5-17; and Dkt. No. 72, p. 5, l. 3-8. The Fourth Amendment protection is a subject that is widely known as it deals with a fundamental right that every person is entitled to. It is very difficult for the Court to believe that PRPD Bari was unbeknown as to the fact that opening the door of a private property without the defendant's consent and without probable cause would constitute a Fourth Amendment violation. The Government, in fact, recognizes that PRPD Bari did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant until he opened the door to the defendant's property and thereafter, saw the firearm for the first time. Thus, \"[t]he government [would be] obliged to justify the arrest by the search and at the same time to justify the search by the arrest. This will not do.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The Court further notes that PRPD Bari's actions were in clear violation of the defendant's Fourth Amendment right. This is exactly the type of conduct that is considered unlawful police conduct and must be discouraged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court finds that the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation correctly concludes that the defendant met the requirements for standing, thus, no plain error was identified. However, upon review of the record at Dkt. No. 72, it is clear that the local police officer opened the door of the defendant's residence and thereafter, saw the weapon on the defendant's waist, hence, the police officer's conduct was unconstitutional in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTS in part\n   </strong>\n   the Magistrate's Report and Recommendation and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   CAMILLE L.

(Docket No. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Pending before this Court is Defendant Figueroa's \"Motion to Suppress Physical Evidence and Statements\" in which he moved the Court to suppress all the evidence seized from his home, from his person\n   and his statements. Defendant Figueroa asserted the entry to his house, the search of his house, the search of his person and his arrest (all done without a warrant) were not lawful because there was no probable cause and no exigent circumstances. (Docket No. 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The United States responded to the Motion to Suppress, arguing Defendant Figueroa lacked standing to question the entry and search of the house since he did not have an expectation of privacy in the place searched. The United States also argued that the police officers entered the house legally based on probable cause to arrest and exigent circumstances. The United States posited in addition that Defendant Figueroa gave consent to search. (Docket No. 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Motion to Suppress filed by Defendant Figueroa was referred to the undersigned for Report and Recommendation. (Docket Nos. 35 and 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   On November 7, 2018, the suppression hearing was held. The matter of standing was addressed first, and Defendant presented the testimony of Coralis Santiago Col\u00f3n (\"Santiago\") because the burden is on Defendant. Direct and cross examination conducted. A verbal ruling was made that Defendant Figueroa had established standing with the testimony of Santiago. The burden then turned to the United States which presented the testimony of PRPD Agent Carlos Bari Mart\u00ednez (\"PRPO Bari\") and PRPO Alexander Gonz\u00e1lez Santiago (\"PRPO Gonz\u00e1lez\"). Direct and cross examination conducted. Several Exhibits were admitted and presented into evidence. Defendant Figueroa did not take the stand on his behalf. (Docket No. 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   On January 8, 2019, post-hearing briefs were filed by the parties.

The United States averred Defendant Figueroa had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the house searched which had no indicia that anyone lived in it. The house had no furniture, no clothes in the closets, and no food or running water. The United States claimed Defendant Figueroa lacked standing to assert a violation of his rights. (Docket No. 41, pages 2-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Later, the government informed the Court in its post-hearing brief that it did not object to the Court's oral ruling that Defendant had standing to seek suppression of the evidence seized. (Docket No. 54, p. 3). However, in an abundance of caution, the issue of standing is briefly discussed herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendant Figueroa presented the testimony of his wife (Santiago) at the suppression hearing to establish standing. The United States did not present any evidence on the standing issue. After hearing the testimony of Santiago, and assessing her demeanor and credibility, the Court orally found that Defendant Figueroa had standing to challenge the admissibility of the evidence seized via a motion to suppress. Defendant Figueroa met his burden of proving he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the house and in relation to the items seized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The concept of standing under the Fourth Amendment refers to the defendant's burden of proving a legitimate expectation of privacy as a prerequisite to challenge unlawful police conduct.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant Figueroa had a key to the house when he was arrested. See Exhibits A-19 and A-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   On cross-examination, Santiago clarified that she moved to the house in March or April 2018. Santiago stated that the house had water and power when she bought it. However, she has never paid for said services. Her neighbors do not pay for utilities either. Santiago paid $10,000.00 in cash for the house. No contract was signed when she bought the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In sum, based on Santiago's testimony, which is uncontested, and under the totality of circumstances, the Court concludes that Defendant Figueroa met his burden that he had an expectation of privacy in the house at issue. The house (which Defendant's wife had bought) was being fixed and renovated prior to Defendant Figueroa's arrest. The house was still being renovated when Defendant Figueroa was arrested in the house. Defendant Figueroa had a key to the house when he was arrested. Santiago moved to the house after Defendant was arrested and did not move before because it was being repaired. Thus, Defendant established with the testimony of Santiago that: 1) he had a legitimate presence in the area searched; 2) prior use of the area searched or the property seized; 3) possession or ownership of the area searched or the property seized; 4) ability to control or exclude other's use of the property; and 5) a subjective expectation of privacy.\n   <em>\n    Lochan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1150834\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/674/960/#p965\">\n    674 F.2d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In sum, Defendant Figueroa has standing to challenge the admission of illegal items seized under the totality of the circumstances and the evidence before the Court.

His duties that day were part of a work plan to attack crime in high crime areas. On that day, PRPO Bari was assigned to San Jos\u00e9 Ward in Toa Baja and he went to that area at about 3:00 pm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   PRPO Bari was with fellow officers Sgt. Felix Rivera (\"Sgt. Rivera\") and Alexander Gonz\u00e1lez. They were doing preventive rounds and, while at 16th Street known as Valle Seco, he observed a Toyota Corolla, black, four doors with license plate IRS-091. See Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 5-1, 5-2, 5-3 and 6. PRPO Bari then reported the license plate through a portable radio to the police command center. The license plate came back with a lien that the vehicle was stolen. PRPO Bari ran the license plate because, some weeks before, a message had been sent by the command center that some individuals in a black Toyota Corolla, license plate ending in 091, were committing crimes at shopping centers in the area. Sgt. Rivera told PRPO Bari to wait for a marked police unit to arrive. PRPO Bari then started to do a visual inspection of the Toyota Corolla and he noticed that the locks nor the ignition were forced. That was suspicious in PRPO Bari's experience because it meant that someone had the key of the stolen vehicle. PRPO Bari then started to canvass the area by going house to house looking for the owner or the possessor of the keys of the stolen vehicle. No one had any information about the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Then, PRPO Bari (who was in civilian clothing and wearing his badge on his neck) approached a property to the far-left which door was ajar. See Exhibit 7. PRPO Bari said \"good afternoon, it is the police.\" A male (later identified as Defendant Figueroa) came out from the right side and stood in front of the glass door. See Exhibit 8 and 8-1. PRPO Bari observed that Defendant Figueroa had a black pistol on his waistband. PRPO Bari asked Defendant Figueroa if he had a license to carry the firearm. Defendant Figueroa said he did not have a license. PRPO Bari then took away the firearm from Defendant and placed it on his waistband. PRPO Bari arrested Defendant Figueroa, patted him down and gave him the Miranda warnings. PRPO Bari made sure that Defendant Figueroa understood the Miranda warnings by asking him if he understood them. Defendant answered he did understand them. PRPO Bari asked Defendant if he was alone in the house due to safety reasons. Defendant Figueroa said there was no one else in the house. PRPO Bari asked Defendant if he had more firearms and he said he had more firearms. PRPO Bari asked where the firearms were, and Defendant indicated they were in a bedroom. PRPO Bari asked Defendant if he would agree voluntarily to show him where the firearms where and Defendant consented. PRPO Bari then went with Defendant down the hallway to the bedroom on the left with the flash light of his cellular phone because it was dark. Defendant showed PRPO Bari an armoire inside the bedroom. Drugs, paraphernalia and bullets were found in the drawers of the armoire. Three bags were also found. The blue and black bags were in the bedroom and the green bag was inside the closet. See Exhibits 9, 10, 11 and 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Exhibit 11 shows the items seized including a cut-off shotgun, two AK-47, two rifles, ammunition and magazines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   PRPO Bari found on Defendant's person the pistol he had seen before and the keys to the stolen Toyota Corolla in one of his pockets. PRPO Bari went to the stolen car with the beeper and the keys and they both worked. PRPO Bari did not search any other bedroom at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Technical Services arrived at the location and an inventory was done. PRPO Bari gave the keys of the property to a neighbor, as instructed by Defendant. Some family members arrived and locked the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Toyota vehicle was searched because it was a stolen vehicle which was\n   recovered. The proper form was filled out. Two magazines and 22 rounds were seized from the interior of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Defendant Figueroa was taken to the PRPD Headquarters in Bayam\u00f3n. Defendant was presented with the Miranda Warnings form in writing, a consent form and the inventory sheet. Defendant refused to sign the documents. See Joint Exhibit I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Exhibit 13 is the inventory of the Toyota Corolla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Exhibit 14 is a photograph of the evidence which was found on Defendant's person, to wit, a Glock pistol, a loaded magazine which was inside the pistol and two cellular phones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   On cross-examination, PRPO Bari testified that Defendant Figueroa never ran and did not threaten the police officers. The house was not on fire and PRPO Bari did not hear anyone screaming. PRPO Bari had never met Defendant Figueroa before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Testimony of PRPO Gonz\u00e1lez:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   PRPO Gonz\u00e1lez testified that on February 23, 2018, he was on duty with the PRPD. PRPO Gonz\u00e1lez was on an undercover vehicle with PRPO Bari and Sgt. Rivera at San Jos\u00e9 Ward in Toa Baja. PRPO Gonz\u00e1lez was there as part of an anti-crime plan doing preventive rounds. PRPO Bari ran the license plate of a Toyota Corolla vehicle which came back as stolen. They stayed back waiting for back up. Other officers went door to door speaking with the residents trying to identify the owner of the Toyota Corolla. PRPO Gonz\u00e1lez stayed surveilling the perimeter per instructions of Sgt. Rivera. Then, PRPO Gonz\u00e1lez heard PRPO Bari identify himself as police and then said, \"raise your hands.\" Sgt. Rivera was close to PRPO Bari and came out and said that an armed subject was inside. Sgt. Rivera asked PRPO Gonz\u00e1lez to keep watching the perimeter. PRPO Gonz\u00e1lez followed the instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
