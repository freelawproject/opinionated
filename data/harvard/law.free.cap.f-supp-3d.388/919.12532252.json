Durham's Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Doc. No. 33). For the reasons set forth herein, the motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Jeremy Durham was elected to the 108th General Assembly of the Tennessee House of Representatives in November 2012 and again in November 2014, for the 109th General Assembly, where he served until his expulsion on September 13, 2016. (Am. Compl., Doc. No. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 34.) As a result of the expulsion, Durham was removed from the House membership roll before the end of the 109th General Assembly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) He was later informed by the defendants that his expulsion resulted in the termination of certain state benefits in which he claims he had a vested interest. This lawsuit stems from the expulsion and ensuing events, in particular the denial of the state benefits. Durham asserts that his expulsion violated Article 1, Section 10 of the United States Constitution, which prohibits bills of attainder, and his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. He also claims it was in violation of state law. He alleges that the unauthorized expulsion and bill of attainder led to further constitutional deprivations when his benefits were terminated. He brings suit to vindicate the federal constitutional violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking his reinstatement on the membership roll of the 109th General Assembly and reinstatement of his state benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As set forth in the Amended Complaint, the Tennessee Attorney General's Office issued a report in July 2016 on Durham's alleged \"disorderly conduct\" while in office. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 35.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, Representative Mike Stewart called for a special session vote to expel Durham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The stated purpose of the session was to ensure that Durham's lifetime pension would not vest in November. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) House Majority Leader Gerald McCormick sponsored a petition in support of the special session. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) Only twenty-seven representatives signed the petition, as a result of which the call for a special legislative session failed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) House Republican Caucus Chair Glen Casada and Representative Joe Armstrong circulated a second petition to call a special legislative session to oust Durham. That petition failed as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 14, 2016, Durham announced at a press conference that he had withdrawn from the GOP primary for his seat in the upcoming term. On August 4, 2016, Sam Whitson won the GOP primary in Durham's district, thus ensuring that Durham would not be re-elected to serve a third term in the General Assembly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) As of that date, there was no plan for the House of Representatives to convene again until after the election of the next General Assembly. Durham's service in the House was over, and he had \"effectively retired from the legislature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   However, on September 2, 2016, then-Governor Bill Haslam issued a proclamation to convene the Tennessee General Assembly for a special session. As set forth in the proclamation, the purpose of the special session was to \"[c]onsider[ ] and act[ ] upon legislation necessary to ensure that Tennessee law prohibiting an individual under the age of 21 from operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol maintains compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20161\">\n    23 U.S.C. \u00a7 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \" and, generally, to ensure compliance with federal law relating to federal-aid highway funding, in order for the State to avoid losing up to $60 million in federal highway funds. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 44; Proclamation, Doc. No. 33-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The special legislative session was authorized by Article III, Section 9 of the Tennessee Constitution. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 9.) That provision specifically empowers the governor, \"on extraordinary occasions, [to] convene the General Assembly by proclamation, in which he shall state specifically the purposes for which they are to convene.\" Tenn. Const. art. III, \u00a7 9. On such occasions, the General Assembly \"shall enter on no legislative business except that for which they were specifically called together.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a press release dated September 2, 2016, Governor Haslam confirmed that an effort to expel Durham was not on the agenda for the special session. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 11, 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nonetheless, on September 12, 2016, the first day of the special session, which Durham did not attend, Representative Susan Lynn gave notice that she intended to make a motion the next day to expel Durham from the House for \"disorderly behavior.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 48.) Durham, notified by media reports about Lynn's announcement, attended the special session the following morning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) That morning, as the House reconvened for the special session to deal with federal highway funds, Lynn introduced her motion and \"debate ensued.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Durham spoke on his own behalf, arguing that the action was unconstitutional and that he had not been accorded due process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) The Tennessee House of Representatives nonetheless voted on the motion and approved it by a margin of seventy votes in favor of expulsion to two against. Durham was not present for the vote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Durham was immediately expelled from the House of Representatives and his name was removed from the House membership roll. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 57.) Durham maintains that his expulsion violated state and federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly after his expulsion from the legislature, Durham inquired about the status\n   of his state health insurance coverage. He was informed that, as a result of the vote to expel him on September 13, his insurance coverage as an active state employee would terminate on September 30, 2016, after which date he would be eligible for COBRA coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 60-61; Doc. No. 33-2.) An email attached to the Amended Complaint, from Angie Gargara, Benefits Administration, to Tammy Rather, which the plaintiff claims was forwarded to him, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The question of whether former Representative Durham is entitled to lifetime coverage as a retiree was decided by Commissioner Martin after consultation with the Attorney General's office. It is the Department's decision that expulsion from the General Assembly does not constitute \"retirement\" that the law requires for lifetime coverage, so Representative Durham is not entitled to that benefit. The Attorney General interpreted \"retirement\" to exclude expulsion in Attorney General Opinion 80-147.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Doc. No. 33-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to the loss of his healthcare benefit, Durham claims that, \"[a]s a direct and proximate result of his improper and unauthorized expulsion,\" he lost his state \"pension and has been so informed by the State's Benefits Administration Division.\" (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on these factual allegations, Durham originally filed suit in this court on August 21, 2017, naming as defendants Larry Martin, in his official capacity as Tennessee Commissioner of Finance and Administration; Connie Ridley, in her official capacity as Director of Legislative Administration; and David H. Lillard, Jr., in his official capacity as Treasurer of the State of Tennessee. The original Complaint asserted a single \"Count\": that the plaintiff had a protected property interest in his state benefits and was denied due process through the deprivation of these benefits, based on his\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   expulsion from the House of Representatives. (Doc. No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This court, construing the original Complaint as asserting a claim based on the plaintiff's unlawful expulsion from the legislature, dismissed the Complaint for lack of standing, as the named defendants did not participate in that action. The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded, finding that the plaintiff Durham had standing to sue the administrators named as defendants, because the injuries he seeks to remedy are fairly traceable to the administrators' conduct, as he adequately alleged that he is not receiving benefits that the defendant administrators should pay.\n   <em>\n    Durham v. Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518788\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/432/#p433\">\n    905 F.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433 (6th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following remand, the plaintiff was granted leave to amend his Complaint. In the Amended Complaint, he names four new defendants: Joe McCord, in his official capacity as the former Chief Clerk of the Tennessee House of Representatives; Victor Thompson, in his official capacity as the former Chief Sergent-At-Arms of the Tennessee House of Representatives; Tammy Letzler, in her official capacity as the current Chief Clerk of the Tennessee House of Representatives; and William C. Howse, in his official capacity as the current Sergent-At-Arms of the Tennessee House of Representatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Amended Complaint includes a new cause of action as well. In Count I, Durham claims that his expulsion by the House of Representatives constituted a legislative action that punished him by taking away his vested health insurance and\n   pension benefits without a judicial trial. He asserts that, as such, the action constituted a bill of attainder, which is expressly barred by Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution. He claims that the \"defendants\"-without identifying which of them-deprived him of his constitutional right to not have a bill of attainder passed against him, a violation he seeks to vindicate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 62-72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In Count II, \"Denial of Due Process,\" Durham asserts, as he had in the original Complaint, that he had a protected property interest in his state benefits and was deprived of those benefits without due process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) He claims that, based on the plain language of Article III, Section 9 of the Tennessee Constitution and the prior failed attempts to call a special session for the specific purpose of expelling him, he had a reasonable expectation under state law that he would retain his state benefits (lifetime health insurance and a state pension) following the expiration of his term. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 75.) He could not have anticipated a vote on his expulsion during the special session called to prevent the state's loss of federal highway funds, given that state law prohibited the legislature from conducting any other business during that session, and Durham's only notice of Representative Lynn's intent to make a motion to expel him was through the media's coverage of the special session. Durham alleges that he was not given a meaningful opportunity to be heard and was afforded no post-deprivation remedy to challenge his expulsion or the deprivation of his state benefits. He brings this claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as well, claiming that the defendants, acting under color of state law, deprived him of his right to due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In his Prayer for Relief, Durham demands that the court issue (1) a declaration that the State of Tennessee's action, through the House's \"illicit and unjustified expulsion\" of him, constitutes an unconstitutional bill of attainder; (2) a declaration that he had a \"potential property interest in his state benefits\" that the defendants denied him without due process of law (Doc. No. 33, at 13); and (3) an injunction requiring the defendants to reinstate the plaintiff to the House membership roll of the 109th General Assembly and to reinstate his state pension and health insurance coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendants thereafter filed their Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint and supporting Memorandum of Law, arguing that the dismissal is required under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted. (Doc. Nos. 35, 36.) The plaintiff has filed his Response in opposition thereto, and the defendants filed a Reply. (Doc. Nos. 40, 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

It would make no sense, for example, to permit the plaintiff to sue the Tennessee Commissioner of Education based on unconstitutional policies adopted by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. State officials sued in their official capacity are not interchangeable, absent some allegation of mistake that would fall within the purview of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).

On September 26, 2016, Plaintiff received a response from Angie Gargaro from the State's Benefits Administration Division.

(Doc. No. 36, at 15.) They also argue that the plaintiff has not shown that the State's remedies for redressing the deprivation of these benefits was inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The court addresses the question of whether the Amended Complaint states a claim related to the deprivation of the state health insurance benefit and the retirement benefit separately, as the analysis pertaining to each differs substantially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

That statute says, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Upon\n   <em>\n    retirement\n   </em>\n   from the general assembly, any senator or representative ... may elect to retain retiree health benefits by participating in the plan authorized by the state insurance committee ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208-27-208\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 8-27-208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (2015) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The defendants maintain that the plaintiff did not \"retire\" from the General Assembly and, therefore, is not eligible for health insurance benefits under this provision, based on the ordinary and common definition of the term \"retire.\" He was, instead, expelled. (Doc. No. 36, at 19-20.) Consequently, they argue, Durham does not have a legitimate expectation of insurance coverage under \u00a7 8-27-208 and no constitutionally protected property interest in such benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The plaintiff responds that (1) defendant Ridley, who is responsible for all administrative matters and member benefits for the General Assembly, publicly stated that the plaintiff would keep his health benefits, even if he were expelled from the house, thus giving rise to a \"reasonable expectation\" that he remained eligible for such benefits; (2) the defendants' proposed interpretation of \"retire\" would lead to an absurd result, since it would mean that representatives who lost re-election campaigns should not be eligible for coverage either, but \"there is no question that such individuals are still entitled to health insurance benefits\" under \u00a7 8-27-208 (Doc. No. 40, at 12); and (3) if he had not been \"unconstitutionally expelled,\" he would have effectively retired from the legislature, having decided not to run for re-election (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The plaintiff's first argument is unavailing. A statement by defendant Ridley cannot create a binding property interest if it is in fact contradicted by state law, as indicated above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305924\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/422/#p430\">\n    455 U.S. at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305924\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/422/#p430\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The hallmark of property ... is an individual entitlement grounded in state law.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puckett v.

The plaintiff appears to argue that, because legislators in that situation are permitted to keep their health insurance, the statute should extend to cover his situation as well. In other words, he is suggesting that, even though he was expelled, he had a reasonable expectation that he would keep his benefits, because expulsion is a form of retirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court notes that there is actually no proof in the record regarding whether legislators who lose re-election bids are permitted to keep their health insurance benefit. Even assuming that they are, however, there is no obvious absurdity in treating a state representative who has been expelled from the General Assembly differently from one who merely loses re-election. And as a matter of simple statutory construction, the court finds that the term \"retirement\" does not encompass an involuntary expulsion from the legislature. As the defendants argue, \"retirement\" is ordinarily defined as \"withdrawal from one's position or occupation or from active working life,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it implies a voluntary action on the part of the person withdrawing. Conversely, \"expel\" is defined as \"to force to leave (a place, an organization, etc.) by official action[;] take away rights or privileges of membership.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The terms are not remotely synonymous.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

The former ordinarily signifies voluntary withdrawal, the latter compulsory dismissal.\"). It is clear that, as a result of his expulsion, the plaintiff did not simply retire from the General Assembly, and this comparison does not further his claim regarding the existence of a protected property interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Nonetheless, regarding the third argument, which is contrary to his second, Durham's position all along has been that his unconstitutional expulsion actually prevented his retirement from the legislature and that the defendants' determination that he was not entitled to health insurance benefits resulted directly from his ouster. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 19 (\"As the direct and proximate result of his improper and unauthorized expulsion, Plaintiff has lost his lifetime health insurance benefits ... and has been so informed by the State's Benefits Administration Division.\").) More specifically, he alleges that he was expelled without due process and for the express purpose of preventing his \"retirement\" from the legislature in order to effect the deprivation of his continued right to health insurance coverage. And\n   the defendants actually do not dispute that, if Durham had not been forcibly expelled from the legislature, his right to health insurance would have continued unabated following the expiration of his second term in the legislature. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 36, at 1 (\"As a result of this expulsion, Plaintiff is not entitled to lifetime health insurance ... benefits under state law.\").) In that sense, it was potentially a property right created and protected by state statute that was not subject to arbitrary or unilateral termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In addition, the plaintiff adequately alleges that his ouster from the state legislature was in violation of his federal due process rights, given, in particular, that he was not provided advance notice of the resolution to expel him and that the bringing of the motion violated the procedure established by the state constitution, providing that special sessions are to deal only with the purposes for which they are called.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerald v.

The second part of the inquiry is whether the plaintiff adequately alleges that the State's procedure for redressing the deprivation of his protected property interest was inadequate. Regarding this question, the plaintiff alleges generally that he was not provided with appropriate or meaningful notice or an opportunity to be heard prior to the expulsion vote and that the State did not provide any post-expulsion process.

He also claims that there is no state or administrative procedure that would \"compensate Plaintiff for the deprivation\n   of his benefits.\" (Doc. No. 40, at 12-13.) Of course, this court cannot order the state to compensate Durham for the deprivation of his benefits either. That is precisely the type of retroactive monetary relief barred by the Eleventh Amendment. But the plaintiff's broader point is well taken. Section 8-27-102, cited by the defendants, provides only for the administrative resolution of \"disputes regarding eligibility and enrollment for the plans and the benefit structure of the plans administered by those committees.\" And the APA itself, while providing for judicial review of an administrative decision, limits such review to the \"record\" and confines relief to situations where the agency decision itself has prejudiced a claimant's rights\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   because the\n   <em>\n    administrative\n   </em>\n   findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   (2) In excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   (3) Made upon unlawful procedure;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   (4) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   (5)(A) Unsupported by evidence which is both substantial and material in the light of the entire record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    Publix Super Markets, Inc. v.

In other words, the defendants' position is that the plaintiff did not have a vested property interest in retirement benefits and would not have had such a property interest, even if he had continued to serve in the General Assembly until his term expired at the end of 2016, because he still would not have had five years of creditable service as a state employee at that point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also argue that he has failed to allege that the state lacked an adequate remedy to address the deprivation of any purported property interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The court accepts, for purposes of the Motion to Dismiss, that the plaintiff has adequately alleged that he elected to participate in the state retirement system. Otherwise, however, the plaintiff's factual allegations in support of this claim are utterly insufficient. He does not allege that he ever made a claim for retirement benefits, that some particular statute operated to terminate his retirement benefit as a result of his expulsion, or that the state lacked a procedure for remedying the allegedly wrongful deprivation of a vested interest. On this basis alone, the court finds that the Amended Complaint fails to state a colorable claim based on the alleged deprivation of due process in connection with a vested interest in a state retirement benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Even if the court accepts, for purposes of the motion to dismiss, that the Amended Complaint adequately alleges that the plaintiff made a claim for benefits that was denied by the defendants, he has not responded at all to the defendants' argument that, under Tennessee law, he did not have a vested interest in a state retirement benefit and, further, that his expulsion from the legislature had no effect on his right to a state retirement benefit. Rather than addressing this issue, the plaintiff asserts only that he had a \"reasonable understanding,\" based on \"numerous representations as well as long-standing custom and practice,\" that \"his time in the General Assembly entitled him to these benefits.\" (Doc. No. 40, at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   He claims that \"[e]vidence such as representations and customs may be used to determine whether a party has a legitimate expectation to retirement benefits\" and insists that he had \"no reason to believe that he would not be entitled to his benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Without providing a citation to any particular statute, he claims, in a wholly conclusory fashion, that he \"met the statutory eligibility requirements for retirement benefits.\" (Doc.

On its face, this provision appears to mean that, even if his legislative term had simply expired at the end of 2016, the plaintiff's retirement benefit would not have vested 100%, because he would not have achieved five years of creditable service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in response to the defendants' assertion that this provision pertains to the plaintiff and establishes that he did not have a vested interest in retirement benefits, the plaintiff states only: \"Plaintiff met the statutory eligibility requirements for retirement benefits.\" (Doc. No. 40, at 11.) He does not suggest an alternative interpretation of the statute or attempt to explain why it might not pertain to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The defendants, likewise, do not explain how \u00a7 8-36-201(a)(1) is construed by the TCRS regulations, what it means to be less than 100% vested, or how \u00a7 8-36-201(a)(1) should be read in conjunction with other parts of the statutory scheme, in particular \u00a7 8-36-204,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the court's limited understanding of these provisions indicates that, regardless of whether the plaintiff had a vested property interest in a retirement benefit, that interest was not affected by his expulsion from the state legislature. If the language of \u00a7 8-34-201, upon which the defendants rely, indeed requires five creditable years of service before an official's right to a retirement\n   benefit vests, then the plaintiff's interest had not yet vested at the time of his expulsion and\n   <em>\n    would not have vested\n   </em>\n   even if he had not been expelled, because he would not have had five years of service upon the expiration of his term in the General Assembly at the end of 2016. On the other hand, if the language of \u00a7 8-34-204(c) applies instead,\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note 14, then state legislators may not have been subject to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   requirement pertaining to length of service in order for their retirement benefits to vest. In that event, the plaintiff may have had a vested interest, but it was not affected by his expulsion. In other words, the plaintiff's expulsion had no apparent effect on his eligibility for retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   As indicated above, the plaintiff does not actually allege that he made a request or even inquired about his retirement benefit. He also does not allege that the state remedy for addressing an allegedly wrongful denial of the benefits was inadequate. Instead, he alleges only that there was no post-deprivation remedy to address his expulsion from the General Assembly. However, because his expulsion from the legislature apparently had no effect on his right to a retirement benefit, that argument is beside the point. Instead, the relevant question is: what remedies were available to Durham specifically pertaining to the purportedly wrongful denial of the state retirement benefit under the statutory scheme (again assuming he made a request that was actually denied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The plaintiff does not allege that the State does not have any pre- or post-deprivation remedy pertaining to the denial of the retirement benefit, that it has a remedy but not an adequate one, or that an adequate remedy existed but it was misapplied in his case.\n   <em>\n    Hahn\n   </em>\n   , 190 F.3d on 716.

Because the Amended Complaint does not allege as a factual matter that the plaintiff availed himself of the statutory remedy, that the remedy is inadequate in his case, or that the State misapplied the remedy, the court finds on this basis too that the Amended Complaint fails to state a procedural due process claim for which relief may be granted as it pertains to the purported deprivation of a state retirement benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to show that he was deprived of a vested state interest in a state retirement benefit or that, even if he was, there was no adequate state procedure to remedy the allegedly unconstitutional deprivation of that benefit. However, he has stated a colorable due process claim related to the termination of his state health insurance benefit.
