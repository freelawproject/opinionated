Over the next five years, she made all the payments required under her bankruptcy plan. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 42-49. In November 2017, the Bankruptcy Noticing Center notified her that she had completed her plan. FAC \u00b6 49. In January 2018, her bankruptcy was discharged. FAC \u00b6 50.

The Metro 2 format provides guidance on how furnishers of consumer information should report consumer accounts once the consumer has paid out the account through a successfully-discharged bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 57. For unsecured accounts, the report should list the CII status as \"Discharged/Completed through BK Chapter 13.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Current Balance, Scheduled Monthly Payment Amount, and Amount Past Due should all be listed as \"Zero\" or \"$0\".\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For secured accounts, the Metro 2 likewise requires furnishers to update the account's Status, Payment History, Current Balance, Scheduled Monthly Payment Amount, and Amount Past Due. FAC \u00b6 58. Yet, following Galea's successful discharge of bankruptcy, Equifax issued a credit report in September 2018 that listed her Scheduled Payment Amount as $410.

Section 1681e(b) requires a consumer reporting agency to \"follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information\" included in a consumer report. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e(b). If a consumer disputes \"the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in [her] file,\" Section 1681i(a) requires the consumer reporting agency to \"conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i(a).

Scheduled Monthly Payment Amount ... as Zero.\" FAC \u00b6 57 (internal quotations omitted). Secured accounts should, likewise, be updated. FAC \u00b6 58. Galea's credit report did not list her Scheduled Payment Amount as zero following the successful completion of her bankruptcy plan. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 50, 110. Assuming the truth of Galea's allegations (as this Court must for purposes of this Motion), the Metro 2 provides an objective basis for her claim that the Equifax report was incorrect or misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Equifax failed to show, as a matter of law, that Galea did not allege inaccuracies in her September 2018 credit report. The Court denies Equifax's motion to dismiss Galea's Section 1681e(b) and 1681i(a) claims on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i(b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under Section 1681i(b), a consumer may file a brief statement of dispute if the reinvestigation requested under Section 1681i(a) did not resolve the issue. As Equifax argues, Galea does not allege Equifax prevented her from filing a statement of dispute following its reinvestigation. Mot. at 11. Indeed, Equifax's results letter expressly invited Galea to \"add a statement of up to 100 words\" to her credit file.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201150848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Exh. 3 at 2). The Court interprets Galea's failure to oppose this argument as acquiescence of its merit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bird v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-cv-00755-SKO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206594612\">\n    2017 WL 6594612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 26, 2016). The Court grants Equifax's motion, dismissing Galea's Section 1681i(b) claim without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    California Consumer Reporting Agencies Act Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Both parties concede Sections 1785.16 and 1785.14 under the CCRAA are substantially identical to Sections 1681i and 1681e under the FCRA. Mot. at 3-4; Opp'n at 4. A plaintiff must show information in her credit report is inaccurate to state a claim under Section 1785.16 or Section 1785.14.\n   <em>\n    Carvalho v.

Furthermore, \"inaccuracy\" under these provisions is governed by the \"patently incorrect or materially misleading\" standard used for FCRA claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079214\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/876/#p889\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079214\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/876/#p889\">\n    at 890-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants do not advance any reasons why the Court should dismiss Galea's CCRAA claims beyond those it argued for dismissal of her corresponding FCRA claims. So, for the reasons discussed above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1214-17, the Court denies Equifax's motion to dismiss Galea's\n   Section 1785.16 and Section 1785.14 claims under the CCRAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Willfulness Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Equifax argues Galea failed to allege that any of the alleged violations of the FCRA and CCRAA were willful. Mot. at 12-13. The Court agrees. The \"willfulness\" requirement under the FCRA covers both known and reckless violations,\n   <em>\n    Robbins v. CitiMortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206513662\">\n    2017 WL 6513662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2017), and Galea has not adequately alleged either. In her complaint, she maintains \"the Credit Bureaus' employees have a policy of simply parroting whatever information is provided by furnishers rather than conducting a reasonable investigation.\" FAC \u00b6 70. These reinvestigations, she argues, \"occur in a hurried, conveyor-belt styled atmosphere in which dispute operators are under pressure to process disputes quickly to meet production quotas\" - a process that results in \"a speed-minded dispute operator failing to consider ... information that is relevant to the consumer's dispute.\" FAC \u00b6 71. Conclusory statements such as these are not entitled to the presumption of truth generally afforded to a plaintiff's allegations at this stage.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The Order also states that an attorney who exceeds the page limits must pay monetary sanctions of $50.00 per page and that the Court will not consider any arguments made past the page limit.

If Galea elects to amend her complaint with respect to either of these claims, she shall file a Second Amended Complaint within twenty days of this Order. Defendants' responsive pleading is due twenty days thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, the Court ORDERS Equifax's counsel to pay $250.00 in sanctions.
