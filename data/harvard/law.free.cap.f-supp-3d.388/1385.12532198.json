Hoffman and EC Design's Motion to Exclude Expert Opinion of Clarke Nelson. (Dkt. Nos. 96, 99, 107, 110.) At the conclusion of the hearing, the court took the matter under advisement with a written order to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   EC Design claims that when Craft Smith and its distributor Michaels Stores began selling the Recollections Planner in October 2016, they infringed on 1) EC's LifePlanner trade dress under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 2) EC's copyright in the LifePlanner under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 54 at 6; Dkt. No. 112 at 6-8, 19.) EC also brings several state law unfair competition claims against Craft Smith and Michaels. (Dkt. No. 54 at 41-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Erin Condren is the founder of EC Design, a California designer and retailer of personal planners, organizers, notebooks, stationery, school and holiday goods, which it sells on its website www.erincondren.com, Amazon, and other retail locations. (Dkt. No. 54 at 7.) Craft Smith, one of EC's competitors, is a California company that began operating in January 2014; it makes and sells products in the personal organizer and crafts markets, including planners under the \"Recollections\" brand. (Dkt. No. 2 at 2; Dkt. No. 112 at 12.) Michaels is a Delaware corporation that sells craft, art, scrapbook, and stationery products at its numerous retail stores, as well as its website www.michaels.com. (Dkt. No. 2 at 7-8.) Craft Smith and Michaels have worked together to develop and sell planners since 2014; Michaels is by far Craft Smith's largest customer. (Dkt. No. 112 at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2007, Erin Condren created EC's flagship product, the LifePlanner. (Dkt. No. 112 at 8.) The LifePlanner has evolved significantly over time since 2007. According to EC, \"[e]ach year since 2007, EC's product development team [has created] a new version of the LifePlanner that builds on Ms. Condren's original design.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) From 2007 to 2015 EC only offered LifePlanners with a vertical layout, but since its 2015-16 LifePlanner version it has offered both horizontal and vertical layouts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The vertical layout uses different artwork and graphics than does the horizontal layout. (Dkt. No. 138 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As of October 2016, the LifePlanner products purchased through the erincondren.com website were customizable. Purchasers could select (i) cover artwork; (ii) removable or \"luxe\" cover style; (iii) a custom message or photograph for the cover; (iv) layout style; (v) coil color; (vi) colorful or neutral color scheme; and (vii) gold foil accents. (Dkt. No. 98 at 10-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since 2009, EC claims to have sold 1,549,770 LifePlanner products, with revenue from these sales totaling approximately $65 million. (Dkt. No. 54 at 23.) In 2016 alone, EC received $18.5 million in U.S. sales of the LifePlanner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 15, 2015, EC reached out to Craft Smith to discuss a \"possible ... private label creation between [the] two companies.\" (Dkt. No. 112 at 10.) Craft Smith's owner and designer were both enthusiastic about the potential to work with EC; Craft Smith's internal correspondence reveals a high level of interest in and admiration for EC's brand, planner quality, and popularity in the market. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 112 at 10, 15.) Craft Smith proposed working with EC to develop a planner together to sell in Michaels stores; ultimately, however, they were unable to arrive at an agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Six months after discussions ended with EC, Craft Smith began preparing to propose a new spiral-bound planner to Michaels that would be similar to EC's LifePlanner. (Dkt. No. 112 at 12.) This would be the first spiral planner Craft Smith had produced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In February 2016, Craft Smith sent its manufacturer in China an EC LifePlanner sample to get a baseline for what its pricing would be on the proposed product for Michaels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Craft Smith told the manufacturer, \"We want the book with the same size and quality of spiral and same laminated type cover. I want to get a quote for this. Same pagination and sheet counts and everything the same.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 29, 2016, Michaels and Craft Smith met to discuss developing a new 2017 planner series to launch in the fourth quarter of 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to meeting notes, Michaels' and Craft Smith's \"[c]oncept [was] to manufacture a like item to the current Erin Condren Life Planner.\" (Dkt. No. 112 at 14.) The projected cost for the new spiral planner was \"based on everything you see in the EC planner,\" with a projection that the new planner could be offered at a discounted price of $24.99-$29.99 in comparison with the LifePlanner's retail price of $40. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 24, 2016, Craft Smith completed its horizontal and vertical Recollections Planner calendar arrangements in black and white, as well as the \"initial cover ... themed ... [and] calendar artwork.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) By April 5, 2016, the final artwork and arrangement of the new planner series was approved by Michaels to move forward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) The planner files were sent to the manufacturer in China on April 5th, along with instructions to \"match [the new planner] exactly to sample\" referring to the LifePlanner Craft Smith had previously provided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sticker pages were purposefully sized to match the LifePlanner's weekly layouts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Craft Smith emphasized that the new Recollections Planner needed to \"feel like overall weight of current sample.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On April 6, Craft Smith further instructed the manufacturer to \"match [the spiral size] of the sample.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In early April 2016, Michaels asked Craft Smith to compare the new Recollections Planner with the LifePlanner, including a request to make sure that no quotes were copied from the LifePlanner \"to make sure our planners are not too similar to hers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) Craft Smith provided the \"specs\" of both planners, revealing that both planners are sized at 7.25? \u00d7 9.25?, and that the twelve-month versions both have a total of 178 pages, and both have removable covers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) EC alleges that the design and arrangement of Recollections didn't change after that comparison was finished. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On April 26, Craft Smith submitted its first purchase orders to the manufacturer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) One day later while reviewing the planner's packaging images, a Craft Smith employee \"noticed that there are still a few things on them that need to be photoshopped, like some of [EC's] prints are showing in spots b/c we used her books for part of our mock-ups. So that definitely needs to be fixed to avoid any major problems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In May 2016, Michaels approached EC to discuss the possibility of Michaels carrying EC's planners at its stores. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Prior to that meeting, Craft Smith had\n   shared consumer survey results showing that \"Erin Condren was the most popular\" planner brand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, this relationship also never materialized as the parties failed to agree on a licensing fee or royalty rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Michaels released Craft Smith's Recollections Planner in October 2016, which was viewed as \"a hit\" with customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 29, 2016, Craft Smith received a letter from EC Design's counsel which included an express allegation that Craft Smith had infringed on EC's alleged copyrights and trade dress rights in the LifePlanner. (Dkt. No. 2 at 3.) EC demanded that Craft Smith immediately cease selling or advertising any planners, including the Recollections Planner, that incorporate any design, text, graphic, color combination, or other material allegedly found in the LifePlanner, and to notify all distributors to return unsold planners to Craft Smith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 8, 2016, Craft Smith filed a complaint in this court against EC seeking a declaratory judgment of no copyright infringement and no trade dress infringement, as well as an award of Craft Smith's costs and attorney fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On the same day Craft Smith initiated this action (December 8, 2016), EC applied for the following copyright registrations from the U.S. Copyright Office for its 2016-17 LifePlanners, which were granted on December 12, 2016:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 LifePlanner Horizontal Layout 2016/2017, U.S. Registration No. VA 2-024-598.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 LifePlanner Vertical Layout 2016/2017, U.S. Registration No. VA 2-024-599.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Dkt. Nos. 110-12, 110-13, 110-15, and 110-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Approximately eight months later, on August 11, 2017, EC applied for a compilation copyright in \"2-D artwork, layout and graphics\" as well as \"Selection, coordination, and arrangement of text and 2D artwork.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 110-17.) Before the copyright was granted by the U.S. Copyright Office, the Copyright Office specifically refused registration of EC's LifePlanner \"layout\" claim, and provided the following rationale:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ... \"layout\" does not describe a copyrightable type of authorship.

Ownership of a Valid Copyright\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To ultimately succeed in its copyright claim, EC Design must first show that it owns a valid copyright in its 2015-16 LifePlanners. In modern copyright cases, this is often established by a certificate of registration which \"constitute[s] prima facie evidence of the validity of the [asserted] copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20410\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The presumption of validity does not apply, however, to alleged authorship that is not \"explicitly claimed in the application\" that was deposited with the Copyright Office, as the office \"does not examine any authorship that is not claimed in the application.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Copyright Office, Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 503.3 (3d ed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   2017). This prima facie presumption therefore does not extend \"to unclaimed authorship that appears in the [registered] work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20410\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Importantly, Section 410(c) of the Copyright Act also provides that \"[t]he evidentiary weight to be accorded the certificate of a registration ... shall be within the discretion of the court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20410\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   EC Design claims that it owns a valid compilation copyright in EC's \"creative selection and arrangement of the many elements, materials, and data comprising the [2015-2016] LifePlanner\" (hereafter \"EC's asserted compilation\"). (Dkt. No. 151 at 7, 12.) EC further argues that because its registered 2016-17 LifePlanner is a derivative of EC's underlying 2015-16 work, EC Design is entitled to a presumption of validity for its underlying compilation. Craft Smith responds that because EC Design never claimed copyright in a compilation of planner parts (divorced of specific artwork, graphics, or text) in its 2016-17 LifePlanner registrations that were deposited with the Copyright Office, EC \"enjoys no presumption of ... validity with respect to the asserted 2015-2016 LifePlanners or the asserted compilation of planner parts.\" (Dkt. No. 138 at 5, 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court agrees with Craft Smith on the initial question of the presumption of validity. Because the copyright asserted by EC Design in this case is a compilation copyright, the court looks first to the language of EC's registration certificate for the \"2016/2017 Vertical LifePlanner Compilation\" that was deposited in the Copyright Office. (Dkt. No. 110-19.) That registration certificate describes the \"limitation of copyright claim\" as only including the following new material: \"2-D artwork, compilation of introductory and section phrases, graphics.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, the certificate explicitly excludes \"Calendar arrangement and calendar text\" from the copyright claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And as Craft Smith points out, EC initially attempted to claim \"layout\" as part of its claim for copyright protection, but this was denied by the Copyright Office because \"layout does not describe a copyrightable type of authorship.\" (Dkt.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 151 at 8-9.) Craft Smith responds that because literary works are defined as \"works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia....\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and the LifePlanner \"does not express anything in words, other than the short phrases which are not copyrightable,\" it cannot meet the definition of a literary work. (Dkt. No. 138 at 33-34.) Craft Smith further argues that because the LifePlanner has an \"intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information,\" it is a \"useful article\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) that cannot be protected as a pictorial or graphic work. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 138 at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The court finds no protectable expression in EC's asserted compilation. Once the non-copied features are removed from consideration (i.e., the 2-D artwork, introductory and section phrases, and graphics), EC's remaining compilation ultimately consists of a collection of planner parts, common property (primarily calendars),\n   templates of expression, and blank forms (such as lined pages and graph paper). For EC to assert that such a compilation qualifies as \"authorship\" under any definition strains credulity, let alone the specific requirements of Section 102. EC's idea to arrange planner parts, templates, common property, and blank forms in a certain order is just that-an idea. While the LifePlanner could feasibly be conceptualized as a creative process for organizing one's life, processes are also outside the scope of Section 102 and thus unprotectable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bikram's Yoga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345731\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1032/#p1041\">\n    803 F.3d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor is the layout of EC's calendars copyrightable. When the Copyright Office considered EC's application for a LifePlanner \"layout\" claim, it refused registration of that claim, and provided the following justification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   ... \"layout\" does not describe a copyrightable type of authorship. Please note that the general layout or format of a book, a page, a slide presentation, a website, or the like, is not copyrightable because it is a template of expression.

As such, please authorize me to remove the term \"layout\" from the applications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (Copyright Office Correspondence, Dkt. No. 138-2 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The relevant components of the LifePlanner (i.e., those features comprising EC's asserted compilation, which excludes the 2-D artwork, phrases, and graphics which are not part of EC's infringement claim) do not as a whole qualify as a \"literary work\" under the plain meaning of Section 102(a). Merely printing or publishing a work into a book form does not create a literary work-the statute requires that a book, greeting card, etc. must also \"express\" authorship \"in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia ...\" to qualify as a literary work.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Excluding the LifePlanner's introductory and section phrases (uncontested by EC in this case), very few words are even used throughout the planner. It is axiomatic that for a party to claim a compilation of words or data, it must have at least used a sufficient quantity of words or data in the first place for the work to qualify as a work of authorship under Section 102. EC Design has not even met this initial burden.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the text of the LifePlanner's introductory and section phrases were all part of EC's asserted claim against Craft Smith, EC would have likely satisfied this initial literary work threshold, but EC is not alleging that the actual text of these short phrases are the subject of its infringement claim. Nor is the court persuaded that any \"numbers or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia\" present in the LifePlanner qualify as a literary compilation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Additionally, the Copyright Act defines pictorial, graphic, and sculptural (PGS) works as \"two-dimensional and three-dimensional works of fine, graphic, and\n   applied art, photographs, prints and art reproductions, maps, globes, charts, diagrams, models, and technical drawings, including architectural plans.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, \"the design of a useful article\" is \"considered a [PGS] work only if ... such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Star Athletica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602588\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1002/#p1010\">\n    137 S.

The court finds that EC's asserted compilation does not qualify as a three-dimensional work of art, either collectively or individually, but instead more naturally as a book. Furthermore, the LifePlanner clearly has an \"intrinsic utilitarian function\" of organizing and planning one's daily life. And as Craft Smith persuasively argues, a \"compilation of planner parts cannot ... be perceived as a three-dimensional work of art separate from the LifePlanner itself ... [because it] cannot possibly exist separately from the LifePlanner.\" (Dkt. No. 138 at 38-39.)

Although EC \"has introduced some of the circumstantial evidence often used to support such a finding,\" the lack of direct evidence that consumers associated the LifePlanner Trade Dress solely with EC Design, as well as \"the lack of evidence as to confusion on the part of actual consumers [regarding the source of the Recollections Planner], renders this circumstantial evidence insufficient for a reasonable juror to find that the trade dress had acquired a secondary meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yankee Candle Co. v.

(Dkt. No. 126 at 38.) For instance, since EC's original LifePlanner was released in 2007, the LifePlanner has always featured \"a bright and colorful vertical weekly layout, a customizable cover, a coiled binding, and stickers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Since 2008, the front and back covers have been laminated. And since 2011, EC's planners have included colorful monthly tabs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, the interior contents have never been customizable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Craft Smith responds that each of these elements can be found in combination on various other competitors' planners as of October 2016, particularly the LimeLife and Plum Paper planners which use the same general size, single coil binding system, a laminated cover with artwork, and colored tabs. (Dkt. No. 98 at 11-12.) As Craft Smith persuasively argues, \"it simply strains credulity to contend that these features would be solely associated with EC, or with any other single source ... when so many others were using substantially the same combination of arguably visible features on or before October 2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Additionally, the LifePlanner's cover designs have varied significantly\n   over the years, and have been customizable from year to year. The LifePlanner has included prominent new artwork, designs and features each year, with some covers even omitting the familiar \"erinCondren\" trademark or asterisk symbol on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The court finds the LifePlanner's wide variation of its prominent features over time to be particularly significant in determining that the LifePlanner Trade Dress's \"manner of use\" has been inconsistent with a primarily source identifying function. Additionally, the fact that the LifePlanner Trade Dress had only been used entirely in combination for slightly more than one year before the Recollections Planner's October 2016 release directly undermines EC's notion that the LifePlanner Trade Dress was used \"so long and so exclusively\" as to make source identification (i.e., identifying Erin Condren) its primary significance in the mind of the public. Furthermore, the presence of these features in various other competitors' planners shows that EC's alleged \"exclusivity\" of trade dress is highly suspect at best.

The court finds \"the lack of evidence as to advertising of the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   trade dress claimed ...\" to be dispositive for purposes of this factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yankee Candle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498071\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/25/#p45\">\n    259 F.3d at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, EC's evidence of advertising is unable to establish secondary meaning-this factor also favors Craft Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Promotion of public's conscious connection between trade dress and EC Design\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The court relies in part on the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Yankee Candle\n   </em>\n   for approaching the issue of secondary meaning. In that case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the district court's grant of summary judgment of no infringement. The district court's determination that\n   Yankee had failed to show secondary meaning was largely focused on \"the lack of evidence ... demonstrating a conscious connection by the public between the claimed trade dress and the product's source.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yankee Candle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498071\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/25/#p45\">\n    259 F.3d at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The same is true for EC Design. As with the first two factors (which overlap significantly with this factor), this factor cuts in Craft Smith's favor. In addition to the reasoning discussed above, because the LifePlanner Trade Dress description is difficult to describe in the first place, the court finds that EC's lack of consistency in the manner and use of the LifePlanner Trade Dress over the years suggests no significant effort by EC to connect the already elusive and abstract LifePlanner Trade Dress with Erin Condrin as the product source. Rather, the evidence suggests that EC was content to focus on promoting its distinctive trademarks (\"LifePlanner,\" \"Erin Condren,\" and iconic asterisk/negative asterisk symbols) to create the conscious connection between those marks and EC Design as the source (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 98 at 29-37), rather than the LifePlanner Trade Dress as asserted in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Actual consumer confusion\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In its interrogatory response, EC admits that it is \"unaware of any reported instances of actual [customer] confusion\" between the LifePlanner and Recollections Planner, and did not deny Craft Smith's statement of undisputed material fact that EC has no evidence of actual customer confusion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 96-2 at 143; Dkt. No. 145 at 12.) Nevertheless, EC still \"alleges there is a likelihood of customer confusion.\" (Dkt. No. 96-2 at 143.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The court disagrees with EC's argument on likelihood of customer confusion. There are numerous significant differences between the LifePlanner and the Recollections Planner, beginning perhaps most importantly with the planners' covers themselves (artwork, presentation, etc.) and the descriptive flap covering part of the front of the Recollections Planner. Based on these \"first impression\" distinctions alone, it is highly unlikely that an ordinary consumer of these products would find these two products confusingly similar. In addition to these differences in outward appearance, there are numerous other weighty differences discussed above in the copyright section of this opinion. Unlike with EC's copyright claim, here the differences in 2-D artwork, introductory and section phrases, graphics, and even use and placement of the trademarks themselves (\"Recollections,\" \"Erin Condren,\" \"LifePlanner,\" asterisks, etc.) are all material to the analysis of whether ordinary consumers were likely confused by the Recollections Planners' \"look and feel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   EC's lack of evidence otherwise is also instructive for this factor. With all of these significant, material differences between the two products, the court holds that no reasonable jury could conclude that an ordinary consumer would have been confused as to the source of the Recollections Planner when purchasing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Proof of intentional copying\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \"Proof of copying may be sufficient in and of itself to establish secondary meaning because there is no reason to copy a non-functional feature except to capitalize on an already existing secondary meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartford House Ltd. v.

The\n   <em>\n    Marker\n   </em>\n   court deemed this an admission by defendant that plaintiff's mark had achieved secondary meaning. The reason for copying was critical to the court's decision.

By contrast, Craft Smith asserts that in this case no evidence has been presented of its intent to pass off the Recollections Planner as a LifePlanner, thereby capitalizing on EC's reputation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   EC has failed to present evidence of Craft Smith's intent to cause customer confusion as to the source of the trade dress. Rather, the court is persuaded that Craft Smith's intent was more likely to exploit some of the LifePlanner's desirable features, while intentionally avoiding any copying of EC's artwork, graphics, and text. While EC has proven Craft Smith's obvious intentional copying, EC would ultimately not be able to support a finding of secondary meaning on this fact alone. At best this factor is inconclusive. The court finds that EC's intentional copying evidence alone is insufficient to defeat summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     Sales volume evidence\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \"Sales volume ... only suggests secondary meaning when presented in conjunction with other evidence; standing alone, sales volume may not be indicative of secondary meaning because it could be related to factors other than source identification.\"\n   <em>\n    Savant Homes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059013\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1133/#p1140\">\n    809 F.3d at 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Between 2009 and 2017, EC Design sold 1,549,770 LifePlanners, earning $65 million in revenue from those sales. EC argues that its high volume of sales alone provides important evidence that a large number of consumers were exposed to its trade dress, and thus that their consumers attribute the trade dress to the product's source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Craft Smith retorts that sales evidence must be combined with additional evidence suggesting that the public actually perceives the LifePlanner's product design\n   <em>\n    primarily\n   </em>\n   as a source identifier, rather than just as its configuration and design. (Dkt. No. 145 at 15.) In support of this contention, it cites the conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Duraco Products\n   </em>\n   that \"[s]ales success by itself will typically not be as probative of secondary meaning in a product configuration case as in a trademark case, since the product's market success may well be attributable to the\n   <em>\n    desirability\n   </em>\n   of the product configuration rather than the\n   <em>\n    source-designating\n   </em>\n   capacity of the supposedly distinguishing feature or combination of features.\"\n   <em>\n    Duraco Prod.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532277\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/40/1431/#p1453\">\n    40 F.3d at 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The court is persuaded that EC has not brought forth sufficient evidence to show that the LifePlanner's success is attributable primarily to its source-designating capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    d.
