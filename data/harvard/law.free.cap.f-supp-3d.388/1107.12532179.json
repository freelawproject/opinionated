HAMILTON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On May 8, 2019, the court held a hearing on (1) the motion of petitioners Jennifer Granick and Riana Pfefferkorn (\"Petitioners\") for de novo determination of dispositive matter referred to magistrate judge,\n   pursuant to Civil L.R. 72-3, and objections to the December 18, 2018, report and recommendation (\"R&amp;R\") of the magistrate judge to deny their petition to unseal technical assistance orders and materials (\"Petition\"); and (2) Petitioners' motion for an evidentiary hearing. Dkt. nos. 62, 63. For the reasons stated on the record and set forth below, the motion for de novo determination is GRANTED; the objections to the R&amp;R are OVERRULED; the motion for an evidentiary hearing is DENIED; the R&amp;R is fully adopted as correct, well-reasoned and thorough; and the disposition on the Petition recommended by the R&amp;R is accepted by the court. Accordingly, the Petition is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The discussion of the factual summary and procedural history of the Petition set forth in the R&amp;R is adopted in full. Dkt. no. 58 at 1-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Posture of the Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 18, 2018, Magistrate Judge Westmore issued an R&amp;R recommending that the court deny the Petition to unseal technical assistance orders and materials. The Petition was reassigned to the undersigned as Chief Judge. Petitioners filed the instant motion for de novo determination (\"Mot.\") and administrative motion for evidentiary hearing on January 16, 2019. Dkt. no. 62, 63. The government, having entered an appearance as an interested party, timely filed its response on March 27, 2019. Dkt. no. 69 (\"Opp.\"). Petitioners filed a reply on April 10, 2019. Dkt. no. 70 (\"Reply\"). Following a hearing on Petitioners' objections to the R&amp;R and motion for de novo determination, the matter was submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Docketing Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to the docketing and sealing procedures summarized in the R&amp;R, the court takes judicial notice of the following Clerk's Office practices and procedures for docketing surveillance applications, orders and related materials under seal in the Northern District of California, as matters that are generally known within the court's jurisdiction, pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 201 :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1. Pursuant to the court's internal intake procedures, an application for issuance of a search or seizure warrant is opened on the court's Case Management/Electronic Case Files (\"CM/ECF\") docketing system as a Magistrate Judge Case designated with \"mj\" as the case type and case number series 70000, e.g. 3:16-mj-76543-MAG. Criminal complaints are also opened as magistrate judge cases with the MJ case designation. Upon the filing of an indictment or information, which is opened as a Criminal Case with \"cr\" as the case type, the MJ case number of the criminal complaint merges under the CR number of the indictment or information in the CM/ECF docketing system. There is no similar procedure for merging the MJ case numbers of search or seizure warrants with a CR case number of a subsequently filed indictment or information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2. Pursuant to the court's internal intake procedures and practices, the following types of criminal matters are opened as Criminal Miscellaneous Cases which are assigned an \"xr\" case number and case number series 90000, e.g., 3:07-xr-98765-MAG:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Wire interceptions\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Orders issued pursuant to the Stored Communications Act (\"SCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Pen registers\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Applications for orders pursuant to the All Writs Act\n   \u2022 Grand jury matters\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This is not an exhaustive list of all types of Criminal Miscellaneous Cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   3. Under current Clerk's Office docketing procedures, an application for an order authorizing surveillance is opened as an MJ or XR case only after an order granting the application is issued by a judge. Currently, there is no procedure for docketing surveillance applications that are not granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   4. Cases involving grand jury matters are automatically sealed without a court order pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 6. All other criminal matters filed under seal require a sealing order pursuant to Criminal L.R. 56-1. Cases or documents filed under seal must be approved for sealing by order of the judge, or a minute order memorializing the judge's order that specifically authorizes the case or document to be sealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   5. Under the court's Criminal Local Rules, \"the electronic filing ('e-filing') of the documents sought to be sealed in criminal cases is not permitted.\" Crim. L.R. 56-1(a). Accordingly, no .pdf files are attached to each of the entries on the sealed criminal docket. Sealed MJ and XR filings in criminal cases are maintained only in paper form until the court orders the unsealing of those filings, when they are scanned and uploaded in a .pdf format by court staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   6. If a magistrate judge case or criminal miscellaneous case is filed under seal, the docket will contain the *SEALED* designation and will be available for internal use only. Clerk's Office staff can view the information that is manually entered on the sealed MJ or XR docket, such as the title of an application for a warrant or order. Some MJ or XR cases filed under seal have a descriptive title such as \"Application for an Order Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d),\" and some cases are simply titled \"USA v. In Re;\" the court's docketing procedures do not require a standard naming convention for magistrate judge cases or criminal miscellaneous cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   7. There is no internal court docketing procedure to add a \"SEALED\" case flag on CM/ECF for magistrate judge cases or criminal miscellaneous cases filed under seal. Accordingly, Clerk's Office staff cannot filter an electronic search on CM/ECF that is limited to sealed MJ cases or XR cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   8. The docket sheet for a sealed magistrate judge case or criminal miscellaneous case is not visible to the public. A public search for magistrate judge cases or criminal miscellaneous cases will result in a list of cases that includes the case numbers of sealed MJ or XR cases and designates the parties as *SEALED*, with no identifying or descriptive information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   9. Because sealed MJ and XR cases, such as search warrant or wiretap applications and supporting documents, are maintained as paper files, manual review of paper files would be required to determine what each sealed document contains, beyond the text of the docket entry that is electronically entered by Clerk's Office staff on the sealed docket in CM/ECF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   10. The court's CM/ECF system does not have a separate case flag or category to designate search warrants in docket entries for MJ cases. Accordingly, the CM/ECF system does not have the ability to filter an electronic search for MJ cases that is accurately limited to search warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   11. Similarly, the court's CM/ECF system does not have a separate case flag or category for XR cases to differentiate wiretaps, \u00a7 2703(d) orders, pen register/trap and trace (\"PR/TT\") devices, and All Writs Act materials. Accordingly, the CM/ECF system does not have the ability\n   to filter an electronic search for XR cases that is accurately limited to a particular category of surveillance or technical assistance materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Those compelling interests are compounded by the administrative burdens on the court and the government required to identify and unseal post-investigation search warrant materials spanning nearly 13 years, which the court may consider as a factor to be weighed against the presumption of public access.\n   <em>\n    Valley Broadcasting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1610149\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/798/1289/#p1294\">\n    798 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1295 and n.8. Allowing public access to these sealed records would also impose burdens on the court docket and the caseload of each judge who would be asked to issue unsealing orders in each search warrant matter, after weighing the competing interests for and against disclosure. Restricting access to sealed search warrant materials would not unduly impede the public's ability to understand and scrutinize the government's use of technical assistance because the public may seek disclosure of relevant materials in publicly filed cases, where the judge presiding over each particular case would determine whether disclosure of search warrant materials, and any limitations on public disclosure, would be warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The court determines that the common law right of access to post-investigative search warrant materials is overcome by these considerations of significant manpower\n   and public resources that would be expended just to identify and produce the subset of search warrant materials sought by Petitioners and to protect the significant governmental and individual interests implicated in those materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The undersigned having served as a magistrate judge for nine years and as a district judge for 19 years, being familiar with the court's docketing system, having reviewed the content of numerous search warrant applications, affidavits, warrants and returns, and having presided over litigation over redactions of information contained in those materials, an evidentiary hearing is not necessary in light of the record to find that identifying and reviewing each of the search warrant cases filed under seal to determine which investigations have been closed, and whether those search warrant materials should remain sealed or redacted to protect governmental interests or individual safety, privacy, due process and reputational interests before public disclosure, is unduly burdensome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The record reflects the enormity of Petitioners' request for access to historical criminal records spanning many years. In support of their motion to unseal dockets and to compel the public docketing of court records, which was denied by Judge Westmore, Petitioners determined that for the six-year period from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2011, there were 4,614 recorded criminal miscellaneous cases, of which 4,415 remained sealed. Dkt. no. 9 (Pfefferkorn Decl.) \u00b6 15 and Ex. A (list of unsealed \"XR\" cases from 2006-2011). Upon review of the XR case docket for the 13-year period sought in the petition, January 1, 2006 to November 8, 2018, the court has determined that 12,243 criminal miscellaneous cases were filed, 11,874 of which are estimated to be under seal. With respect to Petitioners' request to unseal search warrant materials filed from January 1, 2006 to November 8, 2018, the court's review of the magistrate judge criminal case docket, which would include search warrant materials, reflects that 7,498 MJ cases were filed during that period, and the court estimates that 2,540 of those MJ cases remain sealed as of the date of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Petitioners argue that they only seek disclosure of records for which there is no longer any reason to seal and suggest that redaction of sensitive information would adequately protect privacy, public safety and other legitimate concerns. Reply at 8. Petitioners fail to account for the time-consuming process that would be required just to identify which records would be eligible for unsealing. Initially, the Clerk's Office would have to undertake manual review of each sealed docket to determine what type of surveillance materials is contained in the sealed files. Because the court maintains the sealed criminal files in paper form, this review process would have to be conducted in each of the sealed cases to identify the subset of cases that Petitioners seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The government would then have to conduct a case-by-case review of documents to determine whether an investigation is ongoing and to identify any sensitive, private or confidential information that must be redacted before disclosure. The government has represented that this process would be labor intensive because there is no mechanism within the United States Attorney's Office to link a miscellaneous docket number to an investigation or a prosecution of a particular individual.

Further, the government would need to identify the AUSA with the necessary knowledge of each case to determine whether each document could be unsealed, and in some cases, the assigned AUSA may no longer work for the government. Opp. at 16. The government has also articulated the concerns of law enforcement for protecting the identities of cooperators, confidential sources and undercover agents, and preserving the secrecy of wiretap information, grand jury matters and law enforcement techniques, with examples of search warrant materials that reveal confidential sources who remained confidential during the subsequent prosecution and that are related to a criminal investigation in another district, even though the investigation in this district was terminated without a criminal prosecution.

This blanket criticism overlooks the mechanisms that require a judicial determination for the sealing of search warrant applications, and other technical assistance materials sought in the Petition, and the subsequent unsealing of those materials for disclosure to defendants, subject to protective orders, if the investigation results in a criminal prosecution. In any of those publicly filed criminal cases, a member of the public could seek disclosure under the common law right of public access to those search warrant materials, which the presiding judge would weigh against competing interests presented in that case.

The R&amp;R did not, however, rely only on the experience prong to conclude that there was no First Amendment right to access SCA applications, orders and related materials.

This criticism of the R&amp;R is unwarranted, given its extensive discussion of the\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   court's analysis of the factors weighing in favor of and against public access to those surveillance materials in dispute, and its direct application of Ninth Circuit authority which recognizes that \"administrative burden is only one factor for the district court to consider\" and \"could be a legitimate factor for denying access.\"\n   <em>\n    Valley Broadcasting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1610149\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/798/1289/#p1294\">\n    798 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1295 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The R&amp;R considered that the\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   petitioners narrowed their request for public access to extracted PR/TT information and \u00a7 2703(d) docket information, which the D.C. district court estimated would require almost 20 full 40-hour workweeks for the government to extract from electronically available PR/TT records.

Accordingly, the\n   R&amp;R concluded that the presumptive common law right of access to SCA materials, as well as PRA and All Writs Act materials, is overcome by the administrative burden that would be imposed on the court and the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R&amp;R at 23-24 (citing\n   <em>\n    Valley Broadcasting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1610149\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/798/1289/#p1294\">\n    798 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1295 n.8 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Petitioners' objections to the recommendations of the R&amp;R as to SCA materials are overruled.

This argument overlooks the holding of\n   <em>\n    Leopold I\n   </em>\n   , where the court expressly held that there was no First Amendment right of access because there was no historical tradition of openness as to PR/TT materials, failing the first prong of the \"experience and logic\" test.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/#p71\">\n    300 F.

In\n   <em>\n    Leopold II\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that \"[t]hese considerations illustrate that logic weighs against any broader right of access under the First Amendment than that which the Court has already recognized under the common law,\" referring to its earlier ruling granting prospective relief as limited by the docketing reforms agreed to by the USAO and D.D.C.

In other words,\n   <em>\n    Leopold II\n   </em>\n   determined that there was no First Amendment right of access to PR/TT materials because neither prong of the \"experience or logic\" test was satisfied.

There is no Ninth Circuit authority recognizing a First Amendment right to access technical assistance orders under the AWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As the R&amp;R recognized, Ninth Circuit authority holds that \"the AWA 'permits the district court, in aid of a valid warrant, to order a third party to provide nonburdensome technical assistance to law enforcement officers.' \" R&amp;R at 17-18 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Plum Creek Lumber Co. v.

Pet. at 22. As the government articulated in its opposition brief, without rebuttal by Petitioners, the analysis of the public access claims with respect to the underlying investigative materials applies to the supporting AWA materials. Applications for AWA orders are typically issued during the covert stages of an investigation and contain a detailed explanation of why the order is necessary to a criminal investigation.

Further, following the court's de novo determination,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.1, that the presumption of public access to sealed search warrant materials under common law is overcome by administrative burdens, the burden on the court docket, and the compelling interests of the government and individuals, the court determines that Petitioners are not entitled to access sealed AWA materials issued in support of sealed search warrants.

Cir. 2000) (affirming denial of news organizations' request for a generic court rule requiring public docketing of all grand jury ancillary proceedings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The objections to the R&amp;R are overruled and the R&amp;R is adopted as correctly reasoned at pp. 18-19, concluding that there is no First Amendment right of\n   public access to docket sheets for sealed wiretap, SCA, PRA and AWA materials, and at pp. 19-24, concluding that the administrative burden overcomes the common law presumption of access to the underlying SCA, PRA and AWA materials, and, by extension of that reasoning, overcomes the presumptive right of access to those docket sheets. As to the request to unseal and disclose docket sheets of the sealed search warrant materials that were requested in the Petition, by extension of the court's de novo determination,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.1, that there is no First Amendment right of public access to sealed search warrant materials, and that the presumption of public access to sealed search warrant materials under the common law right of access is overcome by administrative burdens, the burden on the court docket, and the interests of the government and individuals, the court determines that there is no right of public access requiring disclosure of those docket sheets. Accordingly, Petitioners' request to unseal and disclose the docket sheets of the five categories of requested surveillance materials (search warrants, wiretap, SCA, PRA and AWA) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Requests for Prospective Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Petitioners object to the recommendation of the R&amp;R that the Petition be denied as to the requests for prospective relief. Petitioners seek prospective changes to the court's docketing and unsealing practices by way of the Petition. Specifically, they seek to have a rule implemented that would require all surveillance applications and orders to be entered on CM/ECF and require the court periodically to review sealed dockets and unseal records for which a continued need to remain under seal no longer exists. Pet. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   While Petitioners acknowledge that docketing reforms could be addressed through the appropriate local rules committee, they take issue with the conclusion of the R&amp;R that this Petition \"is not the vehicle for\n   <em>\n    mandating\n   </em>\n   such changes, especially under the court's supervisory powers over its own records.\" R&amp;R at 27. They argue that the public has the constitutional right \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances,\" and that Petitioners assert a prospective right of access to court records. Mot. at 21 (citing U.S. CONST. amend. I ). The R&amp;R did not question whether the Petition is an appropriate procedural mechanism for asserting the public access claims, but cautioned whether an individual judge ruling on the Petition could or should exercise the court's supervisory authority over its own records and files to commandeer the Clerk of Court's criminal docketing procedures and order the requested administrative and structural changes that would impact the entire court. The courtwide reforms sought in the Petition affect not only the public's right of access, but others whose interests could not be adequately represented by Petitioners: the court which has interests in managing its resources and its docket; the government in preserving the integrity of criminal investigations, protecting the identity of confidential sources and cooperators and protecting the public; criminal defendants in their due process rights; and other individuals in their rights to privacy, reputation, due process and safety. Indeed, Petitioners do not purport to represent those other interests. Accordingly, the R&amp;R correctly concluded that the prospective reforms sought in the Petition would be better addressed through a deliberative and balancing process overseen by the applicable court committee, for consideration and adoption by the judges of the entire court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Petitioners also object to the R&amp;R for comparing the prospective relief sought in their Petition to the relief sought in\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   , where the petitioners expanded their request for prospective relief to include real-time unsealing and public posting of sealed investigative materials.\n   <em>\n    Leopold I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/#p71\">\n    300 F. Supp. 3d at 105-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the litigation had been limited to seeking relief only as to closed investigations until the request for real-time access was added in \"a significant shift in the petitioners' position\"). The court in\n   <em>\n    Leopold I\n   </em>\n   denied the petitioners' additional demands for real-time reporting of sealed materials in ongoing investigations on separate grounds from its ruling on the underlying\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   petition which, like the instant Petition, \"sought information only about closed investigations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/#p71\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   While the R&amp;R addressed the D.C. district court's rulings on the\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   petitioners' request for real-time information, it gave appropriate weight to the holdings of\n   <em>\n    Leopold I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   granting limited prospective relief in light of newly adopted docketing reforms, which were subject to an MOU between the USAO and Clerk's Office. R&amp;R at 26-27. See\n   <em>\n    Leopold I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/#p71\">\n    300 F. Supp. 3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   105 n.38 (\"the petitioners' success in prevailing on their common law right of access claim as to prospective relief is due entirely to the advances outlined in the MOU and adopted by both the USAO and the Clerk's Office in processing the sealed criminal investigative matters at issue\"). The R&amp;R did not purport to adopt the same prospective relief ordered in\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   , and expressly noted that \"the Court does not suggest that any prospective relief be limited to that allowed in\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   .\" R&amp;R at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Petitioners also pursue docketing reform through the court's Ad Hoc Committee on Public Access, which they erroneously assert was formed by the court's Criminal Rules and Practices Committee. Petitioners acknowledge that they were invited to participate, along with other stakeholders, in the discussions of this committee and they request that the court hold in abeyance their request for prospective relief pending the committee's findings and implementation of docketing reforms. Dkt. No. 62 at 20 n.8 and 23-24. Although petitioners were not clear at the hearing, it appeared to the court that they contemplate leaving this litigation open pending the committee's deliberations in order to be able to continue to argue for even broader relief should they not be satisfied with the ultimate recommendation of the committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As explained at the hearing, administrative changes of the magnitude contemplated by Petitioners' petition, which will impact the entire court and staff as well as all stakeholders not represented by these Petitioners and with different interests than Petitioners, are not made by one judge, not even the chief judge, but rather by the entire court. The Ad Hoc Committee on Public Access was formed by the undersigned and tasked with the responsibility to review the court's policies and procedures for sealing and unsealing surveillance records, in view of the comments contributed by the Criminal Rules and Practices Committee and other stakeholders, including Petitioners and institutional litigants, and to recommend, if it sees fit, any revised procedures for consideration and possible adoption by the judges of this court. Any revisions to the court's sealing procedures are subject to this deliberative process as a matter of court governance and are not subject to negotiation as is apparently envisioned by Petitioners. To hold this litigation open and in abeyance pending the deliberative process and then to again permit Petitioners to weigh in on the ultimate result, would be to exalt their interests over the interests of other stakeholders, who have no litigation pending and thus no opportunity for further comment. The court is satisfied that by inviting\n   and permitting Petitioners' participation in the Ad Hoc Committee's review, the court has provided a fair process that allows all stakeholders an equal opportunity to present their concerns to the court. The request to hold the Petition in abeyance is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The court overrules objections to the R&amp;R at pp. 1129-30, adopts the R&amp;R as correctly and thoroughly reasoned, and DENIES the requests for prospective relief presented in the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the motion for de novo determination is GRANTED; the objections to the R&amp;R are overruled; the motion for an evidentiary hearing is DENIED; the R&amp;R is fully adopted; and the Petition is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    The government does not challenge Petitioners' standing under the remaining elements of causation or redressability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
