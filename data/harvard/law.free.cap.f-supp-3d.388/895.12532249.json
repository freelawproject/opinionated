For example, the Capital Jury Project, which was created in 1990 with the objective of gathering and presenting empirical data about how jurors in capital trials make decision, has recently found that death qualification of prospective jurors ultimately leads to an \"unacceptable level of unreliability in capital jury verdicts\" because it (i) results in \"over representation of prosecution- and guilt-prone jurors on capital juries, (ii) \"creates in the jurors a bias against the defendant and in favor of the death penalty,\" and (iii) \"results in the under representation of racial minorities and woman on capital juries.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270606\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/224/327/#p335\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Fell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270606\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/224/327/#p335\">\n    224 F.

Without citation to any authority, Defendants believe that, \"in jurisdictions where most citizens oppose the death penalty, 'death qualification' is likely to result in a greater divergence between the attitudes of the jury selected in a capital case and the attitudes of the community at large.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.
