For example, in\n   <em>\n    Tomaszewski\n   </em>\n   , this Court determined that Kenney did not have personal knowledge about a decision not to promote the plaintiff because the evidence established that plaintiff's application was rejected early in the selection process by a separate committee and there was no evidence that Kenney had seen plaintiff's application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tomaszewski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206590826\">\n    2018 WL 6590826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. In this case, Kenney was more significantly involved-Derenick-Lopez and Slusser testified that they met with Kenney to tell him why they wanted to terminate plaintiff before taking action, and Slusser said that she informed Kenney of concerns about plaintiff weeks before his termination. For these reasons, this case also differs from\n   <em>\n    Hankins\n   </em>\n   , in which the court determined that a mayor's approval of proposed changes to job classifications did \"not demonstrate that he has personal knowledge of the particular reasons why such changes were proposed or why staffing decisions of various agencies were made.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hankins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20524334\">\n    1996 WL 524334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.
