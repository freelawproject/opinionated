INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The U.S. Probation Office alleges that defendant Cameron Lauren Jackson violated the terms of his supervised release by testing positive for the use of marijuana on ten occasions during his term of federal supervision. Defendant maintains that his marijuana use was for medical reasons and was lawful under Pennsylvania's Medical Marijuana Act. Presently before the Court is defendant's Motion to Enjoin Use of [U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") ] Funds and Dismiss Violation Petition on the basis of a rider included in the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which prohibits DOJ from using its funds to \"prevent\" states from \"implementing\" their medical marijuana laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court now faces an issue of first impression in this Circuit: under the appropriations rider, is DOJ permitted to use its funds to prosecute a violation of supervised release premised on state law-compliant use of medical marijuana? For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that the answer is no. Where a defendant shows that his use of medical marijuana was fully compliant with the applicable state law, the rider prohibits DOJ from using its funds to prosecute a violation of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to the U.S. Probation Office, defendant admitted to continuously using marijuana but argued his conduct was not a violation of supervised release because he was in possession of a medical marijuana identification card.

Mot. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 8, 2019, the U.S. Probation Office filed a Report on Offender Under Supervision setting forth the allegations of defendant's marijuana use (ECF No. 8 ). On March 22, 2019, the Court issued an Order scheduling briefing on the novel legal issues presented by this case and a violation hearing for June 13, 2019 (ECF No. 10 ). In compliance with that Order, the U.S. Probation Office submitted the Petition for Violation of Supervised Release, dated March 25, 2019, charging defendant with violating the conditions of his supervised release by testing positive for marijuana use on ten occasions. Pet. 2. The Petition states that the violation warrants revocation of defendant's supervised release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Upon consideration of the Petition, the Court, by Order dated March 26, 2019, issued a summons directing defendant to appear at a revocation hearing. This is the first violation petition filed against Jackson during his three-year term of supervised release. Def. Mot. 6. Defendant contends that at the time the petition was filed, he was compliant with all other conditions of his supervised release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 15, 2019, defendant filed a motion to enjoin the use of DOJ funds in this matter and to dismiss the violation petition (ECF No. 13 ). The Government responded on May 3, 2019 (ECF No. 14 ), and defendant filed a reply on May 7, 2019 (ECF No. 15 ). After a telephone conference with counsel for the parties on May 17, 2019, the Court decided that it was appropriate to rule on two issues of law presented by this case-the conflict between federal and state law on marijuana use and the effect of the appropriations rider on supervised release proceedings-before conducting further proceedings. The legal issues have been fully briefed by the parties and are now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before deciding whether the appropriations rider contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act prohibits DOJ from prosecuting a violation of supervised release the Court must determine whether state law-compliant use of medical marijuana violates the conditions of defendant's supervised release. Second, the Court must decide whether the rider applies to prohibit DOJ involvement in proceedings related to violations of supervised release. Finally, if the rider applies to supervised release proceedings, the Court must determine whether it is applicable to the requested violation hearing in this case.

Gov't Resp. 17. In support, the Government relies on several cases in which courts have addressed the relationship between the rider and supervised release and concluded that the rider has no impact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cal. Aug. 10, 2017) (concluding the rider did not inhibit DOJ from using funds in a violation of supervised release hearing in California). The Government argues that punishing a violation of supervised release differs significantly from engaging in a criminal prosecution-punishing a violation of supervised release is focused on \"holding the defendant accountable for failing to abide by conditions imposed by a federal court,\" not punishing the use of marijuana under federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Resp. 17. Thus, the Government maintains that any impact on Pennsylvania's ability to implement its medical marijuana program is of a \"far lesser degree.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court concludes that, under the plain language of the rider, the rider applies to violations of supervised release. The rider prohibits the use of any DOJ funding to \"prevent\" a state from \"implementing\" its law and does not specify what form this prevention must take. Under this broad language, courts have applied the rider to proceedings other than criminal prosecutions of federal marijuana offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pisarski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418857\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/274/1032/#p1040\">\n    274 F.

Cal. 2017) (applying the rider to prohibit DOJ from using funds in sentencing proceedings of defendants who pled guilty to federal marijuana offenses before the rider was enacted);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cal. 2015) (applying the rider to prohibit DOJ from enforcing a preexisting permanent injunction against a medical marijuana dispensary). The rider has also been extended to protect individuals from\n   federal prosecutions that indirectly attempt to punish them for state law-compliant actions. For example, a U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan concluded that the rider prohibits DOJ from using funds to prosecute an owner of a state law-compliant marijuana dispensary for possession of a firearm in connection with his medical marijuana business. In that case the court stated that \"[a]lthough the Government is not attempting to directly prosecute [the defendant] for his medical marijuana business,\" the prosecution \"accomplishes materially the same effect.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Samp\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-20263,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201164453\">\n    2017 WL 1164453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 29, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court follows those district courts which have concluded that the appropriations rider applies to proceedings other than federal criminal prosecutions of marijuana offenses. Revoking a defendant's supervised release for his state law-compliant medical marijuana use would \"accomplish[ ] materially the same effect\" as directly prosecuting him for his marijuana use and would prevent Pennsylvania from \"giving practical effect\" to its law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Samp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201164453\">\n    2017 WL 1164453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Furthermore, the cases concluding the rider did not apply to violations of supervised release are distinguishable from this case. For example, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Nixon\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to modify the conditions of a defendant's probation to allow him to possess and use medical marijuana, which continues to be unlawful under federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176875\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/885/#p887\">\n    839 F.3d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 887-88 (9th Cir. 2016). In so holding, the court considered only the rider's impact on the authority of a\n   <em>\n    federal court\n   </em>\n   -an entity that is not funded by DOJ and therefore not covered by the rider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176875\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/885/#p887\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176875\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/885/#p887\">\n    at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the question is how the rider impacts the use of funds by\n   <em>\n    DOJ\n   </em>\n   . Further, defendant does not ask the Court to modify the terms of his supervised release but argues only that DOJ cannot use its funds to prosecute any violation premised on his state law-compliant use of medical marijuana.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tuyakbayev\n   </em>\n   is likewise inapplicable to this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 15-cr-00086,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203434089\">\n    2017 WL 3434089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Cal. Aug. 10, 2017). That decision was based in part on the determination that DOJ involvement in a violation of supervised release hearing would not \"prevent\" California from \"implementing\" its medical marijuana law where that law specifically permits California courts \"to prohibit use of medical marijuana as a condition of post-conviction supervision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In contrast, Pennsylvania's Medical Marijuana Act contains no provision similar to the California law cited in\n   <em>\n    Tuyakbayev\n   </em>\n   . The Medical Marijuana Act carves out some exceptions, such as prohibiting the use of medical marijuana in prisons, but it contains no exception for individuals on probation or parole or under supervision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 10231.1309. Without any such provision, the Court concludes that the Act applies to those individuals just as it applies to any other person. Thus, unlike the circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Tuyakbayev\n   </em>\n   , prohibiting defendant from using medical marijuana as a condition of supervised release\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   prohibit Pennsylvania from giving \"practical effect\" to its law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the appropriations rider prohibits DOJ from using its funds to prosecute a violation of supervised release based on state law-compliant use of marijuana. In reaching this conclusion, the Court acknowledges that \"some members of Congress may have desired a more expansive construction of the rider, while others may have preferred a more limited\n   interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/\">\n    833 F.3d at 1178-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Use of DOJ Funds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant argues that DOJ involvement in a violation of supervised release hearing constitutes a use of its funds. Specifically, defendant points out that an attorney from the U.S. Attorney's Office, whose salary is paid by DOJ funding, is required to be present at the hearing to prosecute the violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot. 18. Defendant further contends that U.S. Attorney would use more funds to file documents with the Court, to print relevant documents, and to hire potential expert witnesses. Def. Reply 10. In addition, defendant maintains that DOJ also funds the U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Prisons, both of which would be involved in the hearing. Def. Mot. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Government argues that DOJ involvement would not constitute a use of its \"funds\" given that DOJ prosecutors and U.S. Marshals are paid a fixed salary which they would be paid regardless of whether they attended the hearing. Gov't Resp. 19 &amp; n.12. The Government further maintains that the DOJ role is minimal-it is only to \"advance the critical federal interest of ensuring that persons convicted under federal laws, and subject to terms of federal supervised release, comply with the terms of their release,\" which are imposed by the Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Unlike prosecuting a federal marijuana offense, prosecuting a violation of supervised release does not require DOJ to expend significant funds on, for example, investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 19-20. The Government puts a particular focus on the fact that the violation petition is brought by the U.S. Probation Office-an arm of the Court-not DOJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. The Government further argues that the need for the Bureau of Prisons to use funds in this case is \"speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 n.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court concludes that DOJ involvement in a violation of supervised release hearing-through the presence of an Assistant U.S. Attorney, the U.S. Marshals, or the Bureau of Prisons-constitutes a use of DOJ funding. Regardless of the fact that the U.S. Probation Office, an arm of the judiciary, brings the violation petition, the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecutes the violation. That U.S. Attorneys and U.S. Marshals are paid a fixed salary is immaterial; the fact that these employees would be devoting time to this case over another case is sufficient to constitute use of funds. Moreover, however minor the expense, the rider provides that \"\n   <em>\n    [n]one\n   </em>\n   of the funds\" appropriated to DOJ may be used to prevent a state from implementing its medical marijuana laws. Thus, DOJ participation in such proceedings would constitute a use of its funds under the rider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Scheduling Further Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant's motion seeks to enjoin the use of DOJ funds in these proceedings and to dismiss the violation petition. Def. Mot. 4. Having concluded that the rider is applicable in violation of supervised release hearings, the Court must now consider how this case should proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the rider to apply to the defendant in this case, defendant must\n   show that his use of medical marijuana was compliant with state law-in this case, the Medical Marijuana Act. To assist the Court in making this determination, a defendant is \"entitled to [an] evidentiary hearing[ ] to determine whether [his or her] conduct was completely authorized by state law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/\">\n    833 F.3d at 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such an evidentiary hearing should precede any hearing on the violation of supervised release. At the evidentiary hearing, defendant bears the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he \"strictly complied with all relevant conditions imposed by\" the Medical Marijuana Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These requirements include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that defendant has one of the seventeen enumerated serious medical conditions that qualify an individual for medical marijuana use, that he is \"in possession of a valid identification card issued by\" the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and that the medical marijuana was dispensed in an appropriate form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 10231.103, 10231.303. The Court further concludes that because the purpose of the evidentiary hearing is to determine whether the rider applies, the rider does not bar DOJ from participating in the evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The parties' arguments that such a hearing is unnecessary in this case are unavailing. Defendant argues that his compliance with state law is established, given that the petition states that he is in possession of a medical marijuana identification card.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot. 17-18. But this is not the only requirement imposed by the Medical Marijuana Act and, as such, it is insufficient, standing alone, to establish defendant's compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Government argues that the record already reflects defendant's non-compliance with state law, given that two of his charged positive drug tests predate the issuance of his medical marijuana identification card. Gov't Resp. 21 n.13. The Court concludes that the rider does not apply to these two drug tests. However, the Court disagrees that this eliminates the need for a hearing on defendant's eight remaining, potentially state law compliant uses of medical marijuana.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kleinman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266535\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1020/#p1028\">\n    880 F.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1028 (9th Cir. 2017) (\"The prosecution cannot use a prosecutable charge (for conduct that violates state medical marijuana law) to bootstrap other charges that rely solely upon conduct that would fully comply with state law.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With respect to defendant's eight alleged positive drug tests after the issuance of his medical marijuana identification card, the Court must determine whether defendant was compliant with state law. If so, the rider applies and prohibits the use of DOJ funds in prosecuting the violations of supervised release based on those eight drug tests. If the Court concludes that defendant's use of medical marijuana was not compliant with state law, the rider is inapplicable, and DOJ may use its funds in prosecuting the charged violations of supervised release without limitation. This Memorandum does not affect the two alleged positive marijuana drug tests obtained before defendant received a medical marijuana identification card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court concludes state law-compliant use of medical marijuana violates the conditions of defendant's supervised release. Additionally, the rider contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act prohibits DOJ from using its funds to prosecute violations of supervised release premised on a defendant's state law-compliant use of medical marijuana. An evidentiary hearing for the purpose of determining whether defendant was fully compliant with state law governing use of medical marijuana,\n   and thus whether the rider enjoins the use of DOJ funds in a violation of supervised release hearing in this case, is scheduled for June 13, 2019. An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
