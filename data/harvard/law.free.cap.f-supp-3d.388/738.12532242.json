On May 22, 2019, the court held a hearing on the motions at which all parties were represented by counsel. Having considered the motions, responses, attachments to all pleadings, the exhibits presented at the hearing, the applicable law, and the arguments of counsel, the court will grant the motion to dismiss for the reasons to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At the opening of the 86th Legislative Session, the Texas House of Representatives unanimously passed House Rule 5, which restricts the issuance of media credentials and the accompanying right to sit in the press seating area on the House floor to an employee of a news organization determined to be \"principally a general news organization\" whose \"publications ... are editorially independent of any group ... that lobbies the government or that is not principally a general news organization.\" Tex. H.R. 5, \u00a7 20, 86th Leg., R.S. (2019). On January 29, 2019, the House granted Defendant Charlie L. Geren (\"Geren\"), Chairman of the Committee on House Administration the authority to act on the Committee's behalf in matters involving the management of House facilities, coordination with House support personnel, and general enforcement of the House policies and procedures. The Committee on House Administration is tasked under the House Rules \"with jurisdiction over ... administrative operation of the house and its employees ... [and] all admissions to the floor during sessions of the house.\" Tex. H.R. 3, \u00a7 16, 86th Leg., R.S. (2019). In that capacity, the Committee receives applications from media representatives and issues pass cards to qualifying applicants for purposes of access to the press area on the floor of the House, while the House is in session.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Empower Texans, Inc. (\"Empower Texans\") publishes a variety of news products, including the Texas Scorecard, a news magazine published in print to subscribers across Texas on a bi-weekly basis during sessions of the Texas Legislature and monthly during the interims. Texas Scorecard articles are also published online on a daily basis, as a weekly email digest, and on social media through the Empower Texans Facebook page, which has over 202,700 followers. This is no small number, Empower Texans contends, because it is more followers than all but four of Texas's largest daily newspapers. Empower Texans also produces a variety of other news products, including a weekly radio program, a weekly online video broadcast, and a daily email news digest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Empower Texans characterizes its relationship with Geren as antagonistic. Occasionally, the dispute has spilled into the public eye on social media, as when Geren tweets aggressively at employees of Empower Texans. Empower Texans posits Geren's distaste stems from Empower Texans' endorsements of Geren's challengers in Republican primaries, as well as Empower Texans' grading of Geren's performance on the organization's Fiscal Responsibility Index.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 3, 2019, Plaintiffs Brandon C. Waltens and Destin R. Sensky, reporters for Empower Texans, each submitted media-credentials applications to the Texas House and Texas Senate. A media credential would allow Waltens and Sensky to access the press area on the floor of the House, near the Speaker's dais, as well as access to the area around the rail surrounding members' desks. Empower Texans' claims the press area provides a superior vantage point than that available from the public gallery. The press area also provides a superior auditory advantage: it allows reporters to listen to side conversations between members. The Senate, which has a different standard for press credentials than the House, immediately issued credentials to Waltens and Sensky. On January 4, 2019, Geren sent letters to Waltens and Sensky informing them that their applications for media credentials were denied, because Texas Scorecard is associated with an organization that advocates for matters before the Legislature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically, Geren wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   It is [sic] has come to my attention that the organization you are employed by, Texas Scorecard, has a close association with a general-purpose political committee (GPAC) and that the organization's website prominently display advocacy on policy matters before the legislature. Based on this information, I believe that you are not eligible for a media credential.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Geren explained that eligibility for a news-media credential is determined in accordance with House Rule 5. Geren remarked that, \"[a]ccording to records available on the Texas Ethics Commission website, a GPAC with the name Empower Texans PAC is located at the same address given for your employer.\" Based on this information, Geren surmised that \"Texas Scorecard is not an entity 'whose publication or operations are editorially independent of any institution, foundation, or interest group that lobbies the government or that is not principally a general news organization.' \" Geren concluded that \"it is my determination\n   that you are not eligible for a news media credential based on Rule 5.\" Geren ended the letter with the following: \"[i]f you believe this determination has been made in error, please feel free to provide me with any additional information you feel is relevant to the determination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Empower Texans claims Geren's letter-down to the typos-matches a 2017 letter denying media credentials to employees of Empower Texans. In 2017, Empower Texans was denied media credentials, in part, because the presence of a \"GPAC located at Empower Texans' address.\" Empower Texans alleges that the facts changed between 2017 and 2019. Importantly, Empower Texans claims that when Geren sent the January 2019 letter, Empower Texans PAC was registered with the Texas Ethics Commission at an address in Cove, Texas that was not associated with Empower Texans. Empower Texans surmises that Geren's use of an outdated address as the reason for denying press credentials is evidence of Geren's bad faith and proof of a pretense to cover for his viewpoint discrimination against Empower Texans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A several-month back-and-forth ensued between Empower Texans and the House Business Office. In response to a letter sent by Empower Texans, on February 26, 2019, the Business Office wrote the following information potentially indicating that Empower Texans' applications were still under review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   To process their applications, I need additional information to verify their eligibility under Rule 5 Section 20 of the Rules of the Texas House. Can you please provide me with information sufficient to verify that Empower Texans Inc. d/b/a Texas Scorecard is editorially independent of any institution, foundation, or interest group that lobbies the government or is not principally a general news organization?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Empower Texans followed up with several letters, including information on Empower Texans' status and the organization's concerns about the breadth of House Rule 5. Empower Texans also sought to clarify whether their applications for media credentials had been denied or were still being processed. Empower Texans contends that the Business Office never provided a meaningful response to its letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Empower Texans commenced this lawsuit on April 16, 2019. In an amended complaint filed May 14, 2019, Empower Texans sues Geren in his official capacity under Section 1983\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Declaratory Judgment Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2202. Empower Texans makes two claims: (1) Geren engaged in viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment when he refused to grant Empower Texans a House press credential; (2) Geren violated Empower Texans' procedural due process by not following the procedures in the House rules for issuing or denying press credentials. On May 16, 2019-with the Texas legislative session poised to end in nine days-Empower Texans moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction enjoining Geren from denying Empower Texans access to the floor of the House for the remainder of session. Empower Texans also seeks an order requiring Geren to issue House press credentials to Empower Texans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Geren responded on May 16, 2019, with a motion to dismiss Empower Texans' action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), (6). Geren argues that the doctrine of absolute legislative immunity requires immediate\n   dismissal of this action, because Geren is immune from suit for any press-credential decisions made under the House Rules. Thus, any consideration of the merits of Empower Texans' claims or the constitutionality of Geren's actions would be an impermissible encroachment on the Texas Legislature. Geren also moves to stay consideration of the emergency relief requested by Empower Texans until this court resolves Geren's claim of legislative immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because prevailing on the legislative-immunity claim would require dismissal of this action, the court first considers that claim.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reeder v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Legislative immunity protects legislatures and legislators in establishing and applying rules that they deem most conducive to conducting legislative business. House Rule 5, which regulates who may access the press area on the floor of the House and the railing around the members' desks during deliberations, necessarily affects the manner, tenor, and nature of those deliberations. House Rule 5's application, necessarily plays an integral role in ensuring that the core legislative functions-such as debating, voting, speech making, and the deliberative process itself-are not disrupted by those who have a stake in advocating for the very legislation being deliberated on the floor. Geren is entitled to absolute legislative immunity from suit, and Empower Texans' claims must be dismissed without consideration of the merits of Empower Texans' underlying claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Absolute\n   </em>\n   legislative immunity-as the name suggests and as applied by the Supreme Court-sweeps quite broadly, and it\n   can be read to protect a great deal of behavior that is \"part and parcel\" of the legislative process.\n   <em>\n    Gravel\n   </em>\n   , 408 U.S. at 626,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782860\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/606/#p625\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The broad sweep of such immunity makes it all the more important that legislatures and legislators comport themselves in a manner worthy of the trust placed in them; and whenever possible, without acting in a way that might give rise to an imprimatur of unconstitutional or vindictive conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint filed May 16, 2019 (Dkt.

For simplicity, the court will refer to the requests jointly as press credentials for Empower Texans. Additionally, because the interests of Plaintiffs do not diverge, they will be referred to collectively as \"Empower Texans,\" except as needed for clarity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Congress passed Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code in 1871, which entitles an injured person to relief if a state official violates his or her constitutional rights.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Because of the few remaining days in the Regular Session of the 86th Legislature, the court\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n    Geren's motion to stay (Dkt. No. 13) and entertains argument on both Plaintiffs' request for emergency relief and Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The standards for considering a motion to dismiss are well established and will not be repeated here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Empower Texans contends that Geren has not conclusively denied the requested press credentials. Geren's January 4, 2019 letter states \"it is my determination that you are not eligible for a news media credential based on Rule 5.\" However, the letter was written before the 86th Legislature convened. Empower Texans has unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the dispute through the House Business Office. This places at issue the question of whether there is an actual case or controversy in the absence of an unequivocal denial. The fact remains, however, that the credentials have not been issued, in spite of a timely request having been made. For purposes of this order, the court presumes without deciding that the request has been denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The issues before this court have been presented in the context of absolute legislative immunity. Broader issues are present here. Should a United States District Court interfere with the internal operating procedures of a legislature of a sovereign state, or should the court refrain from doing so under the doctrine of separation of powers or federalism as applied to the relationship between the states and the federal republic or both? The court leaves these questions unanswered.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
