(ECF No. 154.) Black asserts that the First Step Act entitles him to relief because he committed a covered offense before August 3, 2010. (Mot. 1-3.) The United States responded, recognizing that the First Step Act applies to Black but disputing the extent of relief Black seeks in the Motion (the \"Opposition\"). (Opp'n 1, ECF No. 157.) Black replied. (ECF No. 159.) The Motion is ripe for disposition. For the reasons articulated below, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     I.

(Mot. 3; PSR \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, ECF No. 158-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The presentence report prepared following these convictions attributed to Black 249.8 grams of powder cocaine for Count One and 59.5 grams of cocaine base for Count Three. (PSR \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) The presentence report then organized the three counts into two groups of \"closely related counts\" before tabulating the combined adjusted offense level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL (\"USSG\") ch.3, pt. D, introductory cmt. (U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 2004). For Counts One and Three (the first group), the presentence report determined an adjusted offense level of 32 based on the quantity of drugs involved in the offenses. (PSR Wkst A.) For Count Two (the second group), the presentence report calculated an offense level of 24, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), because Black possessed a firearm after sustaining two felony convictions for crimes of violence. (PSR Wkst A, 2.) Combining the offense levels applicable to each group resulted in a combined adjusted offense level of 33. (PSR Wkst B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The presentence report also classified Black as a career offender based on his convictions for New York robbery offenses\n   that occurred in September 1987 when he was 18 years old. The presentence report specified that Black pled guilty to three robbery offenses that occurred over a five-day period and that Black began serving his sentence for each of those offenses on April 11, 1989. (PSR \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 35, Wkst C, D.) These predicate robbery offenses occurred without an intervening arrest.

Count One, however, carried a statutory maximum sentence of 240 months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although Black objected to his status as a career offender and argued that his criminal history score substantially overrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history, the Court overruled his objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PSR B-1-B-2; Sent Tr. 8-9, ECF No. 159-1.) After adopting the Guidelines as presented in the presentence report, the Court imposed a sentence of 360 months for Counts Two and Three, at the low end of the Guidelines range, and the statutory maximum sentence of 240 months for Count One. (Sent. Tr. 14.) The Court ordered these terms of imprisonment to run concurrently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court also imposed a three-year supervised-release term for Counts One and Two and a five-year supervised-release term for Count Three, running concurrently.

Because Black's offense falls within section 2 of Fair Sentencing Act, the First Step Act \"reduce[s] the statutory penalties for cocaine base offenses\" and modifies the penalties applicable to Black.\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172646\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/572/#p575\">\n    843 F.3d at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Recalculating the Guidelines Range After Applying the First Step Act\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Changing the Penalty for Count Three Affects Sentence Grouping\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Pursuant to the First Step Act, Count Three no longer carries a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence and a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the First Step Act decreased the applicable penalty for Count Three to a five-year mandatory minimum and a statutory maximum of forty years in prison. Because the statutory maximum has now decreased from life to forty years, USSG \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(B) provides the total offense level of 34 for Count Three. With a criminal history category VI, assuming Black remains a career offender, his Guidelines range for Count Three becomes 262 months to 327 months. The United States agrees with this computation for Count Three. (Opp'n 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Critically, however, the presentence report grouped Black's Guidelines for Counts One, Two, and Three in accordance with the grouping rules provided in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual Chapter Three, Part D. (PSR Wkst B.) The United States did not discuss sentence grouping in its Opposition but recognized that the First Step Act changed Black's statutory penalty and Guidelines range for Count Three. (Opp'n 12.) Utilizing the applicable sentence grouping Guidelines, reducing the offense level for Count Three pursuant to the First Step Act similarly reduces Black's Guidelines range for Count Two to 262 months to 327 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   USSG Sentencing Table (2004). But, due to the unique circumstances of this case, the Guidelines analysis does not end there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Career Offender Sentencing Enhancement Does Not Apply\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court must consider another imperative issue: whether it should address the prior error in labeling Black a career offender. When the Court initially sentenced Black, the Guidelines explained that predicate offenses such as his New York robberies should be considered one offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel for Black made the appropriate objection prior to sentencing, but the Court overruled it. (Sentencing Tr. 8-9.) That error effectively doubled Black's applicable Guidelines range, increasing it from 188 months to 235 months to 360 months to life. (ECF No. 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While recognizing the error, the United States contends that Section 3582 proceedings are limited in scope and \"[t]his [C]ourt has no occasion to address the issue of whether the court erroneously categorized [Black] as a career offender in his original sentencing, and [Black] has had the opportunity on appeal and two motions under \u00a7 2255 to address that issue.\" (Opp'n 12-13.) Black counters this argument by noting that the First Step Act allows the Court to sentence him \"as if the Fair Sentencing Act had been in place at the time of his original sentencing\" and places no other limit on what the Court may consider. (Reply 5, ECF No. 159.) Black further argues that the First Step Act directs the Court to conduct a \"complete review on the merits\" and that doing so would allow the Court to consider its prior sentencing error by recalculating the Guidelines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   7 (quoting First Step Act, \u00a7 40; Pub. L. No. 115-391,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%205194\">\n    132 Stat. 5194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5222).) Black adds that if he came before the Court today and the Court recognized per the Guidelines that he does not qualify as a career offender, he would face a Guidelines range of only 188 to 235 months, dramatically lower than the 360 months to life range he faced fifteen years ago (and significantly lower than the 262 months to 327 months range with the career offender enhancement). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court simply cannot ignore an error of this magnitude, particularly where Black objected to the career offender enhancement before sentencing and raised on appeal a related challenge to his career offender status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Allowing the procedural posture of the case to overrun an individual's liberty undermines the integrity of the Court system and the value society places on judges to get things right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court sees no reason to overlook this error and fundamental miscarriage of justice particularly where, as here, the First Step Act allows the Court to recalculate Black's Guidelines range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the First Step\n   Act affords the Court the opportunity to review the Motion on its merits and to determine the applicable Guidelines range after Congress modified the penalties for certain drug offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To calculate the applicable Guidelines range, the Court must first determine the offense level and criminal history pursuant to USSG \u00a7 1B1.1(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

USSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table).

The United States agrees that the Court should reduce his sentence for Count Three but asserts that the applicable Guidelines range, with the career offender enhancement, amounts to 262 to 327 months. (Opp'n 12.) The Court finds appropriate reducing Black's sentence to 210 months for each count, to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In enacting the First Step Act, Congress determined that our criminal justice system disparately over sentenced drug offenders like Black. Black lawfully seeks relief based on the modified penalties for crack cocaine offenses that the First Step Act created. While the Court previously sentenced Black at the low end of his applicable Guidelines range, the presentence report erroneously calculated that range using a misapplied career offender sentence enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Looking to the corrected Guidelines range of 188 months to 235 months, the Court must determine the appropriate reduction that the First Step Act affords to Black.

Considering the factors and policy statements together with the arguments in the Motion and responses thereto, imposing a sentence of 210 months imprisonment, at the middle of the applicable Guidelines range after applying the First Step Act, adequately deters criminal conduct, reflects the seriousness of Black's offenses, promotes respect for the law, and complies with the relevant USSG provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court also finds that reducing Black's sentence to 210 months does not threaten public safety. Black has accumulated only three infractions in his fifteen years in prison, all of which were non-violent incidents. (Reply 9.) The United States and the Bureau of Prisons recognize that he completed dozens of programs while incarcerated and acknowledge him as a good worker. (Opp'n 2.) While Black has been the subject of investigations concerning very serious behavioral allegations in prison, (Opp'n 2), those allegations do not warrant subjecting Black to a period of incarceration that Congress, through the First Step Act, has deemed excessive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And to balance any such concerns, the Court denies Black's Motion to the extent that he seeks a reduced supervised-release term.

The Court GRANTS the Motion in part, (ECF No. 154), and REDUCES Black's sentence on each count to 210 months, running concurrently. The Court DENIES the Motion as to Black's terms of supervised release.
