SETTLE, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on Defendants Franciscan Health System, Franciscan Medical Group (collectively \"Franciscan\"), WestSound Orthopaedics, P.S. (\"WSO\"), and The Doctors Clinic's (\"TDC\") motion for partial summary judgment. Dkt. 180. The Court has considered the pleadings filed in support of and in opposition to the motion and the remainder of the file and hereby grants the motion as to Count 2, violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and denies the motion as to Count 1, the rule of decision for violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, for the reasons stated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In July 2016, Franciscan acquired WSO and became the employer of its seven orthopedic physicians (\"the WSO Acquisition\"). In early September 2016, Franciscan and TDC, a multispecialty group with fifty-four physicians including five orthopedists,\n   entered into a series of agreements (\"the TDC Affiliation\"). In Count 1, the State claims that Franciscan and TDC are separate economic entities that entered into an agreement to jointly negotiate the prices for the services they provide to the public. The State asserts that these agreements constitute a horizontal price-fixing agreement that is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   illegal or otherwise constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In Count 2, the State claims that the effect of Franciscan's acquisition of WSO may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State argues that the effects of the subsequent TDC Affiliation should be incorporated into analysis of the effect on competition of the prior WSO Acquisition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, the Court will consider Franciscan and WSO's motion for summary judgment on Count 2, which alleges the WSO Acquisition violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Second, the Court will consider Franciscan and TDC's motion for summary judgment on the State's allegation that the TDC Affiliation constitutes a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Summary judgment is proper only if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law when the nonmoving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of a claim in the case on which the nonmoving party has the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

The Court must resolve any factual issues of controversy in favor of the nonmoving party only when the facts specifically attested by that party contradict facts specifically attested by the moving party. The nonmoving party may not merely state that it will discredit the moving party's evidence at trial, in the hopes that evidence can be developed at trial to support the claim.\n   <em>\n    T.W.

Here, where the State alleges that only the WSO Acquisition violates Section 7,\n   <em>\n    Hospital Corporation\n   </em>\n   is not persuasive authority for the proposition that the Court may rely only on market share or market concentration data which incorporates the later TDC Affiliation, which is not an alleged merger in violation of Section 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court recognizes that post-merger information may be relevant in analyzing the competitive effects of a challenged merger, including the likelihood that the challenged merger will facilitate later cartel pricing. However, the State argues only that its expert correctly analyzed the transactions jointly-it does not argue that it can prove its claim without this evidence. While the State argues the Court should not ignore Franciscan's intent to impact competition through the WSO Acquisition, Dkt. 211 at 21, and the Court agrees such information could \"be highly informative in evaluating the likely effects of a merger,\" Merger Guidelines \u00a7 2.2.1, the State does not specify what admissible evidence it would rely on to prove such intent. A question of material fact to avoid summary judgment must be established by specific admissible evidence. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). Where there is no factual showing set out in opposition to a motion for summary judgment, the District Court is not required to search the record\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   for some genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carmen v.

Moreover, Franciscan anticipated the WSO Acquisition would allow it to increase revenue by using WSO physicians to drive procedures to its hospital instead of ambulatory surgery centers (\"ASC\"), Dkt. 211 at 5 (citing Exs. 25, 27, 28); Franciscan anticipated it would have 80% of the Kitsap County orthopedics market after both transactions, Dkt. 211 at 6 (citing Ex. 30); and Franciscan analyzed, discussed, and negotiated the transactions together, Dkt. 211 at 6-8 (citing Exs. 34-47). These facts could support a narrative that WSO, a lower-priced competitor, merged with Franciscan, a primary competitor with higher prices, as part of a trend of Franciscan acquiring physician groups in the area with the intent to reduce availability of lower-priced ASC surgeries and capture the revenue from siting those surgeries in its hospitals, therefore harming competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court is unable to find the State has made a prima facie showing of the likely\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   harm to competition that Section 7 of the Clayton Act requires without some additional factual information or expert analysis regarding the magnitude of these impacts. It is not the Court's task \"to scour the record in search of a genuine issue of triable fact.
