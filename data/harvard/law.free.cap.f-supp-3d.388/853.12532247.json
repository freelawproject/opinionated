Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n   Elvis Matson sued his former employer, Sanderson Farms, Inc., asserting violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title VII, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Matson alleges that Sanderson Farms discouraged him from taking medical leave; interfered with his leave; and then fired him because he is African-American, had \"mental issues,\" took FMLA leave, complained about discrimination, and filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sanderson Farms moved for summary judgment, arguing that it granted Matson's medical leave and that it had a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for firing Matson. Matson responded that Sanderson Farms's reason was a pretext for discrimination and for retaliation for taking medical leave and for filing an EEOC charge. Sanderson Farms replied, and Matson surreplied. (Docket Entry Nos. 1, 18, 22, 26, 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After a careful review of the complaint; the record evidence; the motion, response, reply, and surreply; and the applicable law, the court finds that Matson has not identified or submitted evidence supporting a reasonable inference that Sanderson Farms either interfered with his FMLA leave, or discriminated or retaliated against him for taking the leave and filing an EEOC charge. Because there are no factual disputes material to deciding these issues, summary judgment is granted for Sanderson Farms, and final judgment is separately entered. The reasons are explained in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This would have been an easy case but for some complicating facts. Sanderson Farms granted FMLA leave to Matson for residential mental-health treatment. Unbeknownst to Matson, Sanderson Farms, or the treatment facility, the treating \"doctor\" was no doctor at all. He was, instead, a nurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner wrote Matson a return-to-work letter with facially apparent authenticity problems and sent the letter to Matson through his personal email. Matson forwarded the email and letter to Sanderson Farms. Sanderson Farms contacted the treatment center to authenticate the letter, and the treatment center assured Sanderson Farms that the letter had not been written by one of its physicians. This assurance led Sanderson Farms to fire Matson for falsifying a physician's statement, as its work rules require. But Sanderson Farms was ready, and tried, to reinstate Matson promptly after learning that the \"psychiatrist\"-the nurse practitioner posing as a doctor-had, in fact, written the return-to-work letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Matson, however, did not return to work when offered reinstatement, choosing instead to continue to work at his brother's trucking company and search for positions at other companies. There are no allegations that any medical condition prevented Matson from returning to Sanderson Farms on the dates it specified, to complete the reinstatement process. Because Sanderson Farms had a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason to fire Matson when he declined to return to work for reasons unrelated to health, summary judgment is granted to Sanderson Farms.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-13\">\n    At bottom, the case involves an employer that met its statutory obligations and an employee who did not meet his employment\n    obligations. The employer is entitled to summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    <strong>\n     A. The Summary Judgment Record\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    The facts are shown by the parties' summary judgment evidence. The summary judgment evidence includes the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n    \u2022 transcripts from the depositions of Matson, Amberly Sherwood, Brenda Gatlin, and Casey Laub;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n    \u2022 declarations from Matson, Judy Matson, Amberly Sherwood, Casey Laub, and Jennifer Buster;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n    \u2022 Sanderson Farms's job description for the master skilled mechanic position; and its substance abuse policy, work rules, and other employment documents;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    \u2022 commercial driver licenses held by Sanderson Farms employees besides Matson;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    \u2022 Matson's psychiatric evaluation from a behavioral-health center;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    \u2022 the certification forms for Matson's FMLA leave;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    \u2022 documents showing that Sanderson Farms granted Matson's FMLA leave;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n    \u2022 return-to-work letters sent to Sanderson Farms from Matson's treatment center;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    \u2022 email correspondence between Sanderson Farms, Matson's treatment center, and Matson;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    \u2022 a transcript from a recording of the meeting in which Matson was fired;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    \u2022 the Sanderson Farms termination and reinstatement paperwork for Matson;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    \u2022 the findings and conclusion from the Arizona State Board of Nursing's investigation into the nurse practitioner who held himself out as a doctor; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    \u2022 Matson's EEOC discrimination charge and related documents.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Docket Entry Nos. 18-1, 23, 26-1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <strong>\n     B. What the Record Evidence Shows\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Sanderson Farms is a Mississippi company that processes chicken products in facilities across the country, including in Bryan, Texas. (Docket Entry No. 1 at 1-2). In September 2009, Sanderson Farms hired Matson as a master mechanic. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 5-7, 54-55). His job was to maintain and repair the commercial trucks and trailers, perform road tests, train other mechanics, and keep inventory at the Bryan Facility. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The master-mechanic position required the \"[a]bility to obtain a class A [commercial driver's license] within [a] specific time limit.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 56). Matson drove commercial trucks \"every day\" and maintained his commercial driver's license. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    When Matson was hired, Sanderson Farms gave him the \"Work Rules for Hourly Employees.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 62, 76). Under these Rules, falsifying a \"doctor's statement\" was \"cause for discharge without warning.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 66). The Sanderson Farms Department of Transportation Drug and Alcohol Policy permitted an employee to return to work after self-identifying a drug or alcohol problem, but the employee had to meet with a mental-health professional and pass an unannounced drug and alcohol test before returning to work. (\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     at 170-200\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; Docket Entry No. 23 at 111-12). An employee's \"failure to appear for any test within a reasonable time\" counted as a refusal to take the test, and the employee would be fired. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 172-78).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Matson has a history of psychiatric problems, including hallucinations and thoughts of self-harm. (Docket Entry No. 23 at 7-8). Early in January 2016, Matson was diagnosed with Hepatitis C and gout and prescribed Interferon for 12 weeks. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8-9, 81). The gout caused inflammation\n    in his foot, and the Interferon made Matson's psychiatric problems worse. He had \"meltdowns\" at Sanderson Farms.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9, 81). Matson asked Sanderson Farms if he could \"work [his] 40 [hours] in four days\" instead of five, explaining his \"medical condition\" and \"what was going on in [his] mind.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 20). Sanderson Farms approved Matson to work 4-day weeks, which Matson described as a \"special accommodation[ ]\" allowing him to \"stay on the job.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 20).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    On May 25, 2016, Matson was admitted to the Rock Prairie Behavioral Health Center for residential treatment for \"depression, anxiety, and agitation.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 97). His initial psychiatric evaluation described \"an obese male, in severe distress,\" with bipolar disorder, alcohol dependence, and nicotine dependence. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 97-98). Matson told Rock Prairie that he had been \"drinking about a half a pint or a fifth [of liquor] on a daily basis now,\" and had smoked \"four packs [of cigarettes] in the last 24 hours.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 97). The evaluation, signed by Dr. Fernando G. Torres, stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    The patient will stabilize with the care plan involv[ing] medication management, group, individual therapy, family therapy. Estimated length of stay will be a week. Initially, the patient is going to be prescribed medications [that have] some sedative properties, but as he recovers then [Dr. Torres] will lessen the medications so they will not adversely affect his commercial driver's license operations.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 98). Matson testified that he submitted a FMLA request for his stay at Rock Prairie in early June 2016, but the record does not contain that request or its result, and it is unclear when Matson left Rock Prairie. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 10-11).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    In July 2016, Judy Matson, Matson's wife, became convinced that he needed \"professional psychiatric treatment\" because his \"depression, mood swings[,] and insomnia continued\" after the Interferon treatment ended. (Docket Entry No. 23 at 100). Judy Matson arranged in-patient treatment for Matson from \"Doctor\" Rodney Dy Wolpert at the Red Rock Addiction and Treatment Company outside Phoenix, Arizona. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    On July 20, the Matsons both went to Sanderson Farms to meet with Amberly Sherwood, the Field Employee Relations Manager at the Bryan Facility, about Matson's \"health and his need to take time off to get treatment.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). According to Matson, he told Sherwood that he needed \"FMLA [leave] for a mental issue.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9). He got the FMLA leave\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Matson arrived in Arizona on July 23, 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 10-11, 13-15, 23). He went to a hospital for two weeks for examinations and \"psychiatric interviews\" to determine which in-patient residential treatment center best suited his medical needs. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 10-11, 13-15). After his hospital stay, Matson was admitted to Red Rock Addiction and Treatment Company for treatment. He saw Dy Wolpert, the faux doctor, each day for an hour of therapy. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 14-16; Docket Entry No. 23 at 12). Dy Wolpert told Matson that he was \"schizophrenic\" and that his condition was \"life threatening.\" (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 19). Matson left Red Rock on August 26, 2016, after about 30 days. (Docket Entry No. 23 at 13).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Unknown to the Matsons and to Red Rock, Dy Wolpert was neither a psychologist nor any kind of medical doctor. (Docket Entry No. 26-1 at 4-5). He was a licensed nurse practitioner who worked at Red Rock from June to September 2016 and held himself out as a psychiatrist. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-6, 11). Red Rock fired Dy Wolpert on September 28, 2016, after \"numerous issues with his employment.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 17). The Arizona State Board of Nursing later investigated Dy Wolpert, finding a long and deeply troubling history of serious misconduct and misrepresentations to patients. (\n    <em>\n     See generally\n     <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ). Dy Wolpert voluntarily surrendered his Arizona nursing license in September 2017, after the investigation concluded that he had violated many Arizona laws. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 20-24).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Shortly after arriving at Red Rock, Matson asked Sanderson Farms for FMLA leave. On July 28, 2016, Red Rock sent Sanderson Farms a completed \"Certification of Health Care Provider for Hourly Employee's Serious Health Condition.\" (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 127-30). This initial certification form listed Matson's job title as \"MAINT. 1\" and his medical provider as \"Dr. Dy Wolpert,\" described as a \"psychiatrist.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The contact number for Dy Wolpert was, confusingly, Sanderson Farms's number. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The initial certification form stated that Matson was \"hospitalized due to life threatening conditions\" and could not work. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). According to the initial certification form, Dy Wolpert treated Matson between July 20 and 25, 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    On the morning of August 4, 2016, Jeffrey Baker, a Red Rock case manager, sent Sanderson Farms another certification form, this time using the Sanderson Farms preprinted FMLA form. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 78, 84-85, 121). The second certification form had Sanderson Farm's name and contact preprinted and listed Matson's title as \"Master Skill M1,\" describing his job functions. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 78). But like the initial certification form, this second certification form stated that: \"Dr. Dy Wolpert\" was Matson's medical provider; Sanderson Farms's phone number was the contact number for Dy Wolpert; Matson was \"hospitalized due to life threatening conditions\" that would last about \"3 months\"; Matson could not work during those 3 months; and Dy Wolpert treated Matson between July 20 and 25, 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13, 78-80).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    After Sanderson Farms received the second certification form, Amberly Sherwood asked Brenda Gatlin, the Sanderson Farms Senior Employee Relations Manager, if she could have Casey Laub, the Bryan Facility's Occupational Health Nurse, seek clarification from Red Rock on the form, including on the \"life threatening conditions\" that the form referred to. (Docket Entry No. 23 at 51). Gatlin replied, \"Yes[,] we need to clarify what exactly is his condition[, h]ave the nurse call.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 115).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Amberly Sherwood told Laub \"to obtain additional information so that [Sanderson Farms] could certify ... Matson's request.\" (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 140). Laub did not contact Dy Wolpert because the number for him on the second certification form was Sanderson Farms's number. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 140-41). In an email to Sherwood and Gatlin, Laub voiced her concerns:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    Something is not right with this situation. The physician's name listed on these FMLA papers is a psychiatrist who lists an office in Florida on the internet. The phone number on the FMLA papers is the phone and fax for our hatchery. When I call the phone number listed for that name on the physician's self-help web page, I get a cell phone that the person who answered\n    stated [he] was a government IT help cell phone. Per the website, [Red Rock] is an alcohol and substance abuse treatment center in Arizona.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    (Docket Entry No. 23 at 169).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Laub, the Occupational Health Nurse, called and emailed Red Rock, asking to speak with Dy Wolpert to clarify why Matson \"needs to be off of work\" and to obtain Wolpert's \"contact information.\" (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 83). Baker, the Red Rock case manager, responded that he understood why Laub \"might be confused.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Baker provided the following information:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    [Matson] is currently in a[n] inpatient program for substance abuse treatment. His listed diagnosis on his EMR is F19.2 Substance Use Disorder, moderate[,] and F10.2 Alcohol Use Disorder, severe. His first interaction was at our detox center and is now at the above listed treatment center. He is currently scheduled to be with us for 30 treatment days.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). On August 5, 2016, based on the information Baker sent, Sanderson Farms approved Matson's FMLA leave from July 20, 2016 to October 20, 2016, as the second certification form requested. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 137-38).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    On August 30, 2016, Sanderson Farms received two return-to-work letters for Matson. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 87-89). The first letter was on Red Rock letterhead and signed by Jeffrey Baker and Erika Heckman, the Red Rock Program Director. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 89). It stated that \"Elvis Matson successfully completed our Residential Substance Abuse Treatment program and Partial Hospitalization Program with Sober Living Housing on August 26th, 2016.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). According to the letter, \"[t]he doctor, Dr. Dy Wolpert[,] cleared [Matson] to return to work as of 8/27/16,\" because his treatment had been \"successful\" and \"he does not pose a risk to himself or anyone else.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    A second letter, also dated August 30 but signed by Dy Wolpert, stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    Elvis Matson has been under my care from 7/27/2016 to 10/20/2016 and would be able to go back to work on 10/21/2016. He is able to perform all duties. If there's questions regarding this matter please don't hesitate to call me at (602)300-8135. Thank You!\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 87). This second letter was not on Red Rock letterhead. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). It is unclear whether Sanderson Farms received this letter.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    On September 7, 2016, Matson emailed Sanderson Farms a third return-to-work letter, over his personal email. Matson told Sanderson Farms that this third letter came \"from [his] doctor to return to work on September 21, 2016.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 93). The third letter stated that \"[Matson] is released to Return To Work on 9/21/2016,\" without any restrictions. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 91). That letter showed that it came \"from the desk of Dr Dy Wolpert\" on \"1234 Main Street Anytown, State Zip (123) 456-7890.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Dy Wolpert's name was signed on the third letter, but the signature did not match his earlier ones. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The signature block listed Dy Wolpert's address as \"323 W. Roosevelt St., Suite 100,\" in Phoenix, Arizona, and provided a phone number. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Casey Laub emailed Baker about the third letter, asking him to \"confirm its accuracy\" because she was \"confused as to what has changed since we received the full release from\" Red Rock on August 30. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 93). Baker responded by email:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    Casey I can assure you that this document did not come from our doctor. If you look at the bottom of the document it states 1234 Main Street, Any Town, State ZIP (123) 456-7890[.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    This is obviously not a document from our doctor and if you look at the signatures you [c]an see that it does not match the document that I sent you and it is not on our letter head. I have no idea what is going on.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    On September 9, 2016, Sanderson Farms fired Matson for falsifying a doctor's statement, based on Red Rock's assurance that the third letter was not from their doctor's office. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 96-97). Amberly Sherwood told Matson that he was fired, and explained why, in a meeting that day. (Docket Entry No. 23 at 89-95). Matson responded, \"I wonder what's wrong with Dr. Wolpert? That's what he sent me.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 91). When Matson asked how he could \"authenticate th[e] note,\" Sherwood responded that \"[t]here is nothing that you can do at this point to authenticate it because we've already done that and [Red Rock] told us it is not authentic.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 93). That evening, Jeffrey Baker emailed Casey Laub, copying Erika Heckman, stating that the third letter \"may\" have come \"from Dr. Wolpert\" and that Red Rock was investigating. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 99).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    On September 12, three days after Matson's firing, Erika Heckman, the Red Rock Program Director, emailed Amberly Sherwood, the Field Employee Relations Manager at the Sanderson Farms Bryan Facility, stating:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    Please contact me at your earliest convenience. I have information that you were misinformed about a letter that [Matson] submitted to the HR department and as a result of the misinformation, [Matson] was terminated. I wish to set the record straight as well as to provide any necessary documentation to correct the original misinformation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    (Docket Entry No. 23 at 70).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Amberly Sherwood and Casey Laub passed this information on to Jennifer Buster, the Sanderson Farms Manager of Corporate Human Resources. She reviewed the return-to-work letters, tried to reach Wolpert, and talked to with Erika Heckman. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 146-47). Buster kept notes from her conversation with Heckman. The notes stated that Jeffrey Baker had been fired, Dy Wolpert wrote the third letter, and the third letter should have been sent through Red Rock, but was not. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 150).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    On September 30, 2016, after investigating, Buster concluded that \"Matson should be reinstated\" and instructed Amberly Sherwood and Casey Laub \"to contact Matson and begin the reinstatement process.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 147;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Docket Entry No. 23 at 74). That same day, Casey Laub sent Matson an email, stating:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    Elvis: I tried to call you this morning but was unable to reach you at the number I have on file .... I need for you to come in today and sign 2 forms for me. One is a return to work agreement and the other is a consent form. I will then set you up to go and see the company's substance abuse professional for recommendations regarding returning to work.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 103). On October 3, 2016, having not heard from Matson, Amberly Sherwood emailed Matson that she \"need[ed him] to contact [her] regarding the paperwork needed to reinstate you.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 105).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    On October 4, 2016, the EEOC sent Sanderson Farms notice that Matson was filing an employment-discrimination charge, alleging that Sanderson Farms had discriminated against Matson based on race and disability, and had retaliated against him. (Docket Entry No. 23 at 198).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Casey Laub and Amberly Sherwood talked to Matson by phone on October 6,\n    2016. They told Matson that he needed to report to work on October 7 or 10 to complete the steps required for reinstatement. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 109, 123-24, 142). Sanderson Farms reinstated Matson's employment on October 6, subject to Matson reporting on October 7 or 10. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 101).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Matson sent Amberly Sherwood an email on October 6, stating:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    Pursuant to our conversation this morning regarding my wrongful termination, may I reiterate that due to undue hardships, caring for my spouse, other personal obligations, and previously scheduled medical appointments that we already have for this month, I am not available to travel to the office to complete the required paperwork for my reinstatement. However, I do wish to cooperate so that the reinstatement paperwork can be executed in a timely manner. Therefore, I would appreciate it if you would e-mail or mail me the required paperwork and I will sign and return them to you promptly via e-mail and the hard copy will be mailed to you by U.S. Certified Mail. Thereafter, I will meet with you on October 31, 2016[,] to proceed through the reinstatement process.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 107).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Matson did not go to Sanderson Farms on October 7 or 10 to see the mental-health professional or to complete the return-to-work agreement and consent forms, as Sanderson Farms requested. Brenda Gatlin tried to call Matson on October 10, but he did not answer. (Docket Entry No. 23 at 67). Matson instead emailed Gatlin on the afternoon of October 10, asking that Sanderson Farms email him the paperwork and allow him to come in on October 31. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 109). Matson stated that he preferred \"not to communicate with Amberly [Sherwood] because [he is] in this predicament as a result of her discriminatory and retaliatory actions against [him] when she wrongfully terminated [him].\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). In his deposition testimony, Matson explained that he had other employment commitments until October 31. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 40).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    On October 11, Brenda Gatlin emailed Matson to say that she had called him again the day before and left a voice message \"asking that [he] give Amberly a call,\" but no one had heard from him. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 109). The email stated that because Matson had failed to \"comply with [Sanderson Farms's] request to report,\" it \"ha[d] no alternative but to terminate [his] employment ... effective today, October 11, 2016.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Sanderson Farms fired Matson on October 11, 2016. The stated reason was that he had failed \"to return from leave\" on the specified dates, October 7 or October 10. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 112).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    On October 11, Matson filed his EEOC charge, alleging race and disability discrimination and retaliation. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 114). The charge alleged that in June 2016, Amberly Sherwood began to discriminate by rejecting Matson's \"Dr. releases to return to work\"; requiring FMLA leave forms to be on Sanderson Farms preprinted forms; requesting information protected \"under HIP[A]A laws\"; continuously contacting Red Rock and Matson's wife; accusing him of falsifying a doctor's statement; and firing him. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The charge alleged that Matson informed Sanderson Farms of his \"discriminatory termination,\" but received no response. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 115). According to the charge, Matson's \"coworkers requesting time off due to a disability received their leave with no problems; the only difference is that [he] was the only Black mechanic in the department.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The parties have not submitted a right-to-sue letter, and the outcome of Matson's EEOC charge is unclear. Presumably Matson did not receive the agency relief he sought, because he sued in federal court in July 2018, asserting FMLA violations, disability and race discrimination, and retaliation. (Docket Entry No. 1 at 6-10). Matson's complaint alleges that, during his approved FMLA leave, Amberly Sherwood and Casey Laub \"continuously called and emailed ... Red Rock requesting information about [Matson's] medical condition and status.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2). Even after Matson provided a letter from Dy Wolpert stating that he could return to work on October 21, 2016, the complaint alleges, Sanderson Farms \"continued to call [Matson] and his wife to ask when he would be returning to work.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3). Because of this \"pressure to return to work,\" Matson asked to \"return to work sooner than October 21,\" and Dy Wolpert gave him a letter releasing him for work on September 21, 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    According to the complaint, when Matson forwarded the letter to Sanderson Farms, it fired him on September 9 for falsifying a doctor's statement, without \"calling the number provided by [Dy Wolpert] in the letter,\" despite Matson's requests. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3-4). The complaint alleges that, after Matson was fired, Red Rock representatives contacted Sanderson Farms to explain that the letter from Dy Wolpert \"was not fraudulent,\" but Sanderson Farms did not respond. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4). The complaint alleges that Sanderson Farms representatives spoke with Red Rock representatives on September 26, 2016, and then tried to reinstate Matson. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5). On October 6, the complaint alleges, Sanderson Farms asked Matson to return to work on October 7 or 10, but Matson responded that he could not report until October 31 \"because of other employment commitments.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). There is no allegation that on October 7 or 10, Matson had any health reason preventing him from returning to work at Sanderson Farms. Sanderson Farms terminated Matson's employment again on October 11 after he did not report on October 7 or 10. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Sanderson Farms answered and, after discovery, moved for summary judgment. (Docket Entry Nos. 5, 18). Sanderson Farms argues that Matson's FMLA claims fail because Sanderson Farms granted Matson the leave he sought; there was no causal link between Matson's request for leave and his firing; and Red Rock's assurance that the September 7 return-to-work letter was not from Dy Wolpert created a legitimate and nondiscriminatory basis to fire Matson. (Docket Entry No. 18 at 21-25). As for discrimination and retaliation, Sanderson Farms contends that he has not exhausted any claims related to the October 11 firing; and the race and disability discrimination claims fail because the undisputed record evidence shows that he was not qualified to work as a master mechanic, he was not terminated because of mental-health issues, Sanderson Farms did not treat him less favorably than non-African-American employees, and Sanderson Farms had a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for firing him. (Docket Entry No. 18 at 25-34).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Matson responds that Sanderson Farms discouraged him from taking and remaining on FMLA leave by requiring Red Rock to use Sanderson Farms's preprinted FMLA form, requesting information about Matson's diagnosis, pressuring him to come back to work before his leave ended, asking Jeffrey Baker to authenticate Dy Wolpert's third return-to-work letter without Matson's permission, and twice terminating Matson. (Docket Entry No. 22 at 14-21). Matson argues that he administratively exhausted his claims arising from the October 11 filing because they reasonably grew out of his EEOC charge allegations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21-22, 26-27). Matson contends that he made a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    showing of disability and race discrimination because he was qualified to work as a master mechanic; Sanderson Farms fired him because of his \"mental health issues,\" not schizophrenia, and the record supports a reasonable inference that Sanderson Farms knew of those medical issues; Sanderson Farms used Dy Wolpert's third return-to-work letter as a pretext to fire him; and he \"was the only black employee in the shop\" and no non-African American employee was \"terminated for the same reasons [Sanderson Farms] claims it terminated Matson.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22-28).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Sanderson Farms replied, submitting documents that included the Arizona State Board of Nursing investigation of Dy Wolpert. (Docket Entry Nos. 26-26-1). Sanderson Farms argues that Matson has raised FMLA violations in the response that he did not allege in the complaint; the law permits Sanderson Farms to ask for FMLA certifications on preprinted forms and to contact medical providers to \"clarify and authenticate\" certification forms and return-to-work letters; and Sanderson Farms did not have to hold Matson's position open after Red Rock released him for work on August 26 in the first return-to-work letter. (Docket Entry No. 26 at 7-12). Sanderson Farms reiterated that it had legitimate and nondiscriminatory reasons for firing Matson on September 9 and October 11. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12-17). Matson surreplied with a timeline of relevant events in August and September 2016, arguing that he was ready to return to work on September 21, 2016, as permitted by Dy Wolpert's September 7 return-to-work letter.

The first concerns Sanderson Farms's alleged violation of FMLA and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act procedures, and interference with Matson's FMLA leave, by communicating with Red Rock about Matson's FMLA certification forms and pressuring Matson to return to work. The second involves Sanderson Farms's alleged discriminatory and retaliatory motives for firing Matson on September 9 and October 11.

Accepting as true Matson's deposition testimony that Amberly Sherwood was \"nasty\" over the phone and made repeated \"disruptive\" calls to him about FMLA issues, unpleasantness or repeated contact, standing alone, does not support a reasonable inference that Sanderson Farms's reasons for the challenged actions were a pretext for discouraging Matson from exercising his FMLA rights. That is particularly true when, as here, the employee's FMLA request was granted and he had successfully completed his treatment program for the medical condition. (Docket Entry No. 23 at 13-14).

On the EEOC charge, Matson checked the boxes for race and disability discrimination and retaliation. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 114). The EEOC charge alleged that Amberly Sherwood began \"discriminating, and rejecting all [Matson's] Dr. releases to return to work\" in June 2016, and that Matson went on medical leave on July 23, 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). It alleged that Amberly Sherwood and Casey Laub \"continuously\" called and emailed Red Rock for \"information [that Red Rock] could not give under HIP[AA] laws.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). On September 9, 2016, the EEOC charge alleged, Amberly Sherwood \"accused [Matson] of falsifying [his] Dr. release\" and fired him. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The EEOC charge asserted that Sanderson Farms fired Matson on September 9 \"because of [his] race (Black), disability, and [he was] subjected to retaliation.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 115). Matson signed, dated, and submitted the EEOC charge on October 11, 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    While the EEOC charge does not mention the October 11 firing, which happened on the day Matson filed the charge, these allegations are \"like\" and \"related to\" the allegations in the charge and emerged on the date the charge was filed.\n    <em>\n     Davenport\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517065\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/162/#p167\">\n     891 F.3d at 167\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . A reasonable investigation would include why Sanderson Farms tried to reinstate Matson after the September 9 firing, the reasons this reinstatement effort failed, and whether Sanderson Farms had a discriminatory or retaliatory motive for the first or second firing.

The Reasons for Firing Matson\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Matson alleges that Sanderson Farms discriminated against him based on his race and mental-health issues, interfered with his FMLA leave by firing and failing to reinstate him, and retaliated for the leave he took, for complaining about discrimination, and for filing an EEOC charge. (Docket Entry No. 1 at 6-10; Docket Entry No. 22 at 14-28). Even assuming that Matson has made a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    showing for each of these claims, Sanderson Farms contends, Red Rock's assurance that Dy Wolpert did not write the third return-to-work letter, making it a false representation by a health care provider, was a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for Sanderson Farms to fire Matson on September 9. (Docket Entry No. 18 at 22-34; Docket Entry No. 26 at 5, 9, 14-17). Sanderson Farms argues that it made a good-faith effort to reinstate Matson after Red Rock later verified the third return-to-work letter, but that Matson refused to report to work on the requested dates despite the absence of any health condition preventing his return. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Matson responds that these reasons were pretexts for discrimination and retaliation. (Docket Entry No. 22 at 25-26). Matson argues that the record supports a reasonable inference of pretext because Amberly Sherwood did not look at the email from Dy Wolpert when Matson tried to show it to her at the September 9 meeting, and because Jeffrey Baker told Sanderson Farms, within \"hours\" of Matson's firing, that Dy Wolpert \"may\" have written and sent the third return-to-work letter. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 26). Matson argues that Sanderson Farms did not give him enough time to report for reinstatement and return to work before it fired him on October 11. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 20).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    <strong>\n     i. The September 9 Firing\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Matson requested a return-to-work letter in September from Dy Wolpert, who emailed him a letter, dated September 7, 2016, that had obvious problems in both form and substance. As to form, the September 7 letterhead said that it came \"from the desk of Dr. Dy Wolpert,\" not from Red Rock; Dy Wolpert's signature did not match his previous signatures; and the bottom of the letter listed an address of \"1234 Main Street Anytown, State Zip (123) 456.7890.\" (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 91). As to substance, the letter stated only that Matson was \"released to Return To Work on 9/21/2016\" without \"any restrictions,\" and the signature block listed a Phoenix, Arizona address and phone number with no apparent affiliation to Red Rock. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). This return-to-work letter was insufficient under the FMLA regulations because it provided no medical facts showing that Matson could perform his essential job functions, and it raised a reasonable forgery suspicion given the signature, bizarre address, lack of Red Rock affiliation, and inconsistency with the August 30 Red Rock letter.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Despite the facially apparent problems with the September 7 letter, Matson forwarded Dy Wolpert's email containing the letter to Sanderson Farms, having \"barely read it.\" (Docket Entry No. 23 at 21). The email from Dy Wolpert came from \"dywolpert@yahoo.com,\" not a Red-Rock affiliated address, and stated simply: \"Hi elvis. here is your letter[.]\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 64). Sanderson Farms reasonably questioned the letter's authenticity, and promptly sent it to Red Rock for authentication and clarification without notifying Matson. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 93). Jeffrey Baker responded from Red Rock the same day, September 7, stating that: \"I can assure you that this document did not come from our doctor.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Because\n    Sanderson Farms's policies required firing any employee who falsified a doctor's statement, Jeffery Baker's assurance that no doctor wrote the September 7 letter that Matson had sent gave Sanderson Farms a legitimate and nondiscriminatory basis to fire Matson.

Jeffrey Baker was Matson's case manager at Red Rock and had regularly communicated with Sanderson Farms to provide necessary paperwork and information. Sanderson Farms had no verified contact information for Dy Wolpert, other than that provided on the September 7 letter, and no one from Sanderson Farms had\n    spoken with Dy Wolpert during Matson's leave. It was reasonable for Sanderson Farms to contact Jeffrey Baker, Matson's case manager at the health-care facility where Dy Wolpert practiced, given the concerns about falsification. Again, even if Sanderson Farms violated FMLA regulations by doing this before notifying Matson in writing, Sanderson Farms did not interfere with Matson's right to reinstatement because it had a reasonable and good-faith basis to believe that Matson was not entitled to that right.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Sanderson Farms fired Matson on September 9, 2016, and Amberly Sherwood informed him why. (Docket Entry No. 23 at 89-95). Matson asked, \"what do I need to do to verify where I was for all those months and authenticate that note?\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 93). Amberly Sherwood responded that \"[t]here is nothing you can do at this point to authenticate it because we've already done that and [Red Rock] told us it is not authentic.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Matson has not pointed to evidence supporting a reasonable inference that Sanderson Farms's stated reason for firing Matson on September 7 was a pretext for retaliation or discrimination because of his disability, race, or FMLA leave.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Jeffrey Baker emailed Sanderson Farms on September 9, 2016, at 7:13 p.m., after Matson had been fired, stating that the September 7 letter \"may\" have come from Dy Wolpert and that Red Rock was investigating. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 135). The fact that Sanderson Farms did not call the number listed on the September 7 letter does not support a reasonable inference of pretext because Red Rock had already confirmed that the letter did not come from Dy Wolpert, and because Red Rock did not verify the clearly wrong phone number. Nor does the fact that Sanderson Farms took no immediate action after Jeffrey Baker's September 9 email support a reasonable inference of pretext because the email came after Matson's firing and indicated only that the September 7 letter \"may\" have been authentic in that it came from someone still incorrectly believed to be a doctor. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Red Rock did not inform Sanderson Farms that Dy Wolpert in fact wrote the September 7 letter until September 12, three days after Matson's firing, in an email from Red Rock's Program Director, Erika Heckman. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 70). According to Jennifer Buster, the Sanderson Farms Manager of Corporate Human Resources, Amberly Sherwood forwarded Erika Heckman's email to her. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 147). On September 16, Matson emailed Amberly Sherwood, asking Sanderson Farms to \"please respond to Ms. Hickman's [sic] September 12, 2016[,] email or call her so this matter may be resolved.\" (Docket Entry No. 23 at 72). Amberly Sherwood again forwarded this email to Jennifer Buster, stating \"I just received this email from [Matson].\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Based on the emails, Jennifer Buster began investigating \"the matter and [Dy] Wolpert's certification.\" (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 147).

The October 11 Firing\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    On September 30, 2016, Jennifer Buster directed Amberly Sherwood and Casey Laub to contact Matson and start the reinstatement process. (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 147). Amberly Sherwood and Casey Laub emailed Matson on September 30, and again on October 3 when they did not hear from him, stating that they had tried to reach him by phone, telling Matson that Sanderson Farms was reinstating him, and asking him to report to work so that he could sign reinstatement forms and \"see the company's substance abuse professional for recommendations regarding returning to work.\" (Docket Entry No. 18-1 at 103-05). Red Rock had informed Sanderson Farms that Matson had been treated for alcohol and substance abuse, and Sanderson Farms's policies required an employee returning from leave for substance- or alcohol-abuse treatment to see a substance-abuse professional and to take an unannounced drug screen.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 83, 89, 176-77).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Matson testified that he became aware that \"Sanderson Farms was trying to reinstate [his] employment\" on September 30, and he remembered the voicemail from Brenda Gatlin on October 3. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 37). Matson testified that he \"wasn't in town\" because, a \"[c]ouple days\" after his firing, he began working at his brother's trucking\n    company in San Antonio. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 37-39, 43). Matson spoke to Amberly Sherwood and Casey Laub on October 6, 2016, and they told him that he had to report to work for reinstatement on either October 7 or 10. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 40). Matson told them that he could not report on those dates. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 40-41). Matson asked if the reinstatement paperwork could be emailed or mailed to him. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 107, 109-10). Amberly Sherwood and Casey Laub stated that Matson needed to appear in person on the specified dates. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 109).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    On October 7, 2016, instead of reporting to Sanderson Farms, Matson went to Vallentine's Garage in Caldwell, Texas, outside San Antonio, seeking employment. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 117). Matson did not report to Sanderson Farms on October 10, although he did email Brenda Gatlin, stating that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n    I emailed Amberly last week regarding executing the reinstatement documents and my availability to report to Human Resources on\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      October 31, 2016\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    . I respectfully requested that the reinstatement documents be e-mailed or mailed to me but to date, I have not received any documentation. As I mentioned in my October 6, 2016[,] email, once I receive the required documentation, I will receive and return them via Certified Mail.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 109 (emphasis in original)). On October 11, after Matson failed to report on either date, Sanderson Farms fired Matson a second time for \"[f]ailure to return from leave,\" informing him in an email sent by Brenda Gatlin. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 109, 112).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Matson argues that Sanderson Farms's reinstatement offer was a \"sham,\" and a pretext, because Sanderson Farms provided \"[in]adequate notice for Matson to return to work.\" (Docket Entry No. 22 at 20). The record evidence does not support that argument. Because Matson did not contact Sanderson Farms until October 6, after learning of his reinstatement on September 30, he had only a few days to report to work for reinstatement. Had Matson promptly contacted Sanderson Farms, he would have had 10 days to report. Matson's EEOC charge stated that he had been out looking for work on October 3, 5, and 7, supporting a reasonable inference that he was medically able to report on October 7 or 10, but chose not to. Matson did not report on the requested dates, and he has identified no authority requiring Sanderson Farms to hold his position open after that.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beckendorf v.
