Plaintiff Thais Ortolaza sues as the mother and on behalf of her minor child, E., who at the pertinent times was a student at the Two Rivers Magnet High School (\"Two Rivers\" or \"the School\") in Hartford, Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The case is before the Court on the motion of one of two groups of Defendants to dismiss an Amended Complaint which Plaintiff filed pursuant to leave granted by the Court in a prior Ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The case arose when during the morning of November 19, 2015, E. was removed by officers of the Hartford Police Department (\"HPD\") from a school bus carrying students to Two Rivers. E. was arrested on a charge of sending a threatening email to the School principal, detained for about an hour, and then released, without further charge or action against him. This action, filed by E.'s mother, followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's initial complaint alleged claims against two groups of Defendants. The first group consists of the Capitol Region Education Council (\"CREC\"), the administrator of Two Rivers, and three CREC officers or employees (collectively, \"the CREC Defendants.\"). The second group of Defendants consists of officers of varying ranks in the Hartford Police Department (collectively, \"the Hartford Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The CREC Defendants moved to dismiss certain counts in the complaint against them. The Hartford Defendants did not join in that motion. The Court granted the CREC motion in an opinion reported at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202100280\">\n    2018 WL 2100280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. May 7, 2018) (\"the May 7 Ruling\"), familiarity with which is assumed. The Court dismissed Plaintiff's federal \u00a7 1983 claims against the CREC Defendants without prejudice and with leave to amend, and dismissed the state law claims against those Defendants without prejudice, with the provision that a particular state law\n   claim could be reinstated \"if the Plaintiff files an amended complaint which alleges a viable federal claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13. The May 7 Ruling dismissed Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claim against the CREC Defendants for the principal reason that \"the form and substance of communication between private parties and the police pleaded by this complaint does not suffice to make the private party a\n   <em>\n    state actor.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The May 7 Ruling granted Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint because of the circumstances described in footnote 6, which noted \"a gap in the Complaint's factual account, between McCain's first telephoned 911 call to the police which did not identify a suspect, and police officers' subsequent boarding of the school bus, searching for E. by name.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10, n.6. \"The question arises,\" the footnote continued, \"whether Plaintiff is in a position to allege additional facts in an amended complaint which would state a viable \u00a7 1983 claim against a CREC Defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Footnote 6 collected a number of cases which consider liability pursuant to \u00a7 1983 \"when a defendant is a private actor and not an arresting officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on those cases, a plaintiff must show that the private defendant \"instigated the arrest\" by, for example, \"importuning the authorities to act\" with the intention that the plaintiff be confined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By contrast, where \"private actors merely furnished information leading to an arrest, liability does not attach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Footnote 6 concluded by saying: \"One cannot presently tell whether the Plaintiff at bar could, consistent with her obligations under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, allege facts in an amended complaint sufficient to bring this case within the theory of those cases. The present complaint does not do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff took advantage of this opportunity to amend her pleading by filing an Amended Complaint [Doc. 53] whose allegations expand upon a number of areas, the most pertinent for present purposes being (1) pre-incident interactions between Plaintiff, her son E., and CREC or School administrators, and (2) communications between CREC Defendants and Hartford police officers on November 19, 2015, the date of E.'s arrest by the Hartford Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the allegations of the Amended Complaint cure the deficiencies the Court identified in the May 7 Ruling, and plead viable claims against the CREC Defendants as state actors in respect of E.'s arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The CREC Defendants respond that the Amended Complaint is just as deficient in that regard as the original complaint. These Defendants move under Rule 12(b)(6) [Doc. 65] to dismiss the Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim against them. The Hartford Defendants continue to play no part in the CREC Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   CREC's renewed motion to dismiss has been fully briefed again. This Ruling resolves the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    THE AMENDED COMPLAINT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I begin with the account Plaintiff gives in her Amended Complaint (hereinafter \"A.C.\") of the manner in which E. came to be arrested by the Hartford police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that during the evening of November 18, 2015, there was delivered to the official email address of Defendant McCain, the School Principal, \"a spoofed email address from Italy with the subject line 'reckoning.' \" A.C. \u00b6 59. That paragraph further alleges that \"e-mail spoofing is the forgery of an e-mail header so that the message appears to have originated from someone or somewhere other than the actual source.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 59 n. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The email was not signed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. The body of the email read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   im fed up with the mind numbing shit thsis [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] school puts me\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   through\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   its hell\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   tomorrow im bringing my dads sawed off shotgun and pistol and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ending this shit\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   good night\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   better make sure you get this before morning\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. McCain checked his office email and read this message at about 6:00 a.m. on the morning of November 19th.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Amended Complaint further alleges that \"at 6:15 a.m. on November 19\" McCain forwarded the email to the CREC email addresses of Defendant Nolan, the CREC Director of Security, and Defendant Sullivan, the CREC Assistant Superintendent for Operations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. \"Between 6:00 a.m. and 6:20 a.m.,\" McCain called Sullivan to discuss the email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. They concluded that the email expressed a \"legitimate threat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. \"McCain called 911 at 6:21 a.m. and informed the HPD 911 dispatcher of the email and that McCain believed the threat it contained was credible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72. This was the CREC Defendants' initial notification to the Hartford Police Department (\"HPD\") about the incident. \"Defendants McCain, Sullivan and Nolan were in continuous communication with HPD from approximately 6:20 a.m. onward.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. The succeeding paragraphs of the Amended Complaint recount aspects of that communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   During McCain's initial 911 call at 6:21 a.m., he did not tell police whom he suspected had sent the email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72. \"Before 7 a.m. on November 19,\" McCain, Nolan and Sullivan \"determined E. was a suspect in the sending of the 'reckoning' email,\" as the result of certain circumstances which in the perception of these CREC employees meant that E.'s \"authorship of the 'reckoning' email was likely.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   E., who traveled from his home to Two Rivers by school bus with other students, boarded the bus at about 6:57 a.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110. By this time, it appears that the CREC Defendants had identified E. to the HPD as the suspected author of the email, but they made no effort to prevent E. from boarding the bus at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"McCain, Sullivan and Nolan told the Hartford Police Department that E. would be on the bus,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115, and subsequently \"directed the bus to the Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts, another school about a block away from the HPD, instead of having the bus go to Two Rivers,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117. The bus \"arrived at school around 7:22 a.m.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116. The Amended Complaint alleges that the CREC Defendants \"knew and understood\" that HPD officers \"would meet the school bus at the other school with the intention of removing E. from the school bus and detaining him and interrogating him about the 'reckoning' email,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119, and further that they \"knew and intended\" that police officers \"would detain and arrest E. in order to prevent E. from carrying out the alleged violent threat contained in the 'reckoning' email,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   HPD officers met the school bus and removed E. from the bus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 134, 135, 137. At that time, at least one officer had his gun drawn and pointed at E.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   They asked E. whether he had sent the email, which he denied, and then searched E., and discovered that he had no weapons or contraband on his person or in his bag.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 143, 151, 153. The officers then handcuffed E. and transported him in a police cruiser to the Two Rivers school building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 151, 154, 170. At the Two Rivers school building, two Hartford police defendants interrogated E.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 176. They were later joined by McCain, who asked questions about the 'reckoning' email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 188-190. E. was released shortly after his parents arrived at the school,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 215, approximately 55 minutes after his arrest,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 215. E. was never charged with sending the email, and no further action was taken against him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 220.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Amended Complaint also contains allegations which undertake to explain why the CREC Defendants believed that E. was the probable author of the \"reckoning\" email. It is alleged that Plaintiff Thais Ortolaza and her son E. \"had been at Two Rivers on the evening of November 18, 2015 for a parent-teacher conference to discuss E. and his academic progress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. According to McCain,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , E. had previously discussed with McCain his familiarity with firearms and association with local gangs. The Amended Complaint states that at the November 18 conference, Plaintiff was unhappy about a lack of communication between the School and herself about the disciplining of E.,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54, and \"after the parent-teacher conference,\" E. was perceived to be angry \"because his mother publicly humiliated him,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Plaintiff and E. left the School and presumably returned to their home. The unsigned threatening email was delivered to McCain's office at approximately 10:13 p.m. that evening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. When McCain, Nolan and Sullivan discussed the email before 7 a.m. on the following morning of November 19, they\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   determined E. was a suspect in the sending of the \"reckoning\" email because (A) of E's alleged prior statements about weapons to Defendant McCain, (B) E. allegedly felt angry after the parent teacher conference the night before and (C) E. was the only student smart enough to know what the word \"reckoning\" meant and thus his authorship of the \"reckoning\" email was likely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92. \"By identifying E. to the Hartford Police Department, Defendants McCain, Sullivan and Nolan intended that E. be arrested and detained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   By the end of 2017, the parties had, in the vernacular, \"lawyered up.\" Plaintiff filed her initial complaint against the CREC Defendants and the Hartford Defendants on November 9, 2017. By this time, E. had withdrawn from Two Rivers School (which he never returned to after the November 19, 2015 incident,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 223).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition to the allegations contained in the paragraphs quoted or cited\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Amended Complaint also refers to a letter dated December 18,\n   <em>\n    2017\n   </em>\n   (over two years after the incident in suit), which McCain's counsel sent to Plaintiff's attorney of record \"regarding the incidents at issue in this litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. The Amended Complaint includes several assertions which Plaintiff's attorney claims that counsel for McCain made in that letter. Specifically, the Amended Complaint alleges the December 18 letter contained the following statements by McCain's counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 McCain had met with E. about four times for disciplinary issues, where \"E. would freely and openly discuss firearms and his affiliation with local gangs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. McCain recalled this information because E. was \"the only student to discuss openly his possession and knowledge of firearms as well as his affiliation with\n   known gangs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. McCain could not determine \"if this was simply a new student trying to 'impress' others or if in fact E's statements were true.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 \"The identification of E. was made through Hartford Police questioning of Mr. McCain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82. Specifically, \"[t]he police pressed Mr. McCain to name anyone who may have access to firearms, Mr. McCain named E.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 \"[T]he Police persisted in asking Mr. McCain to identify any student whom he thought could have access to firearms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. As a result of the alleged prior statements by E. about his access to firearms, \"McCain identified E. as a student who may have access to firearms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 McCain, Nolan and Sullivan opined that \"E. wrote the threatening email directly following the school meeting out of anger over what transpired at the meeting, only hours prior to the subject email was sent\" [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ].\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Somewhat surprisingly, given the quotations from counsel's letter in the preceding paragraphs of the Amended Complaint, the A.C.'s final reference to that letter reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The December 18, 2017 letter unequivocally stated \"\n   <em>\n    At no time did Mr. McCain or any CREC employee identify E. as the student who wrote the threatening email.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis in original).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. The emphasized disclaimer seems somewhat at odds with other explicit or implicit assertions in the December 18, 2017 letter from McCain's attorney, to the effect that McCain identified E. to the Hartford police as the likely author of the email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, the Amended Complaint quotes a police report about the incident, dated November 19, 2015, the day of the arrest, signed by Detective Trigila, one of the Hartford Defendants, which recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   McCain informed CREC Director of Security Chris Nolan that he believed the threat was made by student [E.], who has been having disciplinary issues in the school recently and may have had a motive to make the threat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. This police report does not state explicitly that McCain informed the HPD (as well as Nolan) of his belief that E. was the perpetrator. However, it is plausible to conclude that McCain did so. The police, responding to communications by the School administrators, went directly to the school bus, singled out only E. for preliminary questioning, handcuffed E., and removed him from the scene in a police vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   It is not clear what effect, if any, this reviewing Court should give to the quotations Plaintiff selects from a letter written by Defendant McCain's attorney two years after the incident in suit. The question presented by this action, brought under the aegis of \u00a7 1983, is whether Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges a viable claim that a CREC Defendant violated the United States Constitution as a\n   <em>\n    state actor.\n   </em>\n   To achieve that purpose, the complaint \"must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The letter of an adverse party's\n   attorney, an exercise in advocacy two years after the event, is an unlikely place to look for well-pleaded factual allegations in support of a claim the author-attorney and his client McCain oppose. On the other hand, I accept that McCain's attorney wrote the December 18, 2017 letter and the Amended Complaint quotes it accurately.

Under governing law, Plaintiff's claim turns upon whether her Amended Complaint alleges facts sufficient to show that the CREC Defendants should be regarded as \"state actors\" with respect to the specific claims for relief asserted this Plaintiff in her pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the CREC Defendants were state actors. Obedient to higher authority, I must draw on common sense in comprehending Plaintiff's basis for that contention. The prolix allegations of the Amended Complaint are less than a model of clarity in explaining what these School administrators did in the events leading up to E's arrest by the Hartford police. However, armed by such judicial experience and common sense as I have, it seems to me that the core of what happened in this case, derived from the well-pleaded factual allegations in the Amended Complaint, is this:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The anonymous \"reckoning\" email McCain read at his office at 6:00 a.m. on November 19. 2015, clearly threatened deadly violence at the Two Rivers School. Given the tragic shootings at schools in recent years, the prompt action of McCain and his CREC colleagues in notifying the Hartford police about the threat was an exercise in common sense. The police's common-sense response was to ask the school administrators who they thought the author of the threat might be. The police had no way of knowing or determining that identity with the expediency necessary for such a threat, but the author identified himself as a student. Common sense suggested to the police that McCain, the School principal, might know or suspect who the author could be. In point of fact, McCain, after discussing the question\n   with his CREC colleagues, told the police that E. was familiar with firearms, would be on the bus heading for the School, and was suspected of having written the email. The HPD acted upon that information by removing E. from the bus and briefly detaining and questioning him, before releasing him without taking further action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The conduct of McCain and the other CREC Defendants would cast them in the role of \"state actors\" in E's arrest if they were acting \"under color of\" state law, as that phrase is used in (and required by) \u00a7 1983. Whether that showing is made by the expanded factual account set forth in the Amended Complaint requires a further consideration of case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   One must perforce begin with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Adickes v.

The frequency of such cases is not surprising. A police arrest on the basis of a private citizen's complaint or information is a commonplace occurrence. An arrestee claiming violation of his or her rights is interested in suing everyone potentially liable. Liability of a particular defendant in such a case depends initially upon whether that defendant is a state actor. The police provide no ground for litigation of that threshold question; police officers executing an arrest are by definition acting under color of\n   state law. Whether a private individual's involvement in the arrest constitutes action under color of law sufficient to make that individual a state actor depends upon particular circumstances which the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Brentwood Academy\n   </em>\n   and the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Sybalski\n   </em>\n   undertook to identify by means of articulated \"tests.\" The concept of a private entity as a state actor for \u00a7 1983 purposes is a fertile ground for litigation. No cases are entirely alike. Some are more instructive than others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   A notable contrast to the case at bar is found in\n   <em>\n    Mara v.

Conn. July 15, 2015), decided by Judge Chatigny of this Court on a motion to dismiss. The plaintiff, a student at a university, filed a \u00a7 1983 action for false arrest against university employees and local police officers involved in plaintiff's arrest for an assault against another student, which was subsequently shown to have been committed by someone other than plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. While\n   <em>\n    Mara\n   </em>\n   bears some surface resemblance to the case at bar, the circumstances relevant to the respective plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims are quite different, as Judge Chatigny's meticulous decision demonstrates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Mara,\n   </em>\n   a Fairfield University student, attended an off-campus party where another student was hit on the head with a bottle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The victim could not say who assaulted him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Police officers from the Town of Fairfield investigated the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   A time came when Town police asked the University Public Safety Department for a photograph of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The University complied; an unknown University official provided the town with plaintiff's photograph.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The police included plaintiff's photograph in an array which was showed to a witness at the party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The police then sought to interview plaintiff, and arranged with plaintiff's attorney to meet with plaintiff at police headquarters the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Town police made contact with Defendant Cleary, a Fairfield University campus security officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The complaint, as paraphrased by Judge Chatigny's opinion, recounted these additional events:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Town police officers drove to the University campus. With the assistance of Officer Cleary, they located the plaintiff. He was \"detained,\" placed in a University vehicle driven by Cleary, and brought to the University Public Safety Office. Cleary gave the officers audio and video equipment to record the interrogation and permitted them to use the office but did not participate in the interrogation himself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4213286\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/604/77/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The gravamen of plaintiff's complaint was that Cleary, a University security officer, actively participated in the arrest of plaintiff. Judge Chatigny says in his opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   According to the complaint, the police wanted to arrest the plaintiff and Cleary undertook to help them. The officers benefitted from Cleary's participation because he helped locate the plaintiff and transported the plaintiff to the campus security office .... [T]he complaint does allege that the officers lacked even probable cause, that they asked Cleary to help make the arrest, and that he did so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4213286\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/604/77/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *4-*5. On the motion to dismiss before him, Judge Chatigny construed the complaint's allegations to justify this holding by the Court: \"That Cleary actually participated in the arrest then took the plaintiff to the Public Safety Office for interrogation renders him a state actor with regard to the false arrest claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. In Judge Chatigny's view, the account plaintiff pleaded in his complaint was that \"Cleary participated alongside Town officers in making an arrest and was therefore directly involved in the alleged constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   With respect to the involvement of private individuals in the arrests in these two cases (Cleary in\n   <em>\n    Mara\n   </em>\n   , McCain and the other CREC school administrators in the case at bar), there are significant differences. Cleary was employed as a security officer by the Fairfield University Department of Public Safety, which \"is authorized by Fairfield University to prevent, investigate and report any violations of State or Federal Law and/or University regulations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In dealing with students on the Fairfield campus, Cleary had police-like powers which, at the request of Town police, he exercised on this occasion: identifying, stopping, and detaining plaintiff, and transporting plaintiff in a University vehicle driven by Cleary to the University Public Safety Office, where Town police interrogated plaintiff. Those circumstances underlie Judge Chatigny's remark in\n   <em>\n    Mara\n   </em>\n   that \"Cleary participated alongside Town officers making an arrest.\" The case at bar differs in that the Hartford police, acting on information provided by McCain and his CREC colleagues, acted alone when they boarded the school bus, got E. to identify himself, arrested him, handcuffed him, and transported E. in a police vehicle to the School. No CREC defendant was \"participating alongside\" Hartford police officers during those pertinent events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The May 7 Ruling discussed a number of arrest cases which considered a private entity's possible \u00a7 1983 liability as a state actor, acting under color of state law.

Tsopelas and a co-defendant, a restaurant co-owner, contended in a motion to dismiss that the complaint \"fails to state \u00a7 1983 claims against them because there is no allegation that either defendant acted jointly with the police.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court denied that motion and let the case proceed, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   To establish joint action, a plaintiff must show that the private citizen and the state official shared a common unlawful goal; the true state actor and the jointly acting private party must agree to deprive the plaintiff of rights guaranteed by federal law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiffs allege in the Amended Complaint (1) that Tsopelas called the police, (2) that 30 minutes later, two police officers arrived and engaged Tsopelas in a 20-minute conversation, and (3) that Officer Dean arrested Laura Bang after the conversation ended abruptly. Calling the police, alone, does not establish joint action with the police and the private caller.

If there were facts establishing probable cause to arrest plaintiffs for criminal trespass when the officer arrived at Utopia, it should not have taken 20 minutes for the restaurant owners to explain those facts to the officers ....

McCain, Nolan, and Sullivan were not state actors in those events because (unlike the Hartford Police) they were not acting under color of state law. As the May 7 Ruling held, Plaintiff's initial complaint did not contain factual allegations sufficient to demonstrate that required status. The somewhat expanded details in the proposed Amended Complaint fare no better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The plain fact of the matter, as recounted in each pleading, is that McCain took the manifestly sensible step of telephoning the Hartford police and informing them about the threatening e-mail, thereafter responding to police inquiries by giving them information about E. Police then boarded the school bus, arrested E., and detained him for a time - based on their own exercise of judgment, and through no undue influence or coercion by the CREC Defendants. The cited cases hold uniformly that a private individual's calling the police and giving them information - even if the information is later shown to be incorrect - does not establish joint action between the police and the private caller for the purpose of \u00a7 1983 liability. Nor does such conduct, standing alone, constitute private \"instigation\" of an arrest carried out by police of a nature exposing the private individual to a \u00a7 1983 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Courts are understandably disinclined to allow the assertion of constitutional civil rights claims against private citizens who send such communications to their local police. The circumstances present in the cases upholding \u00a7 1983 claims against private parties for arrests executed by police were not previously alleged by this Plaintiff in her initial complaint, and are not alleged in her Amended Complaint. The CREC Defendants did not knowingly convey to the Hartford police false information about E., with the intent of procuring the arrest of an innocent individual. The Hartford police's arrest of E. was not in furtherance of a pre-existing plan or policy between the CREC Defendants and the police to accomplish a purpose of problematic validity (the set of facts presented by\n   <em>\n    Adickes\n   </em>\n   ). The police's decision to arrest E. was the result of communications from McCain that, as a matter of law, do not subject these school administrators to claims under \u00a7 1983.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   An additional aspect of the case requires discussion.

A plaintiff pressing a claim of violation of his constitutional rights under \u00a7 1983 is thus required to show state action.

Conduct that is formally \"private\" may become so entwined with governmental policies or so impregnated with a governmental character that it can be regarded as governmental action. But a private entity does not become a state actor for purposes of \u00a7 1983 merely on the basis of the private entity's creation, funding, licensing or regulation by the government.

The \"specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains\" is the arrest of E. by Hartford police officers, with E's attendant handcuffing and interrogation. These events occurred during a brief period of time, beginning \"at approximately 6:00 a.m.\" on November 19, 2015, A.C. \u00b6 62, when McCain read the threatening e-mail which prompted his 6:21 a.m. phone call to the HPD, and ending shortly afterward that morning, when E. was \"released into his parents' custody after being arrested for approximately 55 minutes,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 215. According to the allegations of the Amended Complaint, during that brief period the school administrators read the threatening e-mail; notified the HPD by phone about the e-mail; gave the HPD information about E. that suggested he might be the author; directed the school bus to go to the location where the police arrested E.; and, in McCain's case, entered the room where the police were interrogating E. and asked some questions about the 'reckoning' e-mail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 190. Those minimal acts on the part of the private individuals do not amount to instigation of or joint participation with the police in the arrest of E., as those concepts are defined by the cases. McCain and his CREC colleagues did no more than report the e-mail to the police and provide additional factual information by answering police questions. It was for the police to decide whether to arrest E. They decided to do so. Police boarded the school bus alone, arrested E., handcuffed him, transported E. in a police cruiser to the School, and interrogated him there. In these circumstances, E.'s arrest cannot be regarded as the result of joint action by the Hartford police and the private-individual school administrators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   This case differs in that regard from\n   <em>\n    Mara v. MacNamara,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204392956\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , where Cleary, the private individual involved,\n   was a university security officer who was present at the plaintiff's arrest, personally participated in the arrest, and drove the plaintiff and town police to the university security office for interrogation. Judge Chatigny interpreted the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Mara\n   </em>\n   as alleging that \"Cleary [a peace officer himself] participated alongside Town officers in making an arrest and was therefore directly involved in the alleged constitutional violation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204392956\">\n    2015 WL 4392956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Those facts allowed plaintiff's federal claim against the private entities to survive a motion to dismiss. Such circumstances are not present in the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges the school administrators intended that E. be arrested. I am not bound to accept that conclusory and argumentative characterization of the CREC Defendants' mental state. In any event, the existence\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   of joint action in the arrest depends upon the defendants' conduct, and under the clear weight of authority, that conduct does not support finding the school administrators were joint actors with the arresting police officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   I conclude that the CREC Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint against them must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Amended Complaint suffers from the same infirmities with respect to the CREC Defendants as did the initial Complaint, which was dismissed as to those Defendants for the reasons stated in the May 7 Ruling. Plaintiff's federal claim against these school administrator Defendants based upon\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as alleged in the amended pleading, fails because these Defendants cannot be regarded as state actors, or as having acted under color of state law, in connection with the arrest of Plaintiff's son E. by the Hartford police. The police were state actors; they arrested E. under color of state law; the arrest resulted from information communicated to the police by the school administrators. Those facts may be acknowledged, but they fall well short of establishing the CREC Defendants as state actors, or as joint actors with the police in making the arrest. The school administrators and the police were not working together in furtherance of a state-enforced prohibited purpose (that being the\n   <em>\n    Adickes\n   </em>\n   touchstone of a private entity's \u00a7 1983 liability). The CREC Defendants did not instigate E's arrest by knowingly conveying false information about him to the HPD. McCain's initial 911 call to the police about the threatening e-mail, and information subsequently given by the school administrators to the police in response to pre-arrest police inquiries, do not take this case out of the line of cases which hold consistently that such conduct does not impose \u00a7 1983 liability upon a private entity by transforming that entity into a state actor. The state statutory references to educational entities such as CREC do not alter that conclusion with respect to the\n   CREC Defendants' status as private individuals in this false arrest case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The Court's Ruling on this motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint will mirror the May 7 Ruling dismissing the initial Complaint. Plaintiff's federal claims under \u00a7 1983 against the CREC Defendants will be dismissed for failure to state a claim, this time without leave to replead. As for Plaintiff's state law claims against those Defendants, the Court again declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and those claims will again be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Assuming, without deciding or intimating, that as Plaintiff has always contended, her son had nothing to do with sending to the School the \"reckoning\" e-mail that set this whole unhappy chain of events in motion, E. was wronged by his arrest and attendant humiliation, and the injury to the entire family is a serious one. Because this Court's dismissal of the state law claims is without prejudice, Plaintiff and her family may avail themselves of any remedies that may be available to them under Connecticut statutory law or common law, in a Connecticut court of competent jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court makes this Order:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   1.
