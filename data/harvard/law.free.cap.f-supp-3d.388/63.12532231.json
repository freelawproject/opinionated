On January 10, 2019, the Board of Immigration Appeals declined to reopen Sisse's removal proceedings. Resp't's Opp'n Pet'r's Mots.

Judgment 1, ECF No. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 11, 2019, Moniz opposed Sisse's motions for injunctive relief. Opp'n, ECF No. 26. Sisse replied on June 12 and raised, for the first time, the possibility that he might fall into a class certified in another session of this Court and requested a stay of removal pending an I-485 application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r's Resp.

Am. Pet. 13. According to Sisse, if the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed to reopen his case, he would become eligible for adjustment of status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. Yet the Board of Immigration Appeals has already considered Sisse's motion to reopen and rejected it. Opp'n, Ex. 1,\n   <em>\n    In re Sambu Sisse\n   </em>\n   4. As a result, Sisse can no longer seek an adjustment of status.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Am. Pet. 3 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (requiring admissibility to adjust immigration status));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9)(B)(ii)(I) (rendering inadmissible immigrants, such as Sisse, who have \"been unlawfully present in the United States for one year or more, and who again seek[ ] admission within 10 years of the date of such alien's departure or removal from the United States\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sisse has now received exactly what his amended petition requested: the complete adjudication of his immigration claims in the immigration system. The Court can do no more with the claims in his amended petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Therefore, the Court DENIES Sisse's motions for injunctive relief, ECF Nos. 11, 12, and GRANTS Moniz's motion to dismiss his petition, ECF No. 7. Further, the Court denies Sisse's requests for release now that his removal is \"reasonably foreseeable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cissna\n   </em>\n   , Civ.

Therefore, Sisse had until December 5, 2018 to amend his petition without a motion. Because he amended the petition on December 3, 2018, his amendment was timely.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The Court granted the motion to amend with respect to Moniz only.

Though the Court has no opportunity to decide whether these statutes would have provided it with authority to adjudicate Sisse's petition, the Court doubts that it could review a petitioner's claims about the immigration decision-making involved here under the Administrative Procedures Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
