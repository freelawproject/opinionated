Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' protectable copyright interest in the American folk song \"This Land is Your Land\" (the \"Song\" or \"This Land\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that Defendants' copyright of the Song is invalid and that the Song is in the public domain.

Factual Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the Complaint (ECF No. 6) and are assumed true for purposes of the instant Motion.\n   <em>\n    Burnette v. Carothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11567238\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/52/#p56\">\n    192 F.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56 (2d Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   i. Origins of the Song\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the melody of This Land is substantially identical to that of a Baptist gospel hymn from the late 19th or early 20th century, which has been known by various names, including \"Fire Song.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10; 19.) In 1940, the American folk singer Woody Guthrie (\"Guthrie\") heard \"Fire Song,\" or some variation of it, and copied the melody for use with his own original lyrics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.) The lyrics Guthrie wrote in 1940 were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   This land is your land, this land is my land From California to the New York Island, From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   As I went walking that ribbon of highway And saw above me that endless skyway, And saw below me the golden valley, I said: This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts, And all around me, a voice was sounding: This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Was a high wall there that tried to stop me A sign was painted said: Private Property, But on the back side it didn't\n   say nothing - This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   When the sun come shining, then I was strolling In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling; The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting: This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple By the Relief Office I saw my people - As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering if This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\"1940 Lyrics\")(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) However, Guthrie did not publish the Song until 1945.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ii. Disputed Copyright Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In April, 1944, Guthrie recorded This Land for Moses Asch, the owner of Folkways Records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) In 1945, Guthrie wrote and published a songbook entitled \"Ten 10 of Woody Guthrie's Songs Book One,\" (\"10 Songs\") (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Guthrie offered 10 Songs for sale to the general public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) The songbook contained printed instructions about how to order additional copies of the book: \"For more copies of this song book: Woody Guthrie, 3520 Mermaid Avenue, Brooklyn, 24, New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although 10 Songs was never registered with the United States Copyright Office (\"Copyright Office\"), the front cover of 10 Songs contained the following copyright notice: \"Copyright 1945 W. Guthrie.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) The melody and lyrics for This Land, together with the notation \"Words and music by W. Woody Guthrie,\" were printed on page 8 of 10 Songs as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND, THIS LAND IS MY LAND FROM THE REDWOOD FOREST TO THE NEW YORK ISLAND THE CANADIAN MOUNTAIN, TO THE GULF STREAM WATERS THIS LAND IS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   AS I GO WALKING THIS RIBBON OF HIGHWAY I SEE ABOVE ME THIS ENDLESS SKYWAY AND ALL AROUND ME THE WIND KEEPS SAYING: THIS LAND IS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I ROAM AND I RAMBLE AND I FOLLOW MY FOOTSTEPS TILL I COME TO THE SANDS OF HER MINERAL DESERT THE MIST IS LIFTING AND THE VOICE IS SAYING: THIS LAND IS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   WHERE THE WIND IS BLOWING I GO A STROLLING THE WHEAT FIELD WAVING AND THE DUST A ROLLING THE FOG IS LIFTING AND THE WIND IS SAYING: THIS LAND IS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   NOBODY LIVING CAN EVER STOP ME AS I GO WALKING MY FREEDOM HIGHWAY NOBODY LIVING CAN MAKE ME TURN BACK THIS LAND IS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\"1945 Lyrics\")(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 1951, with permission from Guthrie, Folkways Records released a phonograph entitled \"This Land is My Land: A Collection of American Folk Songs,\" which included a recording of Guthrie performing This Land. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) The lyrics were printed on the liner notes without any copyright notice as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   This land is your land, this land is my land. From California to the New York island, From the redwood forest to the\n   Gulf Stream waters, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   As I went walking that ribbon of highway, I saw above me that endless skyway, I saw below me that golden valley, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I roamed and rambled, and I followed my footsteps, To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts, And all around me a voice was sounding, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   When the sun come shining, then I was strolling, And the wheat fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling, A voice was chanting as the fog was lifting, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   This land is your land, this land is my land. From California to the New York island, From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   When the sun come shining, and I was strolling, The wheat fields waving, the dust clouds rolling, A voice was chanting and the fog was lifting, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\"1951, 1956, &amp; 1961 Lyrics\") (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 30, 1956, Defendant Ludlow filed an Application for Registration of a Claim to Copyright (Reg. No. EU432559) (the \"1956 Application\") for an unpublished work with the Copyright Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ludlow is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Defendant TRO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   That same year - 1956 - Folkways Records, with permission from Ludlow or Guthrie, released a phonograph entitled \"Bound for Glory: The Songs and Story of Woody Guthrie,\" which included a recording of This Land. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) The lyrics to the Song were printed on the liner notes without any copyright notice as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   This land is your land, this land is my land, From California to the New York Island, From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   As I went walking that ribbon of highway, I saw above me that endless skyway, I saw below me that golden valley This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   I roamed and I rambled, and I followed my footsteps, To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts, All around me a voice was sounding, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   When the sun come shining, then I was strolling, And the wheat fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling, A voice was chanting as the fog was lifting, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   This land is your land, this land is my land, From California to the New York Island, From Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream Waters, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   When the sun come shining, and I was strolling, The wheat fields waving, the dust clouds rolling, A voice was chanting and fog was lifting, This land was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (\"1951, 1956, &amp; 1961 Lyrics\") (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On December 15, 1958, Ludlow filed an Application for Registration of a Claim to Copyright (Reg. No. EP126345) (the \"1958 Application\") for a derivative work with the Copyright Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) The 1958 Application claimed a copyright in \"new matter\" consisting only of a new piano accompaniment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In 1961, with permission from Ludlow or Guthrie, Folkways Records re-released the\n   1951 phonograph record under the title \"This Land is My Land, Songs to Grow On, Vol. 3: American Work Songs,\" which included the same recording of This Land as the 1951 phonograph record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) The lyrics were printed in the liner notes without any copyright notice as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   This land is your land, this land is my land.

No. EP276540) (the \"1970 Application\") for a published musical composition with the Copyright Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) Reg. No. EP276540 covers only a new guitar arrangement and \"added words.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On May 3, 1972, Defendant Ludlow filed an Application for Registration of a Claim to Copyright (Reg. No. EP301279) (the \"1972 Application\") for a published musical composition with the Copyright Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) The 1972 Application claimed a copyright in only \"some words\" as \"new matter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) Plaintiffs assert that the words claimed as \"new matter\" were the following two verses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   As I went walking I saw a sign there And on the sign it said \"No Trespassing.\" But on the other side it didn't say nothing, That side was made for you and me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people By the Relief Office I seen my people As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking Is this land made for you and me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In all four of Ludlow's Applications (1956, 1958, 1970, 1972), Ludlow identified the title of the song as \"This Land is Your Land\" and Guthrie as the author of the Song's words and music. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 38, 47, 51.) Ludlow did not state in any of the four Applications that the Song had been published previously by Guthrie in 1945 or that the lyrics had been published previously by Folkways Records in 1951. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35, 39, 48, 54.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Defendants claim they own the exclusive copyright to This Land. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's conclusion appears to be based at least in part on the fact that Ludlow is listed as the owner of the copyright to This Land on the website of non-party Harry Fox Agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, prior to this lawsuit, Defendants had asserted their exclusive ownership in the copyright to This Land against non-party Jib Jab Media, Inc. (\"Jib Jab\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) On July 23, 2004, Ludlow's counsel wrote to Jib Jab's counsel regarding Jib Jab's use of the Song. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In that letter, Ludlow's counsel asserted: \"Ludlow is the exclusive copyright owner of the classic folk song 'This Land is Your Land' written by the well-known folk artist Woody Guthrie.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The letter also asserted that Jib Jab's use of the Song's melody and \"the well-known lyrics 'This land is your land, this land is my land' and 'From California to the New York Island' \" infringed Ludlow's copyright. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   iii. Plaintiffs' Use of the Song\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Satorii is a band based in New York City. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Saint-Amour is Satorii's drummer and Jerrra Blues is Satorii's lead singer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 18, 2016, Satorii provided Defendants with a Notice of Intention to Obtain a Compulsory License. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Satorii paid Defendants $45.50 for a mechanical license to produce and distribute 500 copies of the Song as a digital phonorecord. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs claim they did so involuntarily; Plaintiffs allege that they only entered into the mechanical license agreement and paid the $45.50 fee because Defendants had threatened to sue other users of the Song for copyright infringement in the past. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs recorded a version of the Song (\"Version 1\"), which is available for sale on iTunes and on other sites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Version 1 has the same melody as Guthrie's 1945 publication and includes the following lyrics:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   This land is your land, this land is my land From California to New York Island From Redwood Forest to Gulf Stream Waters This land was made for you and me\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   As I was walking that ribbon of highway I saw above me that endless skyway I saw below me that golden valley This land was made for you and me\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   I've roamed and rambled and I followed footsteps In the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts And all around me their voice was sounding This land was made for you and me\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Nobody living can ever stop me As I go walking my freedom highway Nobody living can make me turn back This land was made for you and me\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   This land is your land, this land is my land From California to New York Island From Redwood Forest to Gulf Stream Waters This land was made for you and me\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Satorii also recorded a different version of the Song using a different melody but the same lyrics (\"Version 2\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Plaintiffs believe that Version 2 does not\n   qualify for a compulsory license because of the change in the Song's melody (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that they cannot risk releasing Version 2 without permission from Defendants to create a derivative work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because of Defendants' claim of copyright ownership in the Song, Plaintiffs could be subject to substantial statutory penalties, attorneys' fees, and costs if they were to release Version 2 without first obtaining a license to create a derivative work from Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Additionally, Satorii wants to produce and release a music video of the Song (\"Music Video\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Plaintiffs allege that they cannot release the Music Video without first obtaining a synchronization license from Defendants because doing so would expose them to substantial penalties, attorneys' fees, and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this Class Action Complaint against Defendants on June 14, 2016. (ECF No. 6.) In Count I, Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment under the Copyright Act that the Song is in the public domain, or that Defendants' registrations only cover a piano arrangement (1958 copyright for Reg. No. EP126345), a guitar arrangement (1970 copyright for Reg. No. EP276540), and two alternate verses (1972 copyright for Reg. No. EP301279). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-88.) In Count II, Plaintiffs seek an injunction preventing Defendants' claim to ownership of copyrights in the Song and restitution for licenses of the Song. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-93.) The Complaint also includes four state law claims: deceptive acts and practices in violation of New York General Business Law \u00a7 349 (Count III); breach of contract (Count IV); money had and received (Count V); and rescission for failure of consideration (Count VI). (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 94-123.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On September 2, 2016, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint. (ECF No. 17.) In their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants argue that the Class Action Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety because Plaintiffs lack standing. Furthermore, each of the state law claims should be dismissed as preempted by federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   II.

The right being challenged through this claim is the very right protected by the Copyright Act - the right to restrict the performance and distribution of a copyrighted work. The Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants are deceiving the public by claiming to own a copyright to the melody and well-known lyrics of the Song. (Compl. \u00b6 98-99.) Such a claim is not qualitatively different than the Plaintiffs' request for a declaration that the Defendants have no valid copyright. Accordingly, this claim is preempted as one that seeks to vindicate a right equivalent to the exclusive rights protected by the Copyright Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WSOF\n   </em>\n   at 29-03 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Bus.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    N.Y.

Count IV: Breach of Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In Count IV, Plaintiffs assert a claim for breach of contract. \"Under New York law, a breach of contract claim requires proof of (1) an agreement, (2) adequate performance by the plaintiff, (3) breach by the defendant, and (4) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Fischer &amp; Mandell, LLP v.

On the other hand, where the right asserted hinges essentially on a determination of whether the rights protected by the Copyright Act exist, the breach of contract claim is preempted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 1.01[B][1](a) (contract claims alleging \"nothing other than derogation of rights under copyright\" are preempted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Plaintiffs' contract claim is preempted. The Plaintiffs allege nothing more than that the Defendants breached their contracts with the Plaintiffs because the Defendants \"implicitly represented and warranted that they own the copyrights to the Song as licensed therein.\" (Compl. \u00b6 115.) The claims that there was a failure of consideration and a breach of promise both rely on the alleged misrepresentation that the Defendants have a copyright. Accordingly, the breach of contract claim in this case simply reframes the single question presented in this litigation, that is, whether the Defendants' copyright is valid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WSOF\n   </em>\n   at 30-31 (breach of contract claim preempted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   c.

For example, the fourth and sixth verse from the 1940 Lyrics are absent in subsequent iterations. In the 1945 Lyrics, there are changes to every verse compared to the 1940 Lyrics, and the fifth verse in the 1945 Lyrics is almost entirely new.

The Richmond Organization, Inc., et. al\n    </em>\n    , No. 16-cv-02725-DLC (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2016) (slip op) (\"\n    <em>\n     WSOF\n    </em>\n    \"). Like the Plaintiffs here, the plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     WSOF\n    </em>\n    brought state law claims for alleged deceptive acts and practices under New York Gen. Bus. Law (\"GBL\") \u00a7 349 (Count 3), Breach of Contract (Count 4), Money Had and Received (Count 5), and Rescission (Count 6). As here, plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     WSOF\n    </em>\n    also brought a claim for a Declaratory Judgment regarding the validity of Defendants' copyright in the song \"We Shall Overcome\" (Count 1), and a separate claim for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, seeking to prevent Defendants' claim to ownership of copyrights in the song and restitution for licensees (Count 2). Plaintiffs in both cases are represented by the same counsel, and the state law claims in both cases are substantively the same.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
