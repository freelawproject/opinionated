Eagles, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Ann Finch sued Covil Corporation and others for the wrongful death of her late husband, Franklin Finch, who died from mesothelioma caused by exposure to asbestos. She resolved or dismissed her claims against all defendants but Covil, and the case was tried from October 1 through October 5, 2018. The Court charged the jury on North Carolina state law negligence and failure to warn claims. The jury found Covil liable on both counts and returned an award of $32.7 million in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Covil asks the Court to set aside the jury verdict and grant it judgment as a matter of law, contending the plaintiff failed to present evidence sufficient to support the verdict on liability. In the alternative, Covil asks for a new trial based on the \"cumulative effect\" of purportedly erroneous evidentiary rulings and jury instructions, improper arguments by plaintiff's counsel to the jury, and the excessiveness of the jury's verdict. To the extent the Court denies its motion for a new trial on damages, Covil seeks remittitur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff presented a persuasive case on liability, proffering extensive direct and circumstantial evidence that Covil sold asbestos-containing products to the Firestone tire factory where Mr. Finch worked, at a time when it knew or should have known the products were dangerous to human health; that Covil did not provide pre- or post-sale warnings on or about its asbestos products; and that exposure to asbestos products sold by Covil was a proximate cause of Mr. Finch's fatal mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Covil's arguments about insufficiency of the evidence ignore evidence favorable to the plaintiff, and its assertions about evidentiary rulings mischaracterize the record. It contends the jury instructions failed to address the frequency, regularity, and\n   proximity of Mr. Finch's exposure to Covil's asbestos, but the instructions covered those factors as tailored to the evidence at trial. The plaintiff's closing arguments were grounded in the evidence, relevant, and not unfairly prejudicial, and nothing suggests that the jury's decision on liability was based on improper factors rather than a rational assessment of the strength of the plaintiff's evidence and the weakness of Covil's defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no reason to set aside the verdict on liability or to give Covil another bite of the apple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As to damages, the plaintiff presented an equally compelling case. Her evidence was uncontroverted that mesothelioma is incurable and is one of the most painful forms of cancer ; that after his diagnosis, Mr. Finch experienced eight months of debilitating pain, suffering, and embarrassment; and that Mr. Finch went through hospitalizations, surgeries, complications, a colostomy, and time in a nursing home before he died. Covil made no effort to undermine the plaintiff's evidence of the close relationships between Mr. Finch and his family, and the jury had plenary evidence to conclude that the loss of companionship to Mr. Finch's wife and adult children had substantial value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Though Covil did not emerge from this trial looking like a model corporate citizen and plaintiff's counsel did not pull any punches in her arguments that Covil should be held responsible for the harm caused by its negligence, the law does not require a plaintiff with the burden of proof to downplay the strength of her evidence or to sugarcoat the conduct of the defendant. The plaintiff's arguments were supported by the evidence, and Covil had a full and fair opportunity to challenge those arguments on the merits. The fact that Covil lost and the jury returned a large verdict is explained by the evidence, not by passion or prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court declines to substitute its judgment about an appropriate amount of damages for Mr. Finch's pain and suffering and the value of his companionship to his widow and three adult children for the reasoned judgment of the jury, as reflected in their unanimous verdict. Covil's motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Firestone built a tire manufacturing plant in Wilson, North Carolina, from 1973 to 1974. PTX 13 at 566-1; Doc. 499 at 124:7-10. Mr. Finch worked in the plant from 1975 until 1995, nearly all of which time he spent as a mold changer in the curing room. Doc. 497 at 131:4-132:4. On a daily basis, Mr. Finch worked on and around the tire presses in the curing room and the insulated steam pipes leading to and from the presses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140:14-150:23; Doc. 498 at 10:9-14:24, 144:14-146:16; Doc. 499 at 13:22-14:1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It was undisputed at trial that Covil sold virtually all of the insulation, including pipe insulation, used during construction of the Firestone plant, Doc. 499 at 124:7-10, 125:7-18; PTX 13 at 566-6, and\n   Covil's Rule 30(b)(6) witness,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   James Covil, testified via deposition that at least some of this insulation contained asbestos. Doc. 499 at 110:13-17, 126:17-127:4. In 1975, the EPA banned installation of asbestos-containing pipe insulation, so that any insulation installed or replaced after that date would not likely have contained asbestos. Doc. 498 at 126:13-127:7, 155:13-21. Over 7,000 feet of asbestos-containing pipe insulation remained in the plant 15 years after construction, when it was removed during an abatement project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156:10-14; PTX 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Covil did not produce any sales records showing how much, if any, of the pipe insulation it sold to Firestone was asbestos-free, contending the records were destroyed in a fire at its warehouse in 1973. Doc. 499 at 117:4-16. However, records obtained from Firestone included one 1974 invoice from Covil for 711 feet of \"Thermobestos,\" PTX 4, an asbestos-containing pipe insulation product.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Firestone receipt showed other insulation supplied by Covil--which the jury could have concluded contained asbestos\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   --was earmarked for use in the \"curing area\" where Mr. Finch worked. PTX 21 at 593.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Finch was healthy when he retired in 1996, and he ran a small lawn care business for many years thereafter. Doc. 498 at 193:11-194:15, 198: 7-11. He had three adult children who lived nearby, and he was actively present in their lives. Doc. 497 at 128:24-129:21. After his first wife died in 2009, Doc. 500 at 32:13-18, Mr. Finch remarried the plaintiff here, Ann Finch, in 2013, Doc. 497 at 128:1-4, and the evidence is undisputed that he was a loving and caring husband.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 500 at 40:24-41:3, 45:11-14. He was 78 years old when he was diagnosed with mesothelioma, and Mr. Finch was \"unusually healthy\" for his age up to that point. Doc. 498 at 157:20-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mesothelioma is a cancer that starts out in the layer of cells lining the lung or abdomen,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:18-94:1, 97:1-18, 100:20-101:12, and there is no dispute the disease is caused by inhaling asbestos fibers, which over time can result in cancerous tumors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 499 at 33:4-15, 50:24-51:10, 59:20-62:17. This process typically takes several decades, meaning a tumor does not develop until many years after a person is exposed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50:18-23, 59:20-24, 63:5-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mesothelioma is one of the most painful cancers because of the number of nerve endings in the lining around the lungs, Doc. 498 at 98:2-17, and there is no cure for the disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83:3-8. Mr. Finch died approximately 10 months after his diagnosis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:3-12, 165:5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court will address other facts as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Covil's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law under Rule 50(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Covil asks the Court to set aside the jury's verdict and enter judgment as a\n   matter of law in its favor. Covil makes three arguments in support of its request. First, Covil contends Ms. Finch \"failed to produce evidence that asbestos-containing pipe insulation provided by Covil was actually present in the Firestone plant.\" Doc. 505 at 5. Second, Covil asserts there was insufficient evidence that Mr. Finch was exposed to asbestos-containing products supplied by Covil, or of the \"actual amount\" of his exposure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Finally, Covil maintains the evidence at trial shows that \"any insulation products supplied by Covil that contained asbestos would have contained a warning as mandated by law,\" and that \"there was no evidence presented that an alternate warning would have had any effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the jury has returned a verdict for the plaintiff, a court may only grant judgment as a matter of law for the defendant \"if, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the [plaintiff] (and in support of the jury's verdict) and drawing every legitimate inference in that party's favor, the only conclusion a reasonable jury could have reached is one in favor of the moving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Ground Transp.\n   </em>\n   , 475 F.3d at 218-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Covil's assertions go to the strength of the evidence, not its sufficiency. Those contentions were rejected by the jury, and judgment as matter of law is not appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1306902\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/294/#p301\">\n    144 F.3d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301 (4th Cir. 1998) (noting that, unlike a motion for a new trial, it is not proper to weigh the evidence in resolving a motion for judgment as a matter of law, and the inquiry is limited to assessing legal sufficiency).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Presence of Asbestos Provided by Covil in the Firestone Plant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Finch presented more than sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that Covil supplied thousands of feet of asbestos-containing pipe insulation used in constructing the Firestone plant. Indeed, it was virtually undisputed that Covil sold all of the insulation used during the construction of the plant, Doc. 499 at 124:7-10, 125:7-21, that it was unlikely any asbestos-containing insulation had been added to the plant after its construction, Doc. 498 at 126:20-127:7, 155:13-21, and that, nearly 15 years later, over 7,000 feet of asbestos-containing pipe insulation was removed during an abatement project at the plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156:10-14; PTX 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Specifically, the plaintiff presented deposition testimony from Covil's Rule 30(b)(6) witness that Covil was the exclusive supplier of insulation to the Firestone plant during construction between 1973 and 1974 and that Covil supplied \"miles of insulation,\" including pipe insulation, to Firestone.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 499 at 110:13-17, 124:7-10, 125:7-21. This witness also testified that Covil \"supplied material for the plant, but everything did not have asbestos on it,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 126:17-127:14, thus admitting that at least some of this insulation contained asbestos. A Covil invoice showed the company shipped 711 feet of Thermobestos to the plant on a specific occasion in 1974, PTX 4; Doc. 499 at 124:12-125:4, and a Covil shipping order form listed other asbestos-containing insulation products as purchase options as late as 1982. PTX 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There were over 100 tire presses in the curing room of the Firestone plant. Doc. 497 at 136:23-137:15; Doc. 498 at 143:16-144:4. Each press had eight to ten external pipes, and most were wrapped with asbestos-containing\n   insulation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 498 at 15:7-15, 144:14-147:12, 232:16-24; Doc. 499 at 13:22-14:1. Evidence from Firestone established that \"all of the asbestos insulation\" used in the plant during construction was supplied by Covil, with the exceptions of insulation material sold with equipment like a tire press and \"a single job involving only six tire presses.\" Doc. 498 at 153:18-154:6; PTX 13 at 566-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 1990, 7437 feet of asbestos-containing material or pipe insulation was removed from the press area. Doc. 498 at 156:10-14; PTX 5. When asked \"why there could be so much asbestos-containing insulation was removed if Covil only installed asbestos-free insulation,\" Covil's 30(b)(6) witness testified \"I have no idea.\". Doc. 499 at 130:23-131:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nor did Covil present any sales records to rebut the inference that the insulation it sold to Firestone contained asbestos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 499 at 111:1-11, 115:4. Its 30(b)(6) witness testified that Covil's sales records \"relating to Firestone\" were \"pretty much wiped out\" in a fire at Covil's Greenville warehouse in May 1974,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 115:2-9, though after being shown some documents by plaintiff's counsel, he corrected the date of the fire to May 1973.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116:23-117:16. However, the plaintiff produced receipts showing that Covil supplied insulation to Firestone in 1974,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PTX 4, 20, and the witness confirmed that the company continued supplying insulation to Firestone into 1974. Doc. 499 at 124:7-10. Neither this witness nor any other evidence explained how a fire in May of 1973 destroyed documents from sales made after that date,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 117:19-24, or why documents from other Covil warehouses in Wilson and Greensboro, which also supplied materials to Firestone,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 120:21-121:1, were not available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dr. Holstein testified that the EPA banned the installation of asbestos-containing pipe covering in 1975. Doc. 498 at 126:20-127:7, 155:13-21. Another witness, Charles Ay, testified that repairs or replacements to insulation after the asbestos ban went into effect would have likely used asbestos-free alternatives. Doc. 499 at 178:5-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Over the years, mechanics and mold changers removed old pipe insulation as part of repairs and maintenance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:2-17, 167:12-168:1; Doc. 498 at 20:18-21:1, 150:6-152:12. Despite this removal and replacement, 7,437 feet of asbestos-containing pipe insulation connected to 67 tire presses remained in 1990, when it was removed during an asbestos-abatement project. PTX 5; Doc. 498 at 156:10-14; Doc. 499 at 126:17-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This evidence was easily sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that during construction of the Firestone plant, Covil sold asbestos-containing pipe insulation for use in the tire curing area. The evidence is also sufficient to support the inference that all or most of the asbestos-containing pipe insulation removed in 1990, plus much that had been removed during repairs and maintenance before that date, came from Covil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Covil highlights several composition tests conducted on insulation from the plant that showed asbestos concentrations inconsistent with the asbestos-containing pipe covering products allegedly supplied by Covil-Kaylo\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Thermobestos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 505 at 5-6 (citing Doc. 499 at 201:21-204:14, 204:25-206:9, 206:17-207:8, 211:9-215:4 (noting the tested materials were taken from curing presses, curing press \"platens\" and curing press \"trenches\")). However, there was a dispute as to whether these tests used insulation from inside\n   the tire presses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 497 at 143:2-144:3; Doc. 498 at 170:19-171:7, 225:12-19 (noting the platens were part of the presses), which Ms. Finch never contended was supplied by Covil,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 507 at 15, or insulation from outside the presses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PTX 13 at 566-6 (Firestone's confirmation that Covil supplied virtually all insulation that was not sold with equipment). Even assuming it came from outside the presses, Covil sold several types of insulation to the plant other than Thermobestos and Kaylo.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DTX 13. Based on this and other evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PTX 1, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the tested asbestos was supplied by Covil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exposure to Covil's Asbestos\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ms. Finch also presented sufficient evidence that Mr. Finch was exposed to asbestos in products sold by Covil to a sufficient degree to cause his mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Finch worked at the Firestone factory for about 20 years beginning in 1975, and he spent nearly all of his time as a mold changer in the curing room. Doc. 497 at 131:4-132:4. His primary responsibility was to place molds into tire presses and remove them after they had been cured into the shape of a tire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140:14-150:21. As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , there was plenary evidence to prove that the external pipes connected to almost all of the presses were covered with asbestos-containing insulation supplied by Covil when the plant was built, and Mr. Finch began working there barely a year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Finch worked in close proximity to the insulated pipes connected to the tire presses. He often walked on or bumped into the pipe insulation, causing it to release dust. Doc. 498 at 147:23-148:7, 149:14-150:1; Doc. 500 at 9:9-10:6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 498 at 147:13-22. Steam leaks or other problems with the pipes were common, Doc. 499 at 6:2-12, 167:12-168:1; Doc. 500 at 57:21-58:1, and mechanics or mold changers would fix these issues by removing the insulation, performing repairs, and reinsulating the pipes, then cleaning up any debris around the tire molds using compressed air.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 498 at 19:23-23:12, 150:4-151:24; Doc. 500 at 59:12-60:25. This was a \"very dusty process\" that caused \"air concentrations of asbestos\" to rise \"very high.\" Doc. 498 at 151:7-24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 499 at 168:9-13, 174:7-20. \"Daily\" for almost 20 years, Mr. Finch worked within ten feet of one of these mechanics, for minutes to hours each day. Doc. 498 at 22:10-17; 150:4-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The plaintiff's medical expert, Dr. Holstein, testified without contradiction that Mr. Finch's mesothelioma was caused by asbestos exposure \"beyond any reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107:18-23. He also testified that Mr. Finch's exposure to asbestos in the pipe insulation--which the evidence\n   shows was sold by Covil--was a \"substantial factor\" in causing his mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153:5-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Specifically, Dr. Holstein testified that Mr. Finch had \"daily occasions for breathing the dust from [the pipe insulation], and over the course of time, this amounted to a substantial inhalation of asbestos.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152:10-12. Assuming Mr. Finch's sole exposure to asbestos was to the pipe covering on steam lines leading to the tire presses, Dr. Holstein testified that this would be \"sufficient to cause malignant mesothelioma in human beings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152:18-153:4. Assuming Mr. Finch's exposure to the pipe covering external to the tire presses was one of multiple exposures, including exposure to asbestos inside the tire presses not provided by Covil,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 153:18-154:17, 157:6-13, Dr. Holstein concluded that exposure to the external pipe insulation would nonetheless be a \"substantial factor\" in the development of Mr. Finch's mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153:5-17. Dr. Holstein highlighted several epidemiological studies on workplace exposure to asbestos that informed his opinion about the cause of Mr. Finch's mesothelioma,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:16-61:12, including studies specifically on tire factory workers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:13-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This evidence was more than sufficient to support the jury's finding that Mr. Finch was exposed to asbestos-containing products supplied by Covil to a sufficient degree to cause his mesothelioma, and that this exposure was a proximate cause of his disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Covil next asserts that \"[t]here was no evidence regarding where in the gigantic Firestone plant this pipe insulation was installed.\" Doc. 505 at 6. This is inaccurate. Covil's 30(b)(6) witness admitted that Covil was the exclusive supplier of insulation to Firestone, Doc. 499 at 125:7-21, and the evidence was undisputed that Mr. Finch worked close to and frequently came into contact with pipe insulation outside the tire presses. As discussed in Section II.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , there was substantial evidence that this pipe insulation contained asbestos. Moreover, Ms. Finch introduced into evidence a receipt showing that hundreds of feet of Kaylo insulation supplied by Covil were earmarked for use in the \"curing area\" where Mr. Finch worked.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section I. The jury could reasonably conclude that this and other insulation contained asbestos, was supplied by Covil, and was present on or around the presses, in Mr. Finch's immediate work area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Covil maintains Ms. Finch \"failed to produce any evidence of any actual amount of decedent's exposure to asbestos from products supplied by Covil,\" and specifically, that her \"experts failed to present any individualized analysis of the level of exposure to decedent from products attributable to Covil.\" Doc. 505 at 6-7. As such, Covil contends she failed to adduce sufficient evidence of causation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   First, Covil misstates the applicable test. Although Ms. Finch was required to show that Mr. Finch's \"actual level of exposure\" to Covil's asbestos was sufficient to cause his mesothelioma, she was not required to quantify the \"actual amount\" of his exposure through an \"individualized analysis,\" as Covil contends.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [O]nly rarely are humans exposed to chemicals in a manner that permits a quantitative determination of adverse outcomes.... [I]t is usually difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the amount of exposure. Consequently, while precise information concerning the exposure necessary to cause specific harm to humans and exact details pertaining to the plaintiff's exposure are beneficial, such evidence is not always available, or necessary, to demonstrate that a substance is toxic to humans given substantial exposure and need not invariably provide the basis for an expert's opinion on causation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Westberry v.

May 30, 2015) (same under North Carolina law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, Covil inaccurately characterizes the record. As previously discussed in this section, the evidence showed Mr. Finch was exposed to asbestos-containing pipe insulation provided by Covil on a regular basis for many years, both as a bystander and through direct contact. Dr. Holstein testified that Mr. Finch's exposure to Covil's asbestos pipe insulation was at a level sufficient to cause his mesothelioma and was a substantial factor regardless of whether it was his sole exposure to asbestos or one of multiple exposures to different sources. Doc. 498 at 152:18-157:13. Dr. Arnold Brody, Ms. Finch's expert on cell biology and the experimental pathology of asbestos-related diseases, Doc. 499 at 30:24-31:5, testified that exposure of the degree and duration that Mr. Finch was likely exposed to Covil's asbestos was sufficient to cause his mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64:4-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There is no dispute in this case that Mr. Finch's mesothelioma was caused by exposure to asbestos; Ms. Finch's experts so testified, and Covil neither introduced evidence to the contrary nor argued to the contrary at trial. Moreover, Covil did not proffer expert testimony at trial on the issue of causation or otherwise. Covil presented its contentions about the plaintiff's evidence of exposure and causation to the jury,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 501 at 80-81, which was not required to accept Covil's inferences or arguments in the face of contrary evidence from the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Evidence on Failure to Warn Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Ms. Finch proffered more than sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find that Covil unreasonably failed to provide a warning on its asbestos-containing products and that this failure proximately caused Mr. Finch's mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Covil's 30(b)(6) witness testified that the company had information by the mid- to late-1960's that asbestos was hazardous and caused mesothelioma. Doc. 497 at 106:22-107:4, 118:4-8. Federal regulations were issued in 1971 explicitly stating that workplace asbestos exposure endangered the lives of employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119:5-24; Doc. 498 at 141:10-13. By 1972, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration required that companies selling asbestos-containing products, including asbestos pipe-covering like that Covil sold to Firestone, provide a warning label stating that the product was hazardous to health. Doc. 498 at 141:14-142:18. The president of Covil had copies of these regulations. Doc. 497 at 119:25-120:2. This evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that Covil knew asbestos was dangerous by 1973, when it started selling asbestos-containing pipe insulation\n   to Firestone.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Of the Firestone workers whose testimony was offered at trial, the earliest any could remember being warned of the dangers of asbestos was the mid- to late-1980's, and those who were warned received their warning from Firestone, not from Covil. Doc. 498 at 138:6-17; Doc. 500 at 16:10-22, 61:3-23. Mr. Finch testified via deposition\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he was not informed of the dangers of asbestos until 2010 at the earliest, Doc. 498 at 192:17-24, years after his retirement from Firestone in 1995. Doc. 497 at 131:4-6. He also told the jury that he noticed warnings on several pieces of equipment in the Firestone plant, including a warning on the tire presses to \"beware of moving parts,\" but that he did not see any warnings about \"dangerous chemicals or solvents or material,\" or about asbestos specifically. Doc. 498 at 227:10-228:2; Doc. 499 at 10:17-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Covil's 30(b)(6) witness testified that he never saw any documents suggesting that Covil had developed a safety protocol for working with asbestos-containing insulation. Doc. 497 at 111:14-17. He also stated that the earliest document indicating any warnings were being given to anyone was from 1989,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 112:23-113:7, some fourteen years after Mr. Finch began working around the asbestos products Covil sold to Firestone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Covil has pointed to no direct evidence in the record that it provided asbestos warnings with any of the insulating products it sold to Firestone. Rather, it points to circumstantial evidence it contends shows that \"the products supplied by Covil,\n   <em>\n    if they contained asbestos\n   </em>\n   , would have included a statutorily required warning.\" Doc. 505 at 2 (emphasis added). Covil highlights the testimony of Ms. Finch's expert, Mr. Ay, that OSHA regulations from the early 1970's required asbestos manufacturers to put a warning on the packaging of asbestos-containing materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (citing Doc. 499 at 187:4-9). This evidence is not strong enough to require a verdict in Covil's favor, especially since there was other evidence supporting a contrary inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Covil presented no witness or documentary evidence to show that Covil sold insulation packaged in compliance with these regulations. Covil's 30(b)(6) witness testified that the earliest document indicating any warnings were being given to anyone was from 1989. Doc. 497 at 112:23-113:7. Mr. Finch testified that Firestone conveyed warnings on other products in the plant, Doc. 498 at 227:13-228:2; Doc. 499 at 10:17-25, but neither he nor any other witness ever saw warnings on insulation. Because Firestone conveyed other warnings, the lack of any warning on insulation supports the inference that Covil never provided any warnings at the time of sale. Nor did Covil produce any evidence that it took any steps to convey appropriate warnings to Firestone, Mr. Finch, or other Firestone workers after the sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yates v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:12-CV-752-FL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202189774\">\n    2015 WL 2189774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (E.D.N.C. May 11, 2015) (collecting cases and suggesting North Carolina courts would likely impose a continuing, post-sale duty to warn on asbestos suppliers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Covil next asserts that \"there was no evidence presented that an alternative warning would have had any effect.\" Doc. 505 at 5. However, Covil ignores Mr. Finch's testimony that he followed the safety regulations at Firestone \"as best as\n   ... it was possible for [him] to do,\" Doc. 498 at 190:3-9, and his recollection of specific warnings on equipment at the plant tends to support this.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 227:10-228:2. The medical evidence was that \"the more a person is exposed to [asbestos], the more likely it is that\" it will cause mesothelioma. Doc. 499 at 63:21-25. This evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that Mr. Finch would have heeded warnings about the dangers of asbestos if Covil had provided them, and that a pre- or post-sale warning \"could have been effective in preventing or alleviating\" Mr. Finch's mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202189774\">\n    2015 WL 2189774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Covil does not point to any countervailing evidence on this point in its briefing, and even if there was such evidence, the jury was not required to accept it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Relatedly, Covil also appears to contend that alternate warnings (or any warnings at all) on its products would not have had any effect because \"Firestone knew it had asbestos-containing materials in its plant and did nothing to warn its employees of any danger.\" Doc. 505 at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 510 at 2 (\"The fact that the manufacturer's warning did not reach Mr. Finch was beyond Covil's control.\"). Covil seems to assume that Firestone's failure to convey warnings it received from others to Firestone employees would relieve Covil of liability. However, in North Carolina, the seller of a product generally does not discharge its duty to directly warn a reasonably foreseeable user or claimant by warning an intermediary such as Firestone, with one specific statutory exception that does not apply here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 99B-5(a), (c). North Carolina does not appear to have adopted the \"sophisticated user\" defense, whereby a manufacturer is absolved of any duty to warn employees directly when a product is sold to an employer who is aware of its dangers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Willis v.

Covil's counsel zealously advocated his client's position at trial, but Covil's evidence and inferences were not compelling, and a defense verdict was far from \"the only conclusion a reasonable jury could reach.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Ground Transp.\n   </em>\n   , 475 F.3d at 218-19.

Covil challenges several of the Court's rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The plaintiff offered into evidence deposition testimony from Covil's 30(b)(6) witness that he believed the company stopped selling asbestos-containing products in 1973.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 497 at 113:16-24, 115:20-24. Covil contends this evidence was irrelevant and impermissible character evidence and that the prejudice to Covil substantially outweighed its probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   However, this evidence was relevant to show that Covil sold asbestos-containing products at some point in 1973, when construction on the Firestone plant began. That is, by testifying that Covil stopped selling asbestos products at some point in 1973, the witness implicitly admitted that Covil sold asbestos products up to that point. This was particularly relevant because Covil's counsel had asserted in his opening statement that the manufacturer of Kaylo stopped including asbestos in that product in 1972, supporting his contention that the Kaylo that Covil supplied to Firestone from the manufacturer did not contain asbestos.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94:25-95:18. The plaintiff had the burden to prove that Covil sold asbestos-containing products used at the Firestone plant where Mr. Finch worked, and the 30(b)(6) testimony helped prove that Covil sold such products in 1973.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Evidence that Covil claimed to stop selling asbestos products around the time that asbestos became heavily regulated,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C, was also relevant to show that Covil had knowledge of the dangerousness of asbestos when it sold products to Firestone and was probative of whether Covil should have provided warnings then and later. Covil denied that it was negligent and denied it had a duty to warn, and this evidence was relevant to assessing Covil's duty of care and whether it breached that duty by selling asbestos at all or selling it without a warning--central elements of the plaintiff's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Covil contends the plaintiff used this testimony as improper character evidence because the plaintiff also introduced evidence that Covil continued to sell asbestos-containing products after 1973, and she highlighted the inconsistency to the jury. Doc. 505 at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PTX 4; Doc. 497 at 114:11-16; Doc. 501 at 32:2-15. But by offering testimony from Covil's Rule 30(b)(6) witness that Covil stopped selling asbestos in 1973, the plaintiff was not bound by that evidence. She was entitled to show that this testimony was inconsistent with other evidence that Covil did, in fact, sell asbestos-containing products to Firestone after 1973, which was highly relevant to her case. It was not improper for the plaintiff to point out this inconsistency\n   to convince the jury not to find this aspect of the 30(b)(6) testimony credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Such contrary evidence was particularly relevant in light of Covil's defense. The plaintiff presented an invoice showing Covil sold 711 feet of asbestos-containing insulation to the plant.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section I. Covil conceded this sale at trial, Doc. 497 at 94:1-6, but it otherwise denied the insulation it sold contained asbestos,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:20-94:18, 94:25-95:18, contended there was no evidence of where the small amount of asbestos it supplied was installed, and asserted Mr. Finch's mesothelioma was solely caused by asbestos from other sources.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98:6-23. The plaintiff was allowed to rebut these contentions with other admissible evidence showing Covil sold more asbestos-containing pipe insulation than it was admitting and to attempt to persuade the jury in closing argument that Mr. Covil's testimony that Covil stopped selling asbestos products in 1973 was inaccurate. Plaintiff's counsel gave Mr. Covil an opportunity to address the contrary documentary evidence, which was substantial, and he failed to do so in any convincing way.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 116:7-117:15; Doc. 499 at 130:23 -131:1. The fact that this evidence also made Covil \"look bad\" in some general sense does not make it inadmissible character evidence or unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403. It was highly relevant and its probative value outweighed the minimal possibility of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Covil also asserts that the \"Court improperly forced [it] to stipulate to portions of Dwaine Waters' testimony.\" Doc. 505 at 10. This is not an accurate characterization of the record, which shows that the Court consistently deferred a final ruling so that it could make an appropriate Rule 403 evaluation and that Covil made a tactical decision to stipulate to part of Mr. Waters' testimony in order to keep out the most harmful aspects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Mr. Waters was a Covil insulator in the 1970's. Doc. 499 at 144:15-17. He testified in a deposition that Covil supplied asbestos-containing Kaylo pipe insulation in boxes labeled \"asbestos-free\" to certain worksites other than Firestone around the time his daughter was born, Doc. 306-5 at 17-20 p. 527:6-536:3, which apparently was in 1977. Doc. 433 at 2 n.1 (citing Doc. 433-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   To prevail at trial, Ms. Finch had to prove that Covil supplied asbestos-containing insulation to Firestone and that Mr. Finch was exposed to this insulation to a sufficient degree to cause his mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A-B. Mr. Waters' testimony was relevant for at least two reasons. First, it was relevant to the disputed issue of whether Covil sold asbestos without adequate warnings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, if Covil was still selling asbestos pipe insulation in 1977, this made it more probable Covil was selling asbestos products when the Firestone plant was constructed in 1973 and 1974 and that the pipe insulation Covil supplied to the plant, in fact, contained asbestos. On the other hand, Mr. Waters' testimony raised concerns about unfair prejudice under Rule 403 because, as the Court explained at one point, \"his testimony is not just that [Covil was] continuing to sell asbestos, it is that [Covil was] doing it in a deceptive manner,\" Doc. 499 at 70:8-19, and because its probative value was difficult to ascertain until Covil's defense took shape at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 497 at\n   28:2-8 (noting it would be less relevant \"if the defendant is not actually denying what the plaintiff is trying to rebut.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The admissibility of Mr. Waters' testimony came up before trial when Covil sought to exclude the testimony in a motion in limine. Doc. 391 at \u00b6 1; Doc. 394 at 1-3. The Court tentatively granted Covil's motion, but it noted that Mr. Waters' testimony might be admissible if Covil asserted in its opening statement or introduced evidence suggesting that it stopped using asbestos-containing products in 1973. Doc. 484 at 4-5. At this point, the plaintiff could not use Mr. Waters' testimony without bringing the matter to the Court's attention outside the presence of the jury. Doc. 484 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In opening statements, Covil's counsel did not contend that Covil stopped selling asbestos products in 1973. As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , he admitted Covil sold 711 feet of Thermobestos to the Firestone plant, but he focused on the absence of documentary evidence showing where in the plant that insulation was used or showing that any other insulation sold by Covil contained asbestos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 497 at 93:20-94:18 (noting as to the Kaylo that \"there simply isn't any documentary evidence of yes, it did, no, it did not [contain asbestos]. There's no boxes.\"). Covil's counsel also asserted that the manufacturer of Kaylo stopped including asbestos in that product in 1972 and that much of the Kaylo sold by Covil was delivered directly from the manufacturer, supporting Covil's contention that the Kaylo did not contain asbestos.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94:25-95:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Thereafter, the admissibility of Mr. Waters' testimony came up twice again during the trial. Neither time was in connection with a clear proffer by the plaintiff of his testimony, and each time the Court declined to issue a final ruling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:17-25, 30:22-31:22; Doc. 499 at 79:8-12. Its relevance was (and is) readily apparent given Covil's position on the lack of evidence in its opening statement, but the degree of relevance remained uncertain and the possibility of unfair prejudice to Covil was real, as the Court explicitly recognized.

The Court unambiguously qualified that this was \"not a final decision,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 81:13-82:2, and noted some of the ways the probative value of the testimony might outweigh its prejudicial effect, depending on Covil's evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:5-12, 81:13-82:2. At no time did the Court make any sort of final ruling admitting Mr. Waters' testimony, nor did it state that his testimony absolutely would be admissible in certain situations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Covil stipulated that Mr. Waters \"testified that throughout the '70's and as late as 1977, Covil continued to sell some asbestos-containing Kaylo-type covering insulation.\" Doc. 499 at 144:10-18;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 140:19-141:11. As part of this stipulation, the plaintiff did not offer Mr. Waters' testimony that the asbestos-containing products were sold in boxes marked \"asbestos-free.\" Covil then continued to develop evidence to support its contention that the insulation it sold to Firestone largely did not contain asbestos, including cross-examining the plaintiff's expert Mr. Ay about when the manufacturer stopped including asbestos in Kaylo.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 188:2-17;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 201:21-204:14, 204:25-206:11, 206:17-207:8, 211:9-215:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court never held, as Covil contends, \"that Mr. Waters' testimony was otherwise admissible unless Covil stipulated.\" Doc. 505 at 10. Indeed, during the discussion shortly before Covil stipulated, the Court stated at least seven times that\n   its leanings on the issue--\n   <em>\n    which at that point were favorable to Covil\n   </em>\n   --were tentative. Doc. 499 at 78:18-24, 79:8-12, 80:4-5, 81:2-4, 81:13-17, 19-25, 82:1-2. The Court refused to give Covil's counsel an advance ruling on admissibility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81:19-25 (\"You're not entitled to evidentiary rulings in advance of my having a full and complete understanding of the relevance so that I can weigh that against the potential for unfair prejudice.

Covil may not recast its strategic decision as an error by the Court or as grounds for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, Covil contends the Court improperly excluded evidence that the company ceased all operations in 1991. Doc. 505 at 9-10. Neither in the transcript pages Covil cites nor elsewhere did the Court exclude any such evidence; the Court merely held that counsel for Covil could not mention in opening statements that the company closed in 1991 if it had no evidence to support it. Doc. 497 at 43:2-8, 44:8-15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 103(a) (requiring a \"\n   <em>\n    ruling\n   </em>\n   to admit or exclude evidence\" for a party to claim error (emphasis added)). The Court made no ruling to exclude evidence on this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Indeed, the Court stated it did not \"have any problem\" with such evidence, Doc. 497 at 44:14-16, 23-24, which Covil intended to use to explain why it would not have a live corporate representative testify at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:12-18. The Court noted that \"there would need to be a great deal of care taken\" with such evidence because it might indicate to the jury that \"there is nobody to hold responsible,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:14-19, and that it might open the door to normally inadmissible evidence to rebut this inference.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:18-45:5. Covil apparently made a strategic decision not to offer this evidence. It cannot now blame the Court that the evidence was not before the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In any event, none of these claimed errors are grounds for a new trial. Ms. Finch's evidence on liability was not only adequate to support the verdict, it was substantial, credible, and persuasive. Covil's evidence, on the other hand, was not particularly persuasive, and its own corporate representative was unable to disagree with the plaintiff's strongest evidence that the pipe insulation Covil sold contained asbestos.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A-C (discussing the relevant evidence on liability). Covil never contended that asbestos was a safe product, much less offered evidence in support of that view, and it offered no expert testimony to undermine the plaintiff's evidence on causation. Even if the Court did err in admitting or excluding evidence, any such error was harmless and does not warrant a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

To obtain a new trial based on improper statements by counsel, there must be a \"reasonable probability\" that the argument improperly influenced the jury in reaching its verdict by effectively subverting the jury's reason or its commitment to decide the issues based on the evidence and the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Minter v.

But this argument was supported by rational inferences from the evidence. Covil supplied all insulation used during construction of the Firestone plant, not just pipe insulation.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A-B; DTX 13. A 1982 order form showed Covil sold asbestos-containing insulation other than Thermobestos or Kaylo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX 1 (listing \"Asbestos Cloth\" and \"Asbestos Cement,\" among other asbestos-containing products), and tests of certain materials at the plant showed asbestos concentrations inconsistent with Thermobestos and Kaylo insulation.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A. This chain of evidence supports the inference that\n   Covil sold other insulation to the plant with \"varying different amounts of asbestos,\" and thus, the argument was not improper. Moreover, counsel did not assert, as Covil maintains, that \"all materials provided by Covil contained asbestos.\" Doc. 505 at 12. Her argument was that, if asbestos insulation was in the plant that was not supplied separately with equipment such as the tire presses, it likely came from Covil, even if it wasn't Thermobestos or Kaylo.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 501 at 92:12-93:24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Covil also objected to counsel's argument that Covil destroyed sales records, asserting that there was no evidence to support it. However, as the Court ruled contemporaneously, this was a permissible inference from the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96:6-18. Covil said the records were destroyed in a fire, but neither Covil's 30(b)(6) witness nor any other witness or evidence explained how a fire in May of 1973 in Greenville could destroy documents from sales made after that date or from sales made from other warehouses.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A. The inference argued by counsel was relevant to show Covil's awareness of its negligence, to provide context for why the plaintiff had not proffered more robust documentary evidence, and to address Covil's contention that the absence of documentary evidence meant the plaintiff could not prove her case. Covil's contention that counsel's argument was inconsistent with a pre-trial ruling denying spoliation sanctions was not raised as part of Covil's objection at trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 501 at 96:15-16, and in any event mischaracterizes the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As to the remaining parts of plaintiff's closing arguments to which Covil did not object, Covil's belated complaints are also without merit, either because Covil's characterization of the argument is inaccurate, the arguments were not improper, or the argument could not rationally have caused prejudice to Covil. The Court need not address each such contention, and a few examples suffice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   While plaintiff's counsel did express personal opinions from time to time during closing arguments and during trial,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 501 at 44:21-25, 69:16-20, defense counsel occasionally did the same thing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 499 at 188:10-16, and the Court repeatedly instructed the jury that the statements and opinions of the lawyers are not evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 499 at 182:16-21; Doc. 501 at 24:14-22, 113:8-9, 114:20-115:2. \"[J]uries are presumed to follow their instructions,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Second, Covil did not object at trial to any of the statements identified for the first time in its reply brief, making its current objection twice-belated.

The disease in this case was mesothelioma, not asbestosis, and the undisputed medical testimony demonstrated the significance of this distinction to assessing the level of exposure required to produce each disease. Dr. Holstein testified without contradiction that asbestosis \"is characterized by scar[r]ing in the lungs\" or the \"pleura, which is the lining around the lung,\" due to inhaling asbestos. Doc. 498 at 87:14-20, 89:6-9. Asbestosis starts \"at the bottom of the lungs, and with increasing severity, it can creep upwards to affect the upper parts of the lungs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87:21-25. Dr. Holstein stated that the characteristic scar tissue in asbestosis is \"caused by the asbestos sitting [in the lung] for decades\" and develops \"gradual[ly] and very slow[ly].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88:4-7. Dr. Holstein explicitly testified that asbestosis is \"not cancer,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 89:6-7, and that it is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94:14-95:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Mesothelioma, in contrast, is a \"cancer that starts out in\" the lining around the lung--the pleura--or, in Mr. Finch's case, in the \"lining in the abdomen that is very similar to the pleural lining,\" called the peritoneum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:22-94:1, 97:1-18, 100:20-101:6. Dr. Arnold Brody, the plaintiff's expert on cell biology and the experimental pathology of asbestos-related diseases, Doc. 499 at 30:24-31:5, testified at length about the specific processes whereby inhaled asbestos fibers come into contact with cells on the pleura, causing them to become tumorous and develop into mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:19-22, 33:4-15, 34:6-63:25. Specifically, he testified that asbestos fibers can cause DNA damage to mesothelial cells on the pleura.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60:1-12. Cells with DNA damage \"typically die\" but sometimes survive and pass down the defect through cell division and subdivision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60:13-62:13. Although one DNA error is not sufficient to cause cancer, further asbestos exposure can cause additional errors in the damaged cells.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:13-63:4. Scientists do not know how many, or which, DNA errors are required to cause cancer, but \"the more [errors] you get, the more likely it is that cancer will develop.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62:14-23. This process typically takes several decades, meaning a tumor does not develop until many years after a person is exposed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50:18-23, 59:23-24, 63:5-15. Dr. Brody testified that, while a \"single [asbestos] fiber is not sufficient to cause mesothelioma, ... a single fiber can cause genetic error .... [T]he more a person is exposed to it, the more likely it is that these events occur, because every time fibers are added, it makes it more likely that a fiber is going to be available to cause genetic damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63:16-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The uncontradicted expert testimony in this case thus demonstrated that mesothelioma and asbestosis are different diseases whose development requires asbestos exposure of a different nature and degree. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Lohrmann\n   </em>\n   suggests that trial courts are precluded from tailoring jury instructions on causation to the disease-specific evidence produced in individual cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The jury returned a verdict of $32.7 million. Doc. 489.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Covil does not challenge the Court's instructions on damages. Rather, it relies on the same claims of evidentiary error and improper arguments by plaintiff's counsel to assert that the jury's damage award was excessive and inflamed by passion or prejudice. It asks the Court to either set aside the verdict entirely in favor of a new trial, Doc. 505 at 15-19, or, in the alternative, to order a remittitur to $2,000,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Court in its discretion finds that Covil has not met its burden to show that the jury's verdict was excessive, that it was rendered under the influence of passion or prejudice, or that the jury did not follow the Court's instructions. While the verdict was large, the plaintiff's evidence on damages was compelling and virtually uncontradicted. The jury was attentive during the trial, and Covil had a full and fair opportunity to present its evidence and make its arguments. As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.1-2, the evidence and arguments to which Covil objects were not improper; nor were they of a nature to inspire a jury to base its verdict on passion or prejudice rather than evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In a case such as this involving no significant items of measurable economic loss, \"translating legal damage into money damages ... is a matter peculiarly within a jury's ken.\"\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v.

Doc. 505 at 9-12, 15-19. In its reply brief, Covil focused in more detail on the admission of what it called improper character evidence, Doc. 510 at 4-6, and raised new objections to additional parts of the plaintiff's closing argument,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, in support of its contention that the verdict was excessive as a result of passion or prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-11. Finally, Covil contends that the amount of the verdict is out of line with other wrongful death verdicts. Doc. 505 at 19-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   None of these arguments is sufficient to establish that the jury's verdict was excessive, based on passion or prejudice, or that the jury misapplied the Court's instructions. Any errors or improper argument were minor, and nothing in the record indicates the jury did not follow the law or apply it to the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   As discussed in\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.1-2, the Rule 30(b)(6) testimony and evidence contradicting it were not impermissible character evidence, and the closing arguments by plaintiff's counsel were grounded in the evidence, relevant, and not unduly prejudicial. By its very nature, a plaintiff's negligence claim focuses on whether the defendant has breached a duty and behaved unreasonably, and all evidence which proves liability is prejudicial to some extent or it would not be relevant. There is no unfair prejudice from evidence properly admitted or from argument supported by reasonable inferences from such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   It is true that counsel for the plaintiff spoke strongly about Covil's negligence, as is often the case in closing arguments about fault and credibility. But it is not improper to make a closing argument which aggressively and persuasively identifies the evidence supporting a finding of\n   negligence and responds to the arguments and contentions of the other side disputing liability. The plaintiff was entitled to direct the jury's attention to evidence favorable to the plaintiff's case and to link Covil's negligence to the damages incurred. Nowhere did plaintiff's counsel ask the jury to award a large amount in damages as a punishment for Covil's inaccurate testimony about when it stopped selling asbestos. Indeed, counsel several times reminded the jury that the purpose of money damages was not to punish. Doc. 501 at 68:9-14, 71:10-11;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:2-5 (arguing that \"the law here doesn't ever ask the question, how much should Covil pay,\" but rather, \"what are the losses worth for this family\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The Court also instructed the jury that the purpose of damages was to make injured persons whole, not to punish negligent actors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113:16-21. There is nothing to indicate that these arguments on liability caused the jury to render a damages verdict based on passion or prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   To the extent Covil contends that the \"cumulative impact\" of minor errors inflamed the passion or prejudice of the jury,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 510 at 7, this argument is also without merit. The \"cumulative impact\" argument \"does not exist as a last-ditch, dump-truck tactic to avoid an unfavorable verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Milwaukee Elec. Tool Corp. v. Snap-On Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523221\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/288/872/#p897\">\n    288 F. Supp. 3d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 897 (E.D. Wis. 2017). To prevail, Covil must provide a \"logical bridge connecting the errors and an explanation as to how they affected the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523221\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/288/872/#p897\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here as in\n   <em>\n    Snap-On\n   </em>\n   , Covil has provided no such bridge. At root, Covil is merely challenging the size of the award. As North Carolina law makes clear, this is insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Covil does not assert that the jury speculated in reaching its verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, it would be difficult to do so in this case, which involved substantial evidence of intangible and non-economic damages. It is impossible to offer any hard evidence of the dollar amounts related to pain and suffering or of the value of the companionship, advice, and guidance of a father and husband. By definition, these damages are not subject to hard and fast calculations, and, as discussed in\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.1, any effort to quantify such emotional losses is unlikely to be admissible. During closing argument, plaintiff's counsel acknowledged the difficulties inherent in this decision and did nothing to encourage the jury to speculate. To the contrary, she repeatedly linked her damages arguments to the Court's instructions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc 501 at 67:16-22. In the circumstances of this case, a verdict of $32.7 million is no more speculative than a verdict of $2 million, which Covil suggests as a remittitur without any explanation as to how that amount is linked in any specific way to the evidence in this case. Doc. 505 at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Covil contends it is proper to look to damages awards in other wrongful death cases to determine whether the award in this case is excessive and that an analysis of awards in comparable cases suggests that the award here is excessive and warrants remittitur. Doc. 505 at 19-22. Covil cites no North Carolina decision that has ever compared the verdict in the case under consideration to verdict amounts in other cases to evaluate whether the damages award was excessive, and this approach has been the subject of extensive\n   scholarly debate\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and disagreement between courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   There are good reasons to think that North Carolina would not adopt a comparative-verdict approach. For one, the North Carolina Supreme Court has emphasized the need to give deference to trial judges on the excessiveness determination because of \"their active participation in the trial, their first-hand acquaintance with the evidence presented, their observances of the parties, the witnesses, the jurors and the attorneys involved, and their knowledge of various other attendant circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Worthington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8571152\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/305/478/#p482\">\n    305 N.C. at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=290%20S.E.2d%20599\">\n    290 S.E.2d at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court's reasoning for deferring to the trial court is inconsistent with a comparability review, at which the appellate court would be just as competent as the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Relatedly, North Carolina courts consistently emphasize the need to base the excessiveness determination on record evidence in the case at bar.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8899246\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/164/578/#p581\">\n    164 N.C.

This is similar to the approach of other state courts that reject comparative-verdict analysis as inconsistent with particularized justice and insensitive to the factual differences between and among cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   While the comparability approach gives the appearance of an objective counterweight to the jury's subjective analysis of intangible losses, that appearance is often illusory. As the briefing in this case shows, it is not easy to define which cases are comparable and it is even harder to locate\n   them for comparison. A comparison is only helpful if the cases are comparable, yet the information available in a reported decision is often incomplete or non-specific. Many verdicts are not reflected in reported decisions, and settlements amounts, which would also seem relevant in a comparability analysis, are opaque and even more difficult to obtain. But even if the Court had a comprehensive list of comparable cases, factual differences would still exist, and evaluating the significance of those differences would raise its own challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Here, it is not clear that the North Carolina verdicts identified by Covil, Doc. 505 at 20, were rendered in cases comparable to this one, as Covil provides no details for most cases, and for others, the period of pain and suffering was substantially shorter and the family relationships were different. Reviewing verdicts in mesothelioma cases from other states,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 521-2, would require the Court to evaluate whether the law on damages is different in a way that might have affected the verdict and to review scores of pages of materials from other trials to determine if the evidence was similar and the damages were \"comparable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 521-3 through 521-21. The Court declines this invitation and concludes in its discretion that a comparative approach would not be beneficial here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The Court also declines Covil's implicit invitation to rely on its gut reaction to the size of the verdict based on its experience.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 505 at 15-18. Such subjective reactions by the presiding judge are no more reliable, accurate, or non-speculative than the jury's considered judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8570074\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/286/664/#p673\">\n    286 N.C. at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=213%20S.E.2d%20342\">\n    213 S.E.2d at 348-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the assessment of wrongful death damages \"must, to a large extent, be left to the good sense and fair judgment of the jury.\"). To the extent the Court's subjective reaction is appropriate to consider, this case is a far cry from the case relied upon by Covil,\n   <em>\n    Scagnelli v. Whiting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521755\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/554/77/\">\n    554 F. Supp. 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D.N.C. 1982). There, the size of the verdict \"shocked the conscience of the Court\" in light of the plaintiff's thin evidence on damages and the defendant's \"strong and largely uncontroverted\" evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521755\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/554/77/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521755\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/554/77/\">\n    at 80-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast, the size of the verdict may have been a bit surprising, but, upon reflection, it was not shocking given the strength of the plaintiff's evidence and the weaknesses of Covil's defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Conclusion on Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   The verdict in this case was sizable, but the plaintiff's evidence on damages was compelling and virtually uncontradicted. Covil has not met its burden to show that the jury's verdict was excessive, that it was rendered under the influence of passion or prejudice, or that the jury did not follow the law. The Court's judgment about damages is no more accurate or reasonable than the jury's evaluation, and Covil's suggested remittitur amount is not tethered to any evidence in this case. Covil did not challenge the plaintiff's evidence on pain and suffering or loss of companionship and chose not to address damages in any substantive way in its arguments to the jury. Covil is not entitled to another trial on damages or to remittitur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The plaintiff presented evidence that was more than sufficient to support the jury's finding that Covil sold asbestos-containing insulation products to the Firestone plant at a time when it knew those products were dangerous to human health,\n   that Covil did not warn users then or thereafter of those dangers, that Mr. Finch worked in close proximity to this pipe covering for many years on a daily basis, under circumstances which created asbestos dust, and that this exposure caused his mesothelioma and death. Covil is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   The plaintiff's evidence from Covil's Rule 30(b)(6) witness and the evidence contradicting it were relevant and not unduly prejudicial, and Covil had a full and fair opportunity to contest this evidence at trial. The Court did not \"force\" Covil to stipulate to portions of Mr. Waters' testimony, nor did it exclude any evidence of when Covil went out of business, and Covil may not attribute those strategic decisions to the Court. The plaintiff's closing argument was based on the evidence and was not unfair to Covil. The jury reasonably chose to believe the plaintiff's persuasive evidence on liability as opposed to Covil's less persuasive defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Finally, the damages award was not excessive given the evidence. Covil has not persuaded the Court that the jury was inflamed by passion or prejudice, and the Court is not obligated to compare the value this jury assigned to Mr. Finch's pain and suffering and his family's loss to the value other juries assigned in different cases. Mr. Finch endured months of pain and suffering from an incurable disease, including several hospitalizations, surgery and other procedures, numerous complications, and an airlift to another hospital, among other hardships. He had a colostomy bag for months that caused him embarrassment and limited his activities and his participation in church and family events. He endured a prolonged and painful illness and treatment. His adult children lost an affectionate father who was involved in their lives daily, and his wife lost a loving and romantic husband after only a few years of marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   While the amount of the verdict is unquestionably large, the damages were unquestionably large. Weighing the value of a man's pain and suffering and the loss of his companionship to his family are tasks best left to a jury, composed of individuals who bring diverse perspectives from the community and scores of years of life experience to the table, and who act as a unit after deliberating and evaluating the evidence together. Legal training is of little help to these tasks, and even decades of experience as a trial judge does not make a court of one \"better\" than a jury at determining non-economic wrongful death damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8570074\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/286/664/#p673\">\n    286 N.C. at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=213%20S.E.2d%20342\">\n    213 S.E.2d at 348-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Having heard all the evidence, observed the witnesses, listened to the arguments, and monitored the jury throughout, the Court finds that the verdict was not based on passion or prejudice and that the jury did not disregard the law.
