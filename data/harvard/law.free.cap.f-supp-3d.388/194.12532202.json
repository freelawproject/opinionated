Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Sinmyah Amera Ceasar (\"Ceasar\" or \"Defendant\") pled guilty to (1) conspiring to provide material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (\"ISIL\" or \"ISIS\"), designated by our government as a foreign terrorist organization, and (2) obstruction of an official proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Extensive sentencing hearings were conducted. The parties filed briefs and provided the court with more than 1,000 pages of exhibits. Over the course of three days, the court heard testimony from five experts. Defendant's half-brother submitted a letter in support of his sibling. She spoke at length on her own behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant had a traumatic life: Now 24 years old, she is a survivor of serious sexual, physical, and emotional trauma. Her father abused her sexually. Her mother's limiting physical conditions prevented her care of Ceasar, so Defendant was repeatedly shifted from foster care placement to foster care placement, and abused continuously along the way. Her three husbands were each physically and emotionally abusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Identifying as Muslim, as a young adult, Ceasar sought acceptance with an organization advocating violence and destruction in the United States and other parts of the world: ISIL. She connected individuals in the United States with individuals affiliated with ISIL and posted propaganda for ISIL online. She planned to travel to ISIL territory and to join the organization there. Subsequent to her guilty plea for conspiracy to provide material support, when on presentence release because of health problems, Ceasar engaged in similar conduct, lied to the government about it, and deleted records of her communications favoring ISIL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Against this backdrop of aiding ISIL, under federal penal jurisprudence, the court considers general and specific deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and punishment. She is sentenced to a total of 48 months of incarceration-about 28 months already served while she awaited sentencing in jail. Incarceration is to be followed by eight years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The sentence is designed to ensure that (1) the public is adequately protected from ISIL and organizations like it, (2) Ceasar is punished for her dangerous criminal conduct, and (3) her rehabilitation to a productive, lawful citizen of the United States is encouraged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It is apparent that this young woman is in need of long-term intensive educational, emotional, and economic support to address her traumas, which have, in part, motivated her actions to join a dangerous organization as a substitute for normal family life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In Europe, countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands have designed and used intensive disengagement and deradicalization programs to assist prisoners charged and convicted of terrorism-related offenses. The United States has no such program. The Bureau of Prisons should seriously consider designing an appropriate program to deal with American terrorists like this one. Without access to treatment while incarcerated or on supervised release, Defendant will likely remain an unrehabilitated supporter of ISIL and a continuing danger to the United States. Ceasar's counsel and the Probation Department are developing a program of intensive treatment and support for the term of her supervision after her incarceration; the treatment should begin in prison and connect seamlessly with control and assistance by Probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The sentence is sufficient, but not greater than necessary. The Bureau of Prisons and other relevant federal agencies should design and use disengagement and deradicalization programs to help ensure that people in similar circumstances have a reasonable chance at rehabilitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Dr. Porterfield explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   When you have childhood trauma over and over and over again, what we now understand is that children make their bodies and their brain functioning, their neurophysiological response to that, is that those functions change and the child develops patterns of what we call emotional regulation, handling emotions, that are very impaired. They develop a sense of self that's very impaired and they develop relationships to other people that are very impaired. Those are sort of the hallmark of complex post-trauma[tic] stress disorder. And then what's also with that is the other parts ...of the original Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, which are hyperarousal, problems with feeling frightened, startle difficulties, et cetera. If I could just wrap that up ... [:] Ms. [Ceasar's] diagnosis of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress is severe and she has ... [what] I called emotional disregulation, that means inability to recognize emotions and deal with them. And she has a very severe condition of dissociation and dissociation is a really problematic symptom that happens ... when children get overwhelmed, scared and hurt and left over and over again, because the child's brain and body reaction to that is to begin to shut it off, make it stop, make it go away.

Defendant's Involvement with ISIL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Brief Background of ISIL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   ISIL is an organization with roots in a Sunni Islamist group founded in 1999. Gov't Ex. 1 (\"Vidino Rep.\"), at 2. It was\n   designated by the United States as a foreign terrorist organization in 2004, when it was known by its former name, al-Qa'ida in Iraq. U.S. Department of State,\n   <em>\n    Foreign Terrorist Organizations\n   </em>\n   , https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/ (last visited July 25, 2019). Around 2012, the organization began operations in Syria, and in 2013, it became known by its current name. Vidino Rep. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Though reportedly it no longer controls any territory, at the height of its power in approximately 2015, ISIL ruled territory the size of France across Iraq and Syria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Its power stretched further abroad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIL's leader, urged Muslims to migrate to ISIL territory and take up arms on behalf of the organization. In 2014, he said, \"O Muslims everywhere, whoever is capable of performing hijrah to the Islamic State, then let him do so, because hijrah to the land of Islam is obligatory.\"\n   <em>\n    See Isis leader calls on Muslims to 'build Islamic state'\n   </em>\n   , BBC (July 1, 2014), https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28116846.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Dr. Lorenzo Vidino, Director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, and the government's expert on radicalization, mobilization, disengagement, and deradicalization from jihadist groups, explained the meaning of the term 'hijrah':\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Hijrah\n   </em>\n   in the Qur'an refers to the prophet Muhammad's (and his followers') migration from Mecca-his place of birth and upbringing-to Medina in 622 CE to flee persecution. Those who followed Muhammad were the first converts and followers of Islam and demonstrated their faith by fleeing with Muhammad before fighting alongside him and helping establish the first Islamic society.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   For jihadists,\n   <em>\n    hijrah\n   </em>\n   is a term used predominantly for supporters/followers in countries outside the operational zones of the jihadist group to travel to those zones and join the group. To make\n   <em>\n    hijrah\n   </em>\n   is to travel from a \"land of disbelief\" ... to a territory where a jihadist group has created or seeks to create what it deems a perfect Islamic society.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Vidino Rep. at 23 (italics in original). It is believed that about 5,000 European citizens migrated to ISIL territory and became ISIL fighters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.

At the hearing during which she pled guilty before the court, she described her conduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   From January 2016 to November ... 2016, I knowingly and intentionally agreed with others to provide material support to foreign terrorist organization, that I know ... is run by Dawla or Islamic State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   This is the same organization that the U.S. Government calls \"ISIS\" or \"ISIL.\" At the time, I agreed with others to provide material support to Dawla.

I worked as an assistant to the other members more than once. I put U.S. based individuals who wanted to make [hijrah] or migration to the Dawla in touch with the other members who were based overseas. I did this by passing the [T]elegram contact information of the other members to these U.S. based individuals, [T]elegram is [an] encrypted messaging application. I put these U.S. based individuals in touch with all the members on [T]elegram[ ]so they would have contacts in Dawla, who could help them travel overseas to the territory controlled by Dawla.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   I believed that if these individuals made it to Dawla, they would join the group and work under its directions and control. I personally spoke on ... [T]elegram and other social network applications to Dawla members whose contact information I passed to these individuals. When I passed the information on [T]elegram to contact the Dawla members, I was in the United States, Brooklyn, at the time. I also intended to make [hijrah] to Dawla to join the group.

Several months later, Defendant contacted the username of Confidential Source 1-now operated by an undercover FBI agent-and offered to help him get a visa to migrate to ISIL territory. PSR \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. She put him in contact with an ISIL operative who had, with another individual, taken over the recruitment role of al-Sudani and his wife. PSR \u00b6 27.

Confidential Source 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In early 2016, a second confidential source working under the supervision of the FBI (\"Confidential Source 2\") initiated contact with Ceasar via Facebook. Gov't Sent. Mem. 12. After Confidential Source 2\n   disclosed that she wanted to travel to ISIL-controlled territory, Defendant provided her with the contact information of al-Sudani's wife and instructed \"if u serious about making hijrah then download [the Internet messaging application] and add the head sister committee leader.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ceasar later followed up with Confidential Source 2 and informed her that one of the recruiters who had replaced al-Sudani was looking for her, suggesting that Confidential Source 2 reply to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    iv.

PSR \u00b6 28. Defendant and Individual 2 discussed his desire to migrate to ISIL-controlled territory and join ISIL, and she provided him with the contact information for several ISIL facilitators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Individual 2 engaged in a series of exchanges with the facilitators about joining ISIL. PSR \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. On July 7, 2016, he sent to Ceasar a screenshot of his conversation with the facilitator, in which the facilitator encouraged him to engage in violence in the United States because travel to ISIL-controlled territory would take too long: \"Because of ur visa ...

In June 2016, she obtained a 30-day tourist visa for Afghanistan. PSR \u00b6 28. In July, Ceasar told the ISIL facilitator who had been corresponding with Individual 2 that she would travel to Afghanistan as soon as she had sufficient money. PSR \u00b6 32. She later informed him that she was renewing her visa for Afghanistan (it was set to expire shortly) so that she could travel at a time when flights were less expensive. PSR \u00b6 34. In September 2016, a different ISIL contact promised to purchase for Defendant a plane ticket to Turkey where she could secure a visa at the airport. PSR \u00b6 36. This contact instructed her to live a normal life and wait to do anything until her email address was requested so a plane ticket could be sent. PSR \u00b6 37.

In October 2016, she reported to a New York City transit police officer that she had lost her purse, which contained two cell phones. PSR \u00b6 40. The purse was turned into the New York City Police Department, after which a magistrate judge issued a warrant allowing the FBI to search both cell phones.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The search revealed that Defendant had corresponded with several individuals regarding her plans to travel to ISIL territory and to provide ISIL with potential new members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She was arrested on November 15, 2016 when\n   she checked into a flight from New York to Sweden, via Turkey, at John F.

PSR \u00b6 48. Pretrial Services became aware of the unlawful computer usage when Defendant submitted a laptop computer to Pretrial Services to have computer-monitoring software installed. PSR \u00b6 43. Following a hearing on the violations, Defendant's bond was revoked and she was remanded to federal custody. PSR \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   An investigation into the scope and content of Ceasar's communications and activities while on presentence release turned up widespread violations of her release conditions. In addition to performing online searches for known ISIL affiliates and news of the organization's activities, PSR \u00b6 43, Defendant created at least three pseudonymous social media accounts and used them to contact or attempt to contact at least seven people she had previously identified to the FBI as supporting ISIL or other extremist groups, Gov't Sent.

She also contacted or attempted to contact other individuals about whom she had not previously provided information to the government, but who had expressed support for ISIL or were associated with ISIL supporters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For example, Ceasar searched for and initiated Facebook communications with an individual whom she had previously identified to the FBI as associated with United Kingdom-based ISIL supporters linked to terrorist attacks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After this individual posted on Facebook \"Be very careful as to who you trust on here especially if they send you any links that maybe incriminating,\" Defendant responded, \"Yea that's true that how I went to prison because some the Muslims were spies.\" Gov't Ex. 12. Ceasar also engaged in Facebook communications with an individual based in Belgium with whom she had been in contact before her 2016 arrest. Gov't Sent. Mem. 17. On at least one instance, Defendant, this individual, and an ISIL facilitator, to whom Defendant referred people for help in traveling to ISIL-controlled territory, engaged in a multi-user Facebook posting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Following her 2016 arrest, Defendant never disclosed to the government her contact with the individual in Belgium.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She deleted their messages exchanged while she was out on presentence release, though they were subsequently recovered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Ceasar's messages with ISIL supporters from this time period indicate that she believed that her conduct leading to conviction for conspiring to provide material support to ISIL was not wrong. As noted above, in response to the post \"Be very careful as to who you trust on here especially if they send you any links that maybe incriminating,\" Defendant responded, \"Yea that's true that how I went to prison because some the Muslims were spies.\" Gov't Ex. 12. Two weeks later, she posted on Facebook, \"I didn't do anything wrong under Islam but stand up for my deen and got arrested for what I believe in ....\" Gov't Ex. 14. \"Deen\" is an Arabic term for religion which has been interpreted narrowly by jihadists, \"to refer explicitly to their in-group, and [they] often use\n   <em>\n    deen\n   </em>\n   to express following and adhering to 'the right path' represented by their group's interpretation of Islam.\" Vidino Rep. at 23 (italics in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Ceasar ultimately deleted at least 1,000 Facebook messages and at least 1,000 text messages, as well as emails, audio files, and images.

PSR \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   During the government's investigation of Defendant's conduct while out on presentence release, she provided incomplete, inaccurate, and incorrect answers about her behavior. Ceasar lied about reading ISIL-related news sources and propaganda outlets, denying her familiarity with a Facebook account that regularly posted propaganda even though she \"friended\" the account and \"liked\" posts by the account. Gov't Sent. Mem. 21.

I would say the vast majority of people who are in this sort of informal online community are disseminators of propaganda. They repost or retweet ISIS propaganda.

She makes the connection between people who are on the lower level, people who have no connections whatsoever with ISIS, who have just started this radicalization trajectory, or for one reason or another ... do not have connections with ISIS, she connects them with people who are ISIS members or who are pa[r]t of some kind of inner circle of this informal community.

In sum, Dr. Vidino's testimony explained the value and importance of Ceasar's conduct to help ISIL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Dr. Vidino also gave his opinion about extremist individuals' capacity and ability to leave ISIL-associated networks and reintegrate into mainstream society, as well as Ceasar's progress toward these goals. He described two concepts-disengagement and deradicalization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   26:14-28:3. Disengagement is a behavioral process and is \"marked by a change in role or\n   function that is usually associated with a reduction of violent participation.\" Vidino Rep. at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted). Deradicalization, by contrast, is \"an attitudinal or cognitive process\" that is \"complete[d] when the commitment to, and involvement in, violent radicalization is reduced to the extent that ... [the individual] [is] no longer at risk of involvement and engagement in violent activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Programs aimed to facilitate disengagement and deradicalization are multilayered and bring together mentors, security services, social workers, and psychologists to work with the radicalized individual according to a specific plan. Sent. Hr'g Tr. 38:7-19. These programs exist in various Western European countries, Dr. Vidino stated, but not in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   38:20-39:5. Thus, Defendant, under present conditions, would not have the benefit of such a program of disengagement or deradicalization in or out of prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In discussing Defendant's current trajectory toward disengagement and deradicalization, Dr. Vidino relied on several factors identified in academic literature, which are fully explicated in his expert report.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   28:16-29:23. \"[C]ommonly cited signs of disengagement are: [1] Ending personal involvement in terrorism and related activities[;] [2] Distancing oneself from terrorism and extremist activity by acknowledging the shortcomings of their actions[;] [3] Distancing oneself from the group's ideology[;] [4] Breaking contact with individuals associated with the group or supporting its ideology[; and] [5] Accepting the punishment for crimes committed.\" Vidino Rep. at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \"Signs of a deeper level of disengagement include: [1] Providing intelligence and/or serving as a witness in court[;] [2] Meeting victims as part of reconciliation and restorative justice initiatives[; and] [3] Taking part in activities aimed at reducing recruitment and radicalization to extremist groups as well as taking part in activities aimed at encouraging disengagement for those currently involved (e.g., counter-radicalization efforts).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Dr. Vidino testified that Ceasar exhibited two \"red flags\" signaling a danger that she would reengage with ISIL if released from prison: (1) maintenance of extremist views, and (2) engagement with people known by her to be ISIL supporters-in some instances the same people she engaged with during the charged conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sent.

He testified that the content of her communications suggests that she maintains extremist views.

Sent. Hr'g Tr. 100:7-8;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Katsavdakis Rep. Based on his professional judgment and review of academic literature, he identified nine factors bearing on Defendant's conduct and her likelihood of reoffending: (1) pathway warning behaviors, (2) fixation, (3) identification, (4) leakage, (5) presence of mental illness, (6) reliance on virtual community, (7) failed relationships, (8) thwarting of occupational/academic goals, and (9) presence of deception-violation of supervisory conditions. Katsavdakis Rep. at 15. Dr. Katsavdakis testified in detail about his evaluation of Ceasar vis-\u00e0-vis the factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Q So, starting with the first factor of the nine factors, walk us through that. That's pathway warning behaviors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   A Yes, it's called pathway warning behaviors, originally written about in the mid 1990s, and it's essentially the behaviors that the person is engaging in to indicate that they are accelerating or on the pathway to a potential attack.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   The bottom of the pathway warning behavior generally starts with a grievance ...; it's followed by moving to violent ideation, which is the way to solve the grievance ... through violence, either through oneself or affiliating with a group; from there, it goes to what we call pre-attack planning behaviors, and this could vary from contacting persons with extremist views, securing weaponry, securing travel documents; and it goes from research to more planning, probing, which can be ... going to [a] facility to see if you could enter it or going to the airport; and then the attack is the end.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   And you want to know where are they on the pathway ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Q Where did the Defendant fall for you within that pathway?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   A Planning and preparing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Q What's that ... based on?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   A Her messages through different forums to different persons indicating that she was preparing to secure travel documents to go overseas to marry. Some of the messages that she posted on line regarding doing jihad or engaging in jihad or wanting to die as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   Q Can you talk about what[, the next factor,] fixation is and how it relates to your assessment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   A Generally, fixation means ... a pathological preoccupation with an idea -- doesn't have to be an extremist idea but any idea -- to such an extent that it interferes with functioning, can get the person into problems socially, occupationally, interpersonally, or with the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   And that data was collected via some of the posts ..., interest in ISIS material, connecting people. And, again, the posts from 2016 until the time she was arrested. And then subsequent to that, her interest in ISIS individuals when she was released on bail and under supervision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   Q As part of your examination of the Defendant this time around, this year, did she tell you whether she was or was not still interested in ISIS?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   A I think what she said was she was not interested and there were several factors of why she got involved. Generally, it fell into one of four categories.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   First category was that she was brainwashed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   Second category was that she was living a life that was quite hopeless and wanted to find an alternative lifestyle to kind of get away from everything she had been going through, some of her past.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   Third was curiosity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   And the fourth major category was knowledge. In particular, of 2018 when she was released, indicating that she just wanted to [know] what people were doing in their other cases who had been arrested for terroristic-like behavior. So, it fell in one of those four categories.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   Q Doctor, if she tells you in 2019 that she doesn't have any interest in ISIS anymore, why are you counting fixation as one of the factors in your analysis?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   A Because one of the things in a threat assessment we're trained to do is to look at the consistency or inconsistency between what they say verbally and what they do behaviorally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   So, ... someone can tell me or anybody that they're not interested in a particular subject or a particular person they're stalking, but if their behavior indicates otherwise then that generally indicates there's some interest at least in that area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   Q What, if anything, about the Defendant's behavior indicated contrary to what she was saying?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   A Well, around June 2018, she was able to get a computer, I think from a friend at a mosque, and started browsing the internet for -- not all of it was ISIS-related material but some of it was ISIS-related. And that was also found on her phone ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   Q And doctor, the next factor, identification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   Q Can you explain why that is or how that is relevant to your analysis?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   A Identification is an attempt to become a warrior or pseudocommando or someone with a military or could be a police-like background, and usually it's a sign that you're affiliating with or interested in a particular group or individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   [Defendant] had a video she created in February 2016, espousing not only travel overseas for Islamic purposes but also jihad. That's one. She had also posted different kinds of emoticons with weapons, guns, bombs. She had also reposted messages from ISIS leaders .... She had also referenced Omar Mateen, who ... killed 49 people on June 12, 2016, in reference to some of the acts subsequent to that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   So, those are all examples of identification that we're looking for in a threat case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   Q What about[, the next factor,] \"leakage,\" what is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   A Leakage is conveying to a third party ... your intent to engage in some kind of harmful act. It's not a direct threat to the target, not a direct threat to the individual, but, again, leaking it. Generally, nowadays, it's online ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   But you are telling someone somewhere that you are thinking of doing these things, acting this way, engaging in violence, doing jihad, or hurting people or killing people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   Q In this case, what action or actions of the Defendant indicated leakage?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   A That would be her online post or reposts and ... the video that she made that I saw.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   Q What about the presence of mental illness, was that a factor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   A It is. We do assess for the presence of mental illness; not per se a diagnosis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   One of the common misconceptions in threat assessment/risk assessment is the belief that if you have a mental illness it could be a buffer to a threat. As a threat assessment professional, we pay less attention to the diagnosis but more attention to the symptoms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   Based upon what [Defendant] told me, that she has been suffering from some kind of anxiety and depression probably on or around age eleven ... with regard to her past reported victimization by various family members, marriages, failures at school, failures at work that she experienced up until the time she was arrested in November 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   Q Are you aware of any diagnosed mental illness?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   A No. The diagnosis that was referenced in the available records from Temple University, on September 14, 2015 ... is the suicidal ideation diagnosis. At around that time, she was hospitalized in the emergency room for complications related to a miscarriage about three days earlier and reported victimization by one of the spouses. And at that time, she had reported suicidal ideation via overdose to the practitioner at the hospital, who then referred her [to] case management. I don't think they followed up but I know they referred to case management. Again, that was around September 14 of 2015. There was no documentation of psychiatric distress or symptoms in the school records from 2004 all the way up until about 2014. Philadelphia. The primary diagnosis that [Ceasar] had was what we called a specific learning disability, and that diagnosis was for what we call expressive and receptive language problems. And she was under an IEP -- the name has changed over the last 40 years, but generally stands for individualized education plan....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   Q To be clear, doctor, you reviewed her IQ records?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   A I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   Q Was there anything abnormal about them?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   A [Her] full scale IQ is 98. Her verbal and performance IQ are within 96 to 98, which fall in the average [range].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   The two below average ranges for [Ceasar] are in what we call achievement testing, using the [Wechsler Individual Achievement Test] ... [,] she has below average functioning on reading comprehension and mathematics computations; not significantly below average, but I believe below average.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   That was the main testing that was done with [Defendant] while she was in school at the four, five schools she attended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   Q Doctor, the next factor on your list, reliance on virtual community, can you explain what that factor means and why it's relevant to your assessment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   A One of the things that we see with terrorist[ ] cases in particular is that the person isolates and begins to rely on a monitor in front of them or a computer screen, like a phone, and that becomes their primary method of interacting with the social wor[l]d, which was evident in my opinion with [Ceasar], especially from late 2015 until she was arrested in November 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   You can again further harden your beliefs or have further extremist beliefs by relying on just communicating with people online. Sometimes a person thinks they know who they're interacting with when, i[n] fact, they really don't know who they're interacting with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   Q Failed relationship, I think, is the next factor. Can you [ex]plain to the Court and how it relates?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   A In part, kind of a thwarting of relationships.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   [Defendant] has had successive or sequential relationships that have been destructive and at times abusive with three separate men.... She was married at a very young [age], 18, and she was married again on or around 2014 to 2015. These are short-lived marriages with men typically 25 to 30 years older than [her].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   Q Doctor, the next, which is the second to last [factor], the thwarting of occupational and academic goals, can you explain what that means and how it relates to your assessment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   A This goes, again, to trying to establish some kind of pattern for her to succeed professionally or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   She struggled academically. I would say she did okay up until the eleventh grade and when she moved to Philadelphia all things kind of fell apart. Her grade point [average] decreased and then she dropped out of school. Her last full grade was the eleventh grade. And then subsequent to that, she's held very few jobs for any sustained period of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   Q Doctor, the last factor is presence of deception.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   Can you explain what that means and why it's important to your assessment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   A Yes, you essentially want to see the cooperation or the level of involvement the person has in whatever probation or parole or supervisory conditions you have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   Subsequent to the time that she was released on bail, she was able to, within 50 days, at least get a computer from someone and then return to some of her online activities, including ISIS interests .... In addition, when she was asked [about] some of her behavior by the FBI, I think it was the beginning of January 2019, she had indicated that she was not engaged in some of this activity; later, she pled guilty to some of the same activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   When I interviewed her, I asked her about some of the techniques or some of\n   the methodologies she may have used in 2016, when she was aware that the FBI was perhaps surveilling her. Part of what she said is that, in, part, motivated her to move sooner, to move quicker, which is not uncommon in these cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   Often in a threat case, once the individual realizes that they're monitored by law enforcement or the workplace, they tend to actually increase the pathway to get to the end result faster. It's actually a factor that we look for a lot, what is the organization or the people around her doing to make the situation worse? We don't really look at that too much in regular violence assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   So, those are some examples of deception that are relevant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Sent.

Dr. Sageman contends that these factors were taken from a specific piece of unreliable academic literature, then inappropriately used and misapplied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court did not find Dr. Sageman's testimony on this topic persuasive, since Dr. Katsavdakis did not testify that he relied upon the article in question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Dr. Sageman then testified about Ceasar's past and current relationship with ISIL and her risk of recidivism.

[T]his kind of very strong bond of loyalty and identification with this community, this is why she was attracted to ISIS, because she felt she idealized this community, this caliphate, and so that it would be a fair and just community in the Middle East unlike all of the other tyrannies that exist [in the] Middle East. And she felt that this community, she was attracted to it because it was online a caring community that will take care of her because she was basically looking for some people to take care of her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   Q And how did her personal history contribute to her desire for that community?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   A Well, she was very disappointed and alienated from people around her because\n   they abused her, they exploited her, they ... since she was ... five or six, all the way to ... the three husbands who abused her, and, so, she was looking -- so, she felt very alienated. And no Muslim was coming to her aid. No Muslim was coming to her help. So, she was very alienated, not only by the people who would not take care of her, but also the ambient community here in the United States. So, she basically looked up to this community as an ideal community for her and [was] willing to overlook a lot of the horror that goes along with this community. So that's how she became attracted to this idealized community, online community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   211:21-212:19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   He further explained that the language Defendant used in her communications while on presentence release was not indicative of a continued commitment to ISIL because of the passage of time and the patterns people assume in friendships.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   213:6-16. \"There is no risk of violence\" by Defendant, said Dr. Sageman, because there is no evidence that she has been or is violent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   205:20-206:3. He noted that the risk of Defendant engaging in the conduct that led to her convictions was low because ISIL no longer controls any territory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   One is connecting people to ISIS. And this is now very unlikely because there's no people to connect to ISIS; it's no longer around, as even Dr. Vidino mentioned, in terms of territory. And ISIS online is now very, very small and they don't really respond to people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   Second ..., her body going to Iraq or Syria.

The study by Dr. Omi Hodwitz-Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of Idaho and a Research Affiliate of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland-collected data for terrorist offenders and analyzed their postrelease criminal histories. Def. Ex. UU, at 56. Only 1.6% of terrorist offenders released between 2001 and 2018 recidivated, and none of the crimes which they committed postrelease were clearly politically motivated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   The court's impression from Dr. Sageman's testimony is that he believes Defendant does not pose a risk of reoffending because of changed political circumstances, her own personal growth, and her lack of a history of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Dr. Katherine Porterfield\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Defendant's final expert to testify was psychiatric expert Dr. Katherine Porterfield. Her background is discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , in Section II.B. During the sentencing hearing, she testified at length about Defendant's PTSD, as well as how her offenses directly relate to her clinical problems:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   A So my opinion is that Ms. [Ceasar's] clinical problems are very much the root of her very misguided and destructive and dysfunctional actions. She was a person who did not know how to handle her feelings of pain, shame and fear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   Those are pretty much the feelings she walks around with every day and especially in her younger sort of late adolescence. She did not have the tools with which to handle those feelings and, therefore, she managed them by ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n   disassociating, not connecting to those feelings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   She did not have the tools to manage her self-loathing and self-attack. So she repetitively found herself in relationships with hurtful people who would again misuse her. These three men we've heard about, ... these informal marriages, and then ultimately the people online who were exploiting her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   And she did not know how to handle what I call radar. You know, radar is like the thing you develop as a person when you get taken care of as a little kid. You get radar that says, oh, this person's bad news. They're going to hurt me. They're going to scare me. And then you get radar that says, hey, this person's kind, and gentle, and they're taking care of me. That's a good feeling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-237\">\n   When you get abused by your caregivers, especially sexual abuse at the level she had from her father, your radar, your ability to perceive who's dangerous, who's safe, becomes incredibly distorted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-238\">\n   Ms. [Ceasar's] perceptions of other people have been so severely harmed by this abuse and abandonment that she didn't have good radar. And we have worked on that an awful lot in two years, she and I, because it's one of the most critical things you need as a person. You better know who's safe and who's good, and you have to know who's harmful and dangerous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   Q And it doesn't really make sense to me. If she was abused, why is she seeking out a violent community?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   A It's one of the most painful, difficult things about child abuse, especially what we call betrayal trauma.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n   So Ms. [Ceasar] had betrayal trauma. That is the overwhelming experiences coming at her of fear of hurt of her body, of sexual abuse; were coming from the person who's supposed to protect her. So now you have a double whammy. You have fear and overwhelmed feelings of sexual abuse, and it's coming at you from the person who's supposed to be your protector.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-242\">\n   So what happens is that children, unfortunately, in those moments, often have to develop a defense mechanism. They have to make sense of what's happening to them. I must be worthless. I must have brought this on. I must be bad.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-243\">\n   And children internalize that and then, tragically, if they have really severe abuse and nobody helps them and nobody takes care of them, they repeat it. And that repetition is really the core of what Ms. [Ceasar] has struggled with and continues to work on and really show more insight in, which is the repeated violence and hurt against herself over and over again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-244\">\n   She went towards danger instead of going towards health and protection and that's a very tragic thing, as we see sitting here today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Sent. Hr'g Tr. 243:5-245:11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Dr. Porterfield explained that Ceasar's behavior while on presentence release was typical of the behavior survivors of trauma exhibit during recovery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   Q Based on your training and experience, do you have an opinion about what caused this behavior on bail?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   A I do. I think that when you work with people who are troubled and especially very severely traumatized and abused, their trajectory is not a straight line. They, not unlike drug addiction, and not unlike domestic violence sufferers, meaning people who are abused and then return to abusive partners, the trajectory goes like this: It is a wavy line. There is relapse. There is mistake.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   I believe that's what this was. I believe she was released without enough planning\n   and without enough support, frankly. I wish I had been, myself, more available during that period. I feel badly about that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n   And I think that she could not handle the stress at that point of being out, not having enough treatment, and not having enough of a community. And I think she went back into, you know, sort of dipping her toe in the water of some very familiar dysfunctional people. That's what I think happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n   I was just going to say, it was not a good thing legally, but frankly, clinically, it gave us a lot to work with, because I was quite shocked and I was really, really -- I was shocked and I was disappointed, and I was able to talk very intensely with Ms. [Ceasar] about these choices and about where her life is going.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   And, you know, in clinical work, that's actually the kind of meat that really helps, is if you have some stuff to work with. And I'm not glad it happened for all kinds of reasons, but we worked with it and we continue to work with it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   248:1-249:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Despite the \"wavy line\" of Defendant's recovery from trauma, Dr. Porterfield does not believe Defendant has a continuing commitment to ISIL:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   Q And do you have an opinion about her current level of commitment to ISIS based both on your conversations with her, your review of discovery, but also your experience working with extremists?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   A She does not have a commitment to ISIS. She is very saddened that she did that and embarrassed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   I think she's struggling more now with her relationship to her faith and to Islam, which is why I think it is an incredible benefit to have someone like Ms. Khan, who is a spiritual guide in the field, a spiritual guide in Islam. But Ms. [Ceasar] does not yearn for this fantasied absurd thing that she back then thought was going to give her a new life. She does not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   253:2-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Dr. Porterfield testified that continuing incarceration would be more harmful to Ceasar than it would be beneficial, given her PTSD:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n   Q And shifting to her current state, do you have an opinion about how incarceration affects her complex PTSD?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   A I think that prison is not an easy place for anyone. It's not an easy place to be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   I think that it has been harmful to her in that she hasn't had a community around her of healthy people. She's had other women who are under terrible stress and who also have terrible judgment issues, frankly. She has medical problems that do not get addressed, which leads her then into a very anxious state because she has so many medical problems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   By the way, if you remember the ACE model I talked about ..., one of the biggest predictors is the higher ACE also the higher medical difficulties. And she has very serious medical difficulties for her age, I believe not unrelated to the traumatic stress she endured as a child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n   Prison is not a great environment for her. It has, I think, been a place where she has had to deal with her behaviors and face consequences, and I don't think that's actually a bad thing to face consequences when we make mistakes. But I think that\n   <em>\n    prison itself is not helpful to her condition and it's not helpful to her mental health\n   </em>\n   issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-265\">\n   She needs now trauma-focused treatment, which is not what I've done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   253:15-254:13 (emphasis added). Trauma-focused treatment, Dr. Porterfield testified, cannot be accomplished while Defendant is incarcerated because of her vulnerability.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   254:14-255:16. Trauma-focused treatment is intensive and would require Ceasar to discuss in detail her past experiences, including sexual and physical abuse, so that she and a professional could \"integrate\" those experiences into emotional management strategies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   254:15-255:3. The emotional difficulty of doing this while emotionally isolated during incarceration, Dr. Porterfield explained, might lead to Ceasar's further deterioration and potentially suicide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   255:4-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Appearing calm and sincere, Ceasar spoke briefly on her own behalf. Defendant explained how she sought out ISIL as a way to improve her own situation and how incarceration has allowed her to learn how to discipline herself and avoid negative influences.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   339:1-18. She testified that she no longer supports or associates with terrorist organizations.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   339:19-24. Ceasar also spoke with insight about her improvements in judgment and mental health, both in the past and going forward:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   A year ago out on bail, I trusted my own judgment. The difference is now that I understand that I have terrible judgment and I can't trust what I think are good decisions. I now know the difference, which is that I know to seek proper help and advice only from the people like Dr. Porterfield, my attorneys and their team, and Daisy Khan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   ... What I want everyone to know is I was foolish and ignorant. I understand the actions I took were wrong, and I will never do it again. I'm not ... going to engage with any terrorists or radical groups.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   What I want to focus on is getting my mental, my education, and my physical health, and to become a productive citizen. I know I can be. What I have mentally accomplished about my mental health with Dr. Porterfield, she has taught me boundaries, self-esteem, and cleansing myself away from trauma. Also, Ms. Daisy Khan helped me understand the confusion I had in my beliefs. I am more aware of my emotions and communicate better with my peers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   341:4-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Rehabilitation, Punishment, and Deterrence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Defendant is a 24-year-old United States citizen. Her traumatic childhood has already been described in detail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II.A. Raised by an ill, single mother, Ceasar was sexually abused by her father and placed in foster care after her mother became too ill to care for her. She dropped out of high school and lived with friends and romantic partners, and in homeless shelters, after signing herself out of foster care. Employment of Ceasar was temporary. A series of marriages with older men ended after physical and emotional abuse. Defendant lacks stable relationships with friends and family, with the exception of her half-brother. She also suffers from serious health conditions, including complex PTSD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   Defendant's testimony was supported by her experts: She sought ISIL as a way to deal with her harsh circumstances and because of clinical issues affecting her judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.3 (describing Khan's testimony); Section III.A.4 (describing Dr. Sageman's testimony); Section III.A.5 (describing Dr. Porterfield's testimony); Section III.B (describing Defendant's testimony);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Richard L. Abel,\n   <em>\n    Law's Trials: The Performance of Legal Institutions in the US \"War on Terror\"\n   </em>\n   72 (2018) (describing how many terrorism defendants, \"[s]eeking a sense of meaning through identification with a larger group and cause, ... were easily manipulated\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Whatever her motivations, there is no question that Defendant's criminal offenses were serious. Dr. Vidino's testimony helpfully placed Defendant's conduct-connecting individuals in the United States with ISIL-affiliated individuals-in context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.1. Defendant was not simply an individual who posted propaganda; she intentionally and knowingly connected individuals in the United States with those abroad who would do the United States harm. An objective observer can only conclude that Ceasar's deletion of her communications with others while on presentence release impeded the government's ability to investigate the extent of her bail violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   The sentence must reflect the importance of specific deterrence, as well as general deterrence, to protect the public. The experts disagreed about the risk of reoffending posed by Defendant, but seemed to agree that deradicalization of Defendant (whether or not that has already occurred in whole or part) would reduce the likelihood of reoffending. In this instance, rehabilitation and specific deterrence of Defendant seem to go hand in hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   The ideal sentence, in the court's estimation following the hearing, would be Defendant's placement in a deradicalization or disengagement program with provision for intensive educational, emotional, and economic support to address her childhood trauma and its attendant results. This treatment might begin while Defendant is incarcerated, or while she was supervised under strict conditions by the Probation Department. As disclosed during the hearing, no such satisfactory general program exists in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   For many years, countries in Western Europe and the Middle East have incorporated deradicalization and disengagement programs into their regular practice when confronted with individuals assessed as having been radicalized or individuals that have been charged or convicted of a terrorism-related crime.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,\n   <em>\n    Handbook on the Management of Violent Extremist Prisoners and the Prevention of Radicalization to Violence in Prisons\n   </em>\n   122-23 (2016) (\"The [Danish] Back on\n   Track ... programme was designed to help prisoners who have been charged or convicted of terrorism-related offences, or who have been assessed as vulnerable to radicalization.\"); Kelly A. Berkell,\n   <em>\n    Off-Ramp Opportunities in Material Support Cases\n   </em>\n   , 8 Harv. J. Nat'l Security 1, 28-32 (2017) (describing the deradicalization program used by Saudi Arabia).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Such intensive programs may be integrated into terms of incarceration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Liesbeth van der Heide &amp; Bart Schuurman,\n   <em>\n    Reintegrating Terrorists in the Netherlands: Evaluating the Dutch Approach\n   </em>\n   , 17 J. Deradicalization 196, 204-07 (2018) (describing the Dutch Terrorism, Extremism and Radicalization team, which was designed to \"a) improve efforts made to reintegrate terrorist prisoners while still in detention, b) provide better aftercare upon their release, and c) create a central and coordinated approach for dealing with this offender class in the future\"). The efficacy of such programs is under study; their existence is evidence of a commitment to dealing with the problem of radicalization by focusing on rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   The United States lacks adequate rehabilitation programs. The absence is of particular concern because the kind of incarceration presently utilized in federal prisons can make radicalization more likely to persist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 109 (\"prison radicalization to violence is an issue of considerable importance and recruitment attempts, successful or otherwise, do occur\"). Apparently only the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota has made an effort to incorporate deradicalization programming into terrorism-related sentences, and this appears to have been limited to one criminal prosecution. Berkell,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 45-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   The federal Bureau of Prisons would be well-served by incorporating a formal deradicalization and disengagement program into its offerings. This program might build on those programs in effect abroad and with demonstrated records of success. Such a program should also account for differences on the basis of sex and gender.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Sofia Patel &amp; Jacqueline Westermann,\n   <em>\n    Women and Islamic-State Terrorism: An Assessment of How Gender Perspectives Are Integrated in Countering Violent Extremism Policy and Practices\n   </em>\n   , 14 Security Challenges 53, 56 (2018) (\"Gender perspectives are rarely holistically integrated into definitions and processes of radicalisation. This has resulted in incomplete understanding of female pathways into and out of violent extremism, as well as the ways in which women develop resilience to resist radicalisation ....\"); Nur Irfani Binte Saripi,\n   <em>\n    Female Members of ISIS: A Greater Need for Rehabilitation\n   </em>\n   , 7 Counter Terrorist Trends &amp; Analysis 26 (2015) (describing women's roles in ISIL and noting the importance of tailoring rehabilitation to address their specific experiences with ISIL).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   With no adequate program of rehabilitation available to Defendant, the court seriously considered whether a further term of incarceration was appropriate. The seriousness of the offenses ultimately compelled the conclusion that some incarceration as punishment and for control was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Potential Harm of Long Incarceration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   The manner in which Defendant's physical and emotional health will be impacted by a lengthy term of incarceration was seriously considered by the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rosado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9133369\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/254/316/#p321\">\n    254 F. Supp. 2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (\"Since rehabilitation may not be a basis for incarceration but must be considered as a basis for sentencing, Congress must have anticipated that sentencing judges would use their\n   authority, in appropriate cases, to reduce a defendant's sentence to permit him to continue his rehabilitation in the most effective manner.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Maier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517580\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/944/#p947\">\n    975 F.2d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 947 (2d Cir. 1992) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Both Defendant and her experts testified that further incarceration would run the risk of being detrimental to Defendant's physical and psychiatric conditions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Section III.A.5 (describing Dr. Porterfield's testimony); Section III.B (describing Defendant's testimony). Ceasar's brief presentence release was because of her physical conditions, which have not yet been fully addressed in prison. And Ceasar cannot benefit from the trauma-focused treatment that she requires while she is incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   The court's conclusion is that a lengthy term of incarceration during which her medical needs are not fully met would be extremely harmful to Ceasar's development as a productive member of society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   Continued separation of Defendant from a supportive, non-incarcerated community will also be detrimental to the goal of rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Ceasar's connection to a supportive community in view of her crimes is essential. The expert testimony, as well as academic literature, is clear that an individual in Defendant's position must have stable and supportive relationships for rehabilitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Daniel Koehler,\n   <em>\n    Family Counselling, De-radicalization and Counter-Terrorism: The Danish and German programs in context, in\n   </em>\n   Countering Violent Extremism: Developing an Evidence-base for Policy and Practice 129, 129 (Sara Zeiger &amp; Anne Aly eds., 2015) (\"social bonds and relationships are considered to be essential for desistance focussed probation and reintegration work ..., effective treatment of PTSD ..., as well as the success of terrorist de-radicalization programs ...\" (internal citations omitted)); United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 72 (\"Relationships are one of the primary vehicles for disengagement from violent extremism and, further, appear to be what most optimally enables subsequent engagement of a former violent extremist elsewhere in society.\"). And, in light of Defendant's testimony that she sought ISIL in part to find a supportive community, her rehabilitation will be aided by her connections to her half-brother and experts such as Daisy Khan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   These considerations compel the conclusion that any term of incarceration should be tailored to minimize the amount of time Defendant would go without effective medical and social supports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   <strong>\n    C. First Amendment Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   Not raised by either Defendant or the government was whether the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protected any of Defendant's speech or her speaking activities in support of ISIL. The court, in assessing Defendant's behavior, did consider the free speech issue, namely the extent to which Defendant's behavior amounted only to engaging in protected, unpopular speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   This country's consideration of constitutional protection of unpopular speech goes back to its founding. The Sedition Act of 1798 criminalized \"false\" speech critical of the government subject to the defense of truth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sedition Act of 1798,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%20596\">\n    1 Stat. 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They did not fear political change. They did not exalt order at the cost of liberty. To courageous, self-reliant men, with confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning applied through the processes of popular government, no danger flowing from speech can be deemed clear and present, unless the incidence of the evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is opportunity for full discussion. If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence. Only an emergency can justify repression. Such must be the rule if authority is to be reconciled with freedom. Such, in my opinion, is the command of the Constitution.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   Upon consideration of the underlying constitutional free speech issue, the court concluded that Defendant acted physically to help ISIL. She had adequate actus reus and mens rea under constitutional criminal law. She did not act by speech alone, merely praising that terrorist organization. Rather, her activity went far beyond speech in physically supporting the cause of ISIL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.
