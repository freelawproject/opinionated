(6/30/15 Tr. 7:17-8:5). On the evening of September 17, 2014, Trooper Long was stationed in his unmarked patrol car on the median of Interstate 81 when he witnessed a gray rental vehicle traveling southbound.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:21-9:14, 10:19-22;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 3). The driver was sitting far back \"behind the middle pillar\" of the vehicle such that Trooper Long could see only the driver's hands at the ten and two positions. (6/30/15 Tr. 10:22-11:2, 11:16-22). The driver's unusual posture drew Trooper Long's attention and he began following the rental vehicle in the left lane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:1-8, 37:13-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   There were multiple vehicles in the left lane both in front of the rental vehicle and between the rental vehicle and Trooper Long's unmarked patrol car. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:4-8, 37:13-38:3, 38:24-39:3). Over the course of about two miles, these vehicles moved from the left lane to the right lane until the rental vehicle became the \"lead vehicle\" in the left lane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:9-13:2). The driver of the rental vehicle made no attempt to merge back into the right lane after overtaking the last vehicle therein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:3-11; Def. Ex. 7 at 2). Trooper Long testified that the driver's failure to reenter the right lane absent any traffic pattern preventing such a maneuver-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , an entrance ramp funneling new traffic into the right lane-constituted a \"left lane violation.\" (6/30/15 Tr. 13:12-14:19, 56:10-12). Trooper Long initiated a traffic stop intending to issue a warning to the driver of the rental vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:20-15:1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As he approached the rental vehicle, Trooper Long observed \"extreme nervousness\" from the driver (eventually identified\n   as Byrd) including shaking hands and visible sweating. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:2-6, 15:20-23; Def. Ex. 7 at 2). Byrd disputed the basis for the stop but then provided, at Trooper Long's request, the rental agreement and an interim New York driver's license without a photograph.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (6/30/15 Tr. 15:23-16:16; Def. Ex. 7 at 2; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:12:45-18:15:55; Def. Ex. 13). Byrd initially struggled to locate the rental agreement, and Trooper Long noticed Byrd \"reach[ ] at the center console two or three times\" and \"pull[ ] away from it as if he didn't want to open it.\" (6/30/15 Tr. 16:21-17:5; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:13:35-18:15:55, 18:22:30-18:22:50). As Byrd searched for the agreement, Trooper Long asked him some questions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 11 at 18:15:14-18:15:55). Byrd explained that he was traveling to Pittsburgh where he had been relocated for work and his pregnant girlfriend lived. (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:15:14-18:15:55, 18:20:35-18:21:22; Def. Ex. 7 at 2; 6/30/15 Tr. 111:14-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Byrd produced the rental agreement and informed Trooper Long that \"he was not the renter and a friend rented the vehicle.\" (6/30/15 Tr. 16:6-12). The rental agreement identified Latasha Reed as the person who rented the vehicle and the sole authorized driver. (Gov't Ex. 1 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   6/30/15 Tr. 109:24-110:2; 7/8/15 Tr. 7:20-9:1). Latasha Reed is the mother of several of Byrd's children. (6/30/15 Tr. 110:2-7). Byrd is not listed on the rental agreement, nor did he sign it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113:6-115:7; 7/8/15 Tr. 9:2-10, 9:25-10:7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At Trooper Long's suggestion, Byrd and Trooper Long moved their vehicles to a safer location along the highway. (6/30/15 Tr. 17:23-18:14; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:18:05-18:20:10). Trooper Long ran Byrd's name, date of birth, and license number, and the system returned the name \"James Carter.\" (6/30/15 Tr. 18:15-19:7). Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Travis Martin (\"Trooper Martin\") arrived at the scene in his marked patrol vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:6-10, 19:11-12, 19:24-20:2). The troopers continued running Byrd's information through various law enforcement databases and discovered \"James Carter\" had an outstanding New Jersey warrant for a probation violation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:5-17, 21:7-9, 58:16-21; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:20:25-18:20:35, 18:22:05-18:22:30). The warrant, however, was \"limited extradition,\" and the traffic stop had occurred outside the extradition area. (6/30/15 Tr. 20:17-19). The troopers also learned that Byrd's criminal history included \"convictions or charges for weapons violations, assault on police, drug charges, assault charges, [and] domestic charges.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:14-21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 11 at 18:21:40-18:22:02).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As the troopers were reviewing the warrant and criminal history information, Byrd signaled for Trooper Martin to return to the car. (6/30/15 Tr. 60:1-6, 100:18-25; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:23:23-18:23:35). According to Trooper Martin, Byrd was \"obsessed\" with providing the troopers with his proper driver's license information despite already turning over the interim license. (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:28:30-18:28:38, 18:33:00-18:33:10). Byrd gave Trooper Martin his driver's license number, (6/30/15 Tr. 101:3-17), and shared more about his move to Pittsburgh, (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:28:30-18:28:53, 18:29:03-18:29:18; 6/30/15 Tr. 102:4-10). Trooper Martin stated that Byrd was shaking, smoking a cigarette, and would not make eye contact. (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:28:53-18:29:30; 6/30/15 Tr. 101:18-102:3). Trooper Long testified that the confusion over Byrd's identity prolonged the traffic stop. (6/30/15 Tr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   22:3-13). The troopers struggled to determine whether the driver was Byrd or \"James Carter.\" (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:29:30-18:29:50, 18:30:50-18:49:15; 6/30/15 Tr. 102:24-103:4). In the patrol car, the troopers discussed Byrd's abnormal behavior regarding his driver's license and the center console, his physical signs of extreme nervousness, and the possibility that Byrd possessed marijuana in the center console. (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:32:00-18:32:35, 18:38:18-18:38:32, 18:41:30-18:42:00).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After confirming that Byrd and \"James Carter\" were the same person, the troopers approached the rental vehicle and asked Byrd to exit. (6/30/15 Tr. 22:7-11; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:50:02-18:50:20). Trooper Long provided Byrd with a written warning for the left lane violation, apologized for the length of the stop, and explained to Byrd that he had an outstanding warrant in New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   6/30/15 Tr. 22:11-25, 103:19-104:1; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:51:00-18:51:57). Trooper Long also informed Byrd that he was not authorized to drive the rental vehicle under the rental agreement. (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:52:50-18:53:02). Because he suspected criminal activity, Trooper Long asked Byrd if there was anything illegal in the vehicle, including marijuana, and for consent to search same. (6/30/15 Tr. 23:6-12; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:53:02-18:53:42). Trooper Martin specifically asked about the contents of the vehicle's center console. (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:53:00-18:53:15). Byrd responded: \"I think I got a blunt ...,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which Trooper Long understood to mean a \"smoked marijuana cigarette.\" (6/30/15 Tr. 23:13-17, 104:17-25; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:53:45-18:53:56). In offering to retrieve the blunt for the troopers, Byrd appears to state that \"it's right there on the side.\" (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:54:50-18:54:59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When asked if Byrd ever consented to a search of the vehicle, Trooper Long replied: \"I believe he said, yes, but then he wanted to get - he said yes, I'll get [the blunt] for you. We told him we'd get it.\" (6/30/15 Tr. 93:3-8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:14-15, 24:7-9; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:54:45-18:54:54). Trooper Long initially testified that Byrd asked the troopers several times if they wanted to search the vehicle and eventually said \"yeah, you can search the vehicle,\" (6/30/15 Tr. 24:1-6), but later clarified that Byrd never consented after offering to retrieve the blunt, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 96:9-17). On the patrol car surveillance video, Byrd stated, \"don't search my car\" and \"I don't want you to search it.\" (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:54:12-18:54:23, 18:54:40-18:54:46). According to Trooper Long, Byrd expressed \"nervous laughter\" during this exchange, was unable to stand still, and was \"dancing ... [or] pacing back and forth.\" (6/30/15 Tr. 23:1-5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 11 at 18:54:40-18:54:45). Trooper Long responded to Byrd: \"[Y]ou gave us permission and actually I have probable cause because you told us what's in there but, however we don't need it cause you're not on [the rental agreement], you have no expectation of privacy, alright?\" (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:55:10-18:55:30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trooper Martin stood with Byrd outside the vehicle as Trooper Long began searching the driver's side of the passenger compartment. (6/30/15 Tr. 24:10-13). Byrd admitted to Trooper Martin that he used cocaine earlier that day and continued nervously walking back and forth on the side of the road. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:13-18, 105:1-13; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:55:55-18:56:30). During the search, an off-duty trooper arrived at the scene. (6/30/15 Tr. 24:22-25; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:59:11-18:59:20). Trooper Martin began searching the trunk of the rental vehicle before Trooper Long finished searching\n   the passenger compartment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 11 at 18:55:40-18:59:20). In the trunk, Trooper Martin discovered \"Outlaws motorcycle gang colors\" and a bulletproof vest. (6/30/15 Tr. 25:4:13, 105:24-106:5; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:58:35-18:59:55). Trooper Martin explained to Byrd that he was not under arrest but that he would be detained in handcuffs for the duration of the stop. (6/30/15 Tr. 25:13-18, 106:6-12). Byrd then took off running and all three troopers pursued him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:18-24, 106:13-20; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:59:55-19:00:00). After being subdued by the troopers, Byrd admitted that there was heroin in the rental vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:10-12). The troopers found heroin in a black garbage bag in the trunk of the rental vehicle, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:17-21; Def. Ex. 11 at 19:03:40-19:04:00, 19:09:45-19:10:10), but never recovered a blunt or cocaine, (6/30/15 Tr. 83:19-21, 108:5-6; Def. Ex. 501 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Byrd charging him with manufacturing, distributing, and possessing with intent to distribute heroin in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and with possession of body armor as a person previously convicted of a crime of violence in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20931\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Byrd pled not guilty and promptly moved to suppress all evidence obtained subsequent to the September 17, 2014 traffic stop. The Honorable William W. Caldwell convened suppression hearings on June 30 and July 8, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In denying Byrd's motion to suppress, Judge Caldwell determined that Byrd lacked standing to challenge the search of the rental vehicle despite being the sole occupant because he had no expectation of privacy in the rental vehicle as he was not listed on the rental agreement; that Trooper Long initiated a lawful traffic stop of the vehicle; and that Trooper Long developed reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity to justify expanding the scope of the inquiry beyond the initial reason for the stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Byrd\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:14-CR-321,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205038455\">\n    2015 WL 5038455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-4 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 26, 2015). The Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

App'x 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2017) (nonprecedential).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Supreme Court granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   and reversed. The Court held that a person \"in otherwise lawful possession and control of a rental car has a reasonable expectation of privacy in it even if the rental agreement does not list him or her as an authorized driver.\"\n   <em>\n    Byrd v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 584 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611477\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1518/#p1524\">\n    138 S.

The Court identified two issues to be considered on remand to the Third Circuit: (1) whether an individual who \"intentionally uses a third party to procure a rental car by a fraudulent scheme for the purpose of committing a crime is no better situated than a car thief\" as pertains the existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental vehicle; and (2) whether probable cause \"justified the search in any event.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611477\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1518/#p1524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611477\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1518/#p1524\">\n    at 1531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Third Circuit further remanded the case and identified a third issue for consideration: whether Byrd consented to the search.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We convened a suppression hearing on February 28, 2019. Byrd offered an additional exhibit into the record, but the parties presented no testimony or argument.

Pertinent to this analysis are the following factors: the individual's age, education, and intelligence; whether law enforcement advised the individual of his or her constitutional rights; the length and setting of the encounter; the frequency and duration of the questioning; the parties' verbal and nonverbal conduct; and any use of physical punishment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172008\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/218/#p219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is clear from the record that Byrd did not freely and voluntarily consent to the search of the rental car. After Byrd exited the vehicle, Trooper Long repeatedly asked him for consent to search it. (6/30/15 Tr. 23:6-12, 24:1-6; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:53:02-18:53:42). Byrd offered to retrieve a blunt from the vehicle for the troopers, (6/30/15 Tr. 93:3-8), but at no point granted them consent to search.\n   <em>\n    Per contra\n   </em>\n   , Byrd unequivocally responded, \"don't search my car\" and \"I don't want you to search it.\" (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:54:12-18:54:23, 18:54:40-18:54:46). Trooper Long admitted that Byrd never consented to the search after offering to retrieve the blunt from the vehicle. (6/30/15 Tr. 96:9-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The government contends that Byrd eventually consented to a search of the rental vehicle. (Doc. 108 at 11). Even if Byrd eventually consented, such consent is invalidated by the troopers' claim of lawful authority to search without Byrd's consent. Trooper Long informed Byrd that he was not authorized to drive the vehicle according to the rental agreement, (Def. Ex. 11 at 18:52:50-18:53:02), and explained that the troopers could therefore search the vehicle without consent or probable cause because Byrd lacked an expectation of privacy\n   therein, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:55:10-18:55:30). At no point on the surveillance video of the traffic stop can Byrd be heard giving clear consent to search. And regardless of whether Byrd ultimately relented and permitted the troopers to search, such permission is tainted by the troopers' claim that, under the circumstances, they could lawfully search the vehicle without Byrd's consent. The troopers failed to obtain Byrd's free and voluntary consent to search. Accordingly, the warrantless search of the rental vehicle cannot be justified on grounds of consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Notably, Byrd never claims that he was referring to a standard Phillies Blunt Cigar. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 20-21). Byrd indicated the presence of a blunt shortly after Trooper Long asked if there was anything illegal in the rental vehicle. (6/30/15 Tr. 23:6-17; Def. Ex. 11 at 18:53:02-18:53:56).

The government cites to no authority suggesting that the color of a person's tongue is indicative of marijuana consumption, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Doc. 108), and the court's independent survey of caselaw revealed none. Byrd's admission to cocaine consumption is also excluded from our probable cause analysis as the troopers had already begun their search of the rental vehicle at the time of this admission.
