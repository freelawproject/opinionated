Plaintiff requested documents related to an October 2, 2107 event held by the DOE. Initially, the DOE did not respond to Plaintiff's FOIA request; but, following the initiation of this lawsuit, Defendant produced a total of 447 pages of records. The parties negotiated over redactions in and withholdings from those productions, leading to the release of additional documents and the removal of certain redactions. Redactions in 13 pages of documents remain at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant contends that these redactions are appropriate under FOIA Exemption 5 which protects \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). Plaintiff contends this Exemption does not apply and that the information is being wrongly withheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Currently before the Court are Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. Upon consideration of the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record as it currently stands, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and DENIES Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.

The redacted portions of this email chain consist of emails exchanged between various employees of the Defendant agency and an undisclosed attorney with the Office of the General Counsel. \"These emails contain information shared with that attorney for the purpose of soliciting legal advice, and the legal advice subsequently provided.\" Supplemental Dec. of Jill Siegelbaum, ECF No. 21-2, \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Having reviewed the redacted email chain as well as Defendant's Declaration, the Court finds that the emails were properly withheld. In the emails, an employee of the Defendant agency requests legal advice from an attorney concerning lists of potential invitees for Defendant's October 2, 2017 event. The emails further contain that attorney's legal conclusions concerning the invitation list. Dec. of Jill Siegelbaum, ECF No. 16-1, \u00b6 22. Accordingly, the redacted portions of the email chain, which involve the request and the receipt of legal advice, were properly withheld under the attorney client privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In response to this withholding, Plaintiff contends that Defendant should at least be required to release the name of the attorney who Defendant consulted for legal advice. Defendant argues that the name of the attorney was properly withheld because the \"attorney's practice area is known publicly [so that] [d]isclosure of the attorney's name would effectively release the substance of the ... communications.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527102\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/336/#p350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, Plaintiff claims that \"[n]o government attorney is so well-known and serves such a niche practice that the mere revelation of his name would indicate the\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   of the matter on which the client consulted the attorney, let alone the specific communications made by the client in seeking advice.\" Pl.'s Reply, ECF No. 23, 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Reviewing the unredacted documents as well as Defendant's Declarations, the Court concludes that disclosure of the attorney's name would disclose that Defendant acted on a specific \"motive ... in seeking representation.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

Disclosure of such information in this context creates the risk that agency clients may feel constrained from reaching out to legal counsel for required legal advice due to fear of public disclosure.

As such, the Court concludes that the name of the attorney is properly withheld under the attorney client privilege grounds of FOIA Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In opposition, Plaintiff cites two cases in which courts within this Circuit have required the release of attorneys' identities. First, in\n   <em>\n    Indian Law Resource Center v. Department of the Interior\n   </em>\n   , 477 F. supp. 144 (D.D.C. 1979), the court explained that attorney client privilege \"does not cover the identity of a client or attorney\" absent \"exceptional circumstances.\" 477 F. Supp. at 149. But,\n   <em>\n    Indian Law Resource Center\n   </em>\n   was decided by a district court and is not binding on this Court. Additionally, the case is distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Indian Law Resource Center\n   </em>\n   , the court found that disclosure of the attorneys' identities would not \"prejudice a confidential communication.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Conversely, here, the Court finds that release of the attorney's identity risks revealing privileged information about the nature of the services rendered. Plaintiff also cites\n   <em>\n    Ellsberg v.

In that case, the court required the Government to release the names of the Attorneys General who authorized certain wiretaps. But,\n   <em>\n    Ellsberg\n   </em>\n   was not a FOIA case. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Ellsberg\n   </em>\n   , the Government had conceded that it had no argument as to \"why the identities of the authorizing officials must be concealed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11320433,3642886\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/709/51/\">\n    709 F.2d at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, neither of the cases cited by Plaintiff is persuasive to the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, the Court does not find the redaction of the attorney's name proper on the basis of the attorney client privilege alone. The Court further finds that the redaction of the attorney's name is proper under the deliberative process privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The content of the email chain involves ongoing disagreements and discussions over the appropriate scope of the guest list for Defendant's October 2, 2017 event. As such, the Court finds that the emails are both pre-decisional and deliberative. Dec. of Jill Siegelbaum, ECF No. 16-1, \u00b6 24. These emails, demonstrating Defendant's decision-making process in finalizing an invitee list, are protected because \"[t]he deliberative process ground for Exemption 5 protects the decision-making process of an agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Brinton v.

Releasing the name of the attorney who was consulted as a part of Defendant's decision-making process would necessarily reveal information about Defendant's decision-making process. The release of such information could impair Defendant's deliberative process in the future by instilling a reluctance to explore all options and to request inter and intra departmental opinions. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the attorney's name was also appropriately withheld under Exemption 5's deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aaron v.

Documents OS 69\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Document OS 69 is an email chain between employees of Defendant and the undisclosed attorney with the Office of the Inspector General.

The Court agrees and finds that the redactions are proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendant has again redacted the subject line of the email chain. The subject line of this email chain is the same as that discussed for redactions on documents OS 8-10. As before, the Court finds that the subject line of the email chain was properly withheld under the attorney-client privilege as its disclosure would reveal the client's motivation in seeking legal advice.\n   <em>\n    See Supra\n   </em>\n   Sec. III.A. Accordingly, the Court finds that the subject line of the email was properly withheld under the attorney client privilege ground of FOIA Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendant also redacted the first line of the first email on the chain. This portion of the email reflects communications between Defendant's employees debating the scope of the guest list for Defendant's October 2, 2017 event. Dec. of Jill Siegelbaum, ECF No. 16-1, \u00b6 24. The redacted information is pre-decisional as a decision on the scope of the invitee list for the event had not yet been finalized.

Supplemental Dec. of Jill Siegelbaum, ECF No. 21-2, \u00b6 2.

Instead, Plaintiff challenges only the redaction of the subject lines and the name of the attorney sender/recipient for these documents. Pl.'s Mot., ECF No. 18, 1 n.1. For reasons that have already been given, the Court finds that these redactions are appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant redacted information from each of these documents relying on both the attorney client privilege and the deliberative process privilege grounds of FOIA Exemption 5. As Defendant explained, the \"redacted portions of this internal email chain, including the identity of one of the participants, consist of deliberations and attorney/client consultations regarding potential lists of external invitees to a Departmental event.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, ECF No. 16-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Considering first the subject line of the emails, the Court finds that this information was properly withheld under the attorney client privilege.\n   <em>\n    See Supra\n   </em>\n   Sec.

The subject line of the emails does more than reveal the general subject matter of the attorney client consultations. Instead, based on Defendant's Declaration and the Court's own inspection, the subject line of the emails is sufficiently detailed to reveal the specific motivations behind Defendant's request for legal counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Dec. of Jill Siegelbaum, ECF No. 21-2, \u00b6 4 (\"The subject lines ... contain, in their entirety, the specific topic of the deliberations and legal advice sought from and provided by the attorney.\").

Accordingly, this information is properly withheld under the attorney client privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, the Court concludes that Defendant has an even stronger argument\n   for withholding the name of the attorney under the deliberative process privilege. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held that, under the deliberative process privilege, documents as well as the names of their authors may be withheld if the documents are pre-decisional and deliberative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"627296,3510371\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/636/600/\">\n    636 F.2d at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (withholding names of attorneys who authored requested legal advice under the deliberative process privilege);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aaron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%2013253641\">\n    2011 WL 13253641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *8 (\"This Circuit has recognized that if a document is deliberative in nature, the identity of the author is also privileged.\"). Withholding the names of the authors of pre-decisional and deliberative documents fulfills the purposes of the deliberative process privilege by protecting Defendant's decision-making process which could be chilled by disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, the withheld emails concern deliberations pertaining to the scope of the invitee list for Defendant's event. At the time the emails were sent, the invitee list was in flux and not finalized; as such, the emails were pre-decisional. Additionally, the content of the emails concerns a debate about who should and should not be invited to the event, thus making the emails deliberative. Because the emails were properly withheld under the deliberative process privilege, the Court finds that the name of the author, in this case an attorney, was also properly withheld.\n   <em>\n    See Supra\n   </em>\n   Sec. III.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to documents OS 307-08, 309, 310, and 311-12, Plaintiff challenges only the redaction of the emails' subject lines and the name of the attorney sender/recipient. Having reviewed the redacted information, as well as the parties' arguments and attached Declarations, the Court concludes that this information was properly withheld under the attorney client privilege and deliberative process privilege grounds of FOIA Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Document OS 313\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant also redacted a portion of an email chain on Document OS 313.

The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In the redacted section of the email, an employee of Defendant sent an email to other departmental employees responding to an issue concerning the implementation of guidance sent by Executive Office of the President Administrator Neomi Rao. At the time that the email was sent, Defendant had not finalized its response to the guidance from Administrator Rao, thus making the email pre-decisional. Additionally, the redacted information contains ideas for how best to respond to Administrator Rao's guidance, thus making the information deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court concludes that the redacted information \"reflect[s] deliberations comprising the process by which government policy is formulated.\"\n   <em>\n    Mead Data\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n    566 F.2d at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The email was sent in response to guidance from Administrator Rao concerning Defendant's October 2, 2017 event. Administrator Rao indicated that departmental employees should contact Ms. Moore with any questions regarding her guidance for the event. Following Administrator Rao's suggestion, Mr. Eitel emailed Ms. Moore with potential complications posed by the implementation of Administrator Rao's guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As such, the Court finds that the redacted email was deliberative in nature because \"it reflects the give-and-take of the consultative process.\"\n   <em>\n    Coastal States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Administrator Rao, an employee with the Executive Office of the President, provided Defendant with guidance for its October 2, 2017 event. In reaction, Mr. Eitel emailed another employee within the Executive Office of the President regarding complications arising from that guidance and a potential solution. The Court finds that the redacted portion of the email reflects the type of agency decision-making process that is protected under the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court further finds that the redacted email was also pre-decisional. In the redacted portion of the email, Defendant presented a solution to the potential complication posed by Administrator Rao's guidance. However, it does not appear that this solution was finalized. Instead, the solution was part of a back-and-forth between Defendant and the Executive Office of the President in order to ensure that the structure of the event was tailored to the requirements of both Defendant and the Executive Office of the President. In reaching the conclusion that the email was pre-decisional, the Court is guided by its own review of the redacted email as well\n   as the Declaration of Jill Siegelbaum attached to Defendant's ex parte, under seal addendum providing further explanation as to how the email predated a formal decision on the potential impact of Administrator Rao's guidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs., Inc. v.

Additionally, the email was sent from the Executive Office of the President to Defendant in an effort to mutually agree upon a final invitee list.

A separate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The Court's consideration has focused on the unredacted records which the Court viewed in camera and on the following documents:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n    \u2022 Def.'s Mot. for Summary Judgment, ECF No. [16] (\"Def.'s Mot.\");\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n    \u2022 Pl.'s Cross Mot. for Summary Judgment, ECF No. [18] (\"Pl.'s Mot.\");\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    \u2022 Def.'s Reply in Support of its Mot. for Summary Judgment and Opp'n to Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summary Judgment, ECF No. [21] (\"Def.'s Reply\");\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    \u2022 Pl.'s Reply Memorandum in Further Support of Pl.'s Cross Mot. for Summary Judgment, ECF No. [23] (\"Pl.'s Reply\"); and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n    \u2022 Def.'s Addendum in Support of its Mot. for Summary Judgment (\"Def.'s Addendum\") (filed ex parte and under seal).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    In an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument in this action would not be of assistance in rendering a decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    LCvR 7(f).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Defendant also redacted email addresses on at least three pages of documents pursuant to FOIA Exemption 6 which allows government agencies to withhold \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(6). However, Plaintiff does not challenge Defendant's redactions pursuant to FOIA Exemption 6. Pl.'s Mot., ECF No. 18, 1 n.1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    In its Reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendant \"has not made any argument about the applicability of the deliberative process privilege to these documents and thus the court may treat the argument as conceded.\" Pl.'s Reply, ECF No. 23, 5 n.3. While Defendant's Reply is not a model of clarity, it does refer to Defendant's Declarations and\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    Index which both support the withholding under the deliberative process privilege. Accordingly, the Court will consider the deliberative process privilege as a ground for redacting the relevant information.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
