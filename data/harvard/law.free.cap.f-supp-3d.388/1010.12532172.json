Access to Abortion in Northern Indiana\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Indiana currently has six licensed abortion clinics. Three are located in Indianapolis, at the center of the state. One is located in Lafayette, northwest of Indianapolis and approximately one third of the way between Indianapolis and Chicago. One is located in Bloomington, southwest of Indianapolis and approximately halfway between Indianapolis and Indiana's southern border. One is located in Merrillville, in the northwest corner of the state close to Chicago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   South Bend, Indiana's fourth most populous city, is located north of Indianapolis near the Indiana-Michigan state line and approximately halfway between Indiana's western and eastern borders. It is home to two universities, Indiana University South Bend and the University of Notre Dame, as well as several smaller colleges, including St. Mary's College. South Bend is approximately 65 miles from Merrillville, 107 miles from Lafayette, 150 miles from Indianapolis, and 199 miles from Bloomington. Fort Wayne, Indiana's second most populous city after Indianapolis, lies in the northeastern corner of the state near the Indiana-Ohio state line and is approximately 86 miles from South Bend, 114 miles from Lafayette, 124 miles from Merrillville, 126 miles from Indianapolis, and 176 miles from Bloomington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There is an unmet demand for abortion services in and around South Bend, and more broadly in north-central and northeastern Indiana. That is, there are women living in these areas who desire to terminate their pregnancies but, in Indiana, cannot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Ex. 1, \u00b6 35 (Cowett Decl.) (\"WWHA is trying to open a clinic in South Bend because abortion access is very limited in northern Indiana.... [As an abortion provider in Chicago,] [a]t least 20% of [Cowett's] patients are from out of state, including Indiana.\"); Pls.' Ex. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 32 (Hagstrom Miller Decl.) (\"Based on ... outreach [from a group of local physicians, academics, and activists] and [WWHA's] own independent research, [WWHA] determined that South Bend is an underserved community. There is substantial demand for abortion care in the region, but no local providers.\"), 65 (\"Nearly all the physicians to whom [WWHA] reached out [to serve as the South Bend Clinic's backup doctor] were supportive of WWHA's plans to open an abortion clinic in South Bend[.]\"); Pls.' Ex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   5, \u00b6\u00b6 12 (Guerrero Decl.) (Plaintiff All-Options, Inc., has \"facilitated rides\" to abortion providers for women seeking abortions in South Bend but is \"unable to meet the transportation needs of all people in northern Indiana seeking abortion.\"), 17 (\"The barriers [Plaintiff All Options's] clients face make[ ] it difficult, and sometimes impossible, for them to obtain abortion care in Indiana.\"); Pls.'

Many of these students travel to Chicago[.]\"); Pls.' Ex. 7, \u00b6 14 (Stecker Decl.) (\"Many physicians [WWHA] reached out to [to serve as the South Bend Clinic's backup doctor] were very supportive of WWHA opening an abortion clinic in South Bend.

(Unless the South Bend Clinic opens, \"[a]t worst, [abortion care] will be for[e]gone altogether.\"); Defs.' Ex. 1, 71:14-19 (Hagstrom Miller Dep.) (\"[WWHA] ha[s] formed relationships in South Bend with many people who've lived in the community for a long time, and [Hagstrom Miller] know[s] that having a safe abortion facility in that community would meet a need in Northern Indiana that's currently not being met[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Why the demand for abortion care in north-central and northeastern Indiana cannot be met by the six extant Indiana abortion clinics may be traced to a confluence of factors, though the shortest correct answer, as often, is power. It can be difficult for federal judges and federal litigators, from our comfortable vantage points, to understand how completely the everyday life of another may be outside of her control-but we must try to understand it. For women in northern Indiana who enjoy ample financial means, supportive personal relationships, and power over their own conditions of labor and movement, the scarcity of abortion access there likely presents an insubstantial burden. But many women in these areas (as in most) do not enjoy those advantages, and lacking even one of them can cause substantial difficulties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Ex. 2, \u00b6 14; Pls.' Ex. 3, \u00b6 32; Pls.' Ex. 6, \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The primary burden is travel. No direct lines of public transportation connect South Bend to Merrillville, Indianapolis, Lafayette, or Bloomington. Thus, reliable private transportation is almost required to make the minimum 130-mile, maximum 398-mile, round trip. Naturally the poorer the patient the less likely that such reliable private transportation is available. The well known vagaries of weather- and road conditions in northern Indiana can make the extent of the travel burden difficult to anticipate precisely, especially when coupled with unreliable transportation. This unpredictability in turn increases the difficulty of making all other necessary arrangements, as detailed below. Moreover, because \"patients usually begin passing the pregnancy between one and four hours after taking the misoprostol, the second medication in the medical abortion regimen[,]\" medical-abortion patients driving long distances to obtain the abortion may be \"le[ft] ... to cramp and bleed en route to home.\" Pls.' Ex. 1, \u00b6 18. Finally, requiring women seeking abortions to leave their communities causes in some feelings of criminalization or ostracization. Pls.' Ex. 6, \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The travel burden increases the overall cost of the procedure, which is substantial for those on fixed or limited incomes, for whom \"[u]nexpected expenses are difficult to manage[,]\" Pls.' Ex. 2, \u00b6 13; those without private health insurance covering abortion; and those on Indiana's low-income health insurance program, \"which cover[s] abortions only in very limited circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Pls.' Ex. 5, \u00b6 9. As many as twenty northern Indiana clients of Plaintiff All Options \"have been unable to pay rent or utility bills due to having to pay for abortion care[.]\" Defs.' Ex. 18, 37:6-15. Five have pawned belongings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   37:16-22. Some have taken out short-term \"payday\" loans at confiscatory interest rates. As abortion costs (as well as risks) increase with gestation, even minor delays in obtaining an abortion can increase costs significantly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Ex. 5, \u00b6 16; Defs.' Ex. 18, 43:2-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The impacts of the travel burden are compounded by a mandatory eighteen-hour waiting period, the statutory basis for which is discussed in Part III,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . The upshot is, a woman seeking a medical abortion must visit the abortion clinic twice, once at least eighteen hours before receiving the medications, and again to receive them. Thus, the trip must be undertaken twice over two or more days, or overnight accommodations near the clinic must be secured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   These burdens are compounded again if the woman seeking an abortion is, as nearly all persons are, responsible to and for others. If she has dependent children, or dependents of any description, they must be accommodated on the trip or at home during her absence. If she is employed, her employer must be asked for time off work. If she is a student, she must miss class or an exam. If she is married or in a close relationship, she will be expected to explain her absence to her spouse or partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   By all accounts, South Bend appears to be an inhospitable environment for abortion seekers and abortion providers. An unmarried woman may encounter difficulty obtaining even contraception there.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Ex. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 2 (recounting physician advice that IUDs appropriate only for married women and that having multiple sexual partners causes infertility), 16 (student at university opposed to contraception has difficulty accessing birth control with university-sponsored insurance, increasing likelihood of unintended pregnancy). That is in part why WWHA seeks to operate there, as will be discussed further. Part V,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . Dr. Ellyn Stecker practiced ob/gyn medicine in South Bend for thirty-five years and finds \"pervasive\" hostility to abortion there. Pls.' Ex. 7, \u00b6 7. She furnishes anecdotal examples of that hostility and its consequences, both for abortion seekers and abortion providers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9, 15-18, 19 (\"leads providers in our community to fear counseling pregnant patients about their options\").\n   <em>\n    Also\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Ex. 2, \u00b6 17; Pls.' Ex. 3, \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This social context exacerbates the burdens on women seeking abortions who rely on and are responsible to others. Child care (or other dependent care) is more difficult to find or is foregone entirely because \"there's a lot of folks that don't know who to ask[,]\" particularly for two days' care. Defs.' Ex. 18, 41:11-15. An employer's, professor's, or partner's hostility to abortion may increase the necessity for, and risks of, \"sneak[ing] around\" them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

WWHA's License Applications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   WWHA was founded under the name \"Whole Woman's Advocacy Alliance\" by Amy Hagstrom Miller in 2014. It owns and operates two abortion clinics: one in Charlottesville, Virginia, and one in Austin, Texas. WWHA is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of Texas. It is governed by a board of directors, whose members are elected by majority vote of the board to serve three-year terms, and of which Hagstrom Miller has served as the chair since WWHA's inception. Today the board has nine members; it had three at the time of formation, all initially appointed by Hagstrom Miller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Hagstrom Miller is also WWHA's president and CEO. WWHA's bylaws provide that the president and CEO,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   subject to the supervision of the Board of Directors, shall have general management and control of the business and property of the Corporation in the ordinary course of its business with all such powers with respect to such general management and control as may be reasonably incident to such responsibilities, including, but not limited to, the power to employ, discharge, or suspend employees and agents of the Corporation, to fix the compensation of employees and agents, and to suspend, with or without cause, any officer of the Corporation pending final action by the Board of Directors with respect to continued suspension, removal, or reinstatement of such officer. The President may, without limitation, agree upon and execute all division and transfer orders, bonds, contracts, and other obligations in the name of the Corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Pls.' Ex. 10, at 55. A WWHA board member described Hagstrom Miller's duties as CEO as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [v]ery similar to [those of] ... an executive director; in charge of everything, making sure that the whole entire organization runs smoothly whether it be in finances or in compliance or in medical care or in ordering supplies. It can be a large area of responsibility or down to details, but just making sure that it happens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defs.' Ex. 2, at 161. The board members say they take their oversight responsibilities of Hagstrom Miller seriously but have never overruled one of her decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Before founding WWHA in 2014, Hagstrom Miller had a substantial history of advocacy and activity related to abortion. In 2003 Hagstrom Miller began operating an abortion clinic in Austin, Texas, under the name \"Whole Woman's Health.\" In 2007 Hagstrom Miller founded Whole Woman's Health, LLC (WWH), a for-profit limited liability company organized, like WWHA, under the laws of Texas. WWH is a \"healthcare management company,\" Defs.' Ex. 1, at 16, which contracts with different abortion providers, including WWHA, to provide \"healthcare management services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17. These include services related to bookkeeping, human resources, regulatory compliance, public relations, and marketing. Pls.' Ex. 8, at 5. Other for-profit limited liability companies operate abortion clinics in various American cities under the name \"Whole Woman's Health.\" For example, Whole Woman's Health of Baltimore, LLC, owns and operates an abortion clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. These LLCs too contract with WWH for health care management services. All the LLCs are held by an entity, which is either an LLC or a corporation, called The Booyah Group (\"Booyah\"), named for a communally prepared stew. Booyah is in turn wholly owned by Hagstrom Miller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Confusingly, it appears that Hagstrom Miller has used and continues to use \"Whole Woman's Health\" as an umbrella term or marketing slogan without referring to any specific entity or organization. She states that, today, \"Whole Woman's Health\" is \"a consortium of limited liability companies [and perhaps one corporation],\" though it is unclear whether this \"consortium\" has any legal status and, if so, what that status is. Pls.' Ex. 3, at 3. For example, in this Court and in the administrative proceedings on WWHA's license applications, Plaintiffs have adverted repeatedly to the fact that \"Whole Woman's Health\" was a plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n    136 S.

The complaint in that matter identified the plaintiff\n   simply as \"Whole Woman's Health,\" averring that \"Whole Woman's Health\" operated abortion clinics in Fort Worth, San Antonio, and McAllen, Texas.\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health v. Lakey\n   </em>\n   , 1:14-cv-00284-LY, Dkt. 1, \u00b6 16. But unless \"Whole Woman's Health\" has undergone significant structural changes since 2014 (for which there is no evidence), those clinics were in fact operated by the entities Whole Woman's Health of Fort Worth, LLC; Whole Woman's Health of San Antonio, LLC; and Whole Woman's Health of McAllen, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Hagstrom Miller described her decision to found WWHA as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   I had the idea to found a non-profit organization really directly [stemming] from my experience in the field noticing that as we had increased laws and increased ... restrictions on women's access to abortion care services, it was harder and harder to keep the doors open of the clinics, not only the clinics I had managed through Whole Woman's Health but watching clinics in Texas and Virginia and many other states close as a byproduct of targeted regulation of abortion providers. It became much more difficult to keep a practice open ... like a regular medical practice from patient receipts only, and I saw that we needed to figure out a path for being able to invite donors and grantors and supporters to be able to support us so that we could weather the regulatory interference and still be able to keep the doors open.... So [WWHA was conceived as] a way to be sustainable in states that had a lot of regulation, whereas ... in other places like Maryland and Minnesota where we don't have a similar sort of laws that interfere with the practice, the practice is able to run much more like a normal doctor's office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defs.' Ex. 2, at 242. In addition to providing abortions, WWHA's mission is in part to combat the \"lexicon of shame and stigma that really surrounds abortion in this country[,]\" which it aims to do by having \"really open and honest conversations about abortion\" and presenting a favorable picture of abortion provision in communities where it is most stigmatized. Defs.' Ex. 2, at 242.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In 2014, a group of local physicians, academics, and activists invited Hagstrom Miller and WWHA to consider operating a clinic in South Bend. WWHA determined that South Bend perfectly fit its bill for difficult legal and social environments in which to operate. \"[A]ccess to abortion [there] is difficult, ... and also it is an unfriendly place for providers .... [W]e wanted to go to places where it was unfriendly.\" Defs.' Ex. 2, at 164. After making the necessary preliminary arrangements over the course of a year or more, WWHA submitted to the Department an application for a license to operate the South Bend Clinic on August 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On September 21, 2017, the Department, by Randy Snyder, director of the Department's acute care division, asked John Bucy, one of WWHA's attorneys and a member of its board, to submit a revised application curing four minor deficiencies, including the failure to name a proposed clinic administrator. Bucy submitted a revised application on October 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Around this time, Trent Fox, the Department's chief of staff, began taking an active role in the Department's review of WWHA's application. Fox averred that his intervention was spurred by the fact that Indiana's existing abortion providers were well known to the Department but WWHA was not; it was \"a new entity coming into the state ....\" Defs.' Ex. 2, at 132. Moreover, the name of the proposed clinic administrator supplied by Bucy \"raised some red flags ....\" Defs.' Ex. 2, at 125. The clinic administrator was Liam Morley, who\n   was known to the Department for having had a \"connection,\" either \"as an employee or administrator,\" with Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, \"who in recent years [in or about 2016] ...surrendered his abortion clinic license and had his medical license suspended for serious violations[.]\" Defs.' Ex. 3, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Contemporaneously, the Department received a letter from then state Senator Joseph C. Zakas, dated October 18, 2017. It was addressed to the governor and had been forwarded by him to Box, and by her to Department staff. The letter noted WWHA's attempts to operate the South Bend Clinic, and warned,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   I wanted you know the depth of concern from many people about this organization's application. I received over 200 messages from my constituents in one weekend after the news broke [of WWHA's application via an article in the local newspaper].... It appears that the company in question, Whole Woman's Health, has had a history of health violations at other clinics. Further, the article indicates that [Morley] used to work [for Klopfer]. Indiana has a long history of being a state that stands for pro-life policies. Many believe your administration will reflect that history. Thank you, Governor, for your consideration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Pls.' Ex. 10, at 74. Over the following weeks, similar letters arrived from state Senators Erin Houchin and Ryan Mishler, disparaging the safety record of \"Whole Woman's Health\"; alleging that \"[w]hile [WWHA] would like [the Department] and the public to believe they have women's interests at heart, the record of this Texas-based company shows otherwise[,]\" Pls.' Ex. 10, at 75; and by turns raising alarm at \"this threat to women's health in Indiana,\" Pls.' Ex. 10, at 77, and invoking \"the values of Hoosiers who respect the right to life ....\" Pls.' Ex. 10, at 76. Plaintiffs vigorously maintain that each factual allegation made in these letters was \"completely and utterly false[,]\" and Defendants have not argued the contrary. Pls.' Ex. 3, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Fox began searching \"Whole Woman's Health\" on the Internet. He found www.wholewomanshealth.com, the website for the \"Whole Woman's Health\" \"consortium\" of companies. The website supplied a list of \"Our Clinics,\" featuring eight \"Whole Woman's Health\"-branded abortion clinics across the country; the South Bend Clinic was listed as the ninth. (More precisely, the website is owned and operated by WWH, a fact the website discloses. Plaintiffs have suggested that the website features \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinics as part of the marketing services WWH provides to the different \"Whole Woman's Health\" LLCs under their management services contracts. But Fox was unaware of these distinctions as he performed his searches and the website does not appear to make them itself.) Fox also found a number of public statements by Hagstrom Miller, listed on the license application as WWHA's president, referring similarly to \"Whole Woman's Health\" or \"our\" abortion clinics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Spurred by the senators' letters and his own research, Fox had the Department propound requests for additional information to WWHA on October 27, 2017. Information was sought on eleven points, some with subparts, with a 45-day time limit in which to respond. The first request was as follows: \"Provide a complete ownership structure or description pertaining to the applicant, including, but not limited to, any individuals and/or any parent, affiliate or subsidiary organizations. Please list full legal names and addresses, and for entities, list the type of entity and the state of incorporation/organization.\" Pls.' Ex. 10, at 34. The second request was as follows: \"Provide a list of all the abortion and health care [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] facilities currently operated\n   by the applicant, including its parent, affiliate or subsidiary organizations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   At the time, there was no applicable statutory definition of \"affiliate.\" But when the requests were drafted, Fox had \"some general idea\" of what he meant by \"affiliate\": \"We searched through the Indiana Code and I looked myself as well and there were a few different [definitions] throughout [the] Indiana [C]ode, but the theme I was finding in every definition was there was a common control by one person or entity.\" Defs.' Ex. 2, at 127. This general idea or theme was not communicated to WHHA, however. At oral argument on Plaintiffs' motion, Defendants suggested that the Department's failure to furnish guidance to WWHA on this point was \"part of [its] investigative technique,\" Tr. 53:23-24, designed to test whether WWHA would disclose the \"affiliates\" the Department had already deemed it to have by virtue of the common control exercised by Hagstrom Miller or \"Whole Woman's Health.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   WWHA failed the test. On December 8, 2017, WWHA by Bucy responded to the first request as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   [WWHA] is a Texas nonprofit corporation. It does not have members.

Ex. 10, at 38. Bucy responded to the Department's second request by referring the Department to his answers to the first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Fox considered WWHA's response, identifying two additional clinics and denying the existence of any affiliates, in light of the senators' letters and in light of the seemingly unitary public face of \"Whole Woman's Health\" with its eight clinics, the South Bend Clinic to be the ninth. In Fox's view,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   the levels of confusion are now in the-the information was still inconsistent with-and the information we received from communications laying out the possible violations in these other clinics, we just didn't have an answer for.

Ex. 2, at 129. Fox concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   At this point we simply didn't have enough information to justify granting the license. When we determined the follow-up questions to ask and when two clinics were disclosed, we had conflicting information, and on-when we see eight clinics listed and we are notified of two, it simply doesn't add up to me. Now, that was a question I couldn't answer and if I can't answer that question, then I just can't justify granting the license[.] ... I mean at this point [WWHA's response] is not only inconsistent, we have\n   determined it to be inaccurate. The second part of th[e] [response] creates a-I think a few other questions on our end when it refers to some of the board members of [WWHA] as we had asked for them to be identified, too, so when we look at this, the affiliate definition, this is where we determine that there are some other clinics out there affiliated and under the common control of Ms. Miller, and those were not disclosed and I couldn't-I simply couldn't answer that question either, so at this point we could not justify granting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defs.' Ex. 2, at 130. Fox understood himself and the Department to be under no duty to investigate the matter further or to ask WWHA specific questions about Hagstrom Miller or other \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   While Fox would later couch the Department's decision in terms of lack of information,\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Because WWHA was a nonprofit, Bucy argued, it had no owners and therefore no parent organization. It had no subsidiaries because it held no ownership interest in any other entity. While WWHA had disclosed its management services contract with WWH as well as its Texas and Virginia clinics, it had not disclosed the other \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinics managed by WWH under similar contracts because they were not operated or owned by WWHA. \"To the contrary,\" Bucy maintained, \"those other clinics are independent [companies] that are not controlled by [WWHA][.]\" Pls.'

Bucy cited definitions of \"affiliate\" given in certain provisions of the Indiana Code for business corporations and nonprofit corporations, noting that both rested on the notion of control,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2023-1-43-1\">\n    Ind.

Relying on these definitions (the Department would later point to this reliance as demonstrating that WWHA had understood all along what the Department meant by \"affiliate\"), Bucy argued that in no event was WWHA an affiliate of WWH because WWHA was controlled by its board and its board was not controlled by anyone else; and because WWHA, through its board, had no control over WWH. So, too, for the other \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinics which had management services agreements with WWH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   WWHA's administrative appeal was heard by an administrative law judge (ALJ) over two days, August 22 and 23, 2018. Substantial evidence, live and documentary, was presented by both sides relating to the progress of WWHA's license application and the Department's review of it; Hagstrom Miller and her relationship to WWHA, WWH, and the other \"Whole Woman's Health\" entities; and the relationship of those entities to one another-all towards a determination of whether WWHA had \"affiliates\" because both it and other \"Whole Woman's Health\" LLCs shared a common controller in Hagstrom Miller, and thus whether WWHA had truthfully represented that it had none. The Department pointed the unitary public face of \"Whole Woman's Health\"; Hagstrom Miller's undisputed \"control\" over the \"Whole Woman's Health\" LLCs of which she (through Booyah) is the sole member; and Hagstrom Miller's allegedly dominant position with respect to WWHA's board. WWHA pointed to the board's decisional independence, especially as embodied in WWHA's conflict-of-interest policy, under which Hagstrom Miller recuses herself from decisions involving WWH; and to the willingness of Hagstrom Miller and \"Whole Woman's Health\" to expose themselves to public scrutiny as exemplified by the\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In a recommended order of September 14, 2018, the ALJ framed the question before her as, \"Was [WWHA's] revised Application For License To Operate An Abortion Clinic of October 6, 2017 regarding a clinic in South Bend incomplete and/or inaccurate?\" Pls.' Ex. 10, at 108. The ALJ concluded it was not. Specifically, the ALJ found that there was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   no evidence provided during the proceedings that the responses provided by WWHA to [the Department's] October 27, 2017 eleven (11) questions were inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading. WWHA demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that their responses provided to [the Department's] request for additional information on October 27, 2017 was complete and accurate. [The Department] provided no evidence that they specifically inquired of WWHA regarding concerns that were raised based upon submissions to [the Department] by Indiana Senators in October and November 2017, or that were raised by [Department] staff's own 'informal investigation.' Therefore [the Department] has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that WWHA lacks a reputable and responsible character and should be denied a license for the South Bend clinic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Pls.' Ex. 10, at 108-09. The ALJ recommended that the Department's denial be reversed and that a license to operate the South Bend Clinic be granted to WWHA \"based [on] the information contained in the Revised Application of October 6, 2017, the December [8], 2017 information to [the Department] from WWHA, and the evidence from the proceedings.\" Pls.' Ex. 10, at 109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Department's lawyers were apparently bewildered by the ALJ's recommended order. Clearly, they thought, they had put on at least some evidence that Hagstrom Miller was a common controller of both WWHA and the other \"Whole Woman's Health\" entities; that WWHA therefore had \"affiliates\"; and that therefore WWHA's December 8, 2017, responses had been inaccurate. Further, though both sides had maintained that WWHA's veracity or lack of it turned on the definition of \"affiliate\" and on the subsidiary definition of \"control,\" the Department's lawyers were surprised to find a discussion of that issue nowhere in the ALJ's recommended order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Given that the ALJ did not answer the question whether WWHA had \"affiliates\" as a matter of state law, it appears her ruling addressed whether WWHA had\n   <em>\n    knowingly\n   </em>\n   provided inaccurate information to the Department. That is particularly evident in the ALJ's ruling on the \"reputable and responsible character\" requirement that, because WWHA had no specific notice of what information the Department was seeking, the Department had not shown WWHA lacked a reputable and responsible character. The implied major premise is that knowingly misleading the Department constitutes lack of reputable and responsible character. If that was the ALJ's approach, it appears to us to be an eminently sensible one, as the strictly interpretive question in which the parties mired themselves of whether other \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinics satisfied an unannounced definition of \"affiliate\" grew ever more remote from the question of whether the Department ought to have granted WWHA a license to operate the South Bend Clinic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Department objected to the ALJ's proposed order and brought the matter before the Department's three-member Appeals Panel, its final decisionmaker. The Appeals Panel conducted a hearing on November 28, 2018, during which the parties rehearsed the same arguments as those before the ALJ as to whether Hagstrom Miller \"controls\" WWHA. By written order issued on December 18, 2018, by a two-to-one vote the Appeals Panel agreed with the Department that Hagstrom Miller does \"control\" WWHA. The Appeals Panel conceded that \"[c]ontrol is not defined in Indiana's abortion laws[,]\" Defs.' Ex. 2, at 114, but drew a definition from\n   <em>\n    Combs v.

Ex. 2, at 114.

Ex. 2, at 109-10. Accordingly, the Appeals Panel continued, given Hagstrom Miller's basically undisputed \"control\" of the other \"Whole Woman's Health\" LLCs, those LLCs and WWHA share a common controller and are therefore \"affiliates.\" Specifically, the Appeals Panel held,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Whole Woman's Health, LLC; Whole Woman's Health of McAllen, LLC; Whole Woman's Health of Fort Worth, LLC; Whole Woman's Health of Baltimore, LLC; Whole Woman's Health of the Twin Cities, LLC; Whole Woman's Health of San Antonio, LLC; and Whole Woman's Health of Peoria, LLC are affiliates\n   of Whole Woman's Health Alliance because those entities are under the common control of Amy Hagstrom Miller.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defs.'

By letter dated February 25, 2019, the Department requested among other things the following disclosures \"for each affiliate of WWHA identified\" in the Appeals Panel's order by March 15, 2019:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   [A]ll reports, complaints, forms, correspondence, and other documents that concern, mention, or relate to any investigation, inspection, or survey of the affiliate by any state or other regulatory authorities at any time since and including January 1, 2014[;] ... all forms, correspondence, reports, and other documents that concern, mention, or relate to any application(s) by the affiliate for licensure of or other permission to operate an abortion clinic at any time since and including January 1, 2014[;] ... all orders, submissions, correspondence and other documents that concern, mention, or relate to any regulatory or administrative enforcement action, or administrative, civil or criminal court action involving the affiliate at any time since and including January 1, 2014[;] ... the legal name and current address of each person who, at any time since and including January 1, 2014, has been an organizer, manager, director, owner, and/or officer of the affiliate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Pls.'

The Department's demands concerning Whole Woman's Health clinics are not only irrelevant to determining whether WWHA satisfies the requirements for licensure, but exceptionally broad and burdensome. For example, providing \"all orders, submissions, correspondence, and other documents that concern, mention, or relate\" to every case that Whole Woman's Health has filed challenging restrictive abortion laws ... would require the production not only of privileged communications, but hundreds of thousands of pages. Further, Whole Woman's Health clinics operate in five different states; they are regulated by multiple state and federal agencies. Identifying every document that \"concerns, mentions, or relates to\" inspections or surveys of those entities over a five year-period ... would take weeks of document review. Similarly, all \"copies of all forms, correspondence, reports, and other documents that concern, mention, or relate to any application(s) by the affiliate for licensure of or other permission to operate an abortion clinic at any time since and including January 1, 2014\" would take dozens of hours to identify, much less produce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Pls.'

That is true no matter whether continued application of the Licensing Law would involve excusing WWHA's lateness in failing to meet the deadline and resumption of the proceedings on WWHA's second application; a third application by WWHA, which would doubtlessly be subject to identical demands from the Department; or the Department's denial of the second application and refusal to entertain a third.

Indeed, the regulated enterprise may have the ability to clarify the meaning of the regulation by its own inquiry, or by resort to an administrative process. The Court has also expressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe. And the Court has recognized that a scienter requirement may mitigate a law's vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed.

There are three sets of distinct though interrelated benefits presented, which must be examined in light of their interrelation. First, there are the benefits to the state derived from the Department's enforcing its production demand of February 25, 2019. Defendants suggest those benefits run to the Department's capacity to determine whether WWHA has a reputable and responsible character. Br. Opp. 4-5, 36. Thus, second, there are the benefits to the state derived from the Department's determination of WWHA's reputable and responsible character as a condition of licensure. Third and finally, therefore, there are the benefits to the state in enforcing the licensure requirement against WWHA in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   We further divide the last-mentioned into those benefits derived from the licensure requirement as a whole, for the purposes of the due process claim, and, for the purposes of the equal protection claim, into those derived from the Licensing Law's challenged classifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The first of these challenged classifications is the Licensing Law's distinction between a health care provider who provides an abortion-inducing drug \"for the purposes of inducing an abortion\" and one who does so for another purpose.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2016-18-2-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 16-18-2-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .5(a)(2). The former requires\n   a license; the latter does not.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2016-18-2-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-21-2-10. Necessarily implied by this distinction is another between women seeking an abortion-inducing drug for the purposes of inducing an abortion, who are restricted to licensed providers, and women seeking an abortion-inducing drug for the purposes of treating miscarriages (the only nonabortion purpose of abortion-inducing drugs appearing in the record), who are unrestricted in their choice of provider. Br. Supp. 36. Thus, we ask what benefits accrue to the state by classifying abortion patients differently from miscarriage patients in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The second and third challenged classifications are in reality none at all, and again (without objection from Defendants) play fast and loose with the scope of the facial challenges pleaded in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 199. Plaintiffs maintain that the Licensing Law's five-patient floor \"treats the South Bend Clinic's first four medication abortion patients each year differently than its subsequent patients.\" Br. Supp. 36. It does not. WWHA intends to and, if permitted to, will almost certainly provide more than four medical abortions annually at the South Bend Clinic. The Licensing Law requires it to have a license to do so. Its first patient and its hundred-and-first patient are treated precisely equally in this respect: neither may obtain an abortion at the South Bend Clinic unless it is licensed. It defies credulity and common sense to suggest that WWHA will ask the South Bend Clinic's every fifth annual patient to please wait while it seeks a license or license renewal from the Department before treating her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The Licensing Law does treat classes of medical-abortion providers differently in this respect, but by seeking application of heightened scrutiny we understand Plaintiffs' to be raising their patients' equal protection rights, not their own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birth Control Ctrs., Inc. v.

This alleges not a class-based equal protection claim in the conventional sense but a \"class of one\" claim, in which a plaintiff alleges it has been arbitrarily singled out for oppressive treatment.\n   <em>\n    Engquist v.

First, the benefits to the state, specifically to the\n   Department's enforcement of the Licensing Law and the \"reputable and responsible character\" requirement, derived from the Department's enforcing its production demand of February 25, 2019, are not negligible, as Plaintiffs maintain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   There is no longer any room for confusion on the meaning of \"affiliate.\" That question has been settled, whether by the preclusive effect of the Appeals Panel's determination of WWHA's \"affiliates,\" as the Department apparently correctly believes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dev. Servs. Alts., Inc. v. Ind. Family &amp; Soc.

Code \u00a7 16-18-2-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .4. WWHA's \"affiliates\" are abortion clinics under the control of Hagstrom Miller. Plaintiffs tilt at windmills in steadfastly maintaining the contrary. In any event the correctness of that state-law determination \"can neither add to nor subtract from\" the constitutionality of the Department's conduct,\n   <em>\n    Snowden v. Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"301879\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/321/1/#p11\">\n    321 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"301879\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/321/1/#p11\">\n    64 S.Ct. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"301879\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/321/1/#p11\">\n    88 L.Ed. 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1944), which we must, and here do, evaluate only under the applicable constitutional standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   It is apparent that Hagstrom Miller is significantly involved in the governance and operation of WWHA, the board's formal decisional independence notwithstanding; that Hagstrom Miller is solely responsible for the other \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinics; and that in all areas other than this litigation (including the\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   litigation) the \"Whole Woman's Health\" \"consortium\" draws no such technical organizational distinctions as Plaintiffs now insist are controlling here. It cannot be said that how those clinics operate is not instructive as to how WWHA will operate the South Bend Clinic, nor to WWHA's \"reputable and responsible character.\" Information relating to other \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinics as demanded by the Department on February 25, 2019, is clearly germane to the Department's task and advances the Licensing Law's purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   To the benefits derived from such advancement we turn next. The \"reputable and responsible character\" requirement has obvious utility as an\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   credentialing mechanism. Plaintiffs have not argued (nor could they) that, in the abstract, the state gains nothing by licensing only those health care providers shown to have reputable and responsible characters in respects relevant to the provision of health care and to the soundness of the licensing procedure itself. (As discussed in relation to vagueness, Part I, Section A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence that the Department has yet applied the \"reputable and responsible character\" requirement in respects irrelevant to these concerns.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   On the facts of this case, however, the benefits derived from\n   <em>\n    further\n   </em>\n   application of the \"reputable and responsible character\" requirement appear slight. Defendants have come to know a great deal about WWHA and \"Whole Woman's Health\" since August 11, 2017, but nonetheless point to two areas they believe justify further inquiry. Defendants point to testimony given by Plaintiff Dr. Jeffrey Glazer in discovery on Plaintiffs' motion as suggesting that his treatment practices merit particular scrutiny, in furtherance of the state's interest in preserving the integrity of the medical profession. Plaintiffs stridently resist Defendants' characterization of Plaintiff Glazer's testimony. We agree with Plaintiffs that the evidence overall suggests that Plaintiff Glazer is a competent, responsible provider of ob/gyn care generally and abortion care specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   But the point as framed by Defendants is in any event of dubious relevance to Defendants' case. It is undisputed that\n   Plaintiff Glazer has provided medical abortions in Indiana subject to this state's (and others') physician and clinic licensure rules without a whisper of concern on the Department's part. As Indiana today has only six licensed clinics, it is not credible, and Defendants do not suggest, that Plaintiff Glazer's practice has only until now escaped the Department's notice. If Defendants have only in the course of this litigation unearthed causes for concern with Plaintiff Glazer's practice, that says little or nothing about the benefits derived from the Licensing Law as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Defendants contend next that \"specific identified evidence\" shows that other Whole Woman's Health clinics have failed to operate safely.\" Br. Opp. 28. That contention is not well supported. Defendants cite reports of inspections conducted by the Texas Department of State Health Services of three \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinics in Texas. Those reports assessed each clinic inspected with several deficiencies. According to Plaintiffs' unrebutted expert testimony, however, such deficiencies are \"common\" in the inspection of any health care facility (\"Indeed, it is extremely rare for an inspector not to find a deficiency during an inspection.\") and \"are not indicative of a threat to patient health and safety.\" Pls.' Reply Ex. 1, \u00b6 10. Deficiencies are cured through development and implementation of a plan of correction as a normal part of health-care-facility regulation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=410%20Ind.%20Admin.%20Code%2026\">\n    410 Ind. Admin.

Rather, \"[i]f a health inspection determined that patient health was being endangered, it would typically lead to a suspension or termination of a facility's license or accreditation standards.\" Pls.' Reply Ex. 1, \u00b6 12. And it is uncontested that no \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinic has had its license or accreditation revoked, save for one erroneous revocation in 2006 followed by corrective restoration within eight days at the \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinic in Beaumont, Texas. Pls.' Ex. 3, \u00b6 4. In any event, the relevance of other \"Whole Woman's Health\" clinics' standards of operation as a general matter notwithstanding, none of the particular cited deficiencies (such as keeping bleach and other cleaning chemicals in \"the laundry area (closed off only by a curtain),\" Defs.' Ex. 2, at 37) furnish a substantial basis for doubting WWHA's reputable and responsible character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Thus we turn to the benefits derived from applying the Licensing Law at all. We begin with those benefits as a general matter, as relates to Plaintiffs' due process claim. Foster avers that licensure \"enables [the Department] to enforce important safety and health regulations.\" Defs.' Ex. 2, \u00b6 7. (We note that, for the purposes of the instant motion, Plaintiffs have not challenged any of these regulations. We therefore assume them to be permissible.) Specifically, \"[l]icensure enables [the Department] to do regular surveys of abortion clinics, and to perform complaint investigations according to standardized protocols and criteria. Without licensure, [the Department] would be unable to perform such standardized surveys and investigations[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=410%20Ind.%20Admin.%20Code%2026\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=410%20Ind.%20Admin.%20Code%2026\">\n    \u00b6 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, \"[l]icensure also enables [the Department] to collect and update important information about abortion providers ....

Article 34 of title 16 of the Indiana Code deals exclusively with abortion and was codified in 1993. But licensure was not required of any abortion clinic from 1993 until 2005. Mifepristone having first been approved by FDA in 2000, licensure of clinics providing only medical abortions was not required until 2013 and the requirement could not for practical purposes be enforced until 2015. We are hard pressed to believe that article 34 simply lay dormant for twelve years (1993-2005, with respect to surgical-abortion providers) or thirteen years (2000-2013, with respect to medical-abortion providers). And it strains credulity to believe that for those periods abortion clinics in Indiana operated with \"little or no meaningful regulatory oversight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   For example, Defendants argue that licensure ensures that abortion providers \"follow the State's informed-consent and reporting requirements.\" Br. Opp. 20. But those requirements have been on the books since 1995 and 1973, respectively. Publicly available Department records of pregnancies terminated in Indiana stretch back until at least 1996.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ind. State Dep't of Health,\n   <em>\n    Indiana Induced Termination of Pregnancy Report (2000)\n   </em>\n   , tbl. 15,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.in.gov/isdh/reports/itp/2000/tbl15.html. As such records are generated from the fruits of the reporting requirement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ind. State Dep't of Health,\n   <em>\n    Terminated Pregnancy Reports\n   </em>\n   , https://www.in.gov/isdh/26843.htm, it appears that compliance with the reporting requirement has been reliably obtained for some time without resort to licensure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Defendants place great reliance on the Department's authority to inspect (or conduct \"surveys\" of) abortion clinics, but have not shown how that authority is contingent on the clinics' licensure. The statute says simply, \"[The Department] shall inspect an abortion clinic at least one (1) time per calendar year and may conduct a complaint inspection as needed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016-21-2-2\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 16-21-2-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .6. All that is required is for the Department to know where the clinic is located, a goal which licensure does achieve, but which could equally well be achieved by a registration requirement.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. 2, \u00b6 9 (\"Without licensure ..., it would be difficult and perhaps impossible for [the Department] to know where clinics are operating, who is running them, or what they are doing.\"). We discuss this further below in balancing the benefits and burdens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The most useful feature of a license appears to be the threat of its revocation as a means for preventing noncompliant abortion providers from persisting in their noncompliance. However, we cannot perceive what marginal benefit this\n   <em>\n    ex post\n   </em>\n   enforcement mechanism has over the similarly\n   <em>\n    ex post\n   </em>\n   enforcement mechanisms of prosecution for failing to comply with article 34,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016-34-2-7\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 16-34-2-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; physician-license suspension or revocation; or a civil action for medical negligence or other torts. Defendants point to the Klopfer case, but Klopfer was prevented from continuing his noncompliant abortion practice, not through revocation of the licenses of the clinics at which he practiced, but through suspension of his physician's license and criminal prosecution. Br. Opp. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   For purposes of Plaintiffs' due process claim, Defendants have shown little more than\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   marginal advancement, relative to pre-2013 law, of the state's legitimate interests in maternal health and\n   fetal life derived from requiring licensure as a condition of providing medical abortions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   For purposes of Plaintiffs' equal protection claim, Defendants' case is weaker yet. Here the state must justify its disparate treatment of, on one hand, women seeking an abortion-inducing drug for the purposes of inducing an abortion, and, on the other, women seeking an abortion-inducing drug for the purposes of treating a miscarriage. As the medical and physiological impacts are identical or practically identical in both cases, the state's interest in patient health falls away. The classification can be sustained only on the strength of the state's interest in fetal life, which operates in the abortion context but not in the miscarriage context. But that interest is advanced by licensure only to the extent enforcement of the informed-consent requirement is advanced, and, as we have already explained, the connection between the two is exceedingly tenuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Finally, Defendants gesture in the direction of, without quite asserting, the state's interest administering its own licensing and regulatory regimes on its own terms, an interest which would undoubtedly be advanced by permitting continued application of the Licensing Law to WWHA by the Department without federal-court interference.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Br.

We have set forth this material fully under \"Background,\" Part II,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . This material suggests that the women for whom the burdens are relevant are women seeking abortions in and around South Bend, and more broadly in north-central and northeastern Indiana, of limited financial and social resources. But as Plaintiffs' evidence bears more heavily on the South Bend area's population of college- and university students, so too does our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Plaintiffs' evidence suggests further that, in a large fraction of such cases, the unavailability of abortion in South Bend imposes a substantial obstacle to its access. It establishes that there is a demand for abortion care in and around South Bend which is currently unmet. In the absence of the South Bend Clinic, the demand is unmet because of a confluence of factors: the long-distance travel burden, compounded by the eighteen-hour informed-consent waiting-period requirement;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   high monetary costs undefrayed by state aid to those whose poverty would otherwise entitle them to it or by university-sponsored coverage in the case of students; the necessity of securing the help and support of others in the exercise of a right to which the social environment is reportedly hostile (applying with special force to students, who are likely to be young and unmarried); the high opportunity costs incurred by operation of all the foregoing, including lost wages, missed educational opportunities, and missed rent and utility payments; and the prospect of undergoing the abortion in an unfamiliar, unsupportive setting, undermining one of the chief virtues of the mifepristone-misoprostol regimen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   To the extent that the impact of these burdens, assessed together, do not preclude obtaining an abortion, each delay imposed by them increases the costs to the patient and the risks to her health\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Defendants point to Plaintiffs' Jane Doe declarant and her capacity to obtain an abortion in Illinois. But, as Doe makes clear, even that step was possible for her owing only to her enjoyment of a number of personal and social advantages which many women do not enjoy. And in any event, it is a \" 'profoundly mistaken assumption' \" that \" 'the harm to a constitutional right can be measured by the extent to which it can be exercised in another jurisdiction.' \"\n   <em>\n    Schimel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357462\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/908/#p919\">\n    806 F.3d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ezell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753557\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/684/#p699\">\n    651 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   697 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   We turn finally to the \"ultimate task of determining whether the burdens of the law's requirements were 'disproportionate, in their effect on the right to an abortion' compared 'to the benefits that the restrictions are believed to confer.' \"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Ind. &amp; Ky., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517771\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/809/#p816\">\n    896 F.3d at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Schimel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357462\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/908/#p919\">\n    806 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   919 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   On the facts of this case, the marginal benefits to the state in requiring WWHA to obtain a license before operating the South Bend Clinic are slight or none. Defendants have not shown why the state's interests, to the extent they are advanced by a licensing requirement at all, may not be equally well advanced by a registration requirement. A licensing requirement is thus \"not necessary\" to achieve the state's proffered ends.\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n    136 S.

Moreover, to the extent the Licensing Law advances state interests, continued application of the \"reputable and responsible character\" requirement does little to advance the Licensing Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   These\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   benefits are dwarfed by the burdens of women's access to abortion in and around South Bend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Simply put, there is unmet demand for abortions in and around South Bend which is, at this point, state-created, without any appreciable benefit to maternal health or fetal life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n    at 2316-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).

We find Plaintiffs have shown a fair likelihood of success. While the specific claim (imposition of licensure requirement as undue burden and equal protection violation)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   appears novel, application of settled principles, so far as these exist in the abortion context, points reliably to Plaintiffs' ultimate success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   The irreparable harm to women who lose the opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion is significant and obvious: a period of state-compelled gestation followed by a lifetime of state-compelled motherhood. By contrast, little irreparable harm appears likely to afflict the state if Plaintiffs' motion is granted. Enjoining enforcement of the Licensing Law as to WWHA will do no more than return the state, vis-\u00e0-vis WWHA, to the status quo that reigned from 1993 to 2013 or, as a practical matter, 2015. We do not accept that the state inflicted irreparable harm on itself for those two decades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The public interest to be equitably balanced in Defendants' favor is usually coextensive with any governmental interest appearing in the merits analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Michigan v.
