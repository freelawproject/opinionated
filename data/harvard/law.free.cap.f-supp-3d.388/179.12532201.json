Dearie, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On October 13, 2012, Plaintiff Matthew Jenkins (\"Jenkins\") was arrested by members\n   of the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") for selling crack-cocaine to an undercover officer. Def. Statement of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, ECF No. 67 (\"Def. 56.1\"), \u00b6 4. During the arrest, one of the officers believed Jenkins was experiencing a drug overdose, and had Jenkins transported by ambulance to Woodhull Medical Center (\"Woodhull\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. In the early hours of October 14, 2012, NYPD Detective Orlen Zambrano (\"Zambrano\") escorted Jenkins in handcuffs to Woodhull's Radiology unit for abdominal scans.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 7. While there, Jenkins was injured during a physical altercation with Zambrano.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 8. According to Jenkins, Zambrano repeatedly struck him in the head and face with great force and without justification. Amended Compl., ECF. No. 44, \u00b6 24. According to Zambrano, while Jenkins was lying on a table awaiting his scan, Jenkins tried to remove hidden drugs from his \"rear end\" and Zambrano attempted to stop him by throwing him to the ground, causing a contusion to Jenkins's face. Pl. Statement of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, ECF No. 72 (\"Pl. 56.1\") \u00b6 209; Alexander Noble Decl., ECF No. 83 (\"Noble Decl.\"), Ex. C at 99, 102. Zambrano claims that he witnessed Jenkins swallow drugs he removed from his rear, though a subsequent abdominal scan did not reveal any obstruction or foreign body. Noble Decl., Ex. C at 102; Michael Lumer Declaration, ECF No. 70 (\"Lumer Decl.\"), Ex. 1 (Paynter Expert Report) at 1. Additionally, there is no evidence in Jenkins's medical records that he had ingested cocaine either before arrival, or while in the hospital. Lumer Decl., Ex 1. at 2. Medical personnel observed swelling to the left side of Jenkins's face and a bump over his right eyebrow. Jenkins was taken for a CT scan of his head and face.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Shortly after the incident, Zambrano notified his supervisor, Sergeant Michael Weber (\"Weber\"), about what happened, including the fact that Jenkins was injured. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 207. Weber relayed the information to the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau (\"IAB\").\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 205. IAB created an intake report based on Weber's telephone call and waited for additional information about Jenkins's diagnosis.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 208. About half an hour later, Weber once again called IAB and relayed that Jenkins had been diagnosed with a contusion to his face, requiring no stitches and with no broken bones, and had been released to NYPD custody.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 211.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In reality, Jenkins had not been released because his CT exam revealed he had suffered a subdural hematoma with soft tissue swelling and, following the CT scan, he was admitted to the hospital. Lumer Decl., Ex. 1 at 1. A subsequent CAT scan revealed he was neurologically intact and he was transferred to the critical care area for monitoring and given anti-seizure medication.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   IAB referred the investigation to the Chief of Department and Investigative Review Section, and to the Organized Crime Control Bureau (\"OCCB\"), of which Zambrano was a member. Lumer Decl., Ex. 4 (Deposition of IAB Deputy Inspector Jose Frias) (\"Frias Dep.\") at 69-74. IAB Deputy Inspector Jose Frias (\"Frias\") testified that IAB did not review Jenkins's medical records or discuss his condition with medical personnel at Woodhull to independently confirm the accuracy of Weber's report of Jenkins's diagnosis because Weber was \"a sergeant in the NYPD and [he] expect[ed] him to be truthful and honest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 86-89, 91. Surprisingly, no one at IAB interviewed Zambrano or Jenkins about the incident. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 210-212; Frias Dep at 97-98. However, Frias testified that he would have taken a different course of action if he had been informed that Jenkins\n   had suffered a subdural hematoma. Frias Dep at 89-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The OCCB \"exonerated\" Zambrano, though there is no evidence on the record about how or why they reached that conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lumer Decl., Ex. 5 (BCATS Form). Jenkins was indicted for the sale of drugs and pled guilty on August 8, 2013. Def. 12/1/17 Letter, ECF No. 52, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 13, 2015, Jenkins filed a Complaint, which he amended on June 20, 2017, alleging excessive force against Zambrano, and asserting a claim of municipal liability against the City of New York (\"the City\"), pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). Jenkins argues that, in light of numerous prior allegations against Zambrano for excessive use of force and other misconduct, the NYPD was deliberately indifferent to the risk that Zambrano would use excessive force against Jenkins and other civilians. The City now moves for summary judgment with respect to Jenkins's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. Def. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Partial Summ. J., ECF No. 68 (\"Def. Mem.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, the City's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jenkins's allegations are not the first time Zambrano has faced serious abuse complaints. Far from it. 30 separate complaints were filed against Zambrano prior to the incident with Jenkins on October 14, 2012. Half of these involved allegations of excessive force, including instances when the injured complainant, like Jenkins, was securely in police custody. The ensuing investigations ranged between modest and perfunctory and were for the most part concluded as \"unsubstantiated\" or otherwise unresolved. In only one instance was Zambrano found to be at fault for failing to make an entry in his memo book following another violent confrontation with a complainant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite these largely undisputed facts, the City argues that no reasonable fact finder could conclude that a de facto policy of tolerance for police misconduct exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Zambrano's Prior IAB and CCRB History\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Zambrano started working with the NYPD in 2005 and retired in 2015. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 184-186. Prior to October 14, 2012, Zambrano was the subject of 23 investigations by IAB. Lumer Decl., Ex. 3 (Zambrano IAB Resume).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of these, four involved allegations that an individual was injured\n   while in NYPD custody\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and six involved allegations of unnecessary force.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Two of the unnecessary force investigations were considered unsubstantiated and the other four are still open allegations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   For unexplained reasons, all of the injured prisoner investigations, dating back to May 2008, are still carried as \"open\" matters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During this same period, the New York Civilian Complaint Review Board (\"CCRB\") also investigated 12 complaints about Zambrano, 10 of which involved allegations of excessive force. Lumer Decl., Ex. 6 (Zambrano CCRB Resume). Of these 10, 6 were referred to CCRB by IAB. Noble Decl., Exs. DD,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   GG, II, KK, NN, OO. Zambrano was \"exonerated\" on one of these allegations and one allegation was closed as \"unfounded\". Lumer Decl., Ex 6. All the other allegations were found to be unsubstantiated or were closed because the complainant or victim was apparently unavailable or considered uncooperative.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Since the adequacy of these investigations is at issue, a brief summary of certain investigations is instructive:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    CCRB Case # 2006614478:\n   </strong>\n   On October 30, 2006, CCRB received a complaint alleging, among other things, that Zambrano and another officer assaulted an individual while the three men were in the back seat of a patrol car. Zambrano denied the allegation. The investigator concluded that \"[w]ithout any independent witness to this incident, there is no way to confirm or deny the use of physical force against [the individual] ... [and] it does not seem plausible that two officers, dressed in uniform, along with [the individual], could be seated in the rear of a patrol car with ample space for such physical force to be used.\" The allegation was determined to be \"unfounded.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Noble Decl, Ex. CC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    CCRB Case # 200711636:\n   </strong>\n   On August 13, 2007, CCRB received a complaint that, during a stop, after an individual asked Zambrano if he was being detained, Zambrano grabbed the individual's forearm, threatened him with arrest and threw his identification on the ground. Zambrano and his partner denied the allegations. The investigator concluded that \"[w]hile the allegations are plausible, in the absence of independent witness testimony or corroborating evidence, the investigation was unable to reach a determinative finding.\" The allegation was found to be \"unsubstantiated.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Noble Decl., Ex. DD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    CCRB Case # 200713792:\n   </strong>\n   On September 21, 2007, CCRB received a complaint from an individual alleging that, during a stop, Zambrano grabbed the individual, kneed him two times in the groin, tightly placed handcuffs on the individual, twisted his arms backwards and then punched him. The investigator spoke to the victim on the phone the next day. He tried to schedule two in-person interviews with the victim in early October, but the victim failed to show up to both. On October 18, 2007, the case was closed as \"complainant uncooperative.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Noble Decl., Ex. EE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IAB Case # 09-39229; CCRB Case # 200912653:\n   </strong>\n   On August 11, 2009, Zambrano was involved in a physical confrontation with an individual in custody while Zambrano was taking him to the bathroom in a hospital. A captain from Zambrano's\n   precinct reported that the nurses at the hospital said Zambrano acted aggressively towards the individual, but the Hospital Administrator who reviewed video surveillance of the incident said Zambrano acted appropriately. An IAB investigator spoke to the individual, who said Zambrano had punched him several times while he was being transported to the hospital and that later in the hospital, while Zambrano was taking him to the bathroom, he and Zambrano pushed each other after they got into an argument about what had happened during the transport. The individual gave the investigator his contact information, which the investigator included in the investigation report. The following day, the investigator reviewed the video surveillance of the confrontation and saw Zambrano push the individual and rear cuff him after he put up his fists as if to fight Zambrano. The investigators also learned that one of the hospital employees who was present at the scene said that Zambrano threatened to strike the man before handcuffing him. The case was referred to CCRB for further investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Noble Decl., Ex. JJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The CCRB Case Report states that the IAB referral did not contain any contact information for the complainant and the investigator was unable to locate him using other methods. The case was closed as \"complainant unavailable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Noble Decl., Ex. KK.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    CCRB Case # 201200595:\n   </strong>\n   On January 12, 2012, CCRB received a complaint that Zambrano pushed an individual after the individual asked why he was being stopped. The investigator interviewed the individual, who picked Zambrano out of a photo array. Zambrano and his partner could not recall having any interaction with the individual and failed to make any notes about it in their memo books. The investigator was unable to find any documentary evidence confirming the stop, and thus concluded that \"[l]acking such evidence, it was not possible to determine if the stop occurred and whether force was used\" and the allegation of use of force was \"unsubstantiated.\" Curiously, however, the investigator did conclude that Zambrano interacted with the individual on the day of the incident, and both Zambrano and his partner failed to document the encounter in their memo books; Both officers were cited for failing to adhere to Patrol guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Noble Decl., Ex. LL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    CCRB Case # 201212526:\n   </strong>\n   On September 24, 2012, IAB received a complaint from an individual alleging that Zambrano punched him in the ribs while in his cell at Brooklyn Central Booking (\"BCB\") and again later at the hospital. The same day, the individual told medical personnel at the hospital that he had been hit by a police officer and his medical records showed he had a right rib contusion. The case was referred to CCRB for further investigation. On October 10, 2012, a CCRB investigator interviewed the individual, who gave him a statement consistent with what he had said to medical personnel. The individual again provided a consistent statement about the incident at a 50h hearing in January 2013. Approximately a year after the incident, in September 2013, the CCRB investigator also spoke with a witness who was incarcerated in the cell next to the individual on the day of the incident, an employee of BCB, Zambrano and his partner. The witness recalled officers using force against the individual, but acknowledged being under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident. Zambrano denied using force against the victim, but he did not recall any details from their interactions, even though his memo book contained an entry that read: \"At 9:28 p.m., one man was in the prisoner van at the corner of Franklin Street and Fulton Avenue. At 11:55 p.m.,\n   Det. Zambrano was en route to Brooklyn Central Booking. At 12:20 a.m., Det. Zambrano arrived at Brooklyn Central Booking. At 1:10 a.m., Det. Zambrano went to the hospital and called his desk to inform them.\" Zambrano's partner stated that he was not present during the interaction between Zambrano and the individual at BCB and thus did not know if they had an altercation, but recalled that the individual only started complaining of broken ribs after Zambrano took him to the holding cell. The investigator concluded that \"due to conflicting civilian and officer statements, and in the absence of credible civilian witness testimony, the investigation could not determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether Zambrano used force against [the individual]\". Yet again the allegation was found to be \"unsubstantiated.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Noble Decl., Ex.

Of the 30 complaints filed against Zambrano, many alleging conduct strikingly similar to the claims alleged yet again in this litigation, it appears from the record that not a single complainant was ever credited. The record further reveals that investigators routinely forgo any classic fact finding, even when there is clear corroborating evidence, preferring instead to affix the unsubstantiated label once the accused officer denies the conduct in question. The clear, unmistakable impression is that if there is no irrefutable corroborating evidence, the matter is conveniently labeled \"unsubstantiated,\" which, as a practical matter, the City equates with exonerated. Apparently, unless an officer is caught red-handed or his conduct is undeniable for whatever reason, the NYPD and the City simply choose to regard the allegation as a non-event having no factual or legal evidentiary significance in terms of supervisory responsibility or legal analysis, no matter the frequency or similarities in the complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A review of the CCRB Closing Reports in the record show:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    (1) Investigators systematically refuse to credit testimony by civilian witnesses with regards to use of force yet routinely credit uncorroborated statements by the officers.

In contrast, in the same Report, the investigator wrote that \"[t]he investigation established that PO Zambrano interacted with [complainant] on the day of the incident\" and recommended that Zambrano and his partner be cited for failing to document the encounter in their memo books, a violation of Patrol guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

The Report shows that the investigator found that the victim provided multiple, consistent statements about the incidents, which were corroborated by his medical records and by a witness present during one of the incidents, and that Zambrano's partner admitted he was not present at the holding cells but the individual started complaining about his ribs only after Zambrano took him there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Noble Decl., Ex. 00.

Many of the complaints about Zambrano's use of force involved situations where the complainant was injured by Zambrano while he was in custody-much\n   like the allegation Jenkins makes against Zambrano.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lumer Decl.

Zambrano Dep. at 190-91, 195-96. The superficial nature of the CCRB and IAB investigations into these complaints and their predictable results may well have indicated to Zambrano, and to any officer, that the City was indifferent to his use of excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    H.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203396434\">\n    2017 WL 3396434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (\"[G]iven his disciplinary history, [the officer] could have believed that the only kinds of violations with which his supervisors were concerned were violations involving the Department or its property.\"). Indeed, Zambrano admitted that he does not believe the complaints affected his performance evaluations or how he was supervised on a day-to-day basis. Zambrano Dep. at 195-96. His supervisors' disinterest in his complaint history and the lack of serious repercussions could have led Zambrano to believe that his conduct would go unpunished, empowering him to engage in further misconduct, such as that alleged here. A reasonable jury could find that Jenkins's injuries were foreseeable given the City's failure to adequately investigate allegations against Zambrano and to take appropriate measures to supervise and discipline him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415155\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/72/1040/#p1049\">\n    72 F.3d at 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In light of the Department's 'systematic failure' to alert the supervisory units of the filing of new complaints against problem officers, and in the absence of any significant administrative response to [the officer's] resumption of his abusive misconduct upon reinstatement, it was entirely foreseeable that [the officer] would engage in misconduct yet again.\");\n   <em>\n    Rasmussen v.

It suggests that unsubstantiated means exonerated and that the number of complaints, no matter how many, has no probative force and is of no concern. The City maintains this position despite evidence of a demonstrably flawed system that is supported by plainly inadequate investigations that are in most instances effectively stymied by an officer's simple denials. The NYPD knows how to investigate when they choose to. Given the evidence before the Court, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that in Zambrano's case, the City chose not to conduct an investigation or meaningfully monitor his performance but instead chose to disregard a problem officer and invite his continued abuse. Considering the proffered evidence, the Court concludes that the alleged deficiencies in such an apparently flawed system are so obvious that the City's claim of ignorance must be assessed by the fact-finder at a trial on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Jenkins's excessive force claim against Officer Zambrano is ready for trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    One other allegation against Zambrano, classified as \"Shield-NYPD-Duplicate/Fake,\" was also substantiated, but the Court has no information about the circumstances of that complaint or what, if any, disciplinary action was taken as a result.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The parties' Rule 56.1 Statements contain inconsistencies and are not fully supported by evidence in the record. The Court has conducted its own review of the record to calculate the number of complaints filed against Officer Zambrano and which of those included allegations of excessive force. Perhaps illustrative of the deficiencies in the NYPD's disciplinary and supervisory procedures, the Court found it difficult to come up with a precise compilation because the records are difficult to follow, contain overlap when complaints are referred for \"additional\" investigation and are not consistently classified given the allegations described and the incidents themselves.
