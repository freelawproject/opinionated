Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case involves a dispute over Prudential's payment of the life-insurance benefits of David Freemen (hereinafter the \"Decedent\") to Defendant Otis Norman Freemen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that he was the common-law spouse of the Decedent until the Decedent unfortunately passed away on October 23, 2016. Doc. 26, Pl.'s Fourth Am. Compl. (FAC), \u00b6 11. The life-insurance policy (the \"Policy\") at issue was obtained in 1996 by the Decedent from his employer at the time, MBNA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. On December 30, 1996, Plaintiff alleges that the Decedent executed a beneficiary form designating the Plaintiff as the 100% beneficiary on the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The Decedent worked for MBNA until 2005, when he left active employment and was placed on long-term disability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From 2005 to 2016, Plaintiff alleges that MBNA, BoA, and/or Prudential periodically sent the Decedent information confirming his status, the existence and amount of the Policy, and that Plaintiff was the sole beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. However, Plaintiff does not currently have access to these documents because prior to the Decedent's death, Decedent \"cleaned out\" these documents, and thus, Plaintiff does not specifically allege which entity purportedly sent these documents.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   After the Decedent's death, Plaintiff contacted Prudential and BoA to make claims for various survivor benefits, including a claim as the beneficiary under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Prudential told Plaintiff that there was no beneficiary designation on the Policy and advised Plaintiff to contact BoA to obtain the original records of the Policy since BoA had succeeded to MBNA's records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff then called BoA and spoke to a BoA employee, Kecia Atkins, requesting that she check the records to see if she could locate the form naming Plaintiff as the beneficiary on the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response, Atkins allegedly confirmed that she \"found [Plaintiff's] name, but could not (and would not) certify that the beneficiary designation applied to the Policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Atkins also allegedly \"stated unequivocally that there was no beneficiary form showing [Plaintiff] as beneficiary of the Policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, in October of 2018, in response\n   to a subpoena Plaintiff served on BoA, BoA turned over records it had regarding the Policy, which allegedly showed Plaintiff as the sole 100% beneficiary of the Policy based on the 1996 designation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Relying on the representations BoA made in 2016, Plaintiff proceeded to discuss with Prudential how the Policy proceeds would be paid without a beneficiary designee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Prudential allegedly stated that the proceeds would go to the Decedent's spouse, and if none existed, to his \"heirs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Although Plaintiff alleges that he and the Decedent were common-law married, they never registered their marriage or applied for a marriage certificate after the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell v. Hodges\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/\">\n    135 S.

Based on this concern, Freemen and Plaintiff allegedly agreed that Plaintiff was entitled to the Policy's proceeds and that instead of going through the \"time consuming\" process of proving up Plaintiff's marriage, Freemen would accept the proceeds as the Decedent's father and then send the money to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on this alleged agreement, Plaintiff stopped pursuing his own claim for the funds with Prudential and allowed Freemen to complete the necessary paperwork to pay out the Policy's proceeds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Prudential paid Freemen the Policy proceeds, which at the time totaled $ 726,299.18.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Despite their agreement, Freemen did not pay the Policy proceeds to Plaintiff, but instead allegedly used the money to pay off the title to his house and other third parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 22, 2017, Plaintiff filed his Original Petition in state court bringing only state-law claims against Freemen based on his breach of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2, Ex. A-2, Original Pet. After almost two years of litigation in state court, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Petition, adding state-law claims against Defendants BoA and Prudential.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-4, Ex. A-49, Third Am. Pet. On November 20, 2018, Defendants removed the state-court action to this Court invoking federal-question jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, Notice of Removal. Defendants argued that the Policy at issue was provided under an employee welfare benefit plan controlled by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and thus, Plaintiff's state-law claims were preempted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Plaintiff did not dispute Defendants' removal on any grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Then, on January 2, 2019, Plaintiff filed his now-operative Fourth Amended Complaint. Doc. 26, FAC. In this Complaint, Plaintiff brings a state-law claim against BoA for negligent misrepresentation based on its allegedly negligent handling of and communications regarding the Policy documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-46. Against Prudential, Plaintiff brings a federal claim under ERISA alleging that he was entitled to the Policy's proceeds, but was denied the proceeds in violation of ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 47-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 16, 2019, BoA filed its Motion to Dismiss arguing\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiff's state law negligent-misrepresentation claim is preempted by ERISA and that Plaintiff's claim for benefits should\n   otherwise be dismissed with prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Doc. 33, BoA Mot. to Dismiss, 4-5, 10-11. Shortly thereafter, on January 22, 2019, Prudential filed its Motion to Dismiss making the same exhaustion argument and arguing that in any case, Prudential appropriately paid Freemen according to the Policy's terms, and thus, cannot be liable under ERISA. Doc. 36, Prudential's Mot. to Dismiss, 5-8. Having been fully briefed on both Motions, the Court now addresses the sufficiency of Plaintiff's claims as to both Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.

ERISA Preemption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, the Court addresses BoA's argument that ERISA preempts Plaintiff's state-law claim for negligent misrepresentation.

Here, it appears to the Court that parts of BoA's\n   Motion conflates the two types of preemption-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in parts of its Motion to Dismiss it argues that ERISA completely preempts Plaintiff's state-law claim, but simultaneously argues for conflict preemption by citing to ERISA cases dealing with conflict preemption of state-law claims. The scope of complete and conflict preemption under ERISA are very similar but not exactly the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woods v. Tex.

Because of their differences, and as each appears applicable to this case, the Court considers both preemption types. However, because the parties agree that the Policy is an employee welfare benefit plan governed by ERISA, the Court goes directly into determining whether either type of preemption applies. Then the Court concludes this section with discussing the effect of ERISA preemption on Plaintiff's state-law negligent-misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Complete Preemption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Complete preemption is an exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule.\n   <em>\n    Aetna Health Inc. v.

Thus, like in\n   <em>\n    McGowin\n   </em>\n   , in order to determine whether BoA made negligent misrepresentations, the Court will have to interpret, at least in part, his purported beneficiary status under the Policy. Therefore, Plaintiff may characterize his cause of action as arising under negligent misrepresentation, but he seeks a determination of his eligibility for benefits under an ERISA-governed plan, and he prays for relief specifically provided by \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) or \u00a7 502(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGowin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9267499\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/363/556/\">\n    363 F.3d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In determining whether state-law claims \"relate to\" a plan, courts examine two factors: \"(1) whether the state law claims address areas of exclusive federal concern, such as the right to receive benefits under the terms of an ERISA plan; and (2) whether the claims directly affect the relationship among the traditional ERISA entities-the employer, the plan and its fiduciaries, and the participants\n   and beneficiaries.\"\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644619\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/600/#p603\">\n    459 F.3d at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court concludes that both factors lean in favor of finding that Plaintiff's negligent-misrepresentation claim is subject to conflict preemption. First, as discussed above, Plaintiff alleges that he is a beneficiary to the ERISA Policy and is seeking to obtain the proceeds he believes he was entitled to based on his beneficiary status. The Fifth Circuit has held that when the \"facts underlying a state law claim bear\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   relationship to an employee benefit plan, we evaluate the nexus between ERISA and state law in the framework of ERISA's statutory objectives.\"\n   <em>\n    Mayeaux v.

And ERISA's \"objectives include establishing uniform national safeguards 'with respect to the establishment, operation, and administration of [employee benefit] plans,' and 'establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374463\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/420/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b) ). Thus, based on these objectives, ERISA provides a comprehensive civil-enforcement scheme, which for example allows a beneficiary to sue to \"recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan [or] to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan ...\" ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B); or alternatively, to obtain injunctive or \"other appropriate equitable relief\" to remedy violations of ERISA or terms of a benefit plan, or to enforce ERISA or terms of a benefit plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 502(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court's task in the case will ultimately be to determine whether BoA-as the alleged contract holder of the ERISA Policy and successor to MBNA's duties and obligations-is liable under ERISA for allegedly providing false or misleading information as to Plaintiff's beneficiary status and presumably failing to give the beneficiary form to Prudential. These allegations, although framed in terms of negligent misrepresentation, go to the core of ERISA's safeguarding objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, this claim for relief directly affects the relationship between two of the most traditional ERISA entities-a plan sponsor/employer and a beneficiary-which weighs heavily in favor of finding that the claim is subject to conflict preemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Memorial Hosp.

Doc. 36, Prudential's Mot. to Dismiss, 7-9. In response, Plaintiff argues that: (1) Prudential did not act in accordance with the terms of the Policy because there was no explicit requirement that the Decedent was required to send the 1996 original beneficiary designation form to Prudential, but only that he file it with the contract holder, which he did; and (2) Prudential's argument that it paid out the proceeds in good faith requires more evidence and is improper to determine at the motion-to-dismiss stage because Prudential did not contact BoA to determine what forms it had in its possession. Doc. 44, Pl.'s Resp. to Prudential's Mot., 7-11. The Court addresses Plaintiff's arguments, but concludes that the allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint are insufficient to state an ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) claim against Prudential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court finds that Prudential acted in accordance with the plan documents based on the information it had at the time when it paid out the Policy proceeds. First, there are no allegations in the Complaint that Prudential was aware there was a beneficiary designation form at the time it paid out the proceeds. Plaintiff alleges that when he first contacted Prudential, it told him that it did not have a beneficiary form on file for the Policy. Doc. 26, FAC, \u00b6 17. In fact, Plaintiff acknowledges that even after subpoenaing Prudential's records there was no beneficiary designation form found in Prudential's records.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And Plaintiff further acknowledges that after speaking to BoA and being told there was no beneficiary designee on the Policy, he called Prudential back and asked what would happen with the Policy's proceeds absent a designee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    \u00b6 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, both Prudential and Plaintiff were operating under the belief that there was no beneficiary designation form. Thus, absent a beneficiary designee or a claim for benefits made by the Decedent's spouse or children, the Policy's language clearly directs Prudential to pay out the Policy proceeds to the Decedent's surviving parent(s), which is what it did when it made the payment to Freemen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 51-1, Ex. A, 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court is not persuaded by Plaintiff's argument that \"[t]here is no evidence of any requirement [in the Policy] that the Decedent is required to send the form directly to Prudential[,]\" and thus, by \"[h]aving completed the form, and delivering it to the 'Contract Holder,' Prudential was required to pay Policy proceeds according to the beneficiary form in the hands of the Contract Holder.\" Doc. 44, Pl.'s Resp. to Prudential's Mot., 9. In essence, Plaintiff argues that the Policy \"suggests that Prudential had a duty to inquire further about the plan documents and forms in the possession of its designated 'contract holder.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Prudential had asked Plaintiff to contact BoA and inquire whether there was a beneficiary designee. Plaintiff did so, and BoA told Plaintiff there was no beneficiary. Then, Plaintiff once again contacted Prudential, this time asking what would happen with the proceeds absent a beneficiary designee. And based on the information Prudential gave him, Plaintiff chose to not make a claim as the Decedent's spouse and allowed Freemen to receive the proceeds. Thus, the Court does not find that Prudential's alleged failure to contact BoA can give rise to liability under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) when at the time the proceeds were paid out there was no disputed claim and the contract holder, BoA, had already told Plaintiff there was no beneficiary designee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In a case involving similar facts from the Eighth Circuit, the court found that a life insurance company properly paid out the death benefits according to a 1991 designation even though the life insurance company was aware that there was a later designation, was \"on notice of 'a legitimate dispute between the beneficiaries,' \" and failed to warn the plaintiffs that it would pay in accordance with the 1991 designation before doing so.\n   <em>\n    Matschiner v.

The court held in this manner because the record was clear that although the life insurance company asked the plaintiffs for the later designation, it was never provided to the life insurance company, and thus it properly paid out the benefits in accordance with the plan documents and the beneficiary designation it had on file at the time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p888\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p888\">\n    at 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying the plan-documents rule set out in\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679152\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/285/#p300\">\n    555 U.S. at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679152\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/285/#p300\">\n    129 S.Ct. 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   was decided at summary judgment, the Court still finds it persuasive since the allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint establish that like the life insurance company in\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   , Prudential cannot be found liable under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B): Prudential told Plaintiff that he would need to contact BoA and acquire the beneficiary designation form; Plaintiff never produced the form nor was it found in Prudential's records; and, Prudential advised Plaintiff how the Policy's proceeds would be paid out absent a designee. As discussed in more detail below, Plaintiff chose not to pursue a claim for benefits under the Policy with Prudential, but instead entered into an agreement with Freemen where he would receive the Policy's proceeds and then give the proceeds to Plaintiff. In Plaintiff choosing this path, Prudential did what it was required to do under the Policy-and what Plaintiff expected them to do-it paid the Policy's proceeds to Freemen since there was no beneficiary designee and no claim by the Decedent's spouse or children.

Thus, at first glance, ruling on this issue seems premature. In response, Plaintiff argues that BoA's failure-to-exhaust-administrative-remedies argument is misplaced because BoA has failed to show that the Policy required him to make a claim with BoA, as apposed to the plan-administrator, Prudential.

Plaintiff nevertheless argues that this exception is met because Prudential's position in this lawsuit is that because it paid out the Policy's proceeds to Freemen, Prudential no longer has an obligation to pay the correct beneficiary. Doc. 44, Pl.'s Resp. to Prudential's Mot., 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff however misinterprets this exception. Based on the allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint, Prudential's position as to who is entitled to the Policy's proceeds has remained the same from the time Plaintiff called Prudential following the Decedent's death to present day-absent a beneficiary designee, the Policy's proceeds would be paid out to the Decedent's spouse, and if none, to the Decedent's heirs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 26, FAC, \u00b6 18. Prudential's current position is not that it would have refused any claim by Plaintiff, but that the time to make a claim was when it originally advised Plaintiff of the proper claim process after the Decedent's death and prior to filing suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Furthermore, Plaintiff has failed to allege any hostility or bias on Prudential's part. For example, Plaintiff has not alleged that Prudential's policy was to consider only heterosexual spouses as beneficiaries under the Policy or that even if Plaintiff proved up his common-law marriage Prudential would not have consider him a spouse subject to beneficiary status. In fact, Plaintiff alleges that Prudential advised him that he would need to prove up his marriage status to take under the Policy. Although Plaintiff has arguably alleged bias and/or hostility as to BoA's employee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 26, FAC, \u00b6 29 (alleging that once he told BoA's employee that he was Decedent's spouse she \"became less than helpful\"), there are no allegations that Prudential was hostile or biased against Plaintiff's attempt to collect the Policy's proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To be clear, although the Court finds that Plaintiff potentially has an exception to exhausting administrative remedies with respect to ERISA claims against BoA-and thus, Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is improper as to BoA's claims-the Court does not find that the same reasoning applies to Prudential. This is because Plaintiff admits in his Complaint that even after subpoenaing Prudential's records, \"it appeared that Prudential did not have copies of the beneficiary designation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Thus, unlike BoA-who allegedly had the form in it possession, but failed to produce it when requested-Prudential was appropriately operating under the belief that there was no beneficiary designation form. And while\n   operating under that belief, Prudential advised Plaintiff that according to the Policy's terms, absent a beneficiary designee, the Policy's proceeds would be paid out to the Decedent's spouse, and if none, to Decedent's heirs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Prudential also advised Plaintiff that as Decedent's common-law spouse he would have to make a claim and prove up the elements of common-law marriage to seek benefits under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Thus, the allegations in the Complaint show that Prudential properly advised Plaintiff of his rights under the Policy based on the information known to it at the time. In other words, Plaintiff has not alleged any failure on the part of Prudential to provide him with plan information or how any of its actions prejudiced his ability to obtain the Policy's proceeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meza\n   </em>\n   , 908 F.2d at 1279 (citing\n   <em>\n    Curry\n   </em>\n   , 891 F.2d at 846 ). Although the Court recognizes that the claim process Prudential outlined would likely take significant time and effort, the fact remains that Plaintiff chose to \"stop[ ] pursuing his own claim to the funds,\" and thus on the face of the Complaint it is clear that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 26, FAC, \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the above-stated reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES in part\n   </strong>\n   BoA's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 32) and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Prudential's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 36).

The Court finds that allowing Plaintiff the opportunity to replead against Prudential would be futile because Plaintiff would in essence have to contradict many of the allegations and arguments he currently asserts against Prudential in order to state a viable \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) claim. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) claim against Prudential.

The Court notes this and other exceptions for the sole purpose of highlighting why a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on exhaustion grounds as to BoA is improper, and why more discovery and summary-judgment type evidence is needed to ultimately determine this issue. The Court does not make a determination that any of these exceptions in fact apply.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
