For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Maleno's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 1, 2018, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Maleno and defendant Rafael A. G\u00e1lvez-V\u00e1zquez (\"G\u00e1lvez\") (collectively, \"defendants\") with violating 21 U.S.C. sections 846 and 841(b)(1)(A). (Docket No. 16.) In December 2018, the United States extended a signed plea agreement and plea supplement to the defendants. (Docket No. 63.) On February 11, 2019, March 22, 2019, and May 13, 2019, Maleno requested extensions of time to move for a change of plea hearing in order to continue with plea negotiations. (Docket Nos. 65, 68, 72.) The United States did not oppose Maleno's requests, and the Court granted Maleno's motions, ultimately allowing the defendants until\n   May 20, 2019 to file motions for change of plea. (Docket Nos. 66, 68, 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 14, 2019, the United States \"unilaterally withdrew the plea agreement tendered, without prior notice.\" (Docket No. 74 at p. 3.) According to the United States, the \"same plea agreement/supplement remained standing and available to both defendants until the new change of plea deadline of May 20, 2019, but this time as a package deal plea.\" (Docket No. 82 at p. 4.) \"[T]he Government informed defense counsels [sic] that the same terms and conditions remained in place if both defendants decided to enter a guilty plea either as a straight plea or pursuant to the plea agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 17, 2019, Maleno moved \"to compel the Government to fulfill its duties in bargaining with defendant under the authorized plea agreement and allow defendant to file his motion for change of plea under such terms by May 20, 2019, the date set by the Court.\" (Docket No. 74 at p. 4.) Maleno contends that \"[t]he plea agreement had no deadline, and the Government established no deadline outside the plea agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Maleno, the \"Government did not object to [the] Court's deadlines for change of plea, as plea negotiations were ongoing,\" and \"[t]hroughout plea negotiations, verbally and in writing the Government was advised that defendant Maleno was not going to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
