Kendall, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Everybody who grows up in Northern Illinois or is a professional football fan knows the legend of the 1985 Chicago Bears. After the single loss in their 15-1\n   season, \"da Bears\" boldly became the first sports team ever to record a hip-hop song. Two months later, that team rapped and shuffled their way to an historic 46-10 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX. The\n   <em>\n    Super Bowl Shuffle\n   </em>\n   arguably guaranteed that win, and in the process, it captured the hearts and imaginations of many. Its popularity remains to this day; indeed, it prompted this federal lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The song is an original and artistic expression, so it is the creators' (now owners') intellectual property. The plaintiffs hold the copyrights to the famous record, meaning they determine whether and under what terms others may duplicate it. They allege the defendants infringed these rights because they produced and distributed a documentary that includes clips of the work without first receiving the plaintiffs' permission to do so. The defendants argue this was a \"fair use\" of the material because their film is a historical commentary on the Bears' season and it only uses brief excerpts of the video. Therefore, they maintain they need not pay the plaintiffs to license their work. Because the documentary was a fair use of the music video, the Court enters judgment for the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Red Label Music Publishing, Inc. owns the copyrights to the words, music, sound recording, and video of the\n   <em>\n    Super Bowl Shuffle.\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 6 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 8, 29.) Red Label's agent, Renaissance Marketing Corporation, licenses the use of these rights to others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9, 29.

Mar. 27, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before turning to the defendants' motion for summary judgment based on fair use, the Court addresses the plaintiffs' motion to strike that affirmative defense, seeing\n   that if the Court does so then that will necessarily moot the defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The first issue is whether the plaintiff's motion was even timely. Rule 12(f)(2) empowers parties to move to strike \"either before responding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after being served with the pleading.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f)(2). Here, four defendants answered the amended complaint on February 4, 2019 (Dkt. 45, 51), one defendant answered February 19, 2019 (Dkt. 77), and five other defendants answered on March 6, 2019 (Dkt. 96, 98-101). The plaintiffs then moved to strike the fair use affirmative defenses the defendants asserted in their answers on March 8, 2019. (Dkt. 107.) Because the defendants did not counterclaim, the plaintiffs had no other opportunity to respond to the answers, leaving them with 21 days-or until March 27, 2019-to move to strike.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(3), (7). The motion was therefore timely as to the five defendants who answered on March 6 and the one defendant who answered on February 19. But the answer is less clear as to the four defendants who answered on February 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v.

Ill. July 10, 2014), for the proposition that courts consider timeliness based on the last answer filed in multi-defendant cases with different answer dates. That case, not binding on this Court anyway, stands for no such proposition. There, the court merely exercised its discretion under Rule 12(f)(1) to strike material from a pleading on its own motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203376892\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rule 12(f)(1) does not impose any time constraint on courts like it does on parties in Rule 12(f)(2), so courts read that omission to mean they may consider a motion to strike at any point in a case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Ill. Oct. 26, 2018) (Kendall, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court also rejects the plaintiffs' framing of their motion to strike as a cross-motion-constituting part of their response to the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for summary judgment-approved for filing on March 8, 2019. That claim has no basis in federal civil procedure. If the plaintiffs truly cross-moved, they would have filed their own motion for judgment on the pleadings, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. They did not. They moved to strike under Rule 12(f), not for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) nor for summary judgment under Rule 56. Those are two very different procedural devices that request different judicial relief. Because their motion to strike was independent, the deadline in Rule 12(f) applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Additionally, the plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Freeburg Cmty. Consol. Sch. Dist. No. 70\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-CV-458-JPG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204006333\">\n    2012 WL 4006333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D. Ill. Sept. 12, 2012), to claim that they can move for judgment on the pleadings after the 21-day period under Rule 12(f). True enough, Rule 12(c) imposes its own deadline, which is \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial ...\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). As stated previously, however, the plaintiffs did not move under Rule 12(c) ; they moved under Rule 12(f), so its period governs here. What is more, Rule 12(h)(2)(B) does not permit a party to move to strike an affirmative defense after the Rule 12(f) deadline. It merely clarifies that a party may raise the \"failure ... to state a legal defense to a claim ... by a motion under\n   Rule 12(c).\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(2)(B). The Court accordingly denies the plaintiffs' motion to strike as to the four defendants who answered on February 4 as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Even if the motion was timely, the foregoing discussion reflects the problem with the plaintiffs' motion: it seeks a merits disposition on the defendants' fair use defenses, making it inappropriate for resolution on a motion to strike under Rule 12(f). Instead, the proper path to take would have been for the plaintiffs to move under Rule 12(c), or in the alternative, under Rule 56, like the defendants did and as the plaintiffs seemingly now concede they effectively did. That the plaintiffs think their case against fair use is so strong is entirely beside the point. That is not a reason to strike an affirmative defense. The Rule says that a court may only strike an \"insufficient defense,\" not a defense that is colorable yet ultimately a loser on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As a general matter, fair use is not an insufficient defense in a copyright infringement case. Often, it\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the copyright infringement case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atkins v.

App'x 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 513 (7th Cir. 2008) (stating that Rule 12(f) is not a good fit for qualified immunity, a comparable affirmative defense). For that reason, fair use is neither irrelevant to this case nor so remote from the plaintiffs' claim that it lacks merit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gress\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203869962\">\n    2018 WL 3869962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5 (internal citations omitted).

But the inquiry is whether it is\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to strike the defense as it is necessary to dismiss a claim. On the one hand, Rule 8(a)(2) calls for \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). On the other hand, Rule 8(b)(1)(A) requires a party to \"state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted against it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8(b)(1)(A). Indeed, \"[e]ach allegation must be simple, concise, and direct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8(d)(1). Perhaps, then, the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   framework should apply, considering the nearly matching text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   So says the Second Circuit. Just this year, it noted the divide amongst courts and commentators, then \"conclude[d] that the plausibility standard of\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   applies to determining the sufficiency of all pleadings, including the pleading of an affirmative defense, but with recognition that, as the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , applying the plausibility standard to any pleading is a 'context-specific' task.\"\n   <em>\n    GEOMC Co. v.

Expanding on its holding, the court distinguished the \"key\" context of pleading an affirmative defensive in an answer from a claim in a complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520480\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/92/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the defendant (or counter-defendant) has significantly less time to \"gather facts necessary to satisfy the plausibility standard,\" courts should apply a lesser \"degree of rigor ... for testing the pleading of an affirmative defense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520480\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/92/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition, the nature of the affirmative defense matters because the \"the facts needed to plead [it] ... may not be readily known to the defendant, a circumstance warranting a relaxed application of the plausibility standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520480\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/92/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that case, the example the court used was an ultra vires defense, where the defendant needs more information to plead how an act was done without the requisite legal authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520480\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/92/#p98\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the affirmative defense is fair use, which in a lot of ways also demands detail about a defendant's ability to use another's copyrighted material. As the Court will lay out below, many facts regarding marketplace harm (e.g. loss of licensing revenue) are within the peculiar control of the plaintiffs here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Second Circuit's approach is persuasive, and the Court follows its lead.\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   provide a helpful frame of reference for the affirmative defense analysis; however, courts should remain cognizant of the specific context within which these issues often arise and therefore typically give defendants some slack in pleading them. Applying this standard here, the defendants' fair use defense is plausible. Although not a model pleading by any stretch of the imagination, the defendants alleged facts that enable the Court to draw the reasonable inference that they are not liable for the misconduct alleged. Consequently, timely or not, the Court substantively denies the plaintiffs' motion to strike.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, the Court appreciates their arguments and takes them seriously, and at this point moves on to the merits to discuss them in their proper place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
