Second Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ortiz alleges that, if interest and fees were accruing, the statement that the issuer \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   continue to add interest and fees\" (emphasis added) was false, deceptive, or misleading within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e because it left open the possibility that interest and fees would not accrue.

Subsequent unpublished cases confirm that language substantially similar to that used in the letter sent to Ortiz-that \"Synchrony Bank may continue to add interest and fees as provided in your agreement\"-falls within the safe harbor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taubenfliegel v.

Third Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ortiz alleges that, if interest and fees were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   accruing, then the use of \"may\" was deceptive because it implied that they would. Since this is simply the logical complement of her second claim, one might argue that the\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   safe harbor applies. However,\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   and the cases\n   applying it all involved accounts that were, in fact, accruing interest. In addition,\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   emphasized that a statement qualifies for the safe harbor only if it \"\n   <em>\n    accurately\n   </em>\n   informs the consumer that the amount of the debt stated in the letter will increase over time.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808318\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/72/\">\n    817 F.3d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9969308\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/872/#p876\">\n    214 F.3d at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (safe harbor applies \"provided, of course, that the information [the debt collector] furnishes is accurate and he does not obscure it by adding confusing other information (or misinformation)\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 1692e(5) lists a \"threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken\" as an example of a misleading representation. Thus, a statement that interest may accrue is misleading if it cannot or will not accrue. In\n   <em>\n    Medzhidzade v. Kirschenbaum &amp; Phillips, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202093116\">\n    2018 WL 2093116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. May 3, 2018), Judge Cogan explained how such a statement could be material: \"A letter which leads a debtor to believe that her debt is accruing interest when it actually is not may be materially misleading because it could induce the debtor [to] pay that debt in lieu of another debt she knows is accruing interest at some lower rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It may be the case that Ortiz's debt is increasing, and it is very likely the case that any interest and fees are legal and allowed by her agreement with Synchrony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weiss v. Zwicker &amp; Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794051\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/664/214/#p217\">\n    664 F. Supp. 2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (\"[E]ven the most unsophisticated consumer would understand that credit card debt accrues interest.\"). Those facts would refute the premise of her third claim. They are not alleged in the complaint, however, and so ACCT must provide evidence of them in connection with a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medzhidzade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202093116\">\n    2018 WL 2093116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (\"If, for example, defendant had produced evidence that the amount of the debt would or could increase in the future because of interest or fees, the 'may vary from day to day' language would be entirely accurate.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Fourth Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ortiz's fourth claim challenges the same statement-\"Synchrony Bank may continue to add interest and fees as provided in your agreement\"-but shifts the focus from \"may\" to \"and.\" She argues that the use of that conjunction implies that\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   interest and fees may increase her balance, and that the statement is misleading if only one or the other is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As noted, nothing in the record informs the Court whether Ortiz's agreement with Synchrony authorizes either interest or fees and, if so, whether either has been or will be added to her balance. As with the third claim, then, the fourth claim cannot be disposed of on a motion to dismiss and must await a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Fifth Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Ortiz alleges that that letter, taken in its entirety, is misleading because it implies that payment of the \"amount currently due\" would prevent additional interest and fees from accruing. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The letter informs Ortiz that ACCT will \"stop [its] collection activity\" if \"the Amount Currently Due is paid.\" Compl., Ex. A. \"Collection activity\" is not a self-evident concept. Perhaps its most natural meaning refers to sending collection letters and the like, but the Court cannot rule out the possibility that the least-sophisticated consumer would understand it to include the imposition and collection of interest and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ACCT argues that the letter's meaning was clarified by the disclosure of\n   an \"account balance\" greater than the \"amount currently due\" and a warning that Synchrony \"may continue to add interest and fees.\" The latter, however, might reasonably mean that interest and fees would accrue until the amount due was paid, but not thereafter. The least-sophisticated consumer, meanwhile, might understand the letter to convey an offer to accept the \"amount currently due\" in satisfaction of the higher \"account balance.\" Such payoff offers are common in the industry,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carlin v. Davidson Fink LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277161\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/207/#p217\">\n    852 F.3d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217 (2d Cir. 2017), and their ubiquity makes such an understanding reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Under the least-sophisticated consumer standard, \"collection notices can be deceptive if they are open to more than one reasonable interpretation, at least one of which is inaccurate.\"\n   <em>\n    Easterling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514080,4151097\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/229/\">\n    692 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   233 (citing\n   <em>\n    Clomon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517181\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/1314/#p1318\">\n    988 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1318 ). The Court concludes that the letter is open to a reasonable interpretation that payment of the amount due would stop interest and fees from continuing to accrue. Therefore, Ortiz has adequately alleged a claim that the letter was deceptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   ACCT's motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part.
