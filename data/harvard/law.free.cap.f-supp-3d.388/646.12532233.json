Defendants Violated the FLSA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The statutory minimum wage is $7.25 per hour and it is undisputed that Defendants paid Plaintiffs between $4.13 and $4.75 per hour. (Dkt. No. 41-2 at 4; No. 45-1 \u00b6 2.) It is also undisputed that Defendants deducted an amount equivalent to lost revenue caused by bar shortages, as audited and reportedly weekly to Defendants by Bevinco, from Plaintiffs' hourly wages paychecks. (Dkt. No. 41-2 at 5, No. 45 at 7, No. 45-1 at 9.) Mr. Keller was aware of this practice and described it as to \"make the bar staff pay the loss\" (Dkt. No. 41-3 at 3) and a \"policy\" of \"[w]hatever the shortage that Bevinco calculated, then that was divided by the working bartenders\" (Dkt. No. 41-1 at 21); a policy in which he \"charged them for my loss of revenue from inventory loss\" (Dkt. No. 41-1 at 22). Defendants further imposed the policy as a required term of employment\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   at Two Keys Tavern. (Dkt. No. 41-5 at 2.) Similar employment agreements for shortage deductions while claiming a tip credit have been found in violation of the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mayhue's Super Liquor Stores, Inc. v.

(Dkt. No. 45 at 8.) This argument is inapposite to the undisputed fact that Defendants claimed a tip credit and then deducted bar shortages from their bartenders' paychecks for hourly wages.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dorsey v.

Mr. Keller is the sole member of the LLC that owns and operates the two restaurants. (Dkt. No. 41-1 at 15.) He established the restaurants under an LLC that he and his prior partner incorporated without assistance from counsel (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12) and Mr. Keller personally applied for and procured the restaurants' liquor licenses (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13). Once the restaurants were ready to open, Mr. Keller hired general managers to oversee operations, such as hiring bartending staff, and he himself did not \"work [there] on a day-to-day basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) But Mr. Keller maintained constant oversight and decision-making authority over ongoing operations by, for instance, reviewing the weekly Bevinco audit reports (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33) and communicating with the managers about operations several times per week, including through weekly in-person meetings at the restaurants that could last a few hours each (Dkt. No. 41-2 at 3). The type and frequency of this involvement is sufficient to find that Mr. Keller's status in this workplace is one of economic and operational control so as to hold him individually liable for Defendants' FLSA violation.
