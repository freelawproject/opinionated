Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1. Plaintiff alleges that the policy resulted in the denial of housing at the Sand Castle for twenty of Fortune's clients and cost Plaintiff $65,000 in additional rent, as well as an unspecified additional amount in brokers' fees. ECF No. 116 at 7. The Parties consented to this Court's jurisdiction in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and Rule 73.

Prior to its acquisition by Sarasota Gold, the Sand Castle predominantly provided senior housing. Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 12, ECF No. 97-2; Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 12, ECF No. 98-2. Sarasota Gold, however, made renovations to the building, and, as apartments became available, began to accept residents who paid their rent in whole or in part with governmental rent subsidies, such as Hurricane Sandy victims with FEMA funding. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, ECF No. 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly after acquiring the Sand Castle, Sarasota Gold entered an agreement with Defendant E &amp; M Associates LLC (\"E&amp;M\") to serve as the Sand Castle's management company, and E&amp;M has since directed and controlled the complex's staff.

Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 25, ECF No. 131.

Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, ECF No. 131.

Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 29, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 29, ECF No. 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Parties agree that Sarasota Gold's and E&amp;M's senior leadership have minimal-to-no involvement in the day-to-day operations of the Sand Castle. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 30, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 30, ECF No. 131.

Mr. Tress has managed the Sand Castle since January 2014, is under the direction and control of E&amp;M, and is on-site once per-week. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 48, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 48, ECF No. 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Regulatory Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2013, Sarasota Gold entered into an agreement with the New York City Housing Development Corporation to become a provider of affordable housing (the \"Regulatory Agreement\"). Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 16, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 16, ECF No. 131. The Regulatory Agreement requires that 90% of Sand Castle residents earn no more than 125% of the Area Median Income and that 10% of residents earn no more than 135% of the Area Median Income. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 90, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 90, ECF No. 131. As applied by the Sand Castle staff, this typically means that applicants cannot earn more than $70,000 annually. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 91, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 91, ECF No. 131.

Racial Makeup Of The Sand Castle And Surrounding Areas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Parties dispute the current relevant racial makeup of the Sand Castle and its\n   surrounding area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants assert that based on the United States Census Bureau, 2010-2014 American Community Survey, the area around the Sand Castle is approximately \"50% Black.\" Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 13, ECF No. 97-2. Relying on a tenant roster on which Defendants' employees Rose Campbell and Sonia Forrest assigned a race to each tenant based largely on their own personal assessment (the \"Tenant Roster\"), Defendants allege that 70% of the Sand Castle's tenants are \"Black\" - significantly more than the 50% Defendants assign to the surrounding area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 14, ECF No. 97-2; Tenant Roster, Ex. E, ECF No. 97-8; Campbell Decl., Ex. Y, ECF No. 97-29; Forrest Decl., Ex. Z, ECF No. 97-30. Plaintiff controverts these numbers by citing to the same Census Survey, which reports that the area surrounding the Sand Castle is 44.3% Black or African-American, 28.3% Hispanic or Latino and 22.1% White, while the Census Block made up entirely of the Sand Castle is 37.4% Black or African-American, 14.9% Hispanic or Latino and 42.6% White. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 13, ECF No. 98-2; Ex. D, ECF No. 97-7 at 1-2; Ex. 8, ECF No. 94-5 at 340-42, 347. Neither side provided any information about the current or historical rate of tenant turnover in the Sand Castle, the Census Block or the Census Survey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. The Sand Castle Rental Application Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Since 2006, the year of acquisition, Sarasota Gold employees Ms. Silvera and Ms. Campbell have been primarily responsible for reviewing Sand Castle rental applications. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 35, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 35, ECF No. 131. Ms. Silvera's tenure ran from 2006 to early 2014, and in December 2013, Ms. Campbell succeeded her. Pl.'s 56.1\n   Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 38, 56-57, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 38, 56-57, ECF No. 131. Both were under the direction and control of E&amp;M.

Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 45, ECF No. 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prospective applicants learn about the Sand Castle through,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , online advertisements, broker advertising, housing agencies or by calling or walking into the office onsite. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 78, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 78, ECF No. 131. Applicants must submit to a review of their creditworthiness, criminal backgrounds and landlord-tenant litigation histories. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 80, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 80, ECF No. 131. Since Sarasota Gold acquired the Sand Castle in 2006, Defendants have used Weimark Credit Information Services (\"Weimark\") to conduct background checks on prospective tenants. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 81-82, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 81-82, ECF No. 131. The Weimark background checks list a person's criminal charges, including the nature, class, disposition and sentence. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 86, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 86, ECF No.131. Neither Ms. Campbell nor Mr. Tress can determine from the Weimark reports when a crime or conviction occurred. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 120, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 120, ECF No. 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants do not maintain any written policies on the Sand Castle's rental application process. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 95, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 95, ECF No. 131. The usual application process is for Ms. Campbell to field in-person, telephone and email rental inquiries. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 42, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 42, ECF No. 131. She has the authority to explain the Sand Castle's applicant criteria to prospective applicants, and she does so on a regular basis. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 44, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 44, ECF No. 131. When applications are submitted to Ms. Campbell, she determines whether the applicant satisfies the Sand Castle's rental criteria, and she has the authority to reject an application without prior approval from anyone else at the Sand Castle. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 41, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 41, ECF No. 131. Although the Parties disagree about the precise scope, both Plaintiff and Defendants agree that Mr. Tress plays a more limited, supervisory role in the tenant application review than does Ms. Campbell. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 52, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 52, ECF No. 131;\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Ex. 39, ECF No. 94-13 at 176 (Defendants' Supplemental Responses to Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories, stating that Mr. Tress is involved in the decision-making process with respect to accepting or rejecting tenants \"if there is concern or question about the applications which Rose Campbell doesn't know how to address or determine\"); Ex. 2, ECF No. 94-4 at 292-93; Ex. 10, ECF No. 94-5 at 640-43; Ex. 14, ECF No. 94-5 at 1262-63,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Ex. 10, ECF No. 94-5 at 698-99 (Mr. Tress's testimony stating that Ms. Campbell would at times contact him for approval if an applicant had a criminal history).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Campbell has full authority on her own to decide whether to forward an application to the New York City Housing Development Corporation (\"HDC\") for approval.

Only those applications passing Ms. Campbell's initial screening are sent to HDC; any application rejected by Ms.\n   Campbell is not forwarded. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 92, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 92, ECF No. 131. HDC and the Regulatory Agreement are exclusively concerned with applicants' income, and income has been the only reason that HDC has rejected an applicant approved by the Sand Castle staff. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 93-94, ECF No. 94-2; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 93-94, ECF No. 131. Other than the Regulatory Agreement's income requirements, Defendants assert (and Plaintiff agrees, with the exception of the criminal history criteria) that they provide their employees discretion as to each of the Sand Castle's eligibility requirements. Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 164, ECF No. 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    v. The Alleged Sand Castle Policy Regarding Criminal Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants do not maintain any written policies on the Sand Castle's applicant criteria, including with respect to treatment of applicants with criminal backgrounds.

The Parties present contravening facts regarding the existence or nonexistence of Defendants' alleged policy of excluding potential tenants with criminal convictions (other than traffic violations).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 96-114, 124-147, ECF No. 94-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 59, ECF No. 98-2 (noting that traffic-related convictions are not at issue).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Written Communications Stating \"No Criminal Background\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff submits several communications in support of its assertion that the alleged policy exists, relying heavily on correspondence surrounding a Craigslist advertisement. In January 2014, during the first month of his employment as the manager, Mr. Tress requested via email to a broker that a Craigslist advertisement be placed for the Sand Castle (the \"Craigslist Email\").

Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9 at 6. Relying on Dr. Wildeman's findings, which provided proportions of cumulative risk of incarceration for Whites, African-Americans and Latinos, Dr. Parnell used a \"Z test\" to assess whether, within the above-referenced housing markets, the differences in incarceration rates among each racial group are\n   statistically significant - in other words, whether the differences are meaningful and not due to random chance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. The Z test calculation is based on the proportions of the two populations' lifetime risk of incarceration - based on Dr. Wildeman's findings - and the size of the two populations in the relevant housing market - determined from the 2009-2013 American Community Survey measures of household income, which was designed and collected by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.

Mot., ECF No. 97-1 at 10, 12-13; (ii) Dr. Parnell used an improper applicant pool in his analysis - using market rent units without giving weight to income limitations posed by the Regulatory Agreement; including wealthy New York City neighborhoods in his applicant pool; and disregarding the fact that the Sand Castle participates in Section 8 and other government programs providing rent subsidies,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15; and (iii) Dr. Parnell's analysis is based on inadequate or unreliable data,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 11, 15, 17.

Dr. Parnell relies on Dr. Wildeman's findings based on national data to, as described in more detail in Section IV(b) above, assess the statistical significance of any impact a policy excluding individuals with criminal backgrounds from the Sand Castle would have on individuals of different races in specified housing markets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV(b). Dr. Parnell looks to the potential applicant pool for the Sand Castle by considering a variety of surrounding housing markets and analyzing several potential income ranges. Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9; Supplemental Parnell Report, Ex. 24, ECF No. 94-10. He concludes that for each income range and each housing market considered, the higher proportions of African-American and Latino individuals compared to White individuals that would be adversely affected by a criminal record ban is statistically significant. Parnell Report, Ex. 23, ECF No. 94-9 at 12; Supplemental Parnell Report, Ex. 24, ECF No. 94-10 at 10. In other words, Dr. Parnell opines that the disparity between those who would be impacted by such a ban who are African-American or Latino compared to those who are White is not due to random chance. Dr. Parnell does not analyze data specific to the Sand Castle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Although a reasonable fact-finder could credit Plaintiff's experts' testimony and other evidence to find Plaintiff proved a ban creates a disparate impact, Defendants raise sufficient challenges regarding the underlying methodology and conclusions to make summary judgment inappropriate on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Thus, even assuming the Sand Castle implements some type of criminal record ban - a question of fact that remains open - Plaintiff has not demonstrated as a matter of law that such a ban has a disparate impact on African-American and Latino persons, and Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on this issue is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Record Is Underdeveloped Regarding Remaining Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the Court finds a question of fact remains as to the first prong of the burden-shifting framework - whether the Sand Castle has the policy in question and, if so, whether that policy has a disparate impact on African-American and Latino persons. In light of that determination, the Court cannot grant summary judgment on the disparate impact claim in Plaintiff's favor. Although this finding does not prohibit the Court from finding summary judgment in Defendants' favor on this claim should the Court find for Defendants on the second prong of the burden-shifting test, such a finding would be inappropriate at this stage because the record with respect to the second prong is underdeveloped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In order to find summary judgment for Defendants on Plaintiff's disparate impact claim, the Court would have to assume there was a ban, but find that Defendants had carried their burden on the second prong, showing a legitimate business reason for the ban. Defendants have not argued that they have a legitimate business reason for a criminal record ban and, in fact, they \"concede that a blanket ban would not be narrowly tailored to balance the safety of the building and other tenants with the rights of a potential applicant.\" Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 97-1 at 38;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25; HUD Guidance, ECF No. 97-35 at 6 (\"A housing provider that imposes a blanket prohibition on any person with any conviction record - no matter when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then - will be unable to meet this burden [of showing the\n   policy or practice is necessary to achieve a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest].\"). Defendants instead argue that they have a legitimate business reason for using the case-by-case review of applicants with criminal convictions they claim to use. Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 97-1 at 38. Because the Court has not determined as a matter of law that the type of review on which Defendants' argument is based is applied, it cannot grant Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's disparate impact claim. There must first be a factual determination of whether a ban exists and the scope of any such ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Court notes that the record is similarly underdeveloped with respect to the third prong of the burden-shifting framework. The Supreme Court stated that \"disparate-impact liability must be limited so employers and other regulated entities are able to make the practical business choices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant and dynamic free-enterprise system. And before rejecting a business justification ... a court must determine that a plaintiff has shown that there is an available alternative practice that has a less disparate impact and serves the entity's legitimate needs.\"\n   <em>\n    ICP\n   </em>\n   , 135 S. Ct. at 2518 (alterations omitted). Although Plaintiff argues that the Sand Castle could do a case-by-case assessment of each applicant's criminal history, it has not addressed the practicalities of its proposal in the context of the real estate industry. Plaintiff itself notes that Mr. Tress did not know the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony conviction, and neither Mr. Tress nor Ms. Campbell know how to determine the age of an applicant's conviction or sentence. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 120, 130, ECF No. 94-2. Yet it expects these same employees to make informed and thoughtful case-by-case assessments of an individual's likelihood of recidivism and danger to the community. Plaintiff does not explain where Defendants should obtain adequate information to conduct this in-depth analysis or how Defendants should train their employees (or the costs and resources necessary for such trainings), such that their employees could make considered and appropriate, rather than arbitrary, determinations based on an applicant's criminal background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For all of the reasons set forth above, summary judgment is denied for both Plaintiff and Defendants as to the disparate impact claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
