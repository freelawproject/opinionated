She indicated yes, and I said okay I'm going to pretend to be a doctor and I'm going to poke around and see what's bothering you. I don't-there must be a reason you're not moving. And I got to her tail and I lifted it up and-she's very furry. She's a border collie mix, and her entire back end was covered with blood.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q.

Ravenna told SPD dispatch that the dog was kidnapped, but Layla was present and appeared normal.

When I asked to see the blood, Ravenna claimed that the neighbor cleaned it up just prior to SPD arrival and that [the neighbor] is very sneaky. She also told me that part of Layla's tail was removed for \"easier access.\" The tail appeared normal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   R. 118 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The police reports contain many notations that officers believe Ravenna was suffering from mental illness and required medical attention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 116 at 11-12 (citing records). Several reporting officers requested that their reports be forwarded to\n   a social worker employed by the police department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 103 at 22, 26, 28, 30. On May 22, 2015, the Skokie Police Chief and the social worker visited Ravenna. They told her that her neighbor was not breaking into her house and unsuccessfully tried to convince her to go to the emergency room. R. 118 at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On August 2, 2015, matters came to a head when Ravenna's neighbor called the police because Ravenna was banging on his windows and doors and standing in his yard telling him to return sunglasses she believed he had stolen. R. 118 at 18. After responding to the neighbor's call and watching a video recording of Ravenna's actions, defendant Officer Veenhuis concluded that there was probable cause to arrest Ravenna for disorderly conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The neighbor told Officer Veenhuis that he would be willing to sign a complaint against Ravenna.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Officer Veenhuis did not arrest Ravenna because she was not home at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Officer Veenhuis had been the responding officer for Ravenna's call on June 11, 2015, which was one of the instances when she claimed her neighbor had entered her house and raped her dog, and that the dog had \"told\" Ravenna about this.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 103 at 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   About four days later on August 6, Ravenna called the police at 1:07 a.m. and again at 1:34 a.m. to report that her neighbor had been in her house earlier in the day and had stolen her medicine. R. 118 at 19. Officer Veehuis, another officer, a sergeant, and Commander Robert Libit arrived at Ravenna's house at 2:30 a.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The officers knew that the neighbor had made a complaint against Ravenna on August 2, and that Officer Veenhuis believed there was probable cause to arrest Ravenna.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In a subsequent report to the Police Chief, Commander Libit noted that this incident with Ravenna was \"another unfounded complaint due to delusions,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 103 at 166, implying that the Skokie Police Department was well aware of Ravenna's prior history of claims and believed her claims to be a product of mental illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Upon arrival, Officer Veenhuis spoke with the neighbor who said he still wanted to sign a complaint against Raveena. R. 118 at 20. The officers asked Ravenna to come outside her house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ravenna eventually exited her house and the officers sought to arrest her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The facts regarding the arrest are disputed. The officers testified that Ravenna resisted arrest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Ravenna testified that she did not resist and the officers \"knocked [her] over.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Ravenna was arrested even though Illinois law authorizes (but does not require) commencement of a misdemeanor prosecution with a \"summons\" or \"notice to appear.\" R. 118 at 23 (\u00b6 23). But the Police Chief, who has been an officer for 37 years, testified that the Skokie Police Department only initiates misdemeanor prosecutions with arrests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\u00b6 24). Yet, a Skokie Police Department General Order instructs officers to \"not threaten [a mentally ill] person with an arrest,\" but to \"explain first that you need to talk to them further at the police station.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25 (\u00b6\u00b6 27-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Ravenna was taken into custody at the Skokie police station.

Scope\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Skokie first argues that the ADA does not \"apply to arresting, booking, and/or holding suspects.\" R. 101 at 1. But the primary authority Skokie cites in support of this argument is the Fifth Circuit's holding that \"Title II does not apply to an officer's on-the-street responses to reported disturbances or other similar incidents, whether or not those calls involve subjects with mental disabilities,\n   <em>\n    prior to the officer's securing the scene and ensuring that there is no threat to human life.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hainze v.

Skokie cannot argue that there was any danger or threat afoot when its officers arrested Ravenna. The Skokie Police Department has known for years that Ravenna's complaints were unfounded and likely the product of mental illness. And there is no evidence that Ravenna posed a threat to anyone at the time of her arrest. As the Fifth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Hainze\n   </em>\n   , when addressing a situation that is \"secure\" and without \"threat to human safety, [law enforcement officers are] under a duty to reasonably accommodate [an arrestee's] disability in handling and transporting him to a mental health facility.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454313\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/207/795/#p801\">\n    207 F.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to Skokie's argument, \"no circuit has found Title II of the ADA wholly inapplicable to ad hoc police encounters,\" and some even consider \"exigent circumstances attendant to a police officer's decisions during an ad hoc encounter [to] simply weigh in the balance when evaluating the reasonableness of a prospective ADA accommodation.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray v.

Ill. Feb. 2, 2018) (\"[W]here exigent circumstances were not present, courts have found that government entities can be held liable for failure to accommodate under the ADA in relation to on-the-street arrest situations.\"). Thus, Skokie's conduct in this case is subject to Title II of the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Vicarious Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Skokie next argues that it cannot be vicariously liable for the conduct of its officers. Whether Title II permits vicariously liability is a question that has been identified but not addressed by the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheehan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589266\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1765/#p1773\">\n    135 S.

But we have never decided whether that is correct, and we decline to do so here, in the absence of adversarial briefing.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Seventh Circuit has not addressed this question. Other circuits are split. The Ninth Circuit has held that public entities can be vicariously liable for Title II violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duvall v.

By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit has held that Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (a statute \"functionally identical\" to Title II of the ADA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    P.F. by A.F. v.

First, the courts reasoned that the primary remedy under Section 504 is injunctive relief directed at the public agency, \"not the employee who actually perpetrated the violation,\" and thus the statute should be understood to \"rel[y] heavily upon the idea of vicarious liability,\" even for damage claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529945\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/857/559/#p566\">\n    857 F.2d at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the observation that relief under Section 504 is primarily injunctive (which is also generally true under Title II of the ADA) is not necessarily a basis to imply vicarious liability. The fact that the statutes are focused on enforcing an agency's compliance could just as easily imply that the decisions of individual agency employees to grant or deny certain services for people with disabilities should be considered to have been ratified or adopted by the agency\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   without the need for vicarious liability through the employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Relatedly, the\n   <em>\n    Bonner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Patton\n   </em>\n   courts reasoned that respondeat superior liability is consistent with the intent of Section 504 to eliminate discrimination, and that absent \"a Congressional directive to the contrary,\" the courts would assume that \"Congress intended the judiciary to use every available tool\" to achieve that goal.\n   <em>\n    Bonner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529945\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/857/559/#p566\">\n    857 F.2d at 566-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Patton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4168760\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/498/933/#p942\">\n    498 F.

The Seventh Circuit held that these allegations stated a claim for violation of Title II by the hospital. The Seventh Circuit did not address the theory of liability underlying the claim. The district courts cited above assumed that the claim must be based on respondeat superior liability for the actions of the hospital's staff. But this assumption ignores plausible inferences that can be drawn from the plaintiff's allegations. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   alleged that a \"doctor\" and not merely \"staff\" were involved in her injuries. She also alleged that staff mistreated her over a period of time. These two allegations permit the plausible inference that a hospital officer with the authority \"to institute corrective measures\" on the hospital's behalf \"had actual knowledge\" of the staff's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/\">\n    524 U.S. at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The first such theory (which we shall call the \"effects\" theory) holds that a violation may be found when police wrongly arrested someone with a disability because they misperceived the effects of that disability as criminal activity. The second such theory (which we shall call the \"accommodation\" theory) holds that a violation may be found when police officers properly investigated and arrested a person with a disability for a crime unrelated to that disability, [but] they failed to reasonably accommodate the person's disability in the course of investigation or arrest, causing the person to suffer greater injury or indignity in that process than other arrestees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520245\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/1/#p16\">\n    917 F.3d at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   A reasonable jury could find liability for Skokie under both theories. There is evidence that Skokie understood Ravenna's actions to be the product of mental illness, not criminal activity. Thus, a jury could find for Ravenna on the \"effects\" theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Additionally, a reasonable jury could find that Skokie's policy requiring arrests for misdemeanor offenses, as applied to the misdemeanor disorderly conduct complaint against Ravenna, exhibits deliberate indifference to Ravenna's disability. This case likely would have been avoided if Skokie had issued a summons rather than subjecting her to the alleged violence and indignity of arrest. For this reason, a jury could find for Ravenna on the \"accommodation\" theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Ravenna argues that the evidence is sufficient to grant her summary judgment. While the Court agrees that there is\n   strong evidence that Skokie considered Ravenna to be mentally ill and that the responding officers were aware of this information, these remain questions of fact for the jury. And while it is undisputed that Skokie policy require arrests even for misdemeanor complaints, the actual application of that policy remains to be determined. Furthermore, the answering the questions of whether Skokie \"misperceived the effects of [Ravenna's] disability as criminal activity\" or \"failed to reasonably accommodate [Ravenna's] disability\" are requires fact intensive analyses not amenable to judgment as a matter of law. At bottom, these questions seek a determination of whether Skokie acted reasonably to arrest Ravenna considering all the circumstances. Ravenna has provided no authority that Skokie's actions were unreasonable as a matter of law. Those questions are for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Therefore, the parties' cross motions for summary judgment, R. 101; R. 102; R. 105, are denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Ravenna also claims that defendant Officer Veenhuis used excessive force in arresting her.
