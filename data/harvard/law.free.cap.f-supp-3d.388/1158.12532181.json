Although probable cause requires only a fair probability that a crime was committed, the Court finds that whether there was probable cause to arrest pursuant to \u00a7 9.05.160(g) is a question of fact that cannot be resolved at the 12(b)(6) phase.

As noted above, if there is a close call on probable cause, then qualified immunity enters the picture to protect an officer who has engaged in a reasonable mistake. Even if the Flynns' behavior was not the subject of a complaint by other people, that does not mean that their conduct did not violate \u00a7 9.05.160(g), and it was at least a reasonable mistake for a police officer to so conclude given the allegations in the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 27 (alleging that the Flynns \"stood up, approached the railing separating the stands from the field, and again flipped off the Giants players while screaming 'You fucking suck!' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    California Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 602(o) and 602.1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendants contend that, even if there was no probable cause to arrest the Flynns for a violation of Santa Clara City Code \u00a7 9.05.160(g), there was still probable cause to arrest the two for a violation of California Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 602(o) and 602.1.

More specifically, there are no allegations in the complaint that a Levi's Stadium representative asked the officers to make the Flynns leave; if there was no such request, then a critical element to trespass is missing. And given the lack of facts on probable cause, then there can be no ruling on qualified immunity at this juncture. That is, the officers could not claim a reasonable mistake on trespass if there was never a request by the owner or owner's agent in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    California Penal Code \u00a7 148(a)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that, for both the Flynns and Ms. Alcarez, there was probable cause to arrest for a violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 148(a)(1).

RJN, Ex.

But the Flynns' position is problematic because, even if the officers did not\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   tell the Flynns that they were being ejected, it is implausible that the Flynns did not understand such given that (as alleged in the complaint) (1) Officer Cusimano had previously told the Flynns to stop flipping off players and yelling, \"You fucking suck!\" and (2) the officers were bodily trying to get Kyle Flynn out of his seat and Patrick Flynn away from the railing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Flynns argue still that the officers had no basis to arrest them for resistance under \u00a7 148(a)(1) because (1) as a legal matter, a violation of \u00a7 148(a)(1) requires that an officer be lawfully performing his or her duties and (2) an officer is not lawfully performing his or her duties if he or she is (a) unlawfully arresting the criminal defendant\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   (b) using excessive force against the criminal defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CALCRIM 2656 (instruction on resisting a peace officer in violation of \u00a7 148(a)(1) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CALCRIM 2670 (instruction on lawful performance by a peace officer) (stating that \"[a] peace officer is not lawfully performing his or her duties if he or she is (unlawfully arresting ... someone [or] using unreasonable or excessive force when making or attempting to make an otherwise lawful arrest\")).

To the extent the Flynns still argue that there are questions of fact that should preclude dismissal at the 12(b)(6) phase -\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , was any refusal to comply with ejection actually completed before the excessive force was used - the Court notes that probable cause only requires a fair probability that a violation of \u00a7 148(a)(1) had taken place. Based on the allegations in the complaint, there was a fair probability that the Flynns had violated \u00a7 148(a)(1) because they did not comply with the officers' attempts to remove them from the stands. Moreover, even if there were a close call on probable cause, at the very least the individual officers would be protected by qualified immunity (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , any mistake made by the officers as to an arrest under \u00a7 148(a)(1) was a reasonable one).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Ms. Alcarez\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For Ms. Alcarez, the analysis is different. According to Defendants, there was probable cause to arrest Ms. Alcarez for a violation of \u00a7 148(a)(1) because she grabbed the baton being used on Patrick Flynn and thus interfered with an officer's discharge or attempted discharge of his or her duties. In response, Ms. Alcarez argues that she could not have been found guilty of a \u00a7 148(a)(1) violation because the officer was using excessive force on Patrick and thus she was entitled to defend Patrick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The problem for Ms. Alcarez is that it is not clear that \"defense of others\" is a defense to a \u00a7 148(a)(1) violation.

The Court therefore finds that, based on the allegations in the complaint, there was probable cause to arrest Ms. Alcarez but, even if not, at the very least, qualified immunity protects the individual officers as there was no clearly established law holding that defense of others is a legal defense to a \u00a7 148(a)(1) violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' motion to dismiss.
