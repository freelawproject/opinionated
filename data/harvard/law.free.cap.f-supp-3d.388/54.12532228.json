The petitioner may return to state court in order to exhaust his claims or may amend and resubmit the habeas petition to present only the exhausted claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306412\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/509/#p518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306412\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/509/#p518\">\n    at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306412\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/509/#p518\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As part of AEDPA, however, Congress adopted a one-year statute of limitations for the filing of fully-exhausted claims in a federal habeas petition and did not provide for the tolling of the limitations period while a habeas petition was pending in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duncan v.

Consequently, petitioners who come to federal court with a mixed petition run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims. This is because dismissal of a timely filed federal habeas petition containing unexhausted claims after the limitations period has expired will likely mean the termination of any federal review. To remedy this problem, the Supreme Court approved a \"stay and abeyance\" procedure whereby rather than dismissing a mixed petition, a district court can stay the petition and hold it in abeyance while the petitioner exhausts the unexhausted claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rhines v.
