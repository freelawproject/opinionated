Specifically, he asserts that he was replaced by a female bartender, Marshall, and that this gives rise to an inference of sex discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752911\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/205/#p214\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, he maintains that interviewers at Nebrasa and Bar Louie told plaintiff that Tonelli's informed them it was \"going with a new format\" and \"didn't want men behind the bar anymore.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752911\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/205/#p214\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Pl. Dep. 50:2-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants contend that plaintiff could not have been \"replaced\" by Marshall because she already worked there as a bartender\n   at the time he was terminated. Defs. Mem. Mot. Summ. J. 5, 13. Defendants further argue that even if Marshall took over plaintiff's shifts, that would not be sufficient evidence of sex discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court concludes that plaintiff has failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of sex discrimination. Plaintiff's evidence that Marshall took over his shifts is weak, stemming from a single text from Marshall that he received one week after his termination and was unable to produce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. 46:17-47:9. Even if Marshall did take over plaintiff's shifts, this does not mean that she replaced him, much less give rise to an inference of sex discrimination. Indeed, plaintiff testified that he and Marshall were the two \"primary\" bartenders at the time he was terminated.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 70:24-71:2. Plaintiff further testified that he did not know whether he was replaced by anyone or whether his shifts were \"absorbed by the existing workforce.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113:20-24, 114:18-24. Moreover, plaintiff admitted he \"had never been treated less favorably as a man\" at Tonelli's prior to his termination.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 107:19-24. At best, plaintiff has shown that a female bartender employed at Tonelli's took over his shifts immediately after his termination until defendants could find a permanent replacement-not that plaintiff was terminated for being a man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff's uncorroborated testimony that interviewers at two bars told him that an unidentified Tonelli's employee said Tonelli's \"didn't want men behind the bar anymore\" is also insufficient to meet plaintiff's burden.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 50:2-8. At the outset, the Court notes that this statement is hearsay which would be inadmissible at trial unless the declarants are called as witnesses. Nevertheless, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that plaintiff's statement is admissible in evidence, it is insufficient to give rise to an inference of sex discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin v. Diamond State Port Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 03-617,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%203059543\">\n    2004 WL 3059543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (D. Del. Dec. 30, 2004) (concluding plaintiff's uncorroborated allegation that a supervisor stated \"women should be at home having men pay their bills,\" without more evidence, was insufficient to establish\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Furthermore, numerous facts counsel against an inference of discrimination. Plaintiff wrote \"insubordination\" as the reason for his termination on his unemployment benefits application-the same reason defendants proffer for his termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. 25:5-6; Defs. SOF \u00b6 1. His only explanation for why he wrote \"insubordination\" was, \"I had nothing to put down. I had to put something down.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. 25:6-7. Defendants also provide evidence, in the form of affidavits and payroll records, that another man, Lineberger, was ultimately promoted and trained to become a bartender and take over plaintiff's shifts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Mem. Mot. Summ. J. 6; Defs. Mot., Ex. B., Payroll Records; Marshall Aff. \u00b6 7; Randa Aff. \u00b6 10; Barksdale Aff. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Based on this record, no reasonable jury could find in plaintiff's favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, plaintiff has not met his burden of establishing a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of sex discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Pretext\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Furthermore, even if plaintiff met his burden at the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   stage,\n   which the Court concludes he has not, plaintiff would fail at the pretext stage. To show pretext, \"the plaintiff must point to some evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which a factfinder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer's action.\"\n   <em>\n    Fuentes v. Perskie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844547\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/759/#p764\">\n    32 F.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 764 (3d Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants argue plaintiff has not presented evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that its proffered reason for terminating plaintiff was pretextual. Defs. Mem. Mot. Summ. J. 15. Specifically, defendants assert that plaintiff was terminated because of a \"bad attitude and poor performance,\" including being \"rude and difficult with management, co-workers and customers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844547\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/759/#p764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at J. 2-3. Defendants contend that plaintiff's behavior culminated in a \"final incident of rude behavior\" to the general manager on his last day of work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, plaintiff presents no evidence from which a factfinder could disbelieve defendants' proffered reason for his termination. That plaintiff \"enjoyed three years of employment\" with defendants and \"never had any serious discipline requiring memorialization\" prior to his termination does not refute defendants' averment that plaintiff was rude to customers and insubordinate on the day of his termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Resp. 7. Furthermore, that General Manager Barksdale's voicemail only stated that defendants were \"going in a different direction,\" does not render defendants' explanation a post hoc reason, as plaintiff avers.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In contrast, substantiating defendants' proffered explanation is the fact that plaintiff himself wrote \"insubordination\" as the reason for his termination on his unemployment benefits application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. SOF \u00b6 1; Pl. Dep. 25:5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, for the same reasons, stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , that plaintiff's evidence is insufficient to give rise to an inference of discrimination at the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   stage, plaintiff's evidence fails to support the argument that \"an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer's action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fuentes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844547\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/759/#p764\">\n    32 F.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No reasonable jury could conclude, based on this record, that defendant's articulated reason for plaintiff's termination was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that plaintiff has failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support his Title VII and PHRA claims. The Court thus grants Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and enters judgment in favor of defendants Tonelli's Pizza Pub and Randa Enterprises, Inc., and against plaintiff, Michael Goodrich.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
