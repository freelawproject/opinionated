Overview of the '237 Patent ( Patent No. 7,587,237 )\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The '237 Patent -entitled \"Biological Signal Management\"-relates to systems and techniques for analyzing and handling a patient's biological signal for medical purposes, including notifying cardiac monitoring technicians when an arrhythmia has been detected by the device. '237 Patent, Abstract, Ex. A\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Biological signals are electrical or optical streams that, in the medical context, include information relating to the physiological state of an organism which can be used to diagnose and treat disease. '237 Patent, 1:7-11, Ex. A. The handling of biological signals includes notifying medical personnel at a remote location when an \"event,\" such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (collectively \"AF\"), is identified. An event is a period in time when the information content of the cardiac electrical activity is of increased relevance. '237 Patent, 4:19-23, Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The claimed method of the '237 Patent involves receipt of cardiac biological signals involving events; determining a measure of merit for each identified event; comparing the measure of merit to a merit criterion; transmitting information of the events meeting the merit criterion to a remote medical receiver; and discarding information of the events that do not meet the merit criterion. '237 Patent, Abstract, Ex. A. The '237 Patent describes a method of analyzing biological signals before handling to reduce data clutter and handling costs. '237 Patent, 2:43-50, Ex. A. By analyzing the biological signal before handling and only transmitting meritorious events to the monitoring center for review, the volume of data that is handled by the system is reduced, including the volume of\n   data that is reviewed by medical technicians. '237 Patent at 2:46-50, Ex. A. \"Such reductions in data clutter can be used to quickly provide physicians with relevant information, decreasing the cost of data review and increasing the likelihood that diagnosis and/or treatment is appropriately delivered.\" '237 Patent, 2:46-50, Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The systems and techniques collect information describing variability in heart beats and determine whether that variability is indicative of AF. Pls.' Second Am. Compl. Ex. K, Doc. 58. The patented method accomplishes this by: (1) \"determining a beat-to-beat variability in cardiac electrical activity,\" (2) \"determining a relevance of the variability to one of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter,\" and (3) \"identifying ... an atrial fibrillation [ ] and atrial flutter event based on the determined relevance.\" '207 Patent, 1:49-56, Ex.

An order consistent with this memorandum follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit A\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    US 7,587,237 B2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   BIOLOGICAL SIGNAL MANAGEMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   This disclosure relates to the management of biological signals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Biological signals are electrical or optical streams that include information describing or otherwise relating to the state of a biological system. In the medical context, biological signals generally include information relating to the physiological state of an organism. Such information can be used to diagnose and treat disease states of the organism and can be gathered using any of a number of different techniques. Examples of such techniques include electrical potential measurements (e.g., electrocardiography (ECG's), electromyography, and electroencephalography), blood and other body fluid analyte measurements (e.g., pulse oximetry, blood glucose concentration, blood pH and other ion concentrations), and mechanical measurements (e.g., blood pressure measurements, heart sound transduction, height and weight measurements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   SUMMARY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The biological signal management systems and techniques described here may include various combinations of the following features.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   In one aspect, a method includes receiving a cardiac biological signal that includes an event relevant to a medical purpose, determining a merit of the event for the medical purpose, associating the event with a time span in which the event occurred if the event's merit is among a certain number of the most meritorious events that occurred in the time span, and handling the association of the time span and the event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The merit of the event can be determined by determining the severity and the quality of the event. The quality of the event can be determined by determining the noise in the event. An event can be received after the event has been separated from another portion of the cardiac biological signal. The event can also be identified within the received cardiac biological signal. The event can be one or more of an asystole event, a tachycardia event, a bradycardia event, and an atrial fibrillation/flutter event based on identifying characteristics of these events. The event can be identified based on a frequency of heart beats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   A category of the event can be determined. The event can be associated with the time span when the event merit places the event within the certain number of the most meritorious events of the category. The number of the most meritorious events can be predetermined. The association can be handled by generating a data structure having a time stamp associated with the event or by transmitting the association to a remote receiver. The event can have a greater relevance to a medical diagnostic purpose than an average relevance of the biological signal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In another aspect, a method includes receiving a cardiac biological signal that includes information describing events, determining a merit of each event based on one or more of a severity of a cardiac condition associated with the event and a quality of the event, and handling a subset of the events that meet a merit criterion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The subset can be handled for medical purposes. The merit criterion can be based on merits of other events. The merit of each event can be determined based on both the severity and the quality of the event. The subset can be the events that have merits among a certain number of the most meritorious and the subset can be the events that occur within a certain time span. For example, the time span can be predetermined. The subset of events can be transmitted to a remote medical receiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   In another aspect, a method includes receiving a biological signal, identifying an event in the biological signal, determining a merit of the event for the certain purpose, comparing the merit of the event with a second merit of a second event to identify a more meritorious event, creating an episode describing the more meritorious event, associating the episode with a time span in which the events occurred, and transmitting the association of the episode and the time span to a remote receiver. The event can have a greater relevance for a certain purpose than an average relevance of the biological signal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The episode can be associated with the time span by creating a data structure including the episode and a time stamp indicating when the event occurred. The episode can be created by redacting the more meritorious event. A category of the event can also be determined. The merit of the event can be compared with the second merit of the second event of the same category. The association of the episode and the time span can be associated with a collection of associations of episodes and time spans. The resulting collection of associations of episodes and time spans can be transmitted to the remote receiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   These biological signal management systems and techniques may provide one or more of the following advantages. For example, the management of biological signals can facilitate a coherent approach to organization and presentation of the information contained in the biological signals. Such management must address various objectives that often oppose one another. For example, the volume of data often should be reduced to minimize data handling costs. At the same, relevant information should not be lost. These objectives are of importance in the medical context, where data review may be carried out by a physician or other trained personnel and hence may prove costly. On the other hand, discarding medically relevant information may hinder or even prevent appropriate diagnosis and/or treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The described biological management systems and techniques can address these and other objectives by increasing the average relevance of data that is handled. Such reductions in data clutter can be used to quickly provide physicians with relevant information, decreasing the cost of data review and increasing the likelihood that diagnosis and/or treatment is appropriately delivered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Another set of opposing objectives relates to the timing of data handling. In many data handling systems, continuous handling of data is simply too costly. On the other hand, batch handling that only occurs occasionally may result in improper delays.

In general, the duration of spans\n   <strong>\n    505, 510, 515, 520, 525, 605, 610, 615, 620, 625\n   </strong>\n   is proportional to the duration of the events sought to be identified. The duration of spans\n   <strong>\n    505, 510, 515, 520, 525, 605, 610, 615, 620, 625\n   </strong>\n   can be selected based on consideration of two or more factors, such as the number of events likely to occur in each span and the need to handle events for a particular purpose for which biological signal\n   <strong>\n    200\n   </strong>\n   is monitored. In particular, if spans\n   <strong>\n    505, 510, 515, 520, 525, 605, 610, 615, 620, 625\n   </strong>\n   are too short, then spans\n   <strong>\n    505, 510, 515, 520, 525, 605, 610, 615, 620, 625\n   </strong>\n   may lack an event. On the other hand, if spans\n   <strong>\n    505, 510, 515, 520, 525, 605, 610, 615, 620, 625\n   </strong>\n   are too long, then the delay in handling events may be too large. Such a delay may be particularly harmful in the medical context, where an excessive delay may hinder prophylactic or diagnostic efforts. In the context of cardiac monitoring, a span duration of between one half and four hours, such as between one and three hours or approximately two hours, is effective to address such considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The duration of spans\n   <strong>\n    505, 510, 515, 520, 525, 605, 610, 615, 620, 625\n   </strong>\n   can also accommodate physiological rhythms of a biological system.

For example, when the biological signal is monitored for diagnostic medical purposes, the measure of the merit of an event can describe the diagnostic value of the information content of the event. The measure of the merit of an event can be based on a number of factors, including whether or not the event is representative of the biological signal or of other events of the same category in the biological signal, the quality (e.g., noise or signal dropout) associated with the event, and even the category of the event itself\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   The device performing process\n   <strong>\n    900\n   </strong>\n   can determine if the measure of the merit of an event identified at\n   <strong>\n    910\n   </strong>\n   is greater than the measure of the merit of the least meritorious event of the same category currently associated with the time span that includes the identified event at decision\n   <strong>\n    920.\n   </strong>\n   The least meritorious event of the same category can be associated with the time span in a data structure such as data structures\n   <strong>\n    700. 800\n   </strong>\n   (FIGS.\n   <strong>\n    7\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    8\n   </strong>\n   ). The determination can be made by comparing the measure of the merit of the identified event with the measure of the merit of the associated. least meritorious event of the same category.

A data processing device can perform the process\n   <strong>\n    1000\n   </strong>\n   in isolation or as part of a larger process. For example, the process\n   <strong>\n    1000\n   </strong>\n   can be performed within process\n   <strong>\n    900\n   </strong>\n   at\n   <strong>\n    915\n   </strong>\n   (FIG.\n   <strong>\n    9\n   </strong>\n   ). The device performing process\n   <strong>\n    1000\n   </strong>\n   can determine the severity of an event at\n   <strong>\n    1005.\n   </strong>\n   The severity of an event is a measure of the gravity of the event to the purpose for which the biological signal is monitored. For example, when the biological signal is monitored for diagnostic medical purposes, the severity of an event can be indicative of the individual's physical discomfort or hardship associated with a diagnosis that can be made using the event. Severity can be graded on a discrete scale or on a continuous scale. Table 3 shows example discrete grades of the severity of various cardiac events when cardiac monitoring is performed for prophylactic and diagnostic purposes. In Table 3, events are graded on a two point scale, with an event grade of \"1\" indicating that the event is more severe and an event grade of \"2\" indicating that the event is less severe (e.g., a moderately sever event). For example, event grade \"1\" can indicate an acute medical condition that requires immediate medical attention, whereas event grade \"2\" can indicate a chronic or other medical condition that does not require immediate medical attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Another approach to determining the severity of an event involves comparing characteristics of the biological signal during the event with threshold values relating to various physiological conditions associated with the events. For example, for a tachycardia event as described in Table 2, the severity of a tachycardia event can be determined using Equation 1:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-227\">Tachy Severity=(Heart Rate-Low Heart Rate)/(High Heart Rate-Low Heart Rate) Equation 1</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Similarly, the severity of a Bradycardia event, and Atrial Fibrillation Event, and a Pause event can be determined using the appropriate of Equations 2-4:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-229\">Brady Severity=(High Heart Rate-Low Heart Rate)/ (High Heart Rate-Low Heart Rate) Equation 2 20 AFIB Severity=Heart Rate/Atrial Fibrillation High Heart Rate Equation 3 Pause Severity=(Pause Duration-Low Threshold)/ (High Threshold-Low Threshold) Equation 4</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   The device performing process\n   <strong>\n    1000\n   </strong>\n   can also determine the quality of the event at\n   <strong>\n    1010.\n   </strong>\n   The quality of the event is a measure of the likelihood that the event is suited to the purpose for which the biological signal is monitored. One factor that can impact quality is the amount or type of noise in the biological signal during the event. For example, when the biological signal is a cardiac signal monitored for diagnostic medical purposes, noise can be determined using approaches such as those described in Wang, J. Y. \"A New Method for Evaluating ECG Signal Quality for Multi-lead Arrhythmia Analysis,\" appearing in Proceedings of IEEE Computers in Cardiology Conference 2002, pp. 85-88 and U.S. Pat.

The measure of the merit can be determined using any of a number of different approaches. Table 4 includes examples of various discrete merit grades (lowest, low, medium, and high) that can be assigned to an event when an event is determined to have the corresponding severity and quality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   The handling of allocated events, such as those allocated during a process such as process\n   <strong>\n    900,\n   </strong>\n   can involve any of a number of different activities. For example, event handling can include notifying medical personnel about the event. Such notification can be performed in response to the identification\n   of an event associated with an acute medical condition, such as those events graded level \"\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n   \" in Table 3. Event handling can also include the assembly of more complex data structures, the transmission of allocated events to, for example, a receiver such as receiver\n   <strong>\n    120\n   </strong>\n   (FIG.\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n   ), or the storage of allocated events (for example, in anticipation of assembly into more complex data structures or transmission). Such data structure assembly, transmission, and storage can be performed with events associated with medical conditions that do not require immediate medical attention, such as those graded level \"\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n   \" in Table\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   FIG.\n   <strong>\n    11\n   </strong>\n   shows a data structure\n   <strong>\n    1100\n   </strong>\n   that can result from handling of events associated with time spans.

Call router\n   <strong>\n    1565\n   </strong>\n   is a data processing device that, in accordance with the logic of a set of machine-readable instructions, identifies the content of an incoming communication and directs the communication to one or more appropriate application servers\n   <strong>\n    1575\n   </strong>\n   based on that content. Communications server\n   <strong>\n    1570\n   </strong>\n   is a data processing device that relays communications between call router\n   <strong>\n    1565\n   </strong>\n   and one or more application servers\n   <strong>\n    1575\n   </strong>\n   over an external network. Application servers\n   <strong>\n    1575\n   </strong>\n   are data processing devices that interact with a user or operate in isolation to provide one or more monitoring services in accordance with the logic of a set of machine-readable instructions. Data links\n   <strong>\n    1580\n   </strong>\n   can be part of a local area and/or private network or part of a wide area and/or public network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   In operation, sensor module\n   <strong>\n    1505\n   </strong>\n   can sense, amplify, and record electrical signals relating to the activity of the heart. Sensor module\n   <strong>\n    1505\n   </strong>\n   can also relay all or a portion of those signals to monitor module\n   <strong>\n    1510\n   </strong>\n   where they can be managed. For example, monitor module\n   <strong>\n    1510\n   </strong>\n   can manage the signals in accordance with one or more of processes\n   <strong>\n    900\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    1000\n   </strong>\n   (FIGS.\n   <strong>\n    9-10\n   </strong>\n   ). As part of the management, monitor module\n   <strong>\n    1510\n   </strong>\n   can transmit the signals to receiver\n   <strong>\n    120.\n   </strong>\n   The signals can be transmitted in association with a time span. For example, the signals can be transmitted in one or more of data structures\n   <strong>\n    700, 800, 1100, 1200\n   </strong>\n   (FIGS.\n   <strong>\n    7-8\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    11-12\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The transmitted signals pass along data link\n   <strong>\n    115\n   </strong>\n   over one or more of wired data link\n   <strong>\n    1515\n   </strong>\n   and wireless data link\n   <strong>\n    1520\n   </strong>\n   to receiver\n   <strong>\n    120.\n   </strong>\n   At receiver\n   <strong>\n    120,\n   </strong>\n   the signals are received by server\n   <strong>\n    1555\n   </strong>\n   which causes at least a portion of the incoming signals to be stored on data storage device\n   <strong>\n    1560\n   </strong>\n   and relayed to call router\n   <strong>\n    1565.\n   </strong>\n   The incoming signals stored on data storage device\n   <strong>\n    1560\n   </strong>\n   can be stored in one or more of data structures\n   <strong>\n    700, 800, 1100, 1200\n   </strong>\n   (FIGS.\n   <strong>\n    7-8\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    11-12\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   The incoming signals relayed to call router\n   <strong>\n    1565\n   </strong>\n   are directed to one or more appropriate application servers\n   <strong>\n    1575\n   </strong>\n   based on the content of the signals. For example, when the signal relates to a certain category of cardiac event, the signal can be directed to a certain application server\n   <strong>\n    1575\n   </strong>\n   that is accessible to a cardiologist having expertise with that certain category of event. As another example, when the signal originates with an individual who is under the care of a particular physician, the signal can be directed to a certain application server\n   <strong>\n    1575\n   </strong>\n   that is accessible to that physician. As yet another example, when the signal relates to a certain category of cardiac event, the signal can be directed to a certain application server\n   <strong>\n    1575\n   </strong>\n   that accesses an expert system or other set of instructions for diagnosing and/or treating that category of event. When appropriate, a signal can be routed to communications server\n   <strong>\n    1570\n   </strong>\n   which in turn relays the signal to the appropriate application server\n   <strong>\n    1575\n   </strong>\n   over an external network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Communications can also be relayed from receiver\n   <strong>\n    120\n   </strong>\n   back to individual\n   <strong>\n    105\n   </strong>\n   or to other individuals. For example, when a physician or expert system identifies that care is needed, a message requesting that the individual seek care can be returned to individual\n   <strong>\n    105\n   </strong>\n   over data link\n   <strong>\n    115.\n   </strong>\n   In urgent care situations, third parties such as medical personnel can be directed to individual\n   <strong>\n    105,\n   </strong>\n   either by receiver\n   <strong>\n    120\n   </strong>\n   or by instrumentation\n   <strong>\n    110.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof These various implementations can include one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) may include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language.

priority of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/762,887, filed on Jan. 21, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,194,300 as a continuation application. The contents of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/762,887 are incorporated herein by reference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   The following description relates to cardiac monitoring, for example, by monitoring cardiac electrical activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   The electrical activity of the heart can be monitored to track various aspects of the functioning of the heart. Given the volume conductivity of the body, electrodes on the body surface or beneath the skin often display potential differences related to this activity. Anomalous electrical activity can be indicative of disease states or other physiological conditions that can range from benign to deadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   One example of such a physiological condition is a trial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation involves the loss of synchrony between the atria and the ventricles. In complex atrial fibrillation, long-lived wavelets of depolarization travel along circular paths in the atria. This can lead to irregular ventricular beating as well as blood stagnation and clotting in the atria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   Atrial fibrillation is among the most common forms of cardiac arrhythmia and may affect more than two million people annually. Atrial fibrillation has been associated with stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   Another example of such a physiological condition is atrial flutter. Atrial flutter also involves the loss of synchrony between the atria and the ventricles. In atrial flutter, multiple atrial waveforms reach the atrioventricular (AV) node during each ventricular beat due to, e.g., atrial scars, an atrial infarction, or a re-entrant circuit encircling a portion of the right atrium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   Atrial flutter is less common than atrial fibrillation but is also associated with stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   SUMMARY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   The cardiac monitoring systems and techniques described here may include various combinations of the following features.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   A method can include determining a beat-to-beat variability in cardiac electrical activity; determining a relevance of the variability to one of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter using a non-linear statistics, identifying one of an atrial fibrillation event and an atrial flutter event based on the determined relevance. The event is a period in time when the information content of the cardiac electrical activity is of increased relevance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   The end of the event can be identified based on the determined relevance. An event state associated with atrial fibrillation can be transitioned into in response to identification of the event. The event can be transmitted to a remote receiver from an ambulatory patient. The relevance of the variability to atrial fibrillation can be determined by receiving information identifying a ventricular beat and assigning a preset value indicating that the variability is negatively indicative of atrial fibrillation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   A ventricular tachycardia event can be identified based at least in part on the information identifying the ventricular beat. The relevance of the variability to atrial fibrillation can be determined by determining an average relevance of variability in a collection of R to R intervals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   The beat-to-beat variability can be determined in a series of successive beats, e.g., by determining the variability in an interval between successive R-waves. The event can be identified by comparing the relevance of the variability to a first predetermined amount of relevance. Further, the relevance of the variability in the event can be compared to a second predetermined amount of relevance to identify the end of the event. The second predetermined amount can be lower than the first predetermined amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   A method can include collecting information describing the variability in heart rate over a series of beats, designating variability at a lower end of physiological values as being largely irrelevant to atrial fibrillation, designating variability in a midrange of physiological values as being indicative of atrial fibrillation, designating variability in an upper range of physiological values as being negatively indicative of atrial fibrillation, and determining a relevance of the variability described in the collection to atrial fibrillation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   The variability can be designated by multiplying the information describing the variability by a weighting factor. Information describing a variability in R to R intervals over a series of beats can be collected. The collected information can be a function of a ratio of a first R to R interval and an immediately preceding R to R interval, such as information related to factor DRR(n) as given by\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   The variability at the lower end of physiological values can be designated as being largely irrelevant by designating information related to factors DRR(n) less than about 0.0.2 as being largely irrelevant. The variability at the midrange of physiological values can be designated as being indicative of atrial fibrillation by designating information related to factors DRR(n) greater than about 0.02 and less than about 0.15 as being indicative of atrial fibrillation. The variability at the upper range of physiological values can be designated as being negatively indicative of atrial fibrillation by designating information related to factors DRR(n) greater than about 0.157 as being negatively indicative of atrial fibrillation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   Information describing the variability can be collected by collecting the variability in heart rate over a series of between 20 and 200 of the recent R to R intervals. The determined relevance of the variability can be the relevance of the variability to sustained atrial fibrillation. The series of R to R intervals can be a continuous series of R to R intervals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   A method can include comparing recent R to R intervals with preceding R to R intervals to yield a collection of comparisons, weighting the comparisons according to a likelihood that the comparisons are relevant to atrial fibrillation, and determining the average relevance of the collection to atrial fibrillation. The weighting can include identifying a first of the recent beats as a ventricular beat and assigning a preset value to weight the first beat in the collection. The preset value can be negatively indicative of atrial fibrillation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   The comparisons can be weighted by designating variability at a lower end of physiological values as being largely irrelevant to atrial fibrillation and designating variability in a midrange of physiological values as being indicative of atrial fibrillation. The comparisons can also be weighted by designating variability in an upper range of physiological values as\n   being negatively indicative of atrial fibrillation. A ventricular tachycardia event can be identified based at least in part on the identification of the ventricular beat. Recent R to R intervals can be compared with immediately preceding R to R intervals to yield a collection of comparisons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   The cardiac monitoring systems and techniques may provide one or more of the following advantages. Atrial fibrillation (\"AFib\") and/or atrial flutter (\"AFlut,\" with \"AF\" referring to either) can be distinguished from other types of cardiac arrhythmia, such as the normal sinus rhythm irregularity, irregularity from various types of heart blocks, and the irregularity associated with premature ventricular contractions. The described systems and techniques are a practical approach to calculating the beat-to-beat irregularity while providing improved positive predictability of AF. Moreover, the described systems and techniques are able to identify sustained AF episodes, where AF continues for more that approximately 20 beats and has an increased clinical significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   For example, when the systems and techniques described here were used to analyze the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, available from MIT-BIH Database Distribution, MIT Room E25-505A, Cambridge, Mass. 02139, USA, a sensitivity to AF in excess of 90% and a positive predictivity in excess of 96% were obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   The described systems and techniques are well-adapted to monitoring cardiac signals of ambulatory patients who are away from controlled environments such as hospital beds or treatment facilities. The cardiac signals obtained from to ambulatory patients may be noisier and otherwise strongly impacted by the patients' heightened levels of activity. Thus, improved monitoring systems and techniques, such as those described herein, are required for ambulatory patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   The described systems and techniques are also well-adapted to real-time monitoring of arrhythmia patients, where minimal delays in distinguishing between different types of cardiac arrhythmia can speed the delivery of any urgent medical care. The described systems and techniques also require minimal computational resources. Further, the described systems and techniques do not require training before different types of cardiac arrhythmia can be distinguished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   The details of one or more implementations of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

For example, beat detector\n   <strong>\n    315\n   </strong>\n   can be a QRS detector in that it identifies successive QRS complexes (or an equivalent indicator of ventricular activity) and determines the beat-to-beat timing from the time between complexes.

The detection of AF can include distinguishing AF from other sources of ventricular irregularity, such as premature ventricular contraction, heart blocks, and normal sinus rhythm irregularity. The detection of AF can also include distinguishing between short AF episodes and sustained AF episodes. Short AF episodes generally include between two and 20 beats and may or may not have clinical significant, whereas sustained AF episodes generally include more than 20 beats and may have relatively greater clinical significance. The detection of AF can also include the detection of other types of irregularity caused by random refractory periods of the ventricles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   AF detector\n   <strong>\n    320\n   </strong>\n   can analyze information regarding the time period between ventricular contractions to detect AF using non-linear statistical approaches. Non-linear statistics treats the relationship between variables as something other than a linear function. Detail regarding an example non-linear statistical approach to detecting AF is given below.

For example, decision logic\n   <strong>\n    325\n   </strong>\n   can be embodied in a circuit or decision logic\n   <strong>\n    325\n   </strong>\n   can be executed by a data processing device such as AF detector\n   <strong>\n    320.\n   </strong>\n   Decision logic\n   <strong>\n    325\n   </strong>\n   can also trigger the generation of an AF event by event generator\n   <strong>\n    230.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   Event generator\n   <strong>\n    330\n   </strong>\n   is a device such as a data processing device that prepares an AF event for handling. An AF event is a period in time when the information content of the signal sensed by sensor\n   <strong>\n    305\n   </strong>\n   is deemed to be of increased relevance to the monitoring of AF. AF events need not be of equal or predetermined duration.

Transformation function\n   <strong>\n    700\n   </strong>\n   is adapted to weight factor DRR(n) as being negatively indicative of AF when factor DRR(n) is at the upper range of potential physiological values (e.g., when DRR(n) is greater than about 0.157). Transformation function\n   <strong>\n    700\n   </strong>\n   is adapted to weight factor DRR(n) as being largely irrelevant to AF when factor DRR(n) is at the lower range of potential physiological values (e.g., when DRR(n) is less than about 0.0.2).

The system can also determine the relevance of the collection of weighted comparisons for recent beats to AF at\n   <strong>\n    620.\n   </strong>\n   The collection of weighted comparisons can be relevant to either the onset or termination of AF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   To determine the relevance, the system can sum the weighted comparisons to arrive at a number that represents the average relevance of the weighted comparisons in the collection. The system can calculate such sums for several beats in a row before determining that the beat-to-beat variability is indicative of the onset or termination of AF. In one implementation, the system calculates the average of the weighted comparisons of the beats in the collection and compares this average with a first predetermined threshold to determine if the variability is indicative of the onset of AF and with a second predetermined threshold to determine if the variability is indicative of the termination of AF. In general, the first, onset threshold may be higher than the second, termination threshold. The difference between the onset and termination thresholds can introduce hysteresis into the state transitions to stabilize any system performing process\n   <strong>\n    600.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   FIG.\n   <strong>\n    8\n   </strong>\n   shows an example of instrumentation for cardiac monitoring using an electrocardiogram trace, namely instrumentation\n   <strong>\n    800.\n   </strong>\n   In addition to sensor\n   <strong>\n    305,\n   </strong>\n   signal amplifier/processor\n   <strong>\n    310,\n   </strong>\n   AF (AF) detector\n   <strong>\n    320,\n   </strong>\n   decision logic\n   <strong>\n    325,\n   </strong>\n   and event generator\n   <strong>\n    330,\n   </strong>\n   instrumentation\n   <strong>\n    800\n   </strong>\n   also includes a QRS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   detector\n   <strong>\n    805\n   </strong>\n   and a ventricular beat detector\n   <strong>\n    810.\n   </strong>\n   QRS detector\n   <strong>\n    805\n   </strong>\n   and ventricular beat detector\n   <strong>\n    810\n   </strong>\n   can both receive an amplified and processed signal from signal amplifier/processor\n   <strong>\n    310.\n   </strong>\n   QRS detector\n   <strong>\n    805\n   </strong>\n   is a device such as a circuit or other arrangement that identifies the time period between successive QRS complexes.

Ventricular beats (i.e., premature ventricular beats) are irregular beats that interrupt the normal heart rhythm. Ventricular beats generally arise from a ventricular focus with enhanced automaticity. Ventricular beats may also result from reentry within the His-Purkinje system. The occurrence of ventricular beats is generally unrelated to AF. For example, the occurrence of ventricular beats can be used to identify ventricular tachycardia (e.g., when there are three or more consecutive ventricular beats). Ventricular beats may be precipitated by factors such as alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and stress. Ventricular beat detector\n   <strong>\n    810\n   </strong>\n   can monitor an electrocardiogram trace to identify ventricular beats. Various systems and techniques for identifying ventricular beats can be used. For example, the Mortara VERITAS Analysis Algorithm, available from Mortara Instrument, Inc.

Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing environment that includes a back-end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middle-ware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front-end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the environment can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\"LAN\"), a wide area network (\"WAN\"), and the Internet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   The computing environment can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made. Cardiac signals other than scalar electrocardiograms such as heart sounds can be monitored. Other weighting approaches and transformation functions can be used, depending upon the manner in which the timing of beats is compared.
