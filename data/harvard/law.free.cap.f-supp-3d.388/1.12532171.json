Ex. 1, ECF No. 20-5, p. 1. After searching its Consular Consolidated Database, the Consular Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo, and State Archiving System, State retrieved 53 responsive records. Stein Decl., ECF No. 20-4, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 29-36. State informed Mr. Machado Amadis of the search results, and it released 32 documents in full, released 9 documents in part, and withheld 12 documents in full.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    \u00b6 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Stein Decl. Ex. 4, ECF No. 20-5, p. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Next, Mr. Machado Amadis submitted a FOIA request to the DEA for \"all records related to [himself], as well as [his] entire record[ ] within the [DEA]\" (\"First DEA Request\"). Myrick Decl. Ex. A, ECF No. 20-7, p. 2. Given the request's breadth, the DEA construed Mr. Machado Amadis to be seeking the DEA's investigative files about himself. Myrick Decl., ECF No. 20-6, \u00b6 26. After searching its Investigative Reporting and Filing System and its Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System, the DEA found no responsive records.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 30-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Hardy Decl., ECF No. 20-8, \u00b65; Hardy Decl. Ex. A, ECF No. 20-9, p. 2. The FBI searched its Central Records System, and because Mr. Machado Amadis's FOIA request included an attachment about his 1990 visa application, the FBI searched its manual indices, index cards cataloguing pre-1995 records not searchable through electronic indices. Hardy Decl., ECF No. 20-8, \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43-45, 50, 52-54. The FBI informed Mr. Machado Amadis that it uncovered no responsive records and stated that its FOIA response \"neither confirms nor denies the existence of [Mr. Machado Amadis's] name on any watch lists.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl. Ex. B, ECF No. 20-9, p. 8 (citing FOIA exemption (b)(7)(E)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the FBI determined that Mr. Machado Amadis was likely seeking a copy of his FBI identification records (\"rap sheet\"), it referred his First FBI Request to its Criminal Justice Information Services (\"CJIS\") for processing. Hardy Decl., ECF No. 20-8, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Generally, a person must request a copy of his or her rap sheet directly from CJIS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    \u00b6 8, n.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dissatisfied with the agencies' search results, Mr. Machado Amadis filed six new FOIA requests. He requested that each agency provide records \"memorializing or describing the processing\" of his previous FOIA requests (Count VI-\"Second DEA Request,\" Count VII-\"Second FBI Request,\" and Count IX-\"Second State Request\"). He also sought \"all records, including emails, memorializing or describing the processing\" of the appeals of his First DEA Request and First FBI Request from OIP (Count VIII-\"OIP Request\"). Finally, he renewed his attempts to find the information causing State to deny his visa requests. He requested that the DEA disclose \"copies of all records, including emails, about him[self]\" (Count IV-\"Third DEA Request\"). And he requested that the FBI provide \"all records, including emails and cross references, about him[self]\" (Count V-\"Third FBI Request\"). These six FOIA requests are the basis for this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under FOIA, agencies must conduct \"a good faith effort to [ ] search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably expected to produce the information requested.\"\n   <em>\n    Oglesby v.

Cir. 1990) (\n   <em>\n    Oglesby I\n   </em>\n   ).

Both complied with Mr. Machado Amadis's request and conducted a search, trying to \"gather and review\" responsive documents.

He concedes as much. But he argues that the agencies' responses did not trigger the administrative exhaustion requirement. Mr. Machado Amadis reasons that because the DEA and the FBI offered to conduct additional searches if he submitted more information, the agencies' respective responses were not final \"determinations\" under\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A).

As described above, when an agency informs a requester that it has complied with a request but has located no responsive records, that is a determination, and such a determination is susceptible to immediate administrative appeal. The agency is not \"simply decid[ing] to decide later.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662279,3804439\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/180/\">\n    711 F.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Supp. 2d at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   An agency's offer to conduct an \"additional\" search does not alter the final, appealable nature of its determination. Instead, it allows a requester additional process that is not required by FOIA. But this courtesy offer to do more than FOIA requires does not vitiate the administrative exhaustion requirement. \"[I]f the agency does not adhere to FOIA's explicit timelines, the 'penalty' is that the agency cannot rely on the administrative exhaustion requirement to keep cases from getting into court.\"\n   <em>\n    CREW,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662279,3804439\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/180/\">\n    711 F.3d at 189-190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Conversely, an agency that does comply with FOIA's timelines does not forfeit its ability to invoke the administrative exhaustion requirement merely because it offered a requester more than he was legally entitled. To hold otherwise would discourage agencies from trying to accommodate FOIA requesters and pervert the intent of the FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Even if a requester submits more information so that the agency can conduct another search, as Mr. Machado Amadis did, the agency's original timely determination remains appealable. The requester has two options. If the requester wishes to submit more information, the he gets a second bite at the FOIA apple at the agency level. All the while he retains his ability to seek recourse through an agency appeal and may invoke that right at any time. This ability to appeal at any time ameliorates\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   's concern that agencies might \"desire to keep FOIA requests bottled up in limbo for months or years on end.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662279,3804439\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662279,3804439\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/180/\">\n    at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the requester is unsatisfied with the additional search, either procedurally or substantively, he has all that he needs to appeal. But Mr. Machado Amadis seeks to create a third option by preemptively retreating to court. That door is shut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ultimately, the agencies' letters fulfilled FOIA's requirements to trigger the administrative exhaustion requirement. And the agencies' offers to provide additional process that is not required by the statute does not convert their final determinations to merely \"interim.\" Thus, because Mr. Machado Amadis failed to appeal the DEA and the FBI's decisions to OIP, he has not exhausted his administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The DOJ is entitled to summary judgment on these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    C.

And while there is no evidence that the front-line attorneys received specific requests from their supervisors, Ms. Brinkmann's declaration shows that the front-line attorneys generally are tasked with initial reviews as a matter of OIP practice and policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brinkmann Decl., ECF No. 20-10, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Mr. Machado Amadis retorts that boxes on the Blitz Forms for \"Reviewer Comments\" and \"Attorney Follow-Up to Reviewer Comments\" are blank. Cross Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 31, p. 31. He accordingly reasons that the attorneys who write the Blitz Forms are the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   final decisionmakers. In essence, Mr. Machado Amadis argues that the Blitz Forms represent final agency decisions. But the fact that the supervisors reviewing the front-line attorneys' Blitz Forms did not have additional comments does not show that the front-line attorneys were granted decision-making authority, and Mr. Machado Amadis has cited no authority to the contrary. The supervisors may have simply agreed with their subordinates or disagreed without comment. Indeed, at least one of the Blitz Forms that the Court held OIP properly withheld in\n   <em>\n    Shapiro II\n   </em>\n   also had blank \"Reviewer Comments\" and \"Attorney Follow-Up to Reviewer Comments\" boxes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shapiro II\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 16-cv-01399, ECF No. 13-6, pp. 31-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Nor do to the blank boxes undercut OIP's stated purpose for the redacted information.

Mr. Machado Amadis limited the scope of the request to records created before State knew that he had filed his complaint in district court about his earlier FOIA request-before December 2, 2016. Stein Decl., ECF No. 20-4, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 37.

Am. Compl., ECF No. 15, \u00b6\u00b6 65-69. But State's search was reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. It therefore fulfilled its obligations under FOIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valencia-Lucena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662837,3669414\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/321/\">\n    180 F.3d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   State searched where responsive documents were reasonably likely to be found. State determined that its Office of Information Programs and Services was most likely to have responsive documents, because it is responsible for processing and responding to FOIA requests. Stein Decl., ECF No. 20-4, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 20. What is more, State wisely assigned the search to employees familiar with Mr. Machado Amadis's earlier request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. A State Government Information Specialist with knowledge of Mr. Machado Amadis's first FOIA request and State's records systems searched the agency's case management system, FREEDOMS 2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   And State searched in several databases using criteria unique to Mr. Machado Amadis's past request reasonably likely to return responsive records. It tasked the analyst who had worked on processing Mr. Machado Amadis's first request to search his government email account and the FOIA request mailbox for all correspondence related to Mr. Machado Amadis's First State Request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He conducted his search using the case number assigned to Mr. Machado Amadis's First State Request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   State retrieved three responsive records and released all three in full.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Still, Mr. Machado Amadis claims that State's search was inadequate. First, he argues that contemporaneous records in the administrative processing file contradict State's claim that neither the Visa Office nor the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo had been tasked to conduct searches as of December 2, 2016. Second, he claims that it was insufficient for State to search government email accounts and its FOIA request mailbox using the case number for his First State Request. Neither argument has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   First, Eric Stein, Director of IPS, unambiguously stated that the Visa Office and the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo \"would have no records responsive\" to Mr. Machado Amadis's request, because as of December 2, 2016, State had not tasked either with conducting searches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. \"Where an agency affidavit avers that a reasonable search was conducted, the agency is entitled to a presumption of good faith,\" and \"[a] plaintiff cannot rebut the good faith presumption that attaches to an agency's affidavit 'through purely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of other documents.' \"\n   <em>\n    Veterans for a Strong Am. v.

But speculation is all that Mr. Machado Amadis has to offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   To rebut Mr. Stein's averment, Mr. Machado Amadis points to an email sent by an employee at State's FOIA Requester Service Center that stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Our records indicate that on August 29, 2016, the Requester Communications Branch sent you an official reply acknowledging receipt of your FOIA request and assigning FOIA case number F-2016-10536 to it.

Currently we are determining if we have sufficient information to process your search and ensure we are able to protect personal identifiable information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Stein Decl. Ex. 2, ECF No. 20-5, p. 17. According to Mr. Machado Amadis, State's statement that it had assigned his request to \"the appropriate compliance research branch\" creates a genuine issue of fact whether the Visa Office and the U.S. Embassy had been tasked with conducting a search as of August 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Not so. That statement does not support an inference that the Visa Office or Embassy had become involved in the search.

This ambiguous-at best-statement cannot overcome the presumption of good faith ascribed to agency affidavits in FOIA cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Mr. Machado Amadis's claim that \"email searches normally require several different search terms, [one] of which [is] names,\" Cross Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 31, p. 25, lacks support. The touchstone for whether an agency has conducted an adequate search is reasonableness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shapiro II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523733\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/99/#p108\">\n    293 F. Supp. 3d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because requesters may have common names or several different FOIA requests, it is reasonable for an agency to use a unique identifier, like a FOIA request number, to locate only responsive records while excluding nonresponsive records. This is especially true when searching voluminous databases, such as email accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   More still, while Mr. Machado Amadis rejects Mr. Stein's claim that emails and State's FOIA mailbox are \"organized by request number,\" he offers no evidence to the contrary.

In fact, the email exchange Mr. Machado Amadis relied on to argue that the Visa Office and Embassy had conducted searches before December 2016 cuts against him. There the State employee who responded to Mr. Machado Amadis's email added the FOIA case number to the subject line of the email chain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl.
