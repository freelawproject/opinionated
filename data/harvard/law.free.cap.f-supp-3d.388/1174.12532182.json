However, the rule \"assists only in proving copying, not in proving unlawful appropriation,\" and \"[t]he showing of substantial similarity necessary to prove unlawful appropriation does not vary with the degree of access the plaintiff has shown.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518740\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/1116/#p1130\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, \"[t]he inverse ratio\n   rule has no bearing\" in analyzing whether the works are substantially similar for purposes of determining unlawful appropriation.\n   <em>\n    Rentmeester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516041\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1111/#p1116\">\n    883 F.3d at 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ex. 5.) The idea of cursed pirates is scenes-a-faire and unprotectable. Even if such an idea could be protectable, the Complaint alleges that the Screenplay incorporated \"the basic elements of the\n   <em>\n    Pirates of the Caribbean\n   </em>\n   ride.\" (Compl. \u00b6 26.) The Disney theme park rides on which the Screenplay is based feature skeletal pirates who speak, steer ships, and find treasure. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RJN Ex. 6.) Moreover, in Defendants' first film\n   <em>\n    Pirates of the Caribbean - Curse of the Black Pearl\n   </em>\n   , Barbossa and his crew's bodies are skeleton when they appear in moonlight-whereas Jack Nefarious and his crew have skull faces all the time regardless of whether they are in moonlight. Therefore, Plaintiffs' infringement claims cannot be based on the fact that the works include pirates who are skull-faced or skeletal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege the works are similar because they include treasure maps, ghost pirates, the \"undead,\" the supernatural, ships flying black sails, skeletons, privateers, naval attacks, dark fog, the \"pirate code,\" ghosts, and sea monsters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   These alleged similarities, however, are \"unprotectable elements\" because they are \"familiar stock scenes, and characteristics that flow naturally from the works' shared basic plot premise\" regarding pirates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, an objective analysis of the works demonstrates the plot and sequence of events in Plaintiffs' Screenplay and Defendants' films are not substantially similar. Plaintiffs' Screenplay is based on Davey Jones, a group of orphans named the Rascal Scoundrels, and Davey Jones' love interest Jane, who are in pursuit of a map leading to treasure. After battling with Jack Nefarious who has one half of the treasure map, Jones ultimately gives up the treasure for Jane and the orphans, whom Jones and Jane then raise as their own children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants' Films do not focus on a search for treasure. The plot of Defendants' first film,\n   <em>\n    Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl\n   </em>\n   , is about returning treasure Captain Barbossa and his crew found to end a curse they were put under when they stole the treasure.

(Compl. \u00b6 13, Ex. 5; Screenplay at 2, 29, 79.) However, cockiness, bravery, and drunkenness are generic, non-distinct characteristics which are not protectable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs' Davey Jones character and Defendants' Jack Sparrow character are not substantially similar based on an objective analysis of the works. As to their appearance, Plaintiffs' Davey Jones is described as a \"dashing young rogue,\" clean-shaven, hair pinned back in a tail (Screenplay 79), whereas Defendants' Jack Sparrow is never clean shaven, has facial hair, is dirty, has his hair in dreadlocks and wears a black hat, and his hair is never pinned back. Plaintiffs' Davey Jones character ultimately gives up the treasure he has been pursuing for love, to raise orphan children, and to return to life as a privateer with his newfound family at his side. Defendants' Jack Sparrow never renounces his piracy, does not have an equivalent love interest, does not care for children, is willing to sacrifice everything to be captain of his beloved Black Pearl ship, and continues to live the life of a pirate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Jack Nefarious / Defendants' Captain Barbossa\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Complaint alleges Defendants' Captain Barbossa character is substantially similar to Plaintiffs' Jack Nefarious character because Barbossa is introduced in Defendants' first film\n   <em>\n    The Curse of the Black Pearl\n   </em>\n   in a black outfit with a black hat, a twisting mustache and goatee, with sunken eyes, and left eye twitching. (Compl. Ex. 5.) In objectively comparing the works, however, Barbossa is introduced in the film dressed in dark pirates clothing with a white collar and a dark feathery hat with a pet monkey on his shoulder, he has a scraggly mustache and beard, and yellowish eyes, but his left eye does not twitch. Plaintiffs' character Jack Nefarious, on the other hand, is introduced in the Screenplay as \"[a] distinguished naval officer and pirate hunter with a savage\n   instinct and sinister nature. You'd hesitate to call him the good guy,\" and his \"left eye twitches.\" (Screenplay at 1-2.) Later in the Screenplay, Nefarious is described as \"[p]ale,\" \"[e]yes sunken in like a century old dead man,\" with a \"dark, twisting mustache with a curving goatee, makes him look more like a devil,\" \"clad in a black baroque pirate suit, he is charismatic in an evil way.\" (Screenplay at 47.) Moreover, any similarities between the characters based on wearing dark pirate clothing and having facial hair are generic and unprotectable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege Barbossa and Nefarious are substantially similar because Barbossa is \"not a bargainer.\" (Compl. Ex. 5.) This characterization of Barbossa is inaccurate because Barbossa bargains numerous times throughout Defendants' Films, including for his own life and the life of his crew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege Barbossa and Nefarious are substantially similar because Barbossa was Jack Sparrow's first mate and betrayed him. (Compl. Ex. 5.) Although Barbossa was Jack Sparrow's first mate, Barbossa led a mutiny to overtake the Black Pearl (Jack Sparrow's ship) and marooned Jack Sparrow on an island alone. Barbossa and Jack Sparrow continually fight over being captain of the Black Pearl, and Barbossa ultimately sacrifices himself, with the help of Jack Sparrow who gives him a sword, to save his daughter Carina from Captain Salazar. In Plaintiffs' Screenplay, Jack Nefarious is captain of a privateer ship which takes control of Davey Jones' pirate ship, but Nefarious shoots his own first mate, turns on his crew, and shoots his own privateer ship which causes it to explode and sink in the ocean because Nefarious and Davey Jones have a deal regarding finding treasure. It is revealed that Davey Jones was Nefarious's first mate, and Davey allows Nefarious to take command of the ship because Nefarious has the other half of the treasure map. Davey Jones does not maroon Nefarious on an island; instead Nefarious tries to take Jones' half of the map but is pulled into the ocean by the tentacle of a sea monster. Nefarious later returns as \"Phantom Jack\" in search of Davey Jones's half of the map and the treasure. When they find the treasure, the cavern floods with water, Phantom Jack is swallowed by a sea monster, and Davey, Jane, and the orphans escape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Jack Nefarious character and Defendants' Barbossa character are not substantially similar under the extrinsic test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Rascal Scoundrels and Jane\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Six orphan children named the Rascal Scoundrels are main characters in Plaintiffs' Screenplay. Moreover, the female lead in Plaintiffs' Screenplay is Jane, Jones' love interest, who is depicted as a young, beautiful woman with long red hair, whose background is not revealed in the Screenplay. (Screenplay at 8.) Davey Jones ultimately gives up all the treasure for a future with Jane raising the Rascal Scoundrels. Defendants' Films, however, do not include a group of orphan children and have no equivalent to Plaintiffs' Jane character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, there is no substantial similarity as to the characters of the parties' works under the extrinsic test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Themes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Complaint alleges the works are similar in theme because \"10 years\" is mentioned in Defendants' first film\n   <em>\n    Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl\n   </em>\n   , and \"is a continuing theme of time in the films,\" and the time period of ten years also appears three times in the Screenplay. (Compl. Ex. 5.) In Defendants' Films, the captain of the Flying Dutchman is cursed and can only go on land once every 10 years. In the Screenplay, 10 years pass between the first scene and the second scene when the Rascal Scoundrels are introduced, Jane says, \"ten years later you show up only to say you still love me,\" and Jack tells the Rascal Scoundrels that \"[f]or ten years the Phantom [Jack] has stopped at nothing to get that treasure.\" Accordingly, any theme regarding \"10 years\" as depicted in the parties' works is not substantially similar, and the concept of 10 years is generic and not protectable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Complaint also alleges the parties' works are similar as to theme because they both include betrayal. (Compl. Ex. 5.) Mutiny and betrayal, however, are generic stock themes and flow naturally from the premise of pirates and ships, and therefore unprotectable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, while Plaintiffs' Screenplay portrays Davey Jones as Jack Nefarious's first mate, Davey Jones does not lead a mutiny against Nefarious. In contrast, in Defendants' Films, Captain Barbossa was Jack Sparrow's first mate, but led a mutiny to overtake Jack's ship and marooned Jack on an island. Accordingly, the idea of \"betrayal\" in the parties' works is not depicted in a substantially similar manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Complaint also alleges the works are similar in theme because the main character in the parties' works \"will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.\" (Compl. Ex. 5.) Defendants' Jack Sparrow character, however, never becomes a privateer in Defendants' Films and continues living the life of the pirate, whereas Plaintiffs' Davey Jones character gives up treasure and piracy to become a privateer and raise orphans with his love interest Jane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Based on an objective analysis of the works under the extrinsic test, the Court finds the themes of the works are not substantially similar. The main theme of Plaintiffs' Screenplay is the cost of treasure and piracy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the realization that love and family are worth more than treasure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' Films include themes\n   regarding the costs of love,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Defendants' main character Jack Sparrow never gives up piracy for love, children, or family. Moreover, not all pirates are evil in Defendants' Films (e.g., Will becomes a pirate but is not portrayed as evil) and some of the privateers/non-pirates featured in Defendants' works are evil or morally corrupt (e.g., privateers for the East India Trading Company and Lord Becket, Captain Salazar). Furthermore, unlike in Plaintiffs' Screenplay where the privateers prevail, in Defendants' film\n   <em>\n    Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\n   </em>\n   , Lord Becket and the privateers aboard his ship are killed by pirates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Accordingly, the themes of the parties' works are not substantially similar under the extrinsic test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Dialogue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate \"extended similarity in dialogue\" in the works as required for the works to be substantially similar.\n   <em>\n    Shame on You Prods.\n   </em>\n   , 120 F. Supp. 3d at 1156.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' Screenplay does not include dialogue similar to the dialogue from Defendants' Films referenced in the Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Court notes a few instances of similar dialogue based on its objective review of the works, such dialogue appears in different contexts, are made by different characters, and/or are unoriginal because they are identical or substantially similar to portions of the theme song from Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the parties' works are not substantially similar in dialogue under the extrinsic test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Mood\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   While the parties' works include dark scenes involving pirate battles and sea monsters, the mood flowing from these scenes is unprotectable because it flows \"naturally from unprotectable basic plot premises\" involving pirates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, although\n   Plaintiffs' Screenplay includes skull-faced pirates and a Phantom Captain Jack, sword fights, and violence, the mood of the Screenplay is more lighthearted, some of the Rascal Scoundrels repeatedly provide comedic relief in the form of slapstick comedy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Screenplay ends with Davey Jones and Jane kissing with the orphans proudly alongside them. The mood of Defendants' Films is much darker, and Defendants' Films include more violence such as execution scenes. Accordingly, the mood of the parties' works is not substantially similar under the extrinsic test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    f. Setting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the setting of the parties' works is substantially similar because the works take place primarily aboard ships in the Caribbean, and are set in a \"ghost ship\" and cavern. The Complaint, however, alleges Plaintiffs' Screenplay incorporated \"the basic elements of the\n   <em>\n    Pirates of the Caribbean\n   </em>\n   ride.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26.) Therefore, the settings of the parties' works aboard ships in the Caribbean and in a cavern are unprotectable because they flow from the natural premise of a story based on Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, the fact that the parties' works are primarily set aboard ships, in port towns, and in the Caribbean,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not weigh heavily on the issue of substantial similarity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Having reviewed the works under the extrinsic test, the Court finds the works are not substantially similar based on any similarities in setting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    g. Pace\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs' work is a 111-page screenplay which depicts a fight between Davey Jones and Captain Nefarious over a treasure map, and then flashes forward 10 years to telling the story of six orphans living aboard Davey Jones' ship looking for the map and treasure, the battle between Nefarious and Jones over the map and the treasure, and concludes with Nefarious's death and Davey Jones's sacrifice of treasure in exchange for Jane and the orphans. Defendants' works include five feature films which are each over two hours long and together total more than 12 hours. Defendants' Films span over the course of many years and portray the various adventures of numerous characters including Jack Sparrow, Captain Barbosa, Will and Henry Turner, Elizabeth Swan, and Carina Smith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the parties' works are not substantially similar in pace based on the Court's objective review of the works under the extrinsic test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At most, Plaintiffs have demonstrated random similarities scattered throughout the parties' works. Analyzing the plot, themes, dialogue, mood, setting, pace, characters, and sequence of events as discussed above, the Court finds the parties' works are not substantially similar as a matter of law under the extrinsic test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs request that the Court \"allow the Plaintiffs to amend their complaints\n   after having the opportunity to view the original scripts used by the Defendants for the Disney films.\" The Complaint, however, alleges Defendants' Films (not the scripts for the films) infringe Plaintiffs' Screenplay. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50, 63, 77, 91, 105.) Therefore, the scripts used for Defendants' Films are irrelevant in determining whether Defendants' allegedly infringing works (i.e., Defendants' five feature films) infringe Plaintiffs' Screenplay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, amendment would be futile since the parties' works are not substantially similar under the extrinsic test as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
