However, the Court finds that the most analogous technology to that embodied by the '828 patent is cruise control technology which commonly exists in vehicles. Courts have found that such systems, which allow a driver to set and maintain a steady speed, are patentable and not directed at an abstract idea. For example, in a recent opinion from the District of Delaware, the court reached the following conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   The claims are directed to a physical system operating in three-dimensional space that, when certain conditions are met, physically impacts the speed of a moving object.

Therefore, like cruise control technology which physically changes a vehicle to provide a means of performing a particular function, the technology embodied in the '828 patent also changes a vehicle to provide a means of performing a particular function and is therefore not directed towards an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For this reason, the Court also finds the Defendants' citations to\n   <em>\n    Vehicle Intelligence &amp; Safety LLC v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4194743\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/635/914/\">\n    635 F. App'x 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2015) inapposite. The patent in\n   <em>\n    Vehicle Intelligence\n   </em>\n   claimed technology that screened equipment operators for impairment, for instance, intoxication, physical impairments like injuries, and medical impairments like heart attacks, and controlled the equipment if an impairment was detected.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4194743\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/635/914/\">\n    635 F. App'x at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Federal Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Vehicle Intelligence:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   critically absent from the entire patent is how the existing vehicle equipment can be used to measure these characteristics; assuming these measurements can be made, how the decision module determines if an operator is impaired based on these measurements; assuming this determination can be made, how the decision module decides which control response to make; and assuming the control response decision can be made, how the \"expert system\" effectuates the chosen control response. At best, the '392 patent answers the question of how to provide faster, more accurate and reliable impairment testing by simply stating \"use an expert system.\" Thus, in the absence of any details about how the \"expert system\" works, the claims at issue are drawn to a patent-ineligible abstract idea, satisfying\n   <em>\n    Mayo / Alice\n   </em>\n   step one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4194743\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/635/914/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4194743\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/635/914/\">\n    at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, the patent in\n   <em>\n    Vehicle Intelligence\n   </em>\n   broadly claimed an \"expert system,\" but failed to provide any specificity on the particular way of performing a function, and therefore was directed towards an abstract idea. In that patent, \"[n]one of the claims at issue are limited to a particular kind of impairment, explain how to perform either screening or testing for any impairment, specify how to program the 'expert system' to perform any screening or testing, or explain the nature of control to be exercised on the vehicle in response to the test results.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4194743\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/635/914/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4194743\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/635/914/\">\n    at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, the claims of the '828 patent in this case are directed at particular driving\n   conditions and specify which vehicle subsystems address such conditions and how such subsystems change to meet the demands of the changing driving conditions. In other words, the claims explain how the technology performs the ultimate function of adapting to drive on different surfaces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Further, the court in\n   <em>\n    Carrum Techs.\n   </em>\n   rejected the identical argument raised by Defendants here, namely that cruise control \"patents claim mental processes because they claim methods and systems that do exactly what human drivers perform in their minds, without more.\"\n   <em>\n    Carrum Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201779863\">\n    2019 WL 1779863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. In rejecting this argument, the court explained that \"[a] method of using a physical system is not a 'mental process.' The mere fact that humans have an alternative method of achieving the goals of the claims using sensory perception, mental processing, and physical braking does not foreclose the claims' patent eligibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201779863\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Similarly, in this case, drivers may engage in various mental processes while driving, for instance, driving slower while going downhill, avoiding sharp accelerations or braking while driving on certain surfaces. The technology embodied in the '828 patent, however, physically changes the vehicle's subsystems - wheel spin changes while driving on certain surfaces (claim 21), the suspension changes the height of the vehicle (claim 41), and speed controls are engaged while going downhill (claim 46). It does not computerize what humans would otherwise do by replacing the mental process entirely. Drivers may continue to engage in the same mental processes, but\n   <em>\n    the vehicle\n   </em>\n   itself has adapted to optimize and make driving on different surfaces more efficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that it is not clear that people could do what the '828 patent claims to do. Although Defendants provide the example of driving slower downhill or applying the brakes in a different manner, drivers are generally not able to change the wheel spin of their vehicles or change the suspension while the vehicle is moving. Therefore, unlike tabulating a vote or performing basic economic principles, the technology here is more than mere computerization of functions that people can already do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Because the claims of the patent are directed at both improvements in computer functionality and providing concrete, physical means of implementing the functionality, the Court concludes that the '828 patent is not directed at an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Inventive Concept\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Although the claims of the '828 patent are not directed at a patent-ineligible abstract idea, the Court will, in the alternative, assume they are directed at an abstract idea and consider briefly\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   Step 2 - whether the claims have been transformed in an inventive way that transforms and applies the idea into a patent-eligible one - as it provides an independent basis for denying the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants cite various cases which have held that merely changing the display of information or adding generic computer parts is not inventive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One Fin. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277932\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/1332/#p1341\">\n    850 F.3d 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (affirming the granting of summary judgment where there was no \"inventive concept\" that transforms the abstract idea of collecting, displaying, and manipulating XML data into a patent-eligible application of that abstract idea. \"Rather, the claims recite both a generic computer element - a processor - and a series of generic computer 'components' that merely restate their individual functions - i.e., organizing, mapping, identifying, defining, detecting, and modifying.\"). However, the Federal Circuit has identified improvements to the\n   efficiency of existing technology as one instance where an abstract idea is transformed in a sufficiently inventive manner to become patent-eligible.\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/#p1368\">\n    881 F.3d at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying summary judgment in part because material issues of fact existed as to whether some of the claims stored files in an efficient manner, and technology that \"eliminates redundancies [and] improves system efficiency\" is sufficiently inventive to transform an abstract idea into a patent-eligible concept).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In this case, Defendants have failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the claims are invalid because the only evidence currently before the Court on inventiveness suggests that the technology embodied in the '828 patent improves efficiency and therefore, is inventive like the technology in\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff attaches a number of articles and reviews by third parties praising the Terrain Response technology. Specifically, the articles note the inventive features. For instance, one article described the Terrain Response technology as making \"getting off the beaten track, and back again, as simple as it has ever been. Twist a knob, flick a lever and away you go. A simplistic explanation, to be certain, but fairly close to the mark for a system which has taken the guesswork out of the best way to handle a wide range of difficult terrain.\" Am. Compl., Ex. D, ECF 31-4, Kevin Hepworth,\n   <em>\n    First Drive\n   </em>\n   , The Daily Telegraph (October 9, 2004). Another article stated the following in describing the Terrain Response technology: \"Electronics have allowed engineers to do many things - among them\n   <em>\n    tune a vehicle for improved off-road performance.\n   </em>\n   Perhaps the pinnacle of this evolution, to date, is Land Rovers' Terrain Response System.\" Am. Compl., Ex. F, ECF No. 31-6, Richard Russell,\n   <em>\n    Seize Control of All Terrains\n   </em>\n   , The Globe and Mail (May 19, 2005) (\"The slick part is the programming that went into this. Terrain response sets operating parameters for ... suspension (firmness and ride height) ... [which] presets these parameters depending on conditions.... [The system can] automatically raise [ ] the suspension to increase ground clearance ... to provide wider range of control in anticipation of difficult conditions.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Terrain Response technology is also alleged to have received awards for innovation. Am. Compl, \u00b6 19, Ex. E, ECF No. 31-5, Land Rover Wins Two Queen's Awards, The Manufacturer (June 27, 2008), available at https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/land-rover-wins-twoqueens-awards/.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   These descriptions all suggest that the Terrain Response technology improves existing vehicle control technology by permitting drivers to control multiple vehicle subsystems when driving in particular conditions or on certain surfaces with a \"twist\" and a \"flick.\" Therefore, the technology is more efficient and inventive, transforming the idea into a patent-eligible concept. Accordingly, the Court finds that even if the claims were directed at an abstract idea, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to transform such an abstract idea by demonstrating the inventiveness of the technology at this stage. Ultimately, whether such claims are inventive is a question of fact. For these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step 2, which is an alternative basis to deny the motion to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
