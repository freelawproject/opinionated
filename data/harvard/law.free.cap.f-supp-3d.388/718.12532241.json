Having considered the parties' briefs, the evidence, and the relevant law, the Court issues the following order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is an action about benefits under an insurance policy following pollution damage to commercial property. The following facts are not disputed. Plaintiff HLT Properties, LLC (\"HLT\") leased commercial property (the \"Property\") to non-party Global Environmental Services, LLC (\"GES\") on January 20, 2015. (Lease Agreement, Dkt. 66-4). HLT's owner, Lewis Talbert (\"Talbert\"), visited the property on May 21, 2015, and discovered that GES was storing and recycling televisions, computers, and lead-bearing glass tubes known as \"cathode ray tubes\" (\"CRTs\"). (Talbert Dep., Dkt. 66-11, at 6:16-7:9). Talbert found that GES was \"separating the glass of computer screens, CRT Screens, and separating the lead out, lead and other chemicals out of the CRT screens from the plain, non-hazardous glass.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On May 22, 2015, Talbert sent a notice of default to GES and threatened to evict them for handling hazardous materials at the property in violation of the lease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:20-8:3). GES's operator, Kenneth Gravitt (\"Gravitt\"), assured Talbert that GES was not processing hazardous material on site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:12-15). By May 25, Talbert was satisfied that GES cured their default after GES cleaned up the site and sent Talbert a certificate of insurance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:4-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   GES obtained its insurance policy (the \"Policy\") from Evanston, which issued the Policy to GES for a period from July 21, 2015 through July 21, 2016. (Ins. Policy, Dkt. 66-3). The Policy includes a commercial general liability (\"CGL\") coverage\n   form and an environmental impairment liability (\"EIL\") coverage form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). The Policy also includes a choice-of-law provision specifying that New York law governs all matters arising out of or related to the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). Finally, the Policy contains an endorsement entitled \"Additional Insured - Owners, Lessees or Contractors (Blanket) Endorsement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65). This endorsement expands policy coverage under the CGL coverage form to include \"any person or organization to whom the insured agrees to provide Additional Insured status in a written contract signed by both parties and executed prior to the commencement of operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 27, 2015, GES's neighbor urged HLT to visit the Property out of concern that GES's operations were causing environmental damage to the surrounding property. (Talbert Dep., Dkt. 66-11, at 9:12-18). During that visit, Talbert discovered that GES had damaged the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:12-18). Talbert found that \"the place was totally a mess\" with sand piled outside the building, broken glass everywhere, and boxes stacked inside the building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:4-12:5). The interior walls of the building were \"messed up,\" the exterior walls had several dents and holes, the garage door was broken, and the AC system was clogged from GES's operations (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This was the first time that Talbert believed GES's operations rose to the level of pollution that would justify an environmental claim under the Policy. (Talbert Dep., Dkt. 76-1, at 14:7-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   That same day, Matt Hall, GES's contact, told HLT that GES intended to clean the Property and that it would not abandon the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Talbert Dep., Dkt. 66-11, at 10:18-11:7). HLT also made a claim under the Policy on October 27, 2015, asserting a claim arising from the abandonment of recycled computers which allegedly caused lead contamination. (Olear Dep., Dkt. 76-3, at 14:11-24; Denial of Claim, Dkt. 66-6, at 2). HLT also alleged physical property damage sustained to the Property as a result of GES's operations and use of the Property. (Denial of Claim, Dkt. 66-6, at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Evanston denied HLT's claim. On February 2, 2016, Evanston concluded that \"there is no coverage available for [HLT] under\" the GES Policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Denial of Claim, Dkt. 66-6, at 1). Evanston denied coverage because \"[c]overage is only available for insureds\" and HLT \"is not a named insured under the policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Specifically, Evanston explained that coverage is only available for insureds and that HLT was neither a named insured nor an additional insured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Evanston noted that the \"Additional Insured Endorsement\" required a written contract executed before operations commenced for HLT to be covered under the CGL form, but Evanston did not possess any contract between GES and HLT granting HLT additional insured status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). As a result, HLT did not satisfy the requirements of the Additional Insured Endorsement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Evanston also denied coverage under the terms of the Policy. First, Evanston noted that there was no coverage for the claim under the CGL form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Evanston explained that the policy \"only affords defense and indemnity for claims against an insured seeking damages because of ... 'property damage' during the policy period and caused by an 'occurrence', defined in pertinent part as an accident.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But based on the information Evanston received, there was no \"occurrence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Evanston also cited several exclusions in\n   denying coverage: the total pollution exclusion, the property damage exclusion, and the lead exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Because all of HLT's claims against GES arise out of property damage due to lead contamination or property rented by GES or owned by HLT, Evanston found that there was no coverage under the CGL form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Next, Evanston denied coverage under the EIL coverage form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). Evanston noted that the Policy included coverage for \"Sudden and Abrupt Discharge, Release or Escape of Pollutants\" for HLT's property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Evanston found that the alleged lead contamination and physical property damage arising from GES's work as an electronics recycler was not considered a \"sudden and abrupt 'pollution condition' \" under the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). And Evanston further reasoned that there was no verification that a \"pollution condition\" existed at the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, Evanston found that the Property Damage Exclusion precluded coverage for damages arising from property owned, leased or operated by GES. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 20, 2015, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (\"TCEQ\") inspected the Property. (TCEQ Inv. Rep., Dkt. 66-12). The TCEQ found that the outdoor sand piles contained hazardous levels of lead as a result of GES's improper storage and disassembly of recycled CRTs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, 6). The TCEQ also found that GES's operations were in violation of state environmental protection laws and demanded immediate remediation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4, 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   HLT complied and sought to recover its remediation costs from GES. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 66-13, at 2-3). The bankruptcy court granted HLT relief from the automatic stay GES's bankruptcy action in order to \"contact and assert a claim and receive payment from [GES's] insurance company relating to any covered loss as defined in any applicable insurance policy to the extent of any applicable insurance coverage.\" (Bankr. Order, Dkt. 66-5, at 2). Accordingly, HLT filed this action in state court against several insurer and insurance agent defendants, including Evanston, in addition to GES and Gravitt on February 17, 2017. (Orig. Pet., Dkt. 1-1, at 55). HLT obtained a default judgment against GES for property damage and cleanup costs. (Def. J., Dkt. 66-7). The state court ordered GES to pay $538,429.36 in damages plus attorney's fees, costs, and pre-and post-judgment interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant Risk Placement Services, Inc. (\"RPS\") later removed the suit to this Court. (Not. Rem., Dkt. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Evanston is the only remaining defendant in this action. The other defendants have all filed notices of settlement or stipulations of dismissal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RPS Stip., Dkt. 37; MSI Stip., Dkt. 87; AssuredPartners Joint Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 88; Travelers Not., Dkt. 94). In its amended complaint, (Dkt. 54), HLT states claims against Evanston for breach of the insurance policy, breach of common law duty of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of the Texas Insurance Code. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am Compl., Dkt. 54, at 7-8, 10). HLT alleges that a valid contract existed between GES and Evanston and that Evanston materially breached the insurance contract by denying coverage and refusing to investigate and timely pay HLT's claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). HLT also alleges that Evanston is liable under the Texas Insurance Code for failing to effectuate a prompt settlement of HLT's claim after liability was reasonably clear. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). Finally, HLT alleges that Evanston breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing by denying payment of HLT's claim without a reasonable basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). Evanston seeks summary judgment on HLT's claims. (Dkt. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Evidentiary Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As an initial matter, Evanston objects to and moves the Court to strike several exhibits included in HLT's Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Strike, Dkt. 92; Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 76). Specifically, Evanston asks the Court to strike the unsworn affidavit of Lewis Talbert, (Talbert Decl., Dkt. 76-2), because it is conclusory, speculative, and self-serving; it contains hearsay statements; it is based on conclusions of law; and Talbert is not qualified to render legal opinions and his opinions are not reliable,\n   (Mot. Strike, Dkt. 92, at 1-2). Evanston also moves to strike three sub-exhibits to Talbert's declaration because they contain hearsay and they have not been authenticated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Because the Court does not rely on this evidence in analyzing Evanston's motion for summary judgment, the objection need not be resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Evanston argues that it owes no obligation to pay HLT benefits under the insurance policy issued to GES because HLT is neither a named insured nor an additional insured under the Policy. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 5-6). Because Evanston questions whether HLT has standing to pursue its claims, the Court considers this argument first.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raines v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 66-3, at 65). Coverage includes only liability for \"bodily injury,\" \"property damage,\" or \"personal and advertising injury\" incurred in the performance of GES's ongoing operations for the additional insured that are caused by (1) GES's acts or omissions or (2) the acts or omissions of those acting on GES's behalf.

Policy, Dkt. 66-3, at 6 (providing that GES is the named insured)).

J., Dkt. 66, at 8). Thus, according to Evanston, HLT's damages were not the result of an \"accident\" under the CGL coverage form because GES could anticipate that HLT would suffer damages from its separation method. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 &amp; n.36). HLT, however, disputes that its damages were the inherent result of GES's acts; it says that GES's regular business operations involved separating the leaded glass for disposal offsite, and GES did not intend for the damages to occur. (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 76, at 4-5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cont'l Cas.

Talbert testified that GES stored and recycled televisions, computers, and lead-bearing glass tubes as part of its operations. (Talbert Dep., Dkt. 66-11, at 7:3-12). HLT argues that it realized that GES was \"actually separating the glass of computer screens, CRT screens, and separating the ... lead and other chemicals out of the CRT screens from the plain, non-hazardous glass\" in May. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:3-9). At that point, Talbert sent a notice of default, but he did not believe that GES was mishandling hazardous materials. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 76, at 5-6; Talbert Dep., Dkt. 76-1, at 10:9-21, 11:20-12:12, 14:17-23, 18:11-24). GES told HLT that it was not processing hazardous materials, just separating them for disposal offsite. (Resp. Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 76, at 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Talbert Dep., Dkt. 76-1, at 13:12-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   GES was in the business of recycling electronics, and thus potentially handling hazardous materials, but that alone does not show that HLT's damages were the inherent result of GES's acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Johnstown N.Y. v.

Properly performed, GES's business operations would not have damaged HLT's property. Thus, the cause and effect of GES's actions can be separated, and Evanston has failed to show that the damages to the property were intentional rather than the result of some accident. Given that courts construe \"expected or intended\" provisions narrowly, and drawing all inferences in HLT's favor, there is a dispute as to whether GES intended the damage to HLT's property or knew that the damages alleged would flow from its intentional acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But that is not the end of the coverage analysis. Evanston next argues that four exclusions preclude coverage for HLT's damages as a matter of law: the total pollution exclusion, the damage-to-property exclusion, and the lead and silica exclusions. (Mot. Summ.

(Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 9). According to Evanston, the exclusion was intended to preclude coverage for government-mandated cleanup. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 &amp; n.39). And HLT acknowledges its damages were incurred under TCEQ supervision to prevent environmental contamination and contain hazardous waste.

HLT, however, argues that not all its damages were a result of cleaning up lead at the property; the TCEQ only tested and required clean-up of the outdoor sand piles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Resp.

Talbert testified that, beyond the lead-containing sand piles, \"[t]here was physical damage to the building, it was filled with trash that had to be disposed of.\" (Talbert Dep., Dkt. 76-1, at 22:4-9). And \"the drive was covered with broken glass pieces in the gravel everywhere ... [t]he interior walls of the building were messed up ... [t]he exterior walls had several dents and holes in them.

The AC system was all gummed up with dust from their operation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:5-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   HLT's costs incurred by cleaning up the lead-containing sand piles are excluded by the total pollution exclusion under the CGL form. It is not disputed that TCEQ demanded HLT clean up and remove pollutants at the Property. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 10; Am. Compl., Dkt. 54, at 6 \u00b6 20; Pl.'s Objs., Ans., &amp; Resps. to Def.'s Interrogs., Dkt. 66-17, at 8-9 (admitting that HLT removed and disposed of hazardous waste at the request of TCEQ)). This falls squarely within the total pollution exclusion. While the total pollution exclusion precludes HLT's recovery for costs incurred as a result of the TCEQ-directed clean up, Evanston has not shown that the remaining damages to the Property were the result of the discharge, dispersal,\n   seepage, migration, release or escape of pollutants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    b.

(Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 10-11). HLT, on the other hand, argues that the Damage to Property Exclusion does not apply where the cleanup of an insured's property is required for public health reasons or to prevent damage to a third party. (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 76, at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, the damage-to-property exclusion precludes recovery for HLT's remaining damages claims. There is no dispute that the property damage at issue in this suit concerns property leased by GES. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lease, Dkt. 66-4, at 2; Pl.'s Objs., Ans., &amp; Resps. to Def.'s Interrogs., Dkt. 66-17, at 8 (admitting that the property damage was to property leased and occupied by GES)). HLT argues that the exclusion does not apply because the sand pile posed an \"imminent threat of pollution to public waters and land.\" (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 76, at 8 (quoting TCEQ Inv. Rep., Dkt. 66-12, at 5-6)). But, as already stated, costs HLT incurred in cleaning up the sand is precluded under the total pollution exclusion. HLT does not explain how remediating the remaining damage to the property was required to prevent damage to a third party or protect public health. The Policy expressly excludes property damage to property owned, rented, or occupied by GES. (Ins. Policy, Dkt. 66-3, at 43, \u00b6 (2)(j)). As a result, all of HLT's CGL claims are either precluded from recovery under either the total pollution exclusion or the\n   damage-to-property exclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    EIL coverage form\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Evanston also argues that HLT's damages do not implicate the EIL coverage form. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 12). The EIL covers property damage and cleanup costs \"resulting from a sudden and abrupt covered 'pollution condition' at, on, under, or migrating from\" the property. (Ins. Policy, Dkt. 66-3, at 74 \u00b6 (12)). A \"pollution condition\" is \"the discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of 'pollutants.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87, \u00b6 (NN)). In order to be covered, the pollution condition must commence during the policy period, the insured must report the pollution condition to the insurer in writing within 21 business days following its discovery, and a claim must be made within seven days from the day and time that the pollutants are first discovered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74, \u00b6 (12)(c), (e), (g)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Evanston argues that HLT's claims are not covered by the EIL form because they are not timely. First, Evanston argues that Talbert first discovered GES was separating lead and handling hazardous materials at the property on May 22, 2015, two months before the inception of the Policy. (Mot Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 13). Second, Evanston contends that Talbert did not report the lead contamination in writing until November 6, 2015, more than 21 days after he discovered the pollutants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14). But HLT disputes Evanston's timeline. According to HLT, Talbert did not discover the pollution condition until October 27, 2015, when HLT was notified about the sand piles. (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 76, at 10). Thus, according to HLT, no pollution condition existed in May 2015 because no pollutants were \"discharged\" until around October 27, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11; Talbert Dep., Dkt. 76-1, at 12:3-25, 13:12-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   There is a dispute of material fact as to whether its report to Evanston and subsequent claim were timely filed. It is not disputed that HLT filed a notice for a claim on October 27, 2015. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 3; Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 76, at 10; Talbert Dep., Dkt. 66-11, at 5:7-12). Accordingly, under HLT's version of the facts, Talbert discovered the handling of hazardous materials in May, but he did not believe it was an environmental claim because they were not mishandling it. (Talbert Dep., Dkt. 76-1, at 14:7-23). Talbert testified that it was not until October that he believed he had an environmental claim based on the uncontained materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   18:8-19:4). Merely handling hazardous material does not indicate that the lead contamination occurred; Talbert testified to the contrary. (Talbert Dep., Dkt. 66-11, at 8:1-15 (\"by May 25th they're cleaning up, and they provided me with the certificate of insurance.\")). Rather, the insurance policy requires a \"discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of 'pollutants.' \" (Ins. Policy, Dkt. 66-3, at 87, \u00b6 (NN)). There is no evidence, however, that any such discharge occurred before October 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Evanston next argues that the EIL coverage form is not implicated because the damage to the Property, occurring over several months during GES's ongoing business operations, was neither \"sudden\" nor \"abrupt.\" (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 14). To be sudden, an event must occur \"abruptly, precipitantly or brought about in a short time.\"\n   <em>\n    Northville Indus. Corp. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

Discharges that occur over a period of time are, by definition, not \"sudden.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ogden Corp. v. Travelers Indem.

(Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 14). Based on the TCEQ investigation report, Evanston argues that the pollution condition was incremental due to GES's employees' ongoing process of separating out the lead-bearing parts of the recycled CRTs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Drawing all inferences in HLT's favor, there is a dispute of material fact regarding whether the pollution condition was sudden and abrupt. HLT alleges that GES was removing leaded glass for disposal off-site, and that the remaining ground glass did not contain lead. (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 76, at 12). And Talbert testified that the sand tested as clean before October and that the sand was contained. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Talbert Dep., Dkt. 76-1, 18:16-19:4). GES may have been handling hazardous materials, but that does not indicate that the pollution condition was present before October.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Evanston argues that two exclusions preclude coverage for HLT's damages under the EIL coverage form: the known conditions exclusion and the \"your property - damage or cleanup costs\" exclusion. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    a. Known Conditions Exclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Evanston argues that the known conditions exclusion precludes recovery for HLT's damages under the EIL form. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 15). The known conditions exclusion precludes coverage for any damages arising out of pollutions conditions that existed before the policy period inception date or that were known to the insured at any time before the policy period began. (Ins. Policy, Dkt. 66-3, at 76, \u00b6 (J)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Evanston repeats its argument that because GES began recycling operations in April 2015-three months before the inception date of the Policy-the pollution condition caused by the lead-bearing glass existed before the beginning of the policy period. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 15). According to Evanston, Talbert testified that he discovered GES's manual, lead-separating operations in May 2015 and sent a notice of default to GES. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Talbert Dep., Dkt. 66-11, at 7:3-12, 13-15; Pl.'s Objs., Ans., &amp; Resps. to Def.'s Interrogs., Dkt. 66-17, at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As already stated, there is no evidence that the pollution condition existed before the Policy's inception date. Talbert testified that when he visited the Property on May 21, he was concerned: \"the place was messy. There was stuff outside, racks - big metal storage racks outside and boxes just sitting outside that should have been inside.\" (Talbert Dep., Dkt. 66-11, at 6:16-7:2). But it was not until the October 27 visit that Talbert found the sand outside the building and \"broken class everywhere.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:4-24). The evidence is at best unclear whether the pollution condition existed before October 27, which is insufficient for Evanston to show that the exclusion applies at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    b. Your Property - Damage or Cleanup Costs Exclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, Evanston argues that the \"your property - damage or cleanup costs\" exclusion precludes coverage under the EIL form. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 16). The \"your property - damage or cleanup costs\" exclusion precludes recovery for any claim \"[c]aused by, arising out of or in any way related to 'property damage' or 'cleanup costs' for property owned, leased or operated by [GES], or property in [GES's] care, custody or control, even if any cost is incurred or expended to avoid or mitigate further damage or 'claims.' \" (Ins. Policy, Dkt. 66-3, at 77, \u00b6 (Y)). Because HLT seeks to recover reimbursement of costs to remediate and repair its property after the TCEQ discovered hazardous levels of lead from GES's operations, Evanston contends that the \"your property - damage or cleanup costs\" exclusion precludes recovery. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As the Court has already explained, several district courts in the Second Circuit have found that exclusions precluding coverage for damage to property owned by the insured do not apply where cleanup of an insured's property is required to prevent damage to property of a third party or to protect public health.\n   <em>\n    Olin Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527263\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/332/818/#p844\">\n    332 F. Supp. 3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   843-44 (citing cases). The purpose of this requirement is to incentivize swift cleanup of pollution and avoid delaying remediation until it affects third-party property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527263\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/332/818/#p844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Savoy Med. Supply Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11312940\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/776/703/#p708\">\n    776 F. Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   708 );\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   HLT relies on this rule in seeking recovery under the EIL coverage form. It argues that its costs were a result of a TCEQ requirement to clean up pollutants in order to protect the public health. (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 76, at 7). Thus, according to HLT, its damages are not precluded under the \"your property - damage or cleanup costs\" exclusion under New York law. Evanston argues that this exclusion operates to exclude\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   costs, however, regardless of whether HLT incurred them to prevent damage to third parties or the public health. (Reply Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 91, at 10-11). Unlike the damage-to-property exclusion under the CGL form, Evanston notes that this damage-to-property exclusion explicitly precludes coverage related to property damage or cleanup costs \"even if any cost is incurred or expended to avoid or mitigate further damage.\" (Reply Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 91, at 10; Ins. Policy, Dkt. 66-3, at 77, \u00b6 (Y)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court disagrees. First, fairly read as a whole, the contract's use of \"further damage\" can be construed to refer to mitigating further damage\n   <em>\n    to the property owned, leased or operated by GES.\n   </em>\n   The damage-to-property exclusion precludes recovery for \"property damage\" or \"cleanup costs\" for property owned, leased, or operated by GES. The clause continues, specifying that recovery is precluded \"even if any cost is incurred or expended to avoid or mitigate\n   <em>\n    further\n   </em>\n   damage.\" (Ins. Policy, Dkt. 66-3, at 77 \u00b6 (Y) (emphasis added)). That second clause\n   modifies the first; in order to avoid or mitigate further damage, the implication is that some damage must have already occurred. That phrase thus refers to mitigating damage to property owned, leased, or operated by GES. At best, the clause is ambiguous, so it is construed in HLT's favor and is insufficient to grant summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Palmieri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2781632\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/179/#p187\">\n    445 F.3d at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, HLT sought to mitigate damage to third parties and prevent a threat to public health and safety. The insurance policy does not explicitly negate the general rule under New York law that damage-to-property exclusions do not apply where cleanup is required to prevent damage to protect public health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olin Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527263\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/332/818/#p844\">\n    332 F. Supp. 3d at 843-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Accordingly, making an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess as to what New York courts would hold, the Court finds that the \"your property - damage or cleanup costs\" exclusion does not preclude HLT's claim seeking to recover its damages incurred as a result of cleaning up the sand piles. Because the cleanup of the sand piles was required to prevent damage to third parties, the exclusion would not prevent HLT from recovering its related costs from Evanston under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Attorney's Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Evanston argues that HLT is not entitled to seek reimbursement of the attorney's fees it incurred to retain environmental counsel during the remediation of the Property and in retaining counsel in the Bankruptcy Action. Evanston contends that its duty only extends to fees incurred defending claims, not prosecuting them. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 66, at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ins. Policy, Dkt. 66-3, at 40, \u00b6 (I)(1)(a), (b)). As a result, Evanston argues that the fees HLT incurred in responding to the TCEQ investigation did not involve a suit and HLT's fees incurred in prosecuting claims against GES in the bankruptcy court are not covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   HLT does not respond to Evanston's argument that HLT is not entitled to attorney's fees for its costs incurred during remediation of the Property, its appearance in GES's bankruptcy, or costs incurred in prosecuting this case.

HLT now solely focuses on its status as a third-party judgment creditor, (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 76, at 4 &amp; n.19).

The bankruptcy court broadly permitted HLT to \"contact and assert a claim and receive payment ... from the Debtor's insurance company relating to\n    <em>\n     any covered loss\n    </em>\n    as defined in any applicable insurance policy to the extent of any applicable insurance coverage.\" (Bankr.
