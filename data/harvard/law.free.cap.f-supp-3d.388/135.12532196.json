According to plaintiff, the EOC Director reversed Montgomery's decision but told plaintiff she would have to ask for employer interviews separately from the rest of the class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Montgomery accepted the Director's decision, but stated\n   that he would not be giving her a \"referral\" from his program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thereafter, Montgomery gave to Edwards a certificate signifying her successful completion of the training program.

However, during one of plaintiff's later employer interviews Montgomery \"interrupted\" the meeting and directed his \"security guard\" to remove plaintiff from the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.
