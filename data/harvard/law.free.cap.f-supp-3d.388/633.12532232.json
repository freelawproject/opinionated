BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The basic facts alleged in the complaint are as follows: Plaintiffs, who were both formerly employed by Blue Ridge, are a same-sex married couple. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12, 14.) LaTia began working at Blue Ridge on December 14, 2013, and Octavia began on August 29, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12.) While working at Blue Ridge, Plaintiffs became aware that Blue Ridge was submitting reimbursement claims to Medicaid while out of compliance with Medicaid requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 25, 34). Plaintiffs made multiple attempts to bring Blue Ridge into compliance, including notifying their supervisor, Lynn Taylor, and Blue Ridge's owner, Lubna Reece, of the compliance issues, as well as contacting \"Sandhills Center, the Local Management Entity-Managed Care Organization above [Blue Ridge], to talk about [Blue Ridge]'s compliance issues and how to fix them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 34.) Taylor resisted Plaintiffs' attempts to remedy Blue Ridge's noncompliance and - after Plaintiffs went over her head to discuss the noncompliance issues with Reece - began openly expressing hostility towards Plaintiffs, including telling Octavia \"that she would not forgive [Octavia] for telling Reece about their noncompliance issues and that the best thing Octavia could do would be to find another job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 33, 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Blue Ridge also failed to pay Plaintiffs the legally required overtime wage for overtime work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 65.) When Plaintiffs complained about this to Taylor, she told Octavia \"that she needed to get on board or find another job\" and that any employee \"who did not like it could 'kick rocks.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.) Finally, Taylor told Octavia that Reece \"was not comfortable with gay people\" and that Plaintiffs should keep quiet about their marriage in order to avoid a confrontation with Reece. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.) When Reece eventually found about Plaintiffs' sexual orientation, she gave Octavia a copy of the Quran and told her that \"same sex marriage is not in God's will,\" but that she \"would pray about it and hope it all worked out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) On November 4, 2016, Reece \"expressed that if she had it her way she never would have hired [Plaintiffs] in the first place because she disapproved of their being gay.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Later that day, Plaintiffs were fired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) After receiving right-to-sue letters from the EEOC and the North Carolina Department of Labor, Plaintiffs instituted this action against Blue Ridge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-70.) Blue Ridge never answered, and the Clerk of Court entered default at Plaintiffs' behest. (Doc. 6.) Plaintiffs then moved for default judgment (Doc. 7); however, the court denied the motion and set aside the default because Plaintiffs did not properly serve Blue Ridge. (Doc. 9.) The court extended the time for service to be made, and Plaintiffs timely re-attempted service. (Docs. 17, 18.) The Clerk then re-entered default (Doc. 20), and Plaintiffs filed the instant motion. (Doc. 22.) Blue Ridge's response was struck by the Magistrate Judge because it lacked an original signature as required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(a) and because, as a corporation, Blue Ridge may only appear through an attorney,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Local Civil Rule 11.1(a). (Doc. 27.) Blue Ridge was provided time in which to file a corrected response, but it did not do so. On June 17, 2019, the court held a hearing on the motion and requested supplemental briefing from Plaintiffs. Blue Ridge did not appear at the hearing. Plaintiff timely filed the requested supplement, and the motion is now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Service of Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(h)(1)(A) allows service on a corporation consistent with Rule 4(e)(1), which permits service that \"follow[s] state law for serving a summons in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located or where service is made.\" The relevant North Carolina statute allows service on a corporation by, among other ways, \"mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the officer, director or agent to be served.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 4(j)(6)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this case, \"Plaintiffs have provided evidence that they have served the Defendant by serving its registered agent, Gregory S. Williams, via certified mail, return receipt [requested].\" (Doc. 18 at 1.) Plaintiffs properly addressed the certified mail to the registered agent at the agent's mailing address as maintained on the North Carolina Secretary of State's website.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 17-1); Business Corporation Page for Blue Ridge Health Services, Inc.,\n   <em>\n    Secretary of State: Elaine F.

Although the mail was undeliverable at that address, the United States Postal Service delivered it to the forwarding address associated with the original address, where it was received and signed for. (Docs. 17, 17-1, 17-2, 17-3.) The forwarding appears to have been effective, as Blue Ridge attempted to make its first filing in the case thereafter in the form of a response (Doc. 25) to Plaintiffs' dispositive motion, although - as previously noted - the response was later struck as deficient by the Magistrate Judge. (Doc. 27.) On this record, it appears that Plaintiffs have properly served Blue Ridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Doc. 23-3 \u00b6 6.) She worked 43 hours per week in the office and averaged around 12 hours of work per weekend, of which about 3 hours were for rehabilitation technician work and 9 hours were for personal care and respite work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-10.) Including the overtime rate, where applicable, LaTia's approximate weekly pay was therefore $709. Octavia was paid $13 per hour and worked 43 hours per week. (Doc. 23-2 \u00b6 5.) Her approximate weekly pay was therefore $578.50. Plaintiffs were terminated on November 4, 2016, and Blue Ridge was dissolved approximately 85 weeks later, on June 19, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 30 at 1.) Multiplying Plaintiffs' weekly rates by 85 produces an initial total of $60,265 for LaTia and $49,172.50 for Octavia. However, Plaintiffs mitigated their damages to some extent by finding other work during the 85-week period: LaTia earned $29,010.75 and Octavia earned $23,521.97. (Docs. 23-2, 23-3, 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This brings the court to a legal issue: should the initial back pay amounts be doubled (under the FCA) or trebled (under REDA) before subtracting the mitigation amounts, or afterwards?

This request has a number of problems. First, Plaintiffs have not explained why a case expressly discussing \"[e]motional distress awards within the Second Circuit\" is an appropriate guideline for claims brought in the Middle District of North Carolina. Second, even if the court were to borrow its damages framework from the Eastern District of New York, Plaintiffs fail to acknowledge that other cases from that district provide a much lower damages range.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Houlihan's Rest., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-CV-03129(ENV)(RER),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202470023\">\n    2011 WL 2470023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (E.D.N.Y. May 10, 2011) (\"Plaintiffs with garden variety claims generally receive between $5,000 and $35,000.\"). Third, Plaintiffs have not provided any reasoned basis for their assertion that they \"suffered emotional distress on the upper end of garden variety.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Fourth Circuit has stated that \"[a]n award of compensatory emotional distress damages requires evidence establishing that the plaintiff suffered demonstrable emotional distress, which must be sufficiently articulated; neither conclusory statements that the plaintiff suffered emotional distress nor the mere fact that a violation occurred supports an award of compensatory damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

(Doc. 23-2 \u00b6\u00b6 10-15, Doc. 23-3 \u00b6\u00b6 16-20.) Consequently, the court will award Plaintiffs $5,000 apiece in emotional distress damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This resolved, the court may finally calculate and compare Plaintiffs' damages under the FCA and REDA. As previously noted, Plaintiffs request an award under whichever of these statutes provides the greatest recovery. To calculate LaTia's FCA damages award, the court starts with her initial back pay amount of $60,265, subtracts her mitigation amount of $29,010.75, and doubles the result, equaling $62,508.50. The court then adds the $5,000 emotional distress award, equaling $67,508.50. For Octavia, the court starts with her initial back pay amount of $49,172.50, subtracts her mitigation amount of $23,521.97, and doubles the result, equaling $51,301.06. With the emotional distress award, Octavia's FCA total is 56,301.06. Plaintiffs' REDA damages awards are three times their post-mitigation back pay figures. For LaTia, this equals $93,762.75. For Octavia, it equals $76,951.59. In both contexts, Plaintiffs would receive pre-judgment interest at the rate of 8% per annum on the back pay and\n   post-judgment interest at the federal rate on the total sums.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Therefore, because the REDA award exceeds the FCA award, and because Plaintiffs have specifically requested judgment based on the theory of recovery that produces the larger amount to be awarded (Doc. 23 at 21), the court will grant Plaintiffs relief under REDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the reasons stated,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (1) Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment (Doc. 22), construed as a motion for default judgment, is GRANTED, and Plaintiff LaTia Harris shall have and recover of Blue Ridge $93,762.75, plus pre-judgment interest at 8% per annum and post-judgment interest at the federal rate, and Plaintiff Octavia Harris shall have and recover of Blue Ridge $76,951.59, plus pre-judgment interest at 8% per annum and post-judgment interest at the federal rate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (2) Plaintiffs shall be awarded costs as prevailing parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (3) Plaintiffs, as prevailing parties, may file an appropriate motion for attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to Local Civil Rule 54.2. Given Blue Ridge's default, counsel is excused from the Local Rule's requirement that the parties attempt to reach an agreement on the proper fee award. However, counsel should comply with the remainder of Local Rule 54.2 by filing any motion for attorneys' fees within 60 days and supporting it with \"affidavits, time records, or other evidence, setting forth the factual basis for each criterion which the Court will consider in making such an award\" under the applicable law. As to costs, counsel should similarly comply with Local Rule 54.1. To the extent counsel in his affidavit requests\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of his fee documentation rather than filing it in compliance with the Local Rules (Doc. 23-1 \u00b6 5), the request is denied, but counsel is free to edit his fee documentation prior to submission if necessary to preserve any applicable privilege.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    \"Although the Fourth Circuit has not explicitly held that the\n    <em>\n     McDonnell Douglas\n    </em>\n    burden-shifting framework applies in FCA retaliation cases, there is little doubt that the framework applies there as the Fourth Circuit has applied the framework in similar contexts, including retaliation claims under Title VII.
