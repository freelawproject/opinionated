Plaintiff has appended to the Complaint a copy of the Executive Risk Policy (ECF 1-1) as well as the RLI Policy (ECF 1-2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 11, 2018, Executive Risk moved to dismiss Count II of the Complaint, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). ECF 16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion is supported by memorandum of law (ECF 16-1) (collectively, the \"Motion\") and an exhibit. ECF 16-2 (Denial Letter, dated May 1, 2015). According to Executive Risk, plaintiff's claim is subject to Maryland's three-year statute of limitations, set forth in Md. Code (2013 Repl. Vol., 2018 Supp.), \u00a7 5-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"C.J.\"). Because plaintiff did not file suit until September 5, 2018,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , more than three years after Executive Risk denied coverage on May 1, 2015, Executive Risk maintains that plaintiff's suit is time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff opposes the Motion, asserting that the Court should not consider the Denial Letter of May 1, 2015 (ECF 16-2) in ruling on the Motion. ECF 18 at 3-4. Alternatively, plaintiff argues that \"its cause of action for breach of contract did not accrue on May 1, 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Executive Risk has replied. ECF 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   No hearing is necessary to resolve the Motion. Local Rule 105.6. For the reasons that follow, I shall grant the Motion (ECF 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Complaint lays out one of the ways in which Baltimore Scrap purchases scrap from a customer,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8: \"[A]n individual drives into the facility, has his or her vehicle weighed upon entry, receives instructions to drop the metal being purchased by Baltimore Scrap at a particular area of the scrapyard, and then returns to have the vehicle weighed again.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, \"the customer receives a ticket with a value that is based upon the type of material in the load and the weight difference of their vehicle at departure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ticket is \"scanned by the customer at an ATM-like machine onsite, in exchange for cash.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 24, 2014, a Baltimore Scrap employee \"discovered that a regular customer, Kenneth Grimes, entered the yard with a loaded truck, had the truck weighed by the company scales, but then instead of dropping the metal within the yard, proceeded to drive out a back gate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. About 30 minutes later, Mr. Grimes \"returned to the yard through the back gate with an empty truck.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Mr. Grimes \"attempt[ed] to weigh-out with the empty truck\" to receive compensation for the scrap, the employee \"escorted\" Mr. Grimes \"off the premises.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After reviewing footage from \"security cameras [that] were first installed at the yard in July 2014,\" Baltimore Scrap discovered that \"over a period of three months, Mr. Grimes entered the yard 23 times with a full truck, and after having the truck weighed, drove out a back gate on the property without unloading scrap.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Each time, he \"returned to the yard, and had his truck weighed again so that he was being paid for scrap that he was stealing from the yard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In each instance, Mr. Grimes signed a \"slip on behalf of his employer, Otis Elevator[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. The Complaint asserts that \"over the course of those 23 transactions,\" Grimes \"was paid approximately $23,000 for material he did not leave at the yard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, \"Otis Elevator has confirmed that it did not receive any money from Mr. Grimes for the Baltimore Scrap tickets, and had no knowledge of Mr. Grimes's activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a result of the employee's discovery, the State of Maryland charged Mr. Grimes with a theft offense, and he was subsequently convicted.

Based on our review, we have concluded that the claim is not covered under the Crime Coverage Part as more fully explained below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   According to the information provided to date, we understand the facts to be as follows: Baltimore Scrap Corp. purchases scrap from various entities. A truck driver from Otis Elevator presented his truck to be weighed on Baltimore's scale for purposes of determining the weight of the vehicle's contents for its sale to Baltimore. Once weighed, the Otis Elevator driver was instructed to empty the load contents at the back of Baltimore's facility and come back to the scale to get weighed. The driver would receive payment for the value of the difference in weight. Unbeknownst to Baltimore at the time, the driver did not unload the contents of the truck at the facility. Rather, he took the truck off the premises, unloaded the contents at a different location and returned with an empty truck. The driver for Otis Elevator did this several times before Baltimore discovered what had happened. Baltimore believes that the scheme caused it a loss of $240,000 approximately. The Otis Elevator driver was charged by authorities and has already repaid $23,000 to Baltimore Scrap Corp. There is no information to date to suggest a Baltimore Scrap Corp. employee may have been involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   .... It appears from the information available to date that the loss in this case occurred in the course of an exchange of scrap for Money. Accordingly, we consider this to be a loss of Money for purposes of our coverage analysis. Although it does not appear that there was a loss of Property, it should be noted that the Premises Coverage will only afford coverage for a loss of Property where there is an attempted or actual Robbery on Premises. In this case, there was no violence or threat of violence involved in these circumstances. Nonetheless, regardless of whether this loss is considered a loss of Money or Property, the loss is excluded pursuant to Exclusion (A) (11) as it was due to a knowing surrender of Money or Property in exchange with the Otis Elevator driver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Executive Risk Specialty concludes that there is no covered loss under the Crime Coverage Part.
