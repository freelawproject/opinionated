Malcolm (\"plaintiff\"), proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , brings this action against defendants Rochester City School District (\"RCSD\"), its superintendent, Barbara Deane-Williams (\"Deane-Williams\"), Chief of Specialized Services and Former Interim Director of Specialized Services, Sandra Simpson (\"Simpson\"), Executive Director of Specialized Services, Mary Pauly (\"Pauly\"), and Zone Director of Specialized Services, Theresa Root (\"Root\"). This action was commenced on virtually the same day as\n   <em>\n    Malcolm I\n   </em>\n   (17-CV-6878). The complaint is virtually identical to Malcolm's complaint in\n   <em>\n    Malcolm I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff is a 61-year-old African-American woman who has been employed with the RCSD starting in April of 2015. Plaintiff was hired as a Central Office Coordinating Administrator of Special Education (\"CASE\"). Not long after she was hired, Plaintiff began to have difficulties with her supervisor, Root, and made complaints to her supervisors at the RCSD. Plaintiff alleges that Root, among other things, \"sabotaged her career\" by giving her a developing performance evaluation without notifying her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2017, the RCSD, faced with budgetary concerns, conducted an audit that led them to restructure the special education administrators. This included laying off twenty-two CASE positions. Plaintiff was one of the affected employees. Those employees were then placed on a preferred eligibility list for seven years, meaning they could be recalled and resume employment if a position was open. Plaintiff was recalled from the preferred eligibility list and rehired by the RCSD on November 20, 2017 in her same position, about a month before commencing this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As mentioned in\n   <em>\n    Malcom I\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff then filed five charges within the New York State Department of Human Rights (\"NYSDHR\"). In the first two charges against the RCSD, the NYSDHR determined there was probable cause, and the case is pending and is still unresolved. These two charges were dually filed in the EEOC. The third, fourth and fifth charges against plaintiff's union and RCSD were dismissed with the NYSDHR finding no probable cause, with the EEOC adopting the same findings as the NYSDHR for her federal claims. Upon receipt of her right to sue letter from the EEOC in her fourth charge, plaintiff then filed the present lawsuit, and two other actions in this district regarding similar claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second action, filed the day after the present lawsuit was filed, has been dismissed for various reasons, including a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the present lawsuit, plaintiff alleges defendants discriminated against her with respect to her employment in violation of the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. ; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; New York Human Rights Law (\"NYHRL\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Exec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20290\">\n    N.Y.

Plaintiff's entire complaint is repeated in her second lawsuit, as she has copied word-for-word the same factual claims from one suit to the next. Additionally, the factual allegations as pleaded in both\n   <em>\n    Malcolm I\n   </em>\n   and the present action are identical, particularly pertaining to allegations regarding RCSD and Deane-Williams. Paragraphs 22 through 79 of\n   <em>\n    Malcolm I\n   </em>\n   are identical to paragraphs 22 through 79 of the present action.

App'x 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63 n. 2 (2d Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I find that plaintiff's Title VII and ADEA claims against the individual defendants are dismissed, as both statutes do not provide liability for individuals. As for plaintiff's NYSHRL individual claims against Pauly and Simpson, plaintiff did not allege direct participation in conduct that gave rise to her discrimination claim anywhere in her complaint. Pauly and Simpson are mentioned fewer than five times in the complaint, the only factual allegations being that plaintiff complained to Pauly and Simpson along with several other supervisors of her issues with Root. Compl. \u00b6 61. The fact that plaintiff made a complaint alone does not suggest that any individual defendant furthered, or directly participated in, a discriminatory employment action. Because plaintiff essentially pleads no facts regarding Pauly's and Simpson's actions, plaintiff has pled no cause of action and plaintiff's remaining NYSDHR claims against Pauly and Simpson are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Similarly, nowhere in plaintiff's complaint does she sufficiently plead how Root is personally involved with the alleged discrimination. Plaintiff does not allege that Root played an individual role in the elimination of plaintiff's position, let alone that she did so with discriminatory animus. Plaintiff merely makes conclusory and speculative statements saying she was treated disparately by Root, without detailed factual contentions as to how Root was personally involved. Some of the things that plaintiff claims rise to the level of discrimination include giving plaintiff a developing performance evaluation and failing to warn plaintiff she would receive such a rating. However, plaintiff does not say how this performance rating is connected in any way to plaintiff's race, age or gender. Instead, plaintiff repeatedly makes speculative and conclusory allegations against Root, claiming she sabotaged plaintiff's career and harassed plaintiff without any underlying factual basis. For these reasons, Plaintiff's remaining NYSHRL claims against Root are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

App'x 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110 (2d Cir. 2009). To establish liability under \u00a7 1983, a defendant must be (1) acting under color of state law and (2) defendant's actions resulted in a deprivation of constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

Merely stating that a party is acting \"in color of law\" is not enough to show the nexus required to\n   state a claim under \u00a7 1983 or the New York Constitution. Establishing a defendant's personal involvement in the alleged constitutional deprivations is a prerequisite to damages under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

App'x 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25 (2d Cir. 2006). For an individual defendant to be liable, an official must be personally involved by, (1) directly participating in the constitutional violation, (2) failing to remedy the constitutional violation after being informed of the violation, (3) creating a policy that allowed for unconstitutional violations or allowing for unconstitutional violations under the policy, (4) supervising employees who committed wrongful acts with gross negligence, or (5) exhibiting deliberate indifference towards the rights of others.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Because plaintiff has failed to allege that Pauly, Simpson or Rowe's actions deprived plaintiff of any constitutional right, plaintiff's seventh and eighth claims against Pauly, Simpson and Rowe are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Plaintiff's Breach of Contract claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In order to have a breach of contract claim, plaintiff must have been operating under some contract. Any collective bargaining agreement that RCSD and plaintiff's union were under would not be covered by a breach of contract action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ifill v.

Supp. 2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). Plaintiff does not plead that she and RCSD, nor any of the individual defendants, were bound by any employment contract, what contract was supposedly breached, or how even a collective bargaining agreement would have been breached. Because plaintiff's complaint is utterly devoid of any semblance of a plausibly pled breach of contract claim, her breach of contract cause of action is therefore dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Plaintiff's Request to Stay Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff requested, as part of her complaint, to stay the current proceedings until her unexhausted claims are resolved within the NYSDHR and EEOC. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. When considering a request for a stay of proceedings, the court should consider whether (1) plaintiff is likely to prevail on the merits, (2) the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if no stay is granted, (3) other parties will suffer substantial harm if no stay is granted; and (4) public interest supports a stay.\n   <em>\n    Rochester-Genesee Reg'l Transp.

Supp. 2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 (W.D.N.Y. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff argues that a stay is warranted because of the ongoing NYSDHR proceedings and that a stay is legally and economically necessary to avoid injustice. Plaintiff admits that the NYSDHR has jurisdiction over the claims, but instead is seeking additional relief here in federal court before completing\n   the hearing process in the NYSDHR. As defendants suggest in their motion to dismiss, public interest instead calls for a denial of plaintiff's request to stay, as plaintiff should be required to exhaust her administrative remedies just like every other litigant who files a claim with the NYSDHR and the EEOC. Dkt. #6-10, p. 9. Because I conclude that the causes of action should be dismissed above for failure to exhaust administrative remedies upon which plaintiff bases her request to stay, and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, her request to stay proceedings is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Plaintiff's Motion to Amend the Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff also has moved to amend the complaint (Dkt. #12). Leave to amend, while it should be freely granted, may be denied where amendment would be futile.\n   <em>\n    Malcolm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3579259\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/678/100/#p106\">\n    678 F. Supp. 2d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure detail the baseline for what is necessary in order to request leave to amend, including a notice of motion and a statement \"with particularity the grounds for seeking the order\" which may include a proposed amended complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), 6(c)(1), 7(b)(1)(B). Failing to attach a proposed amended complaint may warrant dismissal. L. R. Civ. P. 15;\n   <em>\n    Murray v. New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201087\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/604/581/#p588\">\n    604 F. Supp. 2d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588 (W.D.N.Y. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff has not submitted a proposed amendment to her complaint that would warrant leave to amend. While plaintiff has asserted additional factual contentions in her later declarations and memoranda (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. #11, 12), none are presented in the form of a proposed amended complaint, and none indicate plaintiff has exhausted her administrative remedies or suggest any additional claims of discrimination. Because I conclude that the complaint must be dismissed, and plaintiff has not suggested any proposed amendments that address any of defendants' arguments, amendment of the complaint would be futile. Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION: MALCOLM II\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I find that Plaintiff has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and failed to state a claim against any defendant with respect to her Title VII, ADEA, NYSDHR and Equal Protection claims. Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint (Dkt. #6) is granted, and the complaint is dismissed, with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Malcolm v.
