On August 12, 2012, Defendant Sapa hired the plaintiff as a full-time employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b615). The plaintiff was promoted to the position of senior extruder on October 10, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b616). Shortly after the plaintiff began his new position, he was asked if he was gay, to which he responded in the affirmative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b617). Since this communication, the plaintiff claims that he has been subjected to continuous sexual harassment by co-workers and managers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For example, the plaintiff was exposed to sexually explicit and derogatory language and conduct discriminating against the plaintiff's sexual-orientation, including, but not limited to the following: being called a \"faggot\"; being referred to as \"fairy boy\"; overhearing another employee announce over the company radio that the plaintiff \"is a pickle splitter\"; having penis shaped sex toys placed in his locker; having male employees begin discussing how much they like \"pussy\" after he walked into the office; being told that his head \"looks like a penis\"; hearing that new employees were warned to be \"cautious\" of him because he is a \"flamboyant gay guy\"; being told that he is \"feminine\"; seeing sexually explicit drawings in the bathroom stall and his locker naming the plaintiff and his supervisor, with whom the plaintiff allegedly had a relationship; and, seeing \"#firetroutman\" written in the bathroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b618).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After each of these incidents, the plaintiff objected to and reported the harassment and abuse to Defendant Sapa's human resource department. Although the plaintiff reported these incidents, the\n   harassment and discrimination continued unabated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b619, 24-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After exhausting all of the appropriate administrative remedies with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, on October 24, 2018, the plaintiff filed a 6-count complaint against the defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Count 1 of the plaintiff's complaint claims that the defendant exposed him to a hostile work environment because of his sexual orientation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Count 2 of the plaintiff's complaint claims that the defendant retaliated against the plaintiff after the plaintiff spoke out against the defendant's employment practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Count 3 pleads that the defendant was negligent for failing to implement a uniformly enforced policy against sex-based harassment, discrimination, and retaliation in violation of Title VII. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Count 4 alleges that the defendant took unlawful actions in violation of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Count 5 is a retaliation claim in violation of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Count 6 seeks to impose punitive damages on the defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 12, 2019, the defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss. (Doc. 9).

Title VII Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint alleges a violation of Title VII based upon sexual orientation harassment/discrimination. The first issue raised by the defendant is that plaintiff cannot have a cause of action under Title VII because sexual orientation discrimination is not prohibited by that statute. Plaintiff argues that sexual orientation discrimination is in fact discrimination because of sex and should be prohibited by Title VII. After a careful review, we find that although plaintiff's position may be correct in certain jurisdictions, the precedent in the Third Circuit favors the defendant's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it \"an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\"\n   <em>\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)\n   </em>\n   . The issue here is whether discrimination based upon \"sexual orientation\" is discrimination \"because of sex\" under Title VII. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has addressed this issue and concluded that sexual orientation discrimination is not discrimination on the basis of sex for Title VII\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bibby v.
