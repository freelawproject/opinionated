(\"USAE\") and Bayou City Environmental Services, L.P. (\"Bayou\" and, together with USAE, \"Plaintiffs\"), in an underlying lawsuit. Plaintiffs have filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the Duty to Defend (\"USAE Motion\") [Doc. # 19]. ASIC has filed a Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Opposition to the USAE Motion (\"ASIC Motion\") [Doc. # 21]. Plaintiffs have filed a combined reply in support of the USAE Motion and opposition to the ASIC Motion (\"USAE Reply\") [Doc. # 29], to which ASIC has replied in kind (\"ASIC Reply\") [Doc. # 30]. Plaintiffs filed a Sur-Reply [Doc. # 36], and ASIC a Sur-Sur Reply [Doc. # 37].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After carefully considering the Motions, Replies, all related filings, and the relevant law, the Court\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   the USAE Motion [Doc. # 19] and\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   the ASIC Motion [Doc. # 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties dispute, among other things, whether ASIC has a duty to defend Plaintiffs in an environmental damage case currently pending in federal court. Plaintiffs claim coverage under several Commercial General Liability and Professional Liability insurance policies for periods covering, collectively, January 3, 2003 to January 3, 2014 (collectively, the \"Policies\"). Provisions of the Policies that are relevant to this dispute are excerpted in the appendix to this Memorandum and Order (\"Appendix\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Underlying Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   USAE and Bayou engage in \"environmental activities\" on behalf of waste generators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' work includes the brokering and transportation of waste material to\n   sites at which the waste will be recycled and/or otherwise disposed of.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That work is at issue in an underlying lawsuit (\"Underlying Lawsuit\"), presently pending in the United States for the Southern District of Texas,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   concerning environmental remediation efforts at a site located in Pasadena, Texas (the \"USOR Site\"). The USOR Site encompasses approximately 18 acres and is comprised of two separate properties, the former U.S. Oil Recovery and MCC Recycling facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MCC facility portion of the USOR Site is located on either side of Vince Bayou, and lays southeast across railroad tracks from the U.S. Oil Recovery facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City of Pasadena, Texas, a defendant in the Underlying Lawsuit, owned and operated the MCC facility from approximately 1944 until January, 2009, when U.S. Oil Recovery acquired that facility from the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Throughout its operating life, the U.S. Oil Recovery facility received and performed wastewater pretreatment of municipal and industrial Class I and II wastewater, \"characteristically hazardous waste,\" used oil and oily sludges, and municipal solid waste.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Associated operations were conducted at the MCC Recycling facility portion of the USOR Site after U.S. Oil Recovery acquired that facility in 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The USOR Site was abandoned by its owners and operators in June, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following month, in July, 2010, a state court-appointed receiver was granted legal control and custody over the USOR Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The receiver's role is to assist in performance of authorized response actions at the USOR Site, among other responsibilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On July 1, 2010, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services contacted the National Response Center and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") hotlines to request assistance in stabilizing the USOR Site and managing a large volume of hazardous substances and waste in preparation for the upcoming season.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The EPA conducted emergency response actions at the USOR Site in July, 2010, November, 2010, and January, 2011, and identified a \"historic an[d] ongoing release of hazardous substances\" at and around the USOR Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In total, the EPA removed approximately 833,500 gallons of contaminated liquids from the USOR Site during the three emergency response actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The EPA proposed the Site be added to the National Priorities List on September 16, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   It\n   was formally added to the List on September 18, 2012, rendering it a Superfund site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Several potentially responsible parties (\"PRPs\"), including plaintiffs in the Underlying Lawsuit (\"USOR Site PRP Group\"), entered into settlement agreements with the EPA on August 25, 2011 (\"First Removal Action\") and July 14, 2016 (\"Second Removal Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The First and Second Removal Actions obligate the PRPs to perform time-sensitive removal action activities at the USOR Site, which efforts are ongoing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, members of the USOR Site PRP Group commit to paying future response costs the EPA incurs at the USOR Site after the effective dates of the agreements in the Removal Actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through July 31, 2016, the USOR Site PRP Group has incurred approximately $10,000,000 in response costs at the USOR Site in performing specified activities required by the First and Second Removal Actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On December 20, 2012, the EPA advised USAE by letter (\"EPA General Notice\") that USAE is potentially liable under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , with respect to the USOR Site as a person who arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances, and invited USAE to join the First Removal Action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   USAE allegedly timely notified ASIC of the EPA General Notice (\"2013 USAE Claim\") and submitted a claim for coverage under ASIC-issued Commercial General Liability and Professional Liability Policy PROP 5844513, effective January 3, 2005 to January 3, 2006 (\"2005-2006 Policy\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   ASIC denied coverage by letter dated March 12, 2013 (\"Denial Letter\"), disclaiming coverage under one exclusion and reserving the right to deny coverage under a second.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In March, 2013, approximately three months after receiving the EPA General Notice, USAE entered into a cost-sharing\n   agreement (the \"Participation Agreement\") with other PRPs (the \"USOR Site PRP Group\") that governed cost-sharing among the USOR Site PRP Group with respect to participating PRPs' clean-up removal activities at the USOR Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   At some point thereafter USAE withdrew from the USOR Site PRP Group because, USAE now argues, it lacked support from ASIC and faced increasing expense and uncertainty by virtue of its participation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The USOR Site PRP Group allegedly notified Plaintiff Bayou by letter dated July 10, 2014, that Bayou faced potential liability in connection with its work at the USOR Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The USOR Site PRP Group offered Bayou \"the opportunity to voluntarily join in the USOR Site PRP Group's efforts at the USOR Site.\" Bayou refused.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On August 24, 2014, the USOR Site PRP Group filed the Underlying Lawsuit against hundreds of defendants, including USAE and Bayou.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The USOR Site PRP Group alleges, in relevant part, that from April, 2004 to July, 2008, USAE and Bayou each transported, or arranged for the transport and disposal of, waste materials to the USOR Site on behalf of themselves and various other parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to Bayou, the USOR Site PRP Group alleges,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [F]rom at least April 2004 to July 2008, [Bayou] accepted for transport to the USOR Site, which was selected by [Bayou], and/or by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, and/or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment of waste owned or possessed by [Bayou], at least 5,801,744 gallons of waste containing hazardous substances at the USOR Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   With respect to USAE, the USOR Site PRP Group alleges,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [F]rom at least January 2004 to February 2008, [USAE] accepted for transport to the USOR Site, which was selected by [USAE], and/or by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, and/or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment of waste owned or possessed by [USAE], at least 5,762,581 gallons of waste containing hazardous substances at the USOR Site.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Additionally, the USOR Site PRP Group claims that USAE breached the Participation Agreement by refusing to pay USAE's share of response costs the USOR Site PRP Group incurred prior to USAE's rescinding the Participation Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The USOR Site PRP Group seeks cost recovery, contribution, and declaratory relief under CERCLA, and cost recovery under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act (\"TSWD\"),\n   Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 361.001\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The USOR Site PRP Group also seeks a judgment against USAE with respect to the breach of contract claim, namely, that USAE is liable for its unpaid assessments of response costs, along with interest, costs of suit, and attorneys' fees and consultant fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   USAE and Bayou are named insureds under eleven CGL policies (each referred to as a \"Policy\"). ASIC issued Policies covering USAE for the periods from January 3, 2003 to January 3, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted, in 2013, USAE allegedly submitted a claim to ASIC under the 2005-2006 Policy, after USAE had received the EPA General Notice but before USAE was named a defendant in the Underlying Lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 10, 2016, Bayou filed a claim with ASIC for coverage under Policies covering, collectively, the period between January 3, 2003 and January 3, 2010 (\"Bayou Claim\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bayou Claim states that ASIC was notified of the underlying claim at issue by USAE's 2013 claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bayou requested \"all insurance coverage under any policies sold to [Bayou] by [ASIC] ... for the environmental claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On July 26, 2016, before ASIC responded to the Bayou Claim, USAE and Bayou filed the instant insurance coverage lawsuit against ASIC seeking declaratory judgments with respect to ASIC's duty to defend and duty to indemnify Plaintiffs in connection with claims relating to the alleged environmental liabilities at the USOR Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The pending Motions are limited to two issues: whether ASIC owes Plaintiffs a duty to defend with respect to the Underlying Lawsuit, and whether ASIC has breached that duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Specifically, ASIC does not disagree that the alleged property damage was caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory, and that the property damage occurred during the Policies' policy periods. The issues that divide the parties are whether Plaintiffs may obtain coverage under any of the Policies or whether any of the following three exclusions in the Policies independently preclude coverage: (1) the Pollution Exclusion (Exclusion f), (2) the Waste Disposal Site Exclusion (Exclusion u), and (3) the Aircraft, Auto or Watercraft Exclusion (Exclusion g), as modified by a Transportation Coverage Endorsement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   ASIC contends that each of the three exclusions is a bar to the coverage Plaintiffs seek and demonstrates the general intent of the Policies, which ASIC asserts is to provide coverage for pollution liability that occurs while the insured's work is ongoing, and to exclude coverage for liability in connection with waste that the insured previously transported to and relinquished at a waste disposal site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs disagree and argue the Court need not reach the Pollution Exclusion or\n   the Waste Disposal Site Exclusion. Significantly, the Policies covering January, 2011 to January, 2014, include an endorsement that creates an exception to the Pollution Exclusion for \"waste disposal sites\" and deletes the Waste Disposal Site Exclusion. Plaintiffs argue that they have a viable claim under the 2011 Policy. ASIC, however, contends that, to the extent Plaintiffs have a claim for coverage, Plaintiffs' claims are limited to the 2003-2004 Policy, with respect to USAE, and the 2004-2005 Policy, for Bayou.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs may pursue their claims under the 2011 Policy. The Court next concludes that the Aircraft, Auto or Watercraft Exclusion (Exclusion g), as amended by an Endorsement No. 10 to the 2011 Policy, is the only applicable exclusion under the 2011 Policy. Finally, the Court determines that Exclusion g does not bar coverage. ASIC therefore has a duty to defend Plaintiffs in the Underlying Lawsuit, and has breached that duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

ASIC argues that even if Plaintiffs may seek coverage under the 2011 Policy, the Sites Endorsement does not apply because the USOR Site does not meet the definition of \"waste disposal site\" introduced by the Endorsement. The Court is unpersuaded by ASIC's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Is the USOR Site a \"Waste Disposal Site\"?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   ASIC contends that the USOR Site was not a \"waste disposal site\" under the 2011 Policy\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the USOR Group's Complaint alleges that the Site was abandoned in 2010 and is being operated by a state-appointed receiver, both of which facts, ASIC asserts, indicate insolvency and/or bankruptcy and thus remove the USOR Site from the purview of the \"waste disposal site\" definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support\n   of its position, ASIC points to the following allegations in the USOR Group's Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   The USOR Site property was abandoned by the owners and operators in June 2010. In July 2010, a State court appointed a Receiver with legal custody and control over the USOR Site.

The USOR Group's Complaint does not include express allegations that the USOR Site, its owners, or its operators are in bankruptcy or are financially insolvent, or other allegations that give rise to reasonable inferences in support of those circumstances. Indeed, the USOR Group's Complaint alleges merely that the owners and operators abandoned the USOR Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, for purposes of the duty to defend analysis, the USOR Site is a \"waste disposal site\" under the 2011 Policy, and the Sites Endorsement-created exception to the Pollution Exclusion applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   To recap, the Sites Endorsement deletes Exclusion u, the Waste Disposal Site Exclusion, and creates an exception to the Pollution Exclusion with respect to waste disposal sites. The USOR Group's Complaint permits the argument that the USOR Site is a \"waste disposal site\" under the 2011 Policy. Thus, under the 2011 Policy, Exclusion g,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Auto Exclusion, is the only remaining exclusion on which ASIC relies to argue coverage is barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Because Exclusion g does not apply, Plaintiffs contend, the Transportation Coverage Endorsement is likewise inapplicable. ASIC argues that Exclusion g, even considered separately from the Transportation Coverage Endorsement, applies and, in any event, the Transportation Coverage Endorsement necessarily adds a ground to Exclusion g that bars coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Plaintiffs also argue that the property damage alleged\n   does not \"arise out of use of an auto\" under well-established Texas law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agrees with both theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The USOR Group's Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs are at least partly responsible for property damage at the USOR Site caused by waste streams containing hazardous substances. Plaintiffs' alleged liability is rooted in alleged transportation, or arranging of transportation, of hazardous substances to the USOR Site. The mode of transportation, however, is never specified. For example, the USOR Group's Complaint's allegations with respect to USAE include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   \u2022 2765.

The\n   <em>\n    Lindsey\n   </em>\n   court, which described this third factor as being especially troublesome because of the difficulty, under many circumstances, of determining the degree of a vehicle's involvement in the production of an injury, decided that the truck at issue in that case \"produced\" the injury in part because the child set off the gun while trying to gain entry to the truck, and therefore \"the truck was not merely the situs of activity ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lindsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11541219\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/997/153/#p156\">\n    997 S.W.2d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The third factor is not met. ASIC fails to show that the \"use of an auto\" exclusion under Exclusion g precludes coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Does Section 2 of the Transportation Coverage Endorsement Preclude Coverage?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As noted above, every Policy, including the 2011 Policy, contains a Transportation Coverage Endorsement that amends Exclusion g, the Auto Exclusion. Section 2 of the Transportation Coverage Endorsement (the \"Section 2 Exclusion\") opens with the phrase \"solely with respect to this endorsement,\" and adds a coverage exclusion for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"\n   <strong>\n    property damage\n   </strong>\n   which occurs subsequent to the time the transported material reaches its final destination ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The parties offer alternate interpretations of the Transportation Coverage Endorsement Section 2 exclusion. Plaintiffs argue that the phrase \"solely with respect to this endorsement\" limits application of the Section 2 Exclusion to the coverage established in Section 1 of the Transportation\n   Coverage Endorsement, which itself simply modifies the coverage provided by paragraph g(6), an exception to the Auto Exclusion. Plaintiffs reason that because Exclusion g does not apply, the Transportation Coverage Endorsement does not come into play and its Section 2 Exclusion does not bar coverage. ASIC responds that Sections 1 and 2 of the Transportation Coverage Endorsement are separate from each other, and that the Endorsement's Section 2 supplements Exclusion g by adding a new exclusion not tied to use of an auto and not tied to the exception in paragraph g(6) of the Auto Exclusion. According to ASIC, if the Section 2 Exclusion, read alone, would preclude coverage, Exclusion g precludes coverage for Plaintiffs in this case. ASIC argues that its interpretation is consistent with what it asserts is the intent of the Policies, namely, to provide coverage for accidents that occur during the course of an insured's work and to preclude coverage for pollution claims arising out of waste relinquished by the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Court finds ASIC's interpretation of the Section 2 Exclusion strained. ASIC's interpretation is inconsistent with a strict reading of Section 2's prefatory phrase \"solely with respect to this Endorsement.\" That phrase conveys that Section 2 may be applied only within the Transportation Coverage Endorsement, and thus modifies the scope of coverage created by Section 1's exception to the Auto Exclusion (Exclusion g). Notably, ASIC's construction would make sense if Section 2 started with the introductory phrase \"by this Endorsement,\" and read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AMENDMENT OF AIRCRAFT, AUTO OR WATERCRAFT EXCLUSION (TRANSPORTATION COVERAGE)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   It is hereby agreed that,\n   <em>\n    by this Endorsement\n   </em>\n   , the following is added to\n   <strong>\n    SECTION I., COVERAGE A.-BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY\n   </strong>\n   , paragraph\n   <strong>\n    2. EXCLUSIONS\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   ...[\n   <strong>\n    P\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    roperty damage\n   </strong>\n   which occurs subsequent to the time the transported material reaches its final destination or while it is in storage off-loaded from the conveyance which was transporting it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Furthermore, to adopt ASIC's interpretation of \"solely with respect to this endorsement\" would be to render that phrase meaningless, contrary to longstanding statutory cannons of construction. Accordingly, ASIC's interpretation is not reasonable. Plaintiffs have supplied a reasonable interpretation of the scope of the Section 2 Exclusion, and the Exclusion does not enable ASIC to avoid its duty to defend in the Underlying Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The same result pertains even if the Court were to conclude that ASIC's interpretation of the Section 2 Exclusion is reasonable when read in the context of the Endorsement and Policy as a whole, and thus the Section 2 Exclusion is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation. Under this approach, the Policy is ambiguous to this extent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RSUI Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856586\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/466/113/#p118\">\n    466 S.W.3d at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To be ambiguous, both interpretations must be a reasonable interpretation of the words chosen by the parties when read in the context of the policy as a whole.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Gilbert Tex.
