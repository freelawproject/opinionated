The Government opposes the motion. ECF No. 25. Given evolving case law on this issue, the Court permitted supplemental briefing to be filed no later than July 8, 2019. Both parties supplemented their briefs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 35 &amp; 36.

On June 10, 1999, the Government issued a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") to initiate removal proceedings. ECF No. 17-1. The NTA ordered Defendant to appear before an immigration judge in Seattle, WA on a date and time \"To Be Calendared.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.

ECF No. 17-2. On June 28, 1999, Defendant appeared before an immigration judge, who granted Defendant voluntary departure in lieu of removal.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant encountered immigration officers again on January 6, 2003, while incarcerated at the Benton County Jail. According to a Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien filed by immigration officer Kevin\n   Smith, Defendant admitted that he had entered the United States without being admitted or paroled. ECF No. 17-4. There is no evidence of formal removal proceedings. While the mechanism of removal is unclear, Defendant was returned to Mexico on February 21, 2003 at El Paso, TX. ECF No. 25-1 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A few months later, on or about June 30, 2003, Defendant was apprehended at the border near Calexico, CA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. He requested but was denied a voluntary return.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When it was determined that he was removable, he was detained for removal proceedings. The same day, the Government issued an NTA. ECF No. 17-5. The NTA ordered Defendant to appear before an immigration judge at a place \"To Be Calendared,\" on \"a date to be set,\" at \"a time to be set.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The certificate of service indicated that Defendant was served on the same day and was \"provided oral notice in the Spanish language of the time and place of his ... hearing,\" despite the fact that a time and place was not yet set.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.

ECF No. 17-6. On July 7, 2003, a removal hearing was held in Imperial, CA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant appeared (most likely by video), was ordered removed to Mexico by the immigration judge, and was removed the same day.

ECF No. 36 at 7. It is precisely that lack of evidence that the Court underscores. While it is understandable that such evidence will be difficult for the parties to locate, without further evidence to the contrary, it appears from the record before the Court that the NTA failed to indicate the address of the immigration court in El Centro, CA that handled the proceedings-presumably where the NTA was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Consequently, Defendant is correct that the NTA was indeed deficient under the regulatory requirements and that jurisdiction never vested with the immigration court.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
