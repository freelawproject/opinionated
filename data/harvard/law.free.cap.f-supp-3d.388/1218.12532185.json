Cynthia Bashant, United States District Judge\n   This case presents the question whether the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause requires certain protections for noncitizens detained by the Government pending removal proceedings. On behalf of themselves and a putative class of noncitizens detained in the Southern District of California, Plaintiff-Petitioners Jose Orlando Cancino Castellar, Ana Maria Hernandez Aguas, and Michael Gonzalez (the \"Plaintiff-Petitioners\") claim that the Due Process Clause requires prompt presentment to an immigration judge after the Government takes an alleged noncitizen into custody. Defendant-Respondents\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -various federal immigration officials who oversee immigration enforcement nationally and locally in the Southern District of California-allegedly have a policy and practice of delaying for one to three months the presentment of detained noncitizens to an immigration judge, which Plaintiff-Petitioners contend renders their detention unreasonably prolonged. Plaintiff-Petitioners allege that Defendant-Respondents' policy impedes Plaintiff-Petitioners' access to a panoply of statutorily and regulatory-required features and rights that attend a noncitizen's initial hearing before an immigration judge, and further impedes the ability for certain noncitizens to request a bond hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following reconsideration of its prior dismissal of this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the Court reinstated\n   Plaintiff-Petitioners' claims that Defendant-Respondents' alleged policy violates the substantive and procedural components of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause and various provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), 706(2)(A)-(D).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cancino-Castellar v.

Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff-Petitioners challenge what they allege is \"Defendant-Respondents' policy and practice of detaining individuals for extended periods of time without promptly presenting them for an initial hearing before an immigration judge[.]\" (Compl.-Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 58.) The alleged policy of delayed presentment entails continued detention \"for weeks or months\"-most concretely \"one to three months\"-before presentment to an immigration judge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 58.) Implementation of this policy is allegedly shared by DHS and its components, ICE and CBP, and EOIR-entities over which the named Defendant-Respondents possess authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   DHS allegedly detains around 1,500 noncitizens in the Southern District of California on any given day, \"the vast majority of whom are detained pending removal proceedings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) ICE allegedly operates two immigration detention centers in the District: the Otay Mesa Detention Facility (\"Otay\") and the Imperial Regional Detention Facility (\"Imperial\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 58.) Individuals detained at Otay and Imperial allegedly face \"severe restrictions on liberty,\" including having to \"wear color-coded prison uniforms\" and being placed in detention in pods or units of 60 to 80 other individuals \"where they spend most of their day and may not leave without permission.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) CBP allegedly operates several additional \"short term\" detention centers and keeps in custody beyond 48 hours noncitizens who are referred to ICE custody and placed into removal proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 60.) \"CBP detainees\" are allegedly \"held virtually incommunicado without proper access to counsel,\" and are ultimately referred to ICE custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   DHS \"detains individuals allegedly subject to removal without regard for the immigration court's ability to commence and process the cases promptly\" and without an \"automatic custody review hearing, commonly called a bond hearing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 62-63.) DHS's alleged practice \"results in detention centers being flooded with more individuals than the immigration court can reasonably handle and, as such, significantly delays the initial [MCHs].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) \"As a general practice,\" DHS allegedly fails to provide the time, place and date of the initial MCH in an NTA, instead relying on EOIR to schedule the hearing.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Although EOIR \"puts the case on the immigration court's detained docket, which is more expedited than its non-detained docket,\" \"EOIR does not schedule more expeditious initial [MCHs] for detainees than it does for subsequent [MCHs] for detainees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, \"EOIR frequently sets the initial [MCH] for detained\n   immigration cases in the [District] for one to three months after receiving the [NTA].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs further allege that EOIR has not taken steps to schedule prompt initial hearings for immigrants in custody \"despite knowledge that the number of pending cases for detainees has increased by several hundred percent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65, 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Each Plaintiff-Petitioner alleges that he or she experienced this alleged policy and practice before and up to the time of the Complaint-Petition's filing on March 9, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, Plaintiff-Petitioner Jose Orlando Cancino Castellar (\"Cancino\") alleges that he was taken into DHS custody on February 17, 2017, and his detention at Otay began the next day.

Defendant-Respondents moved to dismiss the Complaint-Petition under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (ECF No. 28.) The Court granted Defendants-Respondents' Rule 12(b)(1) motion primarily on the ground that applicable Ninth Circuit precedent showed that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(9) channeled jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Petitioners' claims to the Court of Appeals in a petition for review, therefore precluding jurisdiction in this Court. (ECF No. 49 at 20-37.) Because of this jurisdictional conclusion, the Court did not assess Defendant-Respondents' Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal arguments. The Court terminated as moot Plaintiff-Petitioners' then-pending motion for class certification and granted Plaintiff-Petitioners leave to amend \"to assert claims over which this Court may properly exercise jurisdiction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Some three weeks after the Court's order, the Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

Plaintiff-Petitioners specifically allege that \"detainees with legitimate claims to release are not given a hearing to assert them for one to three months.\" (ECF No. 61 at 13.) They contend that the risk of an erroneous deprivation of physical liberty is compounded by language barriers, \"lack of sophistication regarding complex immigration laws,\" and \"ignorance of procedures for seeking a bond hearing.\" (Compl.-Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 29-31.) These allegations plausibly show a meaningful risk of erroneous deprivation at the pleading stage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The next issue then is the probative value of the additional safeguard Plaintiff-Petitioners request: a\n    <em>\n     prompt\n    </em>\n    first appearance before an immigration judge.

Curiously, Defendant-Respondents concede in reply that \"it is conceivable that an individual immigration detainee may bring a procedural due process claim based on the lack of prompt presentment based on the fact facts of his or her particular case[.]\" (ECF No. 62 at 6 n.6.) Defendant-Respondents' concession underlies the inappropriateness of their argument at this stage of the proceedings. If Plaintiff-Petitioners cannot provide evidence to substantiate their as-applied challenge, that is an evidentiary issue suitable for a motion for summary judgment or trial, not on a motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Van Buskirk v.

Defendant-Respondents aver that \"the government's interest in the existing process is extensive, as is the potential for significant fiscal and administrative burdens from any additional process.\" (ECF No. 60-1 at 15.) The Court is not persuaded that Defendant-Respondents' arguments mandate dismissal of Plaintiff-Petitioners' claims at this stage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Defendant-Respondents' sole assertion in their opening brief is that the procedural safeguards Plaintiff-Petitioners seek \"would create a ripple effect\" in that \"any mandate to accelerate one particular phase of the process will necessarily result in delays at other phases\" because \"DHS and the immigration courts have finite resources.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Defendant-Respondents aver that \"a judicially-imposed deadline for all initial [MCHs] may ultimately impede immigration judges' ability to provide prompt hearings (including subsequent master calendar and merits hearings) for other detained aliens.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    As an initial matter, the Court turns to a thread that runs through Defendant-Respondents' argument on the third\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    factor-specifically, that it would be an improper \"judicial imposition\" for this Court to find that Plaintiff-Petitioners possess a procedural due process right that compels prompt presentment of persons detained by the government after their initial arrest.

Defendant-Respondents rely on a single district court decision in which the court determined that the additional process sought by the plaintiffs in that case, specifically a probable cause determination conducted by an immigration judge, \"would certainly burden ICE\" and thus \"weighs heavily against the imposition of additional procedures, especially considering the possible costs.\"\n    <em>\n     Aguilar v.

The\n    <em>\n     Aguilar\n    </em>\n    court construed the due process claims to request a judicial probable cause determination as an additional procedural safeguard in the removal context, a feature that does not exist in the current removal proceeding scheme. Not only does this case no longer involve Fourth Amendment claims, the Plaintiff-Petitioners' procedural due process claims do not seek to fashion from whole cloth a new procedural safeguard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Instead, the procedural due process claims in this case concern the timing of the hearing that is already an established part of removal proceedings and which is already conducted by an immigration judge. As Plaintiff-Petitioners compellingly argue, \"when a state provides for a first appearance, it would place a small burden on the state to ensure the timeliness of that appearance.\"\n    <em>\n     Armstrong\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11709594\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/564/\">\n     152 F.3d at 572\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Complaint-Petition also suggests that the claimed timing safeguard might not impose an undue administrative burden. Plaintiff-Petitioners allege that \"[i]f the case involves a detained individual, EOIR puts the case on the immigration court's detained docket, which is more expedited than its non-detained docket.\" (Compl.-Pet. \u00b6 28.) Assuming its truth, this allegation suggests that a prompt presentment requirement might pose a minimal burden to EOIR.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/\">\n     872 F.3d at 994\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (concluding that proposed \"requirement that ICE and IJs consider financial circumstances and alternative conditions of release\" would impose a \"minimal burden\" in part because \"consideration of financial circumstances [wa]s already 'implicitly' required[.]\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Therefore, there is at least a plausible ground for the Court to conclude that Plaintiff-Petitioners' procedural due process claims pass muster at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    More critically, unlike the\n    <em>\n     Aguilar\n    </em>\n    court, \"th[is] Court cannot, on this scant record, evaluate in a meaningful way the burden that would be imposed by the additional due process.\"\n    <em>\n     Singh\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204770737\">\n     2018 WL 4770737\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *14.

It might be that a prompt presentment requirement for detained persons could drain resources on the front-end of removal proceedings. But it is equally possible that a prompt presentment safeguard for detained persons could actually free up resources currently consigned to the alleged one to three months in which Plaintiff-Petitioners and others like them in the Southern District of California allegedly \"languish\" in detention before they are presented to an immigration judge.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/\">\n     872 F.3d at 996\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (observing that \"reduced detention costs can free up resources to more effectively process claims in Immigration Court.\").

The Court rejects Defendant-Respondents' finality argument because it does not account for the actual nature of Plaintiff-Petitioners' challenge. Plaintiff-Petitioners challenge what they contend is a policy by which Defendant-Respondents detain alleged noncitizens for one to three months before presentment to an immigration judge. (Compl.-Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4-5, 7, 70, 72.) Plaintiff-Petitioners expressly underscore this point in their opposition. (ECF No. 61 at 25.) Defendant-Respondents conspicuously do not challenge Plaintiff-Petitioners' policy allegations and contentions. At this stage, the Court finds that Plaintiff-Petitioners have adequately alleged a final agency action in form of an alleged policy to detain Plaintiff-Petitioners for one to three months before presentment to an immigration judge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Defendant-Respondents next challenge the merits of Plaintiff-Petitioners' particular Section 706(2) claims.

Defendant-Respondents' argument is not tethered to any legal standard for assessment of APA claims raised under these provisions. Defendant-Respondents also overlook that Plaintiff-Petitioners do not invoke the APA to fashion new rights beyond the INA, but rather as means to seek review of agency action in the context of the claimed due process rights. In any\n    event, the parties' briefing on the sufficiency of these Section 706(2) claims is thin. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the sufficiency of Plaintiff-Petitioners' Section 706(2)(A),(C), and (D) has not been distinctly raised or adequately briefed and thus the Court declines to dismiss the claims now.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carroll v.

(ECF No. 60-1 at 22.) This argument necessarily fails because the Court has concluded that all Plaintiff-Petitioners state constitutional due process claims. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendant-Respondents' motion to dismiss Plaintiff-Petitioners' Section 706(2)(B) claims as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION &amp; ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n    <strong>\n     GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n    </strong>\n    Defendant-Respondents' renewed motion to dismiss.
