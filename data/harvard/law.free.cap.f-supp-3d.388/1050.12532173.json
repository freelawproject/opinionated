Jane Magnus-Stinson, Chief Judge\n   According to Haber Land Co. Ltd.'s (\"\n   <em>\n    Haber\n   </em>\n   \") Amended Complaint in this matter, Haber acquired farmland in 2012 in Indiana. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (\"\n   <em>\n    IDEM\n   </em>\n   \") inspected the property and observed foundry waste and coal product. A subsequent hazardous waste assessment revealed PCB contamination. Haber's lawsuit seeks to hold various predecessor owners of and operators on the property responsible for the contamination under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"\n   <em>\n    CERCLA\n   </em>\n   \") and a variety of state-law theories. Two such defendants, Mosey Manufacturing Co. Inc. (\"\n   <em>\n    Mosey\n   </em>\n   \") and Caterpillar Global Mining, LLC (\"\n   <em>\n    Caterpillar\n   </em>\n   \"), have filed motions to dismiss Haber's complaint for failure to state a claim. [Filing No. 42; Filing No. 50.] For the most part, the motions, and in particular Caterpillar's motion, demand far more of Haber than is required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Caterpillar has also filed a Motion to Dismiss Cross-Claims, arguing that because Haber's CERCLA claim fails, the Cross-claimants' derivative claims must fail as well. [Filing No. 118.] For the reasons described below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Mosey's Motion to Dismiss,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Caterpillar's Motion to Dismiss, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Caterpillar's Motion to Dismiss Cross-Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss a claim that does not state a right to relief.

[Filing No. 122 at 3.] Before the Bucyrus-Erie Company purchased the NATCO Site in November 1956, the Site had been used as farmland. [Filing No. 122 at 3.] The Bucyrus-Erie Company used the Site for drill manufacturing until it was purchased by another company in 1960. [Filing No. 122 at 3-4.] Caterpillar eventually acquired the Bucyrus-Erie Company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Filing No. 122 at 4.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In April 1991, Mosey acquired the NATCO Site. [Filing No. 122 at 4.] At the time, another company (for which Defendant Lucas-Fermat LLC is successor in interest) was lessee of a portion of the NATCO Site, which it used for a machine shop and call center. [Filing No. 122 at 5.] In July 1994, Mosey sold the NATCO Site to another Defendant called Mosey Real Estate, Inc., [Filing No. 122 at 5], against whom default has been entered, [Filing No. 89].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2011, Mosey, along with Defendants Mosey Real Estate, Inc. and ALD Indiana, LLC, demolished buildings on the NATCO Site, including the \"NATCO building,\" which contained PCBs, and disposed of waste from the NATCO Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Filing No. 122 at 7.] The Defendants also dumped or released coal ash, industrial waste, and PCBs on the NATCO Site, including on the property eventually acquired by Haber. [Filing No. 122 at 8.] Caterpillar used heavy manufacturing machines containing PCBs. [Filing No. 122 at 7.] Transformers containing PCBs were removed from the NATCO Site at some point by one of the Defendants. [Filing No. 122 at 7.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In summer 2014, after Haber acquired its portion of the NATCO Site, IDEM inspected Haber's property and identified foundry waste and coal product, none of which was generated by Haber. [Filing No. 122 at 6.] IDEM required Haber to further investigate and dispose of the hazardous waste. [Filing No. 122 at 6.] In response, Haber hired an environmental consultant to perform an investigation, which determined that there was cinder and coal-ash waste and PCB contamination\n   which predated Haber's purchase of its property. [Filing No. 122 at 6.] IDEM and the EPA have directed Haber to remediate the PCB contamination on its property. [Filing No. 122 at 6.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Haber thereafter notified the Defendants and the EPA of its intent to sue for Defendants' actions in contaminating its property. [Filing No. 122 at 8.] Haber brought suit in this Court on December 31, 2018, [Filing No. 1], and on May 2, 2019, filed its currently-operative Second Amended Complaint, [Filing No. 60]. The Second Amended Complaint alleges six counts against each Defendant; Haber's trespass claim, which both movants sought to dismiss, was previously dismissed by stipulation. [Filing No. 81.] Remaining are claims under the Indiana Environmental Legal Actions statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-30-9-1\">\n    Ind.

[Filing No. 122.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 6, 2019, Mosey filed its Partial Motion to Dismiss as to Count II of Haber's remaining claims. [Filing No. 42.] On March 8, 2019, Caterpillar filed its Motion to Dismiss, seeking to dismiss all of Haber's claims against it. [Filing No. 50.] Both motions to dismiss are fully briefed. The Cross-claimants have not yet responded to Caterpillar's Motion to Dismiss Cross-Claims, [Filing No. 118], but as Caterpillar's Motion explains, its motion seeks to dismiss the crossclaims for contribution under the CERCLA and is wholly dependent upon the Court finding Haber's CERCLA claim to be deficient. The Court can assess the sufficiency of Haber's CERCLA claim based upon the parties' briefing on the Motions to Dismiss, which will also resolve the merits of Caterpillar's Motion to Dismiss Cross-Claims. All three pending motions are therefore ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Because the Second Amended Complaint did not alter Haber's claims but instead identified a new defendant, rather than deny the movants' motions to dismiss as moot, the Court has applied the motions to Haber's most recent complaint.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Baker O'Neal Holdings, Inc. v.

The first is comprised of fundamentally legal arguments-namely, that Haber's nuisance, illegal dumping and TSCA claims fail as a matter of law and would fail as a matter of law regardless of the detail Haber may add to its complaint. Mosey's argument, applicable just to Haber's nuisance claim, also falls into this first category.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The second includes pleading arguments.

Nuisance\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Both movants contend that Haber cannot maintain a nuisance claim based upon a prior landowners' actions, relying primarily on district court cases interpreting Indiana law. [Filing No. 43 at 5-7; Filing No. 43 at 15-16.] Mosey additionally argues that Haber's claim fails because there is presently no nuisance to abate or enjoin. [Filing No. 43 at 7.]\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    In response, Haber clarifies that its nuisance claim is based upon the Defendants' ownership and maintenance of a nuisance on the adjoining land-specifically, on the larger NATCO Site, of which Haber's property is only one portion. [Filing No. 77 at 3-7; Filing No. 78 at 16-20.]\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The movants reiterate their arguments in reply and emphasize that a nuisance claim is unavailable because they owned the NATCO Site and engaged in the alleged conduct years before Haber acquired its portion of the property. [Filing No. 91 at 3-8; Filing No. 92 at 14-16.]\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Notwithstanding the insight provided by the federal courts' interpretation of Indiana law, the Indiana Supreme Court (whose caselaw is binding as to Haber's state-law claims,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     BMD Contractors, Inc. v.

Such a reading is not only contrary to the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, which requires that reasonable inferences be drawn in Haber's favor, but it is also unnatural. The better reading is that Defendants dumped waste on many parts of\n    the NATCO Site, including the portion Haber did not purchase, such that Defendants maintained a nuisance on the adjoining parcels which impacted Haber's enjoyment of its own parcel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    This reasonable reading of Haber's Revised Amended Complaint takes it out of the realm of the line of persuasive (but not binding,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Camreta v.

First, Caterpillar argues that the Court \"should rule Haber's remaining allegations insufficient to state a claim that rises above speculation and bare plausibility\" because Haber has not pleaded any \"non-conclusory factual allegations regarding disposal of a hazardous substance by Bucyrus, Caterpillar's predecessor-in-interest.\" [Filing No. 51 at 6-7.] Of course, as Haber points out, plausibility is precisely the standard Haber's pleadings must meet. Here, Haber's Second Amended Complaint alleges (to take just one example) that Caterpillar operated \"heavy manufacturing machines on the NATCO Site which contained PCBs,\" [Filing No. 122 at 7], and \"dumped, disposed of, and released PCBs at the Haber Field,\" [Filing No. 122 at 12]. These are factual allegations-not legal conclusions-regarding what Caterpillar's corporate predecessor allegedly did while it owned and operated a factory on what is now Haber's property. The fact that Caterpillar allegedly used machines containing PCBs strengthens the plausibility of its other factual allegations that Caterpillar disposed of or otherwise released the PCBs onto the property. In short, these factual allegations are more than adequate to yield the reasonable inference that Caterpillar disposed of hazardous substances on the property. The information regarding \"who, what, when, and where\" Haber seems to request-and which would be required under a heightened pleading standard, such as required in a fraud case,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) -is simply not required at the pleading stage, and must await discovery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Similarly, Haber easily crosses the plausibility threshold in alleging that it has incurred costs \"consistent with the national contingency plan.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(4)(B). For one, \"plausibility\" does not \"require a complaint to contain facts matching all statutory 'elements,' \"\n    <em>\n     Chapman v. Yellow Cab Coop.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266150\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/846/#p848\">\n     875 F.3d 846\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 848 (7th Cir. 2017), as Caterpillar appears to insinuate. But even if Haber were required to allege facts to match the requirement that it incur costs \"consistent with the national contingency plan,\" Haber has alleged that it has performed remediation at the direction of IDEM. [Filing No. 122 at 6.] For purposes of pleading, this is adequate.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     NutraSweet Co. v. X-L Eng'g Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11192392\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/776/#p791\">\n     227 F.3d 776\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 791 (7th Cir. 2000) (finding adequate evidence of compliance with national contingency plan where \"[t]he Illinois EPA approved NutraSweet's clean-up plan, and the agency monitored the progress of the remediation\" and \"NutraSweet remediated its property until the Illinois EPA advised it that it could stop\");\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.700\">\n     40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.700\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(3)(i) (\"A private party response action will be considered 'consistent with the [national contingency plan]' if the action, when evaluated as a whole, is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements ..., and results in a CERCLA-quality cleanup.\"). As stated above, Caterpillar will have ample opportunity to conduct discovery on the nature of Haber's\n    remediation and the costs it has incurred and will incur.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Caterpillar's final argument, that Haber's Second Amended Complaint fails to plead facts showing the timeliness of the CERCLA cost-recovery claim, may summarily be dealt with, as it contravenes the longstanding principle that \"[a] plaintiff is not required to plead elements in his or her complaint that overcome affirmative defenses, such as statute-of-limitations defenses.\"\n    <em>\n     NewSpin Sports, LLC v.

Caterpillar has not shown that Haber has pleaded itself out of court under the applicable statute of limitations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    All told, Caterpillar's CERCLA pleading arguments are wholly meritless. Haber's Second Amended Complaint suffices to state a CERCLA cost-recovery claim.

Environmental Legal Action\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Caterpillar's last argument is a variation on its CERCLA theme-that Haber has not plausibly alleged facts to state a claim under Indiana's Environmental Legal Action statute (\"\n    <em>\n     ELA\n    </em>\n    \"). [Filing No. 51 at 13-15.] Specifically, Caterpillar argues that Haber has not plausibly alleged that Caterpillar caused any contamination or that the contamination poses a risk to health or to the environment.

At trial (but not at the pleading stage, of course), Haber will need to demonstrate that Caterpillar was \"involved in the alleged release of hazardous substances.\"\n    <em>\n     Neal v.

Ct. App. 2010) (internal quotations omitted) (affirming grant of summary judgment). As above, the factual allegations that Caterpillar used PCBs and then deposited them on the land certainly yield the plausible inference that Caterpillar \"caused or contributed to the release ... [of] hazardous substances....\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-30-9-2\">\n     Ind.

Specifically, Caterpillar submits that Haber's allegation that \"IDEM has alleged that [the contaminants] pose a risk to human health and the environment,\" [Filing No. 122 at 9], reflects a \"speculative ... allegation[ ]\" such that \"according to Haber's own pleading, the alleged contamination may not pose any risk at all,\" [Filing No. 92 at 14]. This creative wordsmithing turns the Rule 12(b)(6) standard on its head. The fact that IDEM alleges (and therefore presumably believes) the contamination to pose a risk raises the plausible inference that the contamination in fact does so.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Haber has sufficiently alleged Caterpillar's role in releasing contaminants and\n    that the contamination caused environmental harm, as required to state a claim under the ELA statute.
