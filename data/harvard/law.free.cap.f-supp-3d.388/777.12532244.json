After careful consideration, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the Government's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   These cases stem from the 2017 mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas. On November 5, 2017, Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 churchgoers and injured 20 more. Among the plaintiffs in these consolidated\n   cases are surviving churchgoers and relatives of those killed. They seek recovery against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Kelley purchased the firearms he used to kill or injure Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' family members at an Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors on April 7, 2016. The thrust of this lawsuit is that Kelley should not have been able to purchase these firearms, but failures by the United States Air Force and Department of Defense to collect, handle, and report required information allowed him to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Federal law prohibits certain categories of people from buying firearms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Devin Kelley fit several of these categories: he was convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year, he was committed to a mental institution, he was dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, and he was convicted of a crime of domestic violence. Yet despite having the duty to process and report this information, the Air Force did not, so when the retailer ran his name through the background check system it learned no disqualifying information. Here, Plaintiffs seek to hold the Government accountable for this failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Devin Kelly\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Devin Kelley entered active duty as an airman with the United States Air Force (\"USAF\") in January 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kelley was initially assigned to an Intelligence Specialist program but was cut from the program due to poor grades. He was transferred to the 49th Logistics Readiness Program. Kelley was stationed at Holloman Air Force Base in Otero County, New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Between July 2011 and March 2012, USAF placed in Kelley's file at least four letters of counseling and at least five letters of reprimand. Kelley was known to have made threats against his USAF superiors. Officers were advised that Kelley was attempting to carry out death threats made to his commanding officers. Kelley was known to have attempted to smuggle guns onto a USAF base in violation of base operating procedures and USAF regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 12, 2011, Kelley married Tessa K. Loge, who had an infant son from a previous marriage. Loge moved into USAF base housing. Kelley committed acts of domestic violence against Loge and her son. On June 8, 2011, Loge took her son to Gerald Champion Medical Center in Alamogordo, New Mexico because he was vomiting. The attending pediatrician also noticed febrile seizure and facial bruising. A CT scan revealed a fractured clavicle and subdural hemorrhage. Kelley produced a video confessing to USAF that he caused these injuries, and a Court Martial was convened. The NM Children, Youth, and Families Department took the child into their custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During Kelley's pre- and post-trial confinement, USAF placed him on lockdown for suicide risk. While these charges were pending, in spring 2012 USAF involuntarily committed Kelley to Peak Behavioral Health Services, located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, which has a dedicated unit for U.S. military personnel. As a basis for committing Kelley, USAF noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Evidence shows a serious escalation of behavior involving firearms and threats after the physical abuse of a child. Particularly alarming is his decision to try to obtain another firearm while undergoing inpatient mental health care, conducting research on\n   body armor, and then escaping from the facility late at night without authorization ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Lesser forms of restraint are inadequate to mitigate the flight risk he poses nor would they prevent him from carrying out the threats that he has made against others, especially given the forethought and planning that he showed by attempting to purchase another firearm and his escape from the mental health facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 7, 2012, Kelley jumped a fence and escaped from the facility. He was apprehended by local law enforcement personnel, who noted that Kelley was a \"danger to himself and others.\" While a detainee at the facility, Kelley attempted to buy firearms and tactical gear online and have these items shipped to San Antonio, Texas. USAF was aware that Kelley attempted to do so. Kelley threatened that if he were picked up by Security Forces, he would go for their guns. On July 10, 2012, USAF determined that Kelley should be confined while awaiting trial because it was foreseeable that he would not appear for trial or would engage in serious criminal misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A Court Martial considered charges against Kelley for: fleeing Peak Behavior Health Services Facility; causing physical injury to his stepson; holding a gun to Loge's temple and asking if she wanted to die; and threatening to kill Loge, members of her family, and members of his squadron. Kelley was charged with pointing a loaded gun at Loge and two counts of threatening his spouse with an unloaded firearm. On November 7, 2012, Kelley pled guilty to striking Loge, choking her, pulling her hair, and kicking her and to assaulting his stepson with \"force likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm.\" He was sentenced to 12 months of imprisonment, a bad-conduct discharge, and reduction in rank to airman basic. USAF discharged Kelley with a \"bad conduct discharge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Statutory Context\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under federal law, people with certain characteristics cannot buy or own firearms (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ) and dealers cannot sell to those so disqualified (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ). These disqualifying characteristics include, as relevant here, those with a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction, those convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year, those dishonorably discharged from the military, and those involuntarily committed to a mental institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, passed in 1993, tasked the Attorney General with the establishment of the national instant criminal background check system (\"NICS\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040901\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 40901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Attorney General delegated this task to the FBI. The FBI, in administering NICS, performs background checks on those who try to buy a firearm from a federally licensed gun dealer. As provided in the Brady Act implementing regulations, when NICS receives a background check request, NICS must respond with \"Proceed\" (the go-ahead signal), \"Denied\" (stopping the sale), or \"Delayed\" (additional information required).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2025.6\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 25.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(iv)(A)-(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Federal agencies, including USAF and DOD, are obligated to report disqualifying information to NICS.

Further, Department of Defense Manual 7730.47-M Volume 1, Enclosure 3 implements the policy of Manual 7730-47 and prescribes reporting requirements pursuant to the various federal laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This manual sets out a central DOD repository, Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (\"DIBRS\"), which is to include incidents of domestic violence and criminal data. DOD uses this to transmit reportable crimes to the FBI's databases, which are used in background searches. DIBRS was created because, \"[i]n addition to meeting the mandatory statutory requirements, ..... [DOD has] been faced with increasing requests from Congress, the Department of Justice, and other agencies for statistical data on criminal offenses[.]\" Manual 7730.47-M Volume 1, Enclosure 3 at 11. \"These requests necessitate improvements in the ability of [DOD] to track a crime or incident through the law enforcement, criminal investigation, command action, judicial, and corrections phases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    c. DOD's and USAF's History of Reporting Failure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Despite these federal reporting obligations, as incorporated in and implemented by the DIBRS system, USAF and DOD have consistently mis-or under-reported required information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2014, the DOD's Inspector General (\"IG\") evaluated compliance with DOD's reporting procedures. The investigation concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   10 years of DoD criminal incident data have not been provided to the FBI for inclusion in the annual uniform crime reports to the President, the Congress, State governments, and officials of localities and institutions participating in the UCR Program, as implemented in DoD Directive 7730.47 and DoD Manual 7730.47-M, Volume 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the time period sampled, Air Force Security Forces failed to submit fingerprint cards and final disposition reports in 60 percent of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Then, in February 2015, the IG conducted a comprehensive review of the failures of the branches of the U.S. military to promptly and accurately input criminal conviction information into the appropriate computer databases. This study found that, between June 2010 and October 31, 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from a sample of 358 convictions that required reporting, USAF submitted 248 fingerprint cards and 245 final dispositions. As part of this report, the IG made recommendations to USAF. The first recommendation was for USAF to submit and enter the missing fingerprint and final criminal disposition information for the sample period into the appropriate databases. Another recommendation was for USAF to \"take prompt action\" to ensure that all arrestee information is properly reported. USAF agreed to both recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, a 2017 IG report found that USAF did not remedy its reporting problems. In the sample taken for this report, USAF was deficient in reporting fingerprints and final dispositions in 94 percent of cases. Referring to the Sutherland Springs shooting, this IG report stated \"[a]ny missing fingerprint card and final disposition report can have serious, even tragic consequences, as may have occurred in the recent church shooting in Texas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Specifically here, while USAF was required to enter Kelley's conviction and criminal history into federal databases,\n   USAF did not do so. USAF allegedly did not report Devin Kelley's domestic violence conviction, his incarceration for a crime punishable by more than one year, his commitment to psychiatric inpatient care, or his bad conduct discharge post-court martial to NICS, the Interstate Identification Index, or the National Crime Information Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Sutherland Springs Shooting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Between 2016 and 2017, Kelley purchased guns in Colorado and Texas. These dealers received \"Proceed\" signals from NICS due to USAF's and DOD's reporting failures. Then, on September 5, 2017, Kelley used at least one of these guns when he entered First Baptist Church and killed 26 people and injured 20 others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs are the victims and the victims' relatives. Joe and Claryce Holcombe are the parents of decedent John Bryan Holcombe, who was killed in the Sutherland Springs shooting (18-555). Margarette Vidal was shot four times during the shooting-Monica Shabbir, Robert Vidal, and Ramiro Vidal, Jr. are Vidal's children (18-712). Charlene Uhl is the parent of decedent Kaley Krueger (18-881). Gary Ramsey and Ronald Ramsey, Jr. are the sons of decedent Therese Rodriguez (18-944).

Kris Workman (19-506) was shot eight times during the shooting. Plaintiffs' counsel has indicated that additional suits will follow pending exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Summary of Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their complaints individually, which for efficiency were consolidated under the above-captioned case, as it was first filed. The way the complaints depict the Government's negligence varies slightly, but at bottom they allege USAF and DOD were negligent in failing to submit or submitting inaccurate or incomplete information related to Kelley. Along the way, Plaintiffs allege these entities were negligent in their training and supervision, processing and recording of information, and other acts. Thus, Plaintiffs bring claims for negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   based on violation of the Brady Act, negligent undertaking, and negligent training and supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Standard for Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Government moves the Court to dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(1). Dismissal is proper under Rule 12(b)(1) \"when the court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Home Builders Ass'n of Miss., Inc. v.

When considering a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, courts may consider evidence outside of the complaint and dismiss on the bases of: \"(1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts in the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed\n   facts plus the court's resolution of disputed facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

That communication between NICS and the dealer was the indispensable nexus between any alleged negligence and the injuries alleged. Indeed, the entire NICS apparatus exists solely to communicate information to firearms dealers, which is then relied upon by the dealers when consummating firearm sales.

The\n   <em>\n    Block\n   </em>\n   court stated that the misrepresentation exception applies when \"the essence of an action for misrepresentation, whether negligent or intentional, is the communication of information\n   <em>\n    on which the recipient relies.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6192505\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/289/\">\n    460 U.S. at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6192505\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/289/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). And in\n   <em>\n    Saraw Partnership v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit stated that \"[w]here there is no detrimental reliance on an alleged miscommunication, no claim for misrepresentation is made.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414949\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/567/#p570\">\n    67 F.3d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571 (5th Cir. 1995). Without reliance on any governmental statement, then, Plaintiffs argue the exception cannot apply, and Plaintiffs argue there was no such reliance here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Government counters this reliance argument with\n   <em>\n    Baroni\n   </em>\n   , which found that even though the plaintiffs had not relied on the government's miscalculation of the flood plain, the developer did so rely, and that reliance was a link in the chain that led the plaintiffs to purchase their home and subsequently caused the plaintiffs' injuries.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1185408\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/662/287/#p289\">\n    662 F.2d at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government argues that, here, the gun retailers relied\n   on a governmental communication to proceed with the purchases, and that this indirect reliance is sufficient for the misrepresentation exception to apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court is not persuaded. For one thing, there is not even indirect reliance on Plaintiffs' part anywhere in the chain of causation. In\n   <em>\n    Baroni\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs' purchase decision indirectly relied on the misrepresentation-they relied on the representations of one who relied on the government's misstatement. But here that is not the case. The cases make clear that\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   reliance on plaintiffs' part is necessary,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   although cases like\n   <em>\n    Baroni\n   </em>\n   show that sometimes this hurdle is met even where the government's communication was not represented to the plaintiff directly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But in this case, even a far-reaching application of the \"vital link\" argument the Government advances would fail. Plaintiffs simply did not rely on a governmental statement of any kind-not even indirectly. They did not rely on any representation that was buttressed by a governmental misstatement. It is true that the gun retailers relied on some government representation (the \"Proceed\" signal from NICS) in selling Kelley the firearms, but Plaintiffs did not rely on this representation to their detriment. For another thing, as discussed below, the Court views Plaintiffs' claims as alleging operational negligence, not negligent communication. Any miscommunication in the chain of causation is merely collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Thus, the misrepresentation exception to the FTCA's immunity waiver does not bar Plaintiffs' claims for lack of any reliance to Plaintiffs' detriment. Even if the claims were centered on representations or failures to communicate, then, the exception would not apply. But the Court also finds that Plaintiffs' complaint centers on operational negligence, which is an additional basis on which Plaintiffs successfully avoid the misrepresentation exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The proper analysis seems to be two-fold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, does the Brady Act independently pull back some of the FTCA's broad sovereign immunity waiver in a suit against the United States? If not, the standard FTCA analysis applies, which the Court conducts below-namely, if the United States were a private person, would that person be liable in Texas under analogous circumstances?\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Here, the first question depends on the statutory text. In other words, is the Government correct that the United States is immune even though the immunity provision omits it from the listed immune entities? The Government argues that sovereign immunity is the default, and any waiver of that immunity must be set out clearly. Since \"[o]nly the explicit inclusion of the United States in statutory language waives the government's sovereign immunity,\" the Government argues the United States need not be \"listed in a statutory immunity provision to shield the government from liability.\" Docket no. 45 at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiffs have the better of this argument, though, as they point out that the FTCA\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the necessary immunity waiver. Congress has pulled back some of that waiver in specific statutes and has explicitly listed the United States where it has done so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the negative-implication canon, \"where Congress has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where\n   excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Supreme Court has \"stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there[,]\" and \"[w]hen the words of a statute are unambiguous ... this first canon is also the last: 'judicial inquiry is complete.' \"\n   <em>\n    Conn.

And since in\n   <em>\n    Alfonso\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   the United States claimed state-law defenses, these cases do not show that the United States can here claim an immunity granted to its employees by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   What these cases show is that the United States, when standing in the position of a private person under the FTCA, can use any state-law defenses available to that person.

It does not follow, then, that a statutory immunity provision shielding government employees from liability-and failing to immunize the federal government-can be invoked as a defense under state law. No case cited by the United States or revealed in the Court's research holds this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   court stated-and the Government appears to argue here-that \"Congress's clear intent in enacting \u00a7 922(t)(6) was to prevent any assumption of monetary liability for the operation of the background check system.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526655\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/636/\">\n    324 F.

Instead, the Brady Act contains other precisely defined immunities beyond that discussed here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (s)(7) (immunizing, in the waiting-period provision, \"[a] chief law enforcement officer or other person responsible for providing criminal history background information\"). This is not indicative of a blanket immunity against all liability related to the background check system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The position that Congress intended to immunize the United States in roundabout fashion through a grant of immunity to federal employees rather than immunizing the United States directly lacks satisfactory support. The statute includes tailored grants of immunity-none of which fit the United States-and the doctrine cited by the Government focuses on state-law defenses. Thus, the Court holds that the unavailability of suit against federal employees directly does not confer immunity on the United States in this FTCA action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Even if the United States is immune, the Act cabins immunity to those 'responsible for providing information'\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Even if the Government could avail itself of its employees' immunity, this provision states that it applies to those federal employees \"responsible for providing information\" to NICS. If applicable here, it would immunize the United States for some of its allegedly negligent conduct, but not all. Had Congress intended to completely immunize those covered by the provision, it would have omitted this \"responsible for providing information\" qualifier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In arguing that \u00a7 922(t)(6) is a total bar to Plaintiffs' claims, the Government focuses only on the alleged acts related to the\n   transmission of fingerprint cards and criminal incident data to the FBI's background check system. The Government does not grapple with the other alleged negligence. For example, Plaintiffs allege the USAF failed to: collect fingerprints and criminal incident data from and about Kelley; submit this information to DOD; train and supervise employees in properly collecting and submitting this information; and correct these problems despite a promise to do so following the Inspector General report. Further, in addition to DOD's failure to transmit Kelley's information to the FBI, they allege DOD failed to: follow policies and procedures regarding the collection and transmission of fingerprint cards and criminal history data and correct wrong or incomplete database entries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Not every federal employee responsible for these alleged acts-including collection, supervision, training, and processing-is \"responsible for providing information\" to NICS. Under no circumstances, then, does the Brady Act immunity provision end these cases, as the Government claims. Further, at this stage the individual employees (whose defenses the Government attempts to invoke on its own behalf) are not known by name. This is not a pleading deficiency-those in the position of Plaintiffs cannot be expected to know with specificity USAF's internal delegation of responsibilities and where in that chain the missteps occurred. Determining which employees' responsibilities fall under this immunity provision and which do not would require the benefit of discovery and would be better addressed at summary judgment or trial. Thus, even if the Government\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   invoke this provision-and the Court holds above that it cannot-disposition under 12(b)(1) would be inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Plaintiffs' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Having ruled that neither the misrepresentation exception nor the Brady Act's immunity provision bars Plaintiffs' claims, the Court turns to Plaintiffs' legal theories. Under the FTCA, the United States is liable in tort for \"the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Further, Plaintiffs argue, even if negligently running the background check system is not an undertaking under Texas law, the USAF's volunteering to take corrective action and failing to do so does constitute such an undertaking. Although these allegations could not support a negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   claim, violation of these duties imposed by statute and regulation provide evidence that the United States have voluntarily assumed a duty, as recognized by Texas common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   First, applying the\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   factors, the Court must decide the duty element. The risk, foreseeability, and likelihood of injury are high. Gun violence generally and mass shootings specifically are tragically commonplace. To limit this violence, Congress has disqualified certain people from buying, owning, or possessing guns and established a national background check system to prevent these people from obtaining guns. With Kelley specifically, at every stage in his life-during and after his USAF tenure-the threat of violence loomed. People like Kelley cannot own\n   guns and the negligent operation of the background check system foreseeably increased the risk and likelihood of injuries like those suffered by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The social utility of USAF's and DOD's conduct is high, but the magnitude of guarding against the injury and the consequences of placing this burden on the United States are low. The United States, of all possible entities, is best positioned to carry out the NICS system effectively and has the resources to absorb the blow when, as here, it allegedly acts negligently and faces the prospect of damages for that negligence. Taken together, these factors lead the Court to conclude that the United States owed a duty in this case. Had the Government elected to provide this service even without a statute requiring it, the United States would also, in that case, assume this duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Another court in the Western District of Texas recently denied summary judgment in an FTCA case stemming from another mass shooting the Government should allegedly have prevented-the 2015 Fort Hood shooting.\n   <em>\n    Kristensen v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530764\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/372/461/\">\n    372 F.Supp.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Tex. 2019). In that case, the court found that the plaintiffs had a negligent undertaking claim, locating the duty in \"Army and Department of Defense regulations\" that was \"voluntarily assumed by affirmative conduct-enacting the regulations and acting under color of them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530764\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/372/461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Kristensen\n   </em>\n   decision supports this Court's conclusion. Similarly, here, in enacting the DOD regulations mandating that information be collected and reported to NICS, the Government assumed a duty to act non-negligently in doing so. And when USAF promised to adopt the IG report's recommendations and fix its systemic problems, it re-affirmed this assumption of duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   With the duty element satisfied, Plaintiffs easily satisfy the remaining elements. Importantly, Plaintiffs' reliance is not required here. Many arguments like Plaintiffs' fail because, in casting an argument in terms of a state's Good Samaritan doctrine, plaintiffs often run into the misrepresentation or discretionary-function exceptions. Not so here. As held above, Plaintiffs relied on no governmental representation or failure to communicate, which prevents application of the misrepresentation exception. This would pose a problem under a Good Samaritan doctrine that requires reliance on the voluntary undertaking, but Texas's does not. It requires either reliance or an increased risk of harm. And despite the Government's argument to the contrary, Plaintiffs allege the systemic negligence on the Government's part led to a background check that was botched many times over, and the result was that Devin Kelley bought guns he should have been disqualified from buying. He used those guns to kill Plaintiffs' family members. This is a sufficient allegation of increased risk of harm. Besides, this is a factual question, as is whether the Government should have known of a danger to Plaintiffs arising from its alleged negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Further, referring to the above discussion of the Brady Act immunity provision, the alleged negligent undertaking-enacting and acting under color of regulations that require DOD and USAF to collect, handle, process, and report information to the background check system-implicates the conduct of employees well beyond those \"responsible for providing information\" to NICS. Even if the United States were immune to the extent its employees are immune, then, the negligent undertaking claim would still survive. The United States would still have assumed the duty to act non-negligently with respect to the background check system, and it would still have breached this duty by, for example,\n   failing even to collect Kelley's fingerprints. This act and other alleged acts have nothing to do with \"providing information\" to NICS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Thus, Plaintiffs' claim for negligent undertaking under Texas law should proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    3.
