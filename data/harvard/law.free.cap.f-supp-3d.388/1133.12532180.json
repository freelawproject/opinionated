(\"AlterG\") brings this action against three of its former employees, Sean Whalen, Thomas Allen, and Michael James Bean (the \"Individual Defendants\") and the competing company they founded, Boost Treadmills LLC (\"Boost\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). AlterG alleges that Defendants infringed its patents and misused its trade secret information to create Boost products. AlterG's complaint pleads ten causes of action: (1) patent infringement; (2) breach of contract; (3) trade secret misappropriation; (4) breach of fiduciary duty; (5) interference with contract; (6) interference with prospective economic advantage; (7) false advertisement; (8) trade libel; (9) unfair competition; and (10) conspiracy. Pending before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint. Docket No. 15 (\"Mot.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons stated on the record at the hearing on May 9, 2019 and discussed below, the motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The complaint alleges the following. Plaintiff AlterG is a \"medical device company\" that is the \"leading provider of impact reduction treadmills,\" also known as \"Anti-Gravity Treadmills,\" that are used for \"orthopedic rehabilitation and training.\" Docket No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 14. \"One of the keys [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] drivers of AlterG's success is its patented Differential Air Pressure ('DAP') technology,\" which works by \"us[ing] a pressurized bag to provide a counterforce to the subject's body weight, reducing their effective weight on the treadmill surface.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. From 2012 to 2015, AlterG devoted substantial resources to develop \"a lower cost, bare bones AlterG machine\" in response to \"potential competitors who wanted to develop anti-gravity training and rehab machines using mechanical unweighting and other options, and at a lower price point than AlterG.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. AlterG calls this project the \"Low-Cost Platform Project,\" or \"LCPP.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   AlterG ultimately decided not to commercialize or sell any products developed as part of the LCPP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Individual Defendants are three former employees of AlterG. \"Whalen was the founder of AlterG\" as well as \"the initial\n   and primary inventor ... principally involved in developing the technology and products of the company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. He therefore \"had intimate access to and knowledge of AlterG products, technology, business plans, intellectual property strategy, marketing strategy, financial data, vendors, suppliers, customers, and confidential research and development.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2012, Whalen relinquished his former positions at AlterG but continued working for the company as a consultant until he stopped working for AlterG altogether on March 31, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 24. During this consultancy period, \"Whalen was the principal consultant and engineer\" on the LCPP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Allen joined AlterG in 2007 and has \"held numerous jobs at AlterG in sales, business development, and in international sales.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Through those positions, he became \"intimately familiar with the products of AlterG and specifically the costing, bill of materials (BOM), sales and financial information, customer acquisition, marketing projections, and business strategy for AlterG products.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Like Whalen, Allen worked closely with the LCPP team from 2012 through 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Allen was also AlterG's \"principal liaison\" to Woodway USA (\"Woodway\"), a longtime supplier of treadmills for AlterG.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28. He resigned from AlterG on April 28, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Bean joined AlterG in 2008 and worked in various sales roles at the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. He resigned from AlterG in April 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. \"Since Bean's departure from AlterG in April 2017, AlterG has discovered communications between Bean and Allen about Allen's work on a competing anti-gravity unit while Bean was still an employee of AlterG.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Each of the Individual Defendants signed various confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with AlterG during their employment with the company, which provided that they would \"not use or disclose AlterG's proprietary and confidential information in any way contrary to the benefit of AlterG.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 25, 34. AlterG and Woodway also \"entered into various confidentiality agreements whereby AlterG would provide to Woodway proprietary and confidential information to assist Woodway to build and supply AlterG with anti-gravity units.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Boost was formed at the end of 2016 and registered in April 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Allen and Bean are founders of Boost, and Whalen worked for the company in product development.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   AlterG believes that \"Defendants conspired almost immediately [upon leaving AlterG] to create a competing machine incorporating AlterG intellectual property,\" and that \"Boost was developing an unweighting treadmill well prior to the company's registration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 39. As part of this process, Whalen and Allen started \"secretly\" working with Woodway and \"utilized confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information from the [LCPP], and other AlterG intellectual property, to shortcut the research and development time to come to market with a lower cost unweighting treadmill.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. \"At the end of 2017, Boost introduced its first product-the Boost One,\" which \"infringes AlterG patents\" and \"incorporates numerous technology features developed by AlterG in connection with the [LCPP].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   AlterG further alleges that Defendants \"falsely claim that the problematic Boost One is a superior product over the AlterG DAP systems 'at a fraction of the cost.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Defendants have also \"told customers and prospects false statements to denigrate AlterG and its superior technology, falsely claiming that AlterG was going out of business, is in poor financial health and will not be able to get Woodway treadmills\n   anymore.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. The upshot of Defendants' allegedly unlawful practices is that Defendants have been able to \"sell over 20 units [of Boost products] to date to customers considering an AlterG unit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For a plaintiff to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss after\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The types of information listed in paragraph 102 are somewhat more concrete, but are not tethered to a specific technology; it cannot be discerned which aspects of AlterG's \"anti-gravity rehabilitation and training units\" the information pertains to. And although AlterG, like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Alta Devices\n   </em>\n   , has alleged that the trade secrets at issue are covered by confidentiality agreements between the parties, AlterG only summarizes rather broadly the categories of information protected by the agreements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 5 n.2 (defining \"Confidential Information\" to include \"techniques, sketches, drawings, models, inventions, know-how, processes, apparatus, equipment, algorithms, software programs, software source documents, and formulae related to the current, future and proposed products and services of the Company, and includes, without limitation, its respective information concerning research, experimental work, development, design details, and specifications, engineering, financial information, procurement requirements, purchasing\n   manufacturing, customer lists, business forecasts, sales, and merchandising and marketing plans and information\").

The complaint alleges that \"Defendants conspired almost immediately [after resigning from AlterG] to create a competing machine incorporating AlterG intellectual property.\" Compl. \u00b6 39. Defendants seize upon the \"almost immediately\" language to suggest that the alleged acts of misappropriation must have started as early as April 2015, when Whalen and Allen resigned from AlterG, and before the DTSA was enacted. Mot. at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   AlterG counters that, although Defendants may have initially\n   <em>\n    disclosed\n   </em>\n   its trade secrets in 2015, they\n   <em>\n    used\n   </em>\n   the secret information in 2017, when they were developing the Boost One.

The elements of a breach of contract claim are: (1) the existence of a contract, (2) performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) damages.\n   <em>\n    Oasis West Realty, LLC v.

Defendants argue that AlterG fails to adequately plead three of these four elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Existence of a Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, Defendants argue that the complaint does not describe with specificity the terms of the contracts that were allegedly breached. Mot. at 16. A plaintiff can state a claim for breach of contract by quoting verbatim the terms of the contract or attaching the contract to the complaint, but he is not required to do so. \"[A] complaint for breach of contract must include the contract itself or plead its essential terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Gross v. Symantec Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. C 12-00154 CRB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203116158\">\n    2012 WL 3116158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (N.D. Cal. July 31, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, AlterG has not pleaded all of the essential terms of the relevant contracts. While the complaint states clearly that the contracts at issue require Individual Defendants to \"keep confidential and not use or disclose AlterG's proprietary and confidential information in any way contrary to the benefit of AlterG,\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, 25-26, 34, it does not allege with sufficient particularity what the \"proprietary and confidential information\" is. The complaint merely lists broad categories of information covered by the agreements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 n.2. As explained above, these broad categories are insufficient to put Defendants on notice of the scope of the trade secrets that are the subject of AlterG's DTSA claim. AlterG's breach of contract claim is also predicated on Defendants' alleged disclosure of trade secrets, and AlterG must allege with more specificity the types of information protected by its confidentiality agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Two other arguments Defendants make are easily disposed of. The first is that AlterG references multiple confidentiality agreements but does not specify which particular ones were breached. Mot. at 16. But the complaint indicates that Defendants breached all of the agreements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 91; Opp. at 11. The second argument is that the complaint does not explicitly state whether the confidentiality agreements continued to have effect after Defendants' employment with AlterG terminated. Mot. at 17. The complaint alleges, however, that an agreement signed by Whalen provided that he would not disclose AlterG's confidential information during his work with AlterG \"or at any time thereafter.\" Compl. \u00b6 21. The allegations with respect to Allen's and Bean's agreements are not so explicit, but the complaint states that the agreements required Allen and Bean to \"not disclose any of AlterG's confidential and proprietary information without AlterG's permission\" without mentioning any time limitation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the duty of confidentiality imposed by Defendants' agreements extended beyond their periods of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Breach\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that AlterG \"failed to plead specifically how each individual has breached his respective contract(s)\" because AlterG nowhere mentions \"what specific confidential information or trade secrets were in fact integrated into the Boost One.\" Mot. at 17-18. The complaint currently alleges that the Boost One utilized \"an anti-gravity unit that derived directly from the technology Whalen and other AlterG engineers developed for AlterG in the Low Cost Platform Project\"; that Bean, while still employed at AlterG, \"disclosed confidential and proprietary information about AlterG technology, marketing strategy, and prospective and actual customers and test sites to his friends at Boost\"; and that \"Defendants have taken technology and negative information and learnings from the [Low Cost Platform] Project ... and applied them to the Boost One product.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 36, 95. Once AlterG amends the complaint to describe the terms of its confidentiality agreements and the substance of its trade secrets with more particularity, it will be able to allege the specific trade secrets incorporated into the Boost One in violation of the confidentiality agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, Defendants claim that AlterG has failed to explain how the alleged breaches caused it to suffer damages, given that AlterG admits the LCPP was \"not commercialized.\" Compl. \u00b6 43. Defendants misapprehend AlterG's damages theory. The complaint states that Defendants used AlterG's confidential information to \"unfairly compete with AlterG and sell over 20 units to date to customers considering an AlterG unit,\" causing \"monetary damages\" to AlterG. Compl. \u00b6 46. It is well-established that non-speculative lost sales or profits can constitute contractual damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Illumina, Inc. v.

The essential terms of the agreements are also specified: \"AlterG would provide to Woodway proprietary and confidential information to assist Woodway to build and supply AlterG with anti-gravity units,\" including \"all specifications, drawings, files, instructions, and other documents,\" and this information was \"not to be shared or used with or on behalf of any other person or entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   However, Defendants' second argument has merit.

This does not mean, however, that Whalen and Allen induced or caused Woodway to disclose AlterG's confidential information to them. In fact, the complaint does not even allege that Woodway in fact disclosed any information; it merely states that Whalen and Allen \"utilized\" information. It is difficult to imagine that Woodway possessed any confidential information from the LCPP that Whalen and Allen did not already have, given that \"Whalen was the principal consultant and engineer\" on the LCPP and Allen was also heavily involved in the LCPP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 27.
