We hold that it did not and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">Appellant VFW Post 3562 challenges the warrantless administrative search conducted in this case as being unconstitutional because the administrative regulatory scheme under which the search was made is not carefully limited as to time, place, and scope. Such a frailty violates Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. VFW Post 3562 also contends that evidente obtained as a result of the warrantless administrative search may not be used in a criminal prosecution under a statute of general criminality not related to the provisions of R.C. Chapters 4301 and 4303.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">The Department of Liquor Control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>has broad regulatory authority over the manufacture, distribution and sale of intoxicating liquor. R.C. 4301.10 and Ohio Adm. Code Chapter 4301. In particular, the department, under R.C. 4301.10(A)(4), has the power to \u201c[e]nforce Chapters 4301. and 4303. of the Revised Code, and the rules and orders of the board, the director, and the penal laws relating to the manufacture, importation, transportation, distribution, and sale of beer and intoxicating liquors; and the attorney general, any prosecuting attorney, and any prosecuting officer of a municipal corporation or a municipal court, shall at the request of the department prosecute any person charged with the violation of such chapters or of any section of the Revised Code relating to the manufacture, importation, transportation, distribution, and sale of beer and intoxicating liquor.\u201d The department also has the . authority under R.C. 4301.10(A)(6) to \u201c[i]nspect, upon demand, the books, accounts, records, memorandums, and place of business of any person subject to Chapters 4301. and 4303. of the Revised Code or the laws relating to the manufacture, importation, transportation, distribution, and sale of beer and intoxicating liquors, and the sale of alcohol * * *.\u201d R.C. 4301.10(A)(7) provides, in part, that the department shall \u201c[delegate to any of its agents or employees any power of investigation which the department possesses and the powers of police officers with respect to the enforcement of any of the penal laws relating to beer and to intoxicating liquor * * *.\u201d A warrantless administrative search of a liquor establishment is constitutionally permissible given the long-standing governmental interest in the regulation of the industry. <em>Colonnade Catering Corp. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 72. However, the owner of a liquor establishment does not surrender all his Fourth Amendment protections because of such ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger </em>(1987), 482 U.S___ 96 L. Ed. 2d 601, 107A S. Ct. 2636, the United States Supreme Court recently held that a warrantless search of an automobile junkyard, conducted pursuant to the New York administrative inspection statute, did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The court first found that the state had a substantial interest in regulating the automobile-junkyard industry as a means of combating automobile theft. Second, the regulatory scheme created by the statute served this interest. Last, the court considered the time, place, and scope elements of the statute to determine whether the warrantless search provisions of the statute were reasonable. The court observed: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>place appropriate restraints upon the discretion of the inspecting officers. See <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>452 U.S., at 605, 69 L. Ed. 2d 262, 101 S. Ct. 2534. The officers are allowed to conduct an inspection only \u2018during [the] regular and usual business hours.\u2019 \u00a7 415-a5. The inspections can be made only of vehicle-dismantling and related industries. And the permissible scope of these searches is narrowly defined: the inspectors may examine the records, as well as \u2018any vehicles or parts of vehicles which are subject to the record keeping requirements of this section and which are on the premises.\u2019 <em>Ibid.\u201d Id. </em>at _, 96 L. Ed. 2d at 619-620, 107A S. Ct. at 2648. (Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201c* * * \u00a7 415-a5 provides a \u2018constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.\u2019 <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>452 U.S., at 603, 69 L. Ed. 2d 262, 101 S. Ct. 2534. The statute informs the operator of a vehicle dismantling business that inspections will be made on a regular basis. <em>Id., </em>at 605, 69 L. Ed. 2d 262, 101 S. Ct. 2534. Thus, the vehicle dismantler knows that the inspections to which he is subject do not constitute discretionary acts by a government official but are conducted pursuant to statute. See <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S., at 332, 56 L. Ed. 2d 305, 98 S. Ct. 1816 (dissenting opinion). Section 415-a5 also sets forth the scope of the inspection and, accordingly, places the operator on notice as to how to comply with the statute. In addition, it notifies the operator as to who is authorized to conduct an inspection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">\u201cFinally, the \u2018time, place, and scope\u2019 of the inspection is limited, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biswell, </em>406 U.S., at 315, 32 L. Ed. 2d 87, 92 S. Ct. 1593, to</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>In <em>Bionic Auto Parts &amp; Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fahner </em>(C.A. 7, 1983), 721 F. 2d 1072, 1078-1079, the United States Court of Appeals, in reviewing an Illinois statute and an administrative rule promulgated thereunder authorizing warrantless searches of automobile parts dealers, scrap processors, and parts rebuilders, stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">\u201cThe determinative factors to be considered are whether the industry affected is so closely regulated as to provide notice of the prospect of governmental intrusion and whether the statutory scheme enacted \u2018provides an adequate substitute for a warrant in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application.\u2019 * * * To satisfy the \u2018certainty and regularity\u2019 requirement, the inspection program must define clearly what is to be searched, who can be searched, and the frequency of such searches * * *. * * * [T]he degree and extent of past regulation comprise but a part, albeit a substantial part, of a determination of \u2018a reasonable expectation of privacy\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment. Otherwise, no protections at all would be appropriate in closely regulated industries. The Fourth Amendment requires that a determination of the reasonableness of the intrusion be made. Even in closely regulated industries, the inspection provisions still must be tailored to the state\u2019s proper objectives, and they must minimize the dangers inherent in the unbridled exercise of administrative discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Unlike the statute in <em>Bionic Auto Parts &amp; Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fahner, supra, </em>R.C. 4301.10 fails to provide the liquor license holder with adequate safeguards for an inspection scheme. The court of appeals in <em>Bionic Auto Parts &amp; Sales, Inc. </em>reviewed these safeguards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">\u201cThe revised Illinois Vehicle Code does limit the discretion of Illinois state officials in several important respects. First, \u00a7 5-403(1) * * * delineates specifically what is to be searched, namely, those parts of the business establishment \u2018used by the licensee to store vehicles and parts that are reflected by the required books and records.\u2019 Thus, unlike the statutory scheme held to be overbroad in <em>Marshall, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 323-24 &amp; nn. 21-22, inspectors under the Illinois statute cannot roam at will throughout the business premises. <em>United States, ex rel. Terraciano, </em>v. <em>Montanye, </em>493 F. 2d 682, 684-85 (2d Cir. 1974) (holding permissible warrantless inspections that are \u2018statutorily limited to the business records and goods of industries that are properly subject to intensive regulation in the public interest\u2019). Second, the statute describes how searches are to be conducted, confining them to \u2018any time that business is being conducted,\u2019 allowing the licensee or a representative to be present, and placing a maximum limit of twenty-four hours upon any search. Those constraints minimize the intrusiveness of the search. <em>Wayne Consumano, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>Block, </em>692 F. 2d 1025, 1028-29 (5th Cir. 1982) (approving warrantless searches limited to ordinary business hours). Finally, no more than six inspections of an establishment may be conducted within any six-month period, thus placing another limit on inspectors\u2019 discretion which was not present in <em>Marshall, supra. </em>While the buffer of an independent magistrate might constrain officials even further, the statutory scheme here involved narrowly defines what is to be searched, who may be present, how long the search may last, and how often it may take place. In light of the safeguards placed on the inspection, an administrative warrant requirement would add only marginally if at all to the licensee\u2019s right of privacy. <em>Biswell, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 316; <em>Camara, supra, </em>387 U.S. at 539.\u201d <em>Bionic Auto Parts &amp; Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fahner, supra, </em>at 1080.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Clearly, the United States Supreme Court and courts applying the law as announced by the Supreme Court have established a strict but reasonable requirement that where the premises of a person operating a licensed business are searched by agents of the licensing authority acting pursuant only to their administrative authority and without the sanction of a judge or magistrate, the search must be executed pursuant to statutory standards that limit the scope, time, and place of the search. In the present case, there were no restraints on the discretion of the investigators. R.C. 4301.10 contains no limitations on the hours of administrative searches. It fails to delineate what may be searched. In fact, the search here was made without a request to inspect the club\u2019s records. The statutory standard found in R.C. 4301.10 is therefore not sufficiently specific and narrow. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ciaccio </em>(D. Md. 1972), 356 F. Supp. 1373, 1377. \u201c* * * [T]he Fourth Amendment protects the interest of the owner of property in being free from <em>unreasonable </em>intrusions onto his property by agents of the government. Inspections of commercial property may be unreasonable if they are not authorized by law or are unnecessary for the furtherance of [state] interests.\u201d <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey </em>(1981), 452 U.S. 594, 599. Our review of the case law and our application of R.C. 4301.10(A)(4), (6), and (7) and Ohio Adm. Code 4301-.1-1-53<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> cause us to conclude that they are unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>tional insofar as they fail to establish time, place, and scope limitations on warrantless administrative searches of liquor establishments by agents of the Department of Liquor Control. The warrantless administrative search by agents of the Department of Liquor Control in this case, therefore, was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Further, a warrantless administrative search may not be used to obtain evidence of general criminality. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Akron Airport Post No. 8975 </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St. 3d 49, 19 OBR 42, 482 N.E. 2d 606, syllabus, this court held that R.C. 4301.10(A)(7) \u201c* * * does not empower law-enforcement officers who are not liquor department agents or employees to enter and search a liquor permittee\u2019s premises for \u2018evidence of general criminality\u2019 with the intent to charge the permittee with any violations contained in R.C. Title 29.\u201d In that case, the court cited with approval <em>Carter </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. App. 1970), 238 So. 2d 681, wherein the conviction of the defendant for receiving stolen property was overturned on the grounds that the state liquor control laws, which provided for administrative inspections, could not be the basis for a search for evidence of general criminality. The Florida Court of Appeals stated the following at 683: \u201c* * * [T]he authority of a beverage agent to search the premises of a beverage licensee without a search warrant is restricted to occasions in which the beverage agent is acting in good faith \u2018in the enforcement of the beverage law and the cigarette tax law of this state, and in the prosecution of offenders against such laws.\u2019 \u201d The court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Akron Airport Post No. 8975 </em>also quoted <em>Finn\u2019s Liquor Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Liquor Auth. </em>(1969), 24 N.Y. 2d 647, 658, 249 N.E. 2d 440, 445, that \u201c* * * [n]o State may require, as a condition of doing business, a blanket submission to warrantless searches at any time and for any purpose. * * *\u201d The state should not be permitted to do under the state liquor laws what it is prohibited.from other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>wise doing. Extending <em>State </em>v. <em>Akron Airport Post No. 8975, supra, </em>to this case, we hold that evidence obtained as a result of a warrantless administrative search may not be used in a criminal prosecution under a statute of general criminality not related to provisions of R.C. Chapters 4301 and 4303.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Appellant next contends that R.C. 2915.02 should not apply to fraternal organizations which are tax exempt under Sections 501(a) and (c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code and defined as \u201ccharitable organizations\u201d under R.C. 2915.01(H)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> since they are statutorily organized and defined for non-profit purposes. Because we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment on the issue of whether the warrantless administrative search in the case <em>sub judice </em>complied with the protections found in the federal Constitution and the Ohio Constitution, we do not here reach the merits of appellant\u2019s second contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Appellant\u2019s last contention is that mere possession of a gambling device is not a violation of R.C. 2915.02(A)(5). Recently, this court stated in <em>Garono </em>v. <em>State </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St. 3d 171,175, 524 N.E. 2d 496, 500, that \u201cmere possession of * * * [a gambling] device is insufficient to find a violation of the gambling laws. Such a device becomes contraband only if it is or is intended to be used to violate the gambling laws under R.C. Chapter 2915. See R.C. 2901.01(M)(6) and 2915.02(A)(5). Therefore, in order for possession of a gambling device to be illegal, it must be acquired, possessed, controlled, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>operated with the purpose to \u2018[establish, promote, or operate, or knowingly engage in conduct that facilitates any scheme or game of chance conducted for profit.\u2019 R.C. 2915.02(A)(2) and (5).\u201d Given our holdings that the warrantless administrative search of VFW Post 3562 was illegal and that evidence obtained as a result of a warrantless administrative search may not be used in a criminal prosecution under a statute of general criminality not related to provisions of R.C. Chapters 4301 and 4303, the fruit of that search, the club\u2019s records, should have been suppressed. Given the absence then of any evidence indicating that VFW Post 3562 engaged in conduct facilitating any scheme or game of chance conducted for profit, appellant\u2019s conviction for violation of R.C. 2915.02(A)(5) must be reversed. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b381-7\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
