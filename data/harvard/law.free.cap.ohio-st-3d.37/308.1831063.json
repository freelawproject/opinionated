We disagree. R.C. 149.43 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEP\">\u201c(A) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-14\">\u201c(1) \u2018Public record\u2019 means any record that is kept by any public office, including * * * [a] city * * * except * * * trial preparation records * * *. &lt;&lt;* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-16\">\u201c(4) \u2018Trial preparation record\u2019 means any record that contains information that is specifically compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or in defense of, a civil or criminal action or proceeding, including the independent thought processes and personal trial preparation of an attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-17\">Respondent argues further that under the Charter of the city of Middle-town, the police chief and police officers are members of the classified civil service, and that the charter invokes state law, specifically R.C. 124.34, for procedures to remove members of the classified service from public office or employment. Since those procedures potentially involve appeals to the municipal civil service commission and the court of common pleas and subsequent appeals to the court of appeals and this court, respondent argues, based on the affidavit of City Manager Burns, that \u201call documents prepared in connection with the subject investigation were compiled and held in anticipation [of] removing Chief Dwyer from his office for disciplinary reasons.\u201d We reject this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">Ohio law favors disclosure of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>records. Some years before enactment of the current statute, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">\u201c \u2018The rule in Ohio is that public records are the people\u2019s records, and that the officials in whose custody they happen to be are merely trustees for the people; therefore anyone may inspect such records at any time, subject only to the limitation that such inspection does not endanger the safety of the record, or unreasonably interfere with the discharge of the duties of the officer having custody of the same.\u2019 \u201d <em>State, ex rel. Patterson, v. Ayers </em>(1960), 171 Ohio St. 369, 371, 14 O.O. 2d 116, 117, 171 N.E. 2d 508, 509, quoted in <em>Dayton Newspapers </em>v. <em>Dayton </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 107, 109, 74 O.O. 2d 209, 211, 341 N.E. 2d 576, 577-578. The General Assembly has recently furthered this philosophy of disclosure by changing the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d under the statute from a record \u201crequired to be kept\u201d to one that merely \u201cis kept.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Respondent\u2019s assertion offends this philosophy. While any prudent public officer would be aware that this investigation might lead to litigation \u2014 administrative, civil, or criminal \u2014 the record resulting from the investigation was not \u201cspecifically compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or in defense of, a civil or criminal action or proceeding.\u201d Clearly the investigation was conducted and the record compiled to establish the accuracy of the accusations being made against the police chief and to assess the propriety of his conduct, whatever litigation might result. It was simply a lawful investigation of one public officer by another. As such, the record compiled is a public record as defined in R.C. 149.43(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Since we hold that the record in question is a public record subject to disclosure, judgment for relators is appropriate. However, we agree with respondent that on the facts presented he is not the person responsible for the record. That person is the city manager. Moreover, we note that under R.C. 149.43(C), a person aggrieved by a \u201cgovernmental unit\u201d may obtain a judgment in mandamus that requires the \u201cgovernmental unit <em>or </em>the person responsible for the public record to comply with [the disclosure requirements of] division (B) of * * * [R.C. 149.43].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, pursuant to Civ. R. 21, we, <em>sua sponte, </em>join the city of Middletown and the City Manager of the city of Middletown as parties, and hereby issue a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the respondent city and the respondent city manager to make the subject record available as required by R.C. 149.43(B). <em>State, ex rel.
