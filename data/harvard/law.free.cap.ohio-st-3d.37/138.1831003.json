We hold in the negative and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-18\">This issue was originally raised by the appellants in the court of appeals upon their filing of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \u201cWhere a court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of an action or an appeal, a challenge to jurisdiction on such ground may effectively be made for the first time on appeal in a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Keller </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St. 2d 122, 35 O.O. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>147, 216 N.E. 2d 379, paragraph five of the syllabus. See, also, <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Eaton Corp. </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 236, 2 O.O. 3d 408, 358 N.E. 2d 536.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court of appeals overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Appellants maintain that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this cause of action because (1) R.C. 4123.519 is the only statute that could have vested the common pleas court with subject matter jurisdiction over this claim, and (2) R.C. 4123.519 does not afford a right of appeal to the legal representative of a claimant\u2019s estate. We agree. \u201cCourts of Common Pleas do not have inherent jurisdiction in workmen\u2019s compensation cases but only such jurisdiction as is conferred on them under the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>at paragraph four of the syllabus. The jurisdiction of the court of common pleas over workers\u2019 compensation claims is not included within its general jurisdiction. However, jurisdiction over such claims is provided by R.C. 4123.519.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">R.C. 4123.519 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\"><em>\u201cThe claimant </em>or <em>the employer </em>may appeal a decision of the industrial commission or of its staff hearing officer made pursuant to division (B)(6) of section 4121.35 of the Revised Code in any injury or occupational disease case, other than a decision as to the extent of disability, to the court of common pleas of the county in which the injury was inflicted or in which the contract of employment was made if the injury occurred outside the state, or in which the contract of employment was made if the exposure occurred outside the state.* * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The language of this statute is clear and unambiguous. Two parties have been given the right of appeal from a decision of the Industrial Commission by the General <em>Assembly </em>\u2014 the <em>claimant </em>and <em>the employer. </em>Appellee filed the instant appeal pursuant to R.C. 4123.519. However, he is neither a claimant nor an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Appellee argues that he does have the right to appeal the decision of the Industrial Commission based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Whitmore </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1922), 105 Ohio St. 295, 136 N.E. 910. In that case, a dependent widow died while her claim for death benefits was pending. She had taken the necessary steps to present her claim to the Industrial Commission prior to her death in compliance with the then existing statute. Following her death, the administrator of her estate pursued her claim and prosecuted it all the way through the courts. This court found no error in the administrator\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Appellee\u2019s reliance on <em>Whitmore </em>is misplaced. Prior to 1931, a legal representative of a deceased employee was permitted to prosecute a workers\u2019 compensation claim by statute. Pursuant to G.C. 1465-76 (104 Ohio Laws 194), the legal representative of a deceased employee could make application for an award. Thus, it is not unreasonable that this court found no error in the administrator\u2019s actions. Permitting the legal representative or administrator of an estate of a deceased dependent to prosecute a claim would have been a logical extension of the laws at that time. However, this no longer holds true. G.C. 1465-76 was repealed effective July 9,1931 (114 Ohio Laws 39).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">The present Workers\u2019 Compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>tion Act does not contain <em>any provisions </em>which confer the right to file a claim or an appeal upon a legal representative of a claimant\u2019s estate. R.C. 4123.519 provides the right of appeal to the claimant and the employer only. Therefore, we hold that the legal representative of the estate of a workers\u2019 compensation claimant may not appeal a decision of the Industrial Commission to a common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 4123.519. While this may be a harsh result, we find that to construe this provision otherwise would be legislation by unjustified judicial interpretation. \u201c[I]t must be recognized that a comb, in interpreting a legislative enactment, may not simply rewrite it on the basis that it is thereby improving the law.\u201d <em>Seeley </em>v. <em>Expert, Inc. </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St. 2d 61, 71, 55 O.O. 2d 120, 126, 269 N.E. 2d 121, 128. \u201c[A] statute which is free from ambiguity is not subject to judicial modification under the guise of interpretation.\u201d <em>Pulley </em>v. <em>Malek </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 95, 96-97, 25 OBR 145, 147, 495 N.E. 2d 402, 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the executor\u2019s appeal filed pursuant to.R.C. 4123.519 by a party that had no right to file such an appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should have been granted in favor of the appellants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b205-11\">Moyer, C.J., Holmes, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b205-12\">Sweeney and H.

Hoper, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 105, 190 N.E. 222. It is unclear whether the administrator of the deceased dependent\u2019s estate perfected an appeal from the decision of the Industrial Commission prior to or after July 1931. Furthermore, <em>Hoper </em>relies <em>exclusively </em>on the authority of <em>Whitmore, supra, </em>and <em>Indus. Comm. </em>v. <em>Dell </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 389, 135 N.E. 669.

In footnote 3, we declined \u201cto substitute a representative of the claimant\u2019s estate to the appeal pursuant to Civ. R. 25, as the estate does not have any interest in the appeal due to the language of R.C. 4123.519.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 25 OBR at 317, 464 N.E. 2d at 135.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b205-16\"> Because the issue addressed is dis-positive of this action, it is unnecessary to address appellants\u2019 other proposition of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b205-13\">H. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5a\">dissenting. R.C. 4123.519 gives a \u201cclaimant\u201d a right of appeal from decisions of the Industrial Commission. \u201cClaimant\u201d is not defined in the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. Nevertheless, the majority, in contravention of established law, has defined \u201cclaimant\u201d to exclude the claimant\u2019s executor or legal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">The estate of a dependent essentially encompasses all that the decedent owned at the time of his death, including choses in actions. The executor of an estate personally represents the deceased in settling his affairs and distributing his assets. <em>Service Transport Co. </em>v. <em>Matyas </em>(App. 1952), 63 Ohio Law Abs. 236, 108 N.E. 2d 741, reversed on other grounds (1953), 159 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Ohio St. 300, 50 O.O. 298, 112 N.E. 2d 20. The executor, as a legal representative, stands in the shoes of the decedent. See <em>Hopper </em>v. <em>Nicholas </em>(1922), 106 Ohio St. 292, 302, 140 N.E. 186, 189; <em>Freeze </em>v. <em>Donegal Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1983), 504 Pa. 218, 224, 470 A. 2d 958, 961 (\u201cA personal representative in the person of the executor or administrator of his estate stands in the shoes of the deceased victim as far as entitlement to benefits is concerned.\u201d); <em>Ames Trust &amp; Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Reichardt </em>(1963), 254 Iowa 1272, 121 N.W. 2d 200; <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Continental Illinois Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chicago </em>(1935), 360 Ill. 454, 458, 196 N.E. 515, 518 (\u201cAn executor stands in the shoes of his testator with respect to his personal property, and his ownership of the property is but a continuation of the ownership of the decedent.\u201d); <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Bridgeport </em>(1982), 187 Conn. 53, 444 A. 2d 225; <em>Waugh </em>v. <em>Lennard </em>(1949), 69 Ariz. 214, 211 P. 2d 806; <em>Hanks </em>v. <em>Admr. of Estate of Jensen </em>(Utah 1974), 531 P. 2d 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The executor is like a guardian of a ward. Just as the guardian of an insane or incompetent dependent should be able to prosecute an appeal on behalf of th$ claimant-ward, so too should the executor of a claimant\u2019s estate be allowed to prosecute an appeal on behalf of the claimant-decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">This court has long allowed the legal representative of the estate of a widow-dependent to pursue the widow\u2019s claim throughout the administrative and judicial process. In paragraph four of the syllabus in <em>Indus. Comm. </em>v. <em>Dell </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 389, 135 N.E. 669, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201cThe right of a widow to participate in the state insurance fund is not lost by the death of such widow before an award has been rendered thereon, but the legal representative of such widow * * * is entitled to an award covering the period from the time of the death of the employee until the death of such widow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">In <em>Whitmore </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1922), 105 Ohio St. 295, 136 N.E. 910, we affirmed our holding in <em>Dell, supra, </em>and allowed the administrator of a widow-dependent\u2019s estate to both file an application with the Industrial Commission for death benefits and appeal the Industrial Commission\u2019s denial of the award to the court of common pleas. See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Hoper, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 105, 190 N.E. 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">These are sound holdings because a widow-dependent has an interest in her entitlement which survives her death. The entitlement is a property right which can be passed on, through a will, to the people of the dependent\u2019s choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">The majority seeks to circumvent these cases, claiming they were decided at a time when the workers\u2019 compensation statute explicitly permitted the legal representative of a deceased employee to prosecute a claim. However, at the time of <em>Dell, supra, </em>and <em>Whitmore, supra, </em>the statutory right to appeal decisions of the Industrial Commission was given to a \u201cclaimant,\u201d with no mention of legal representatives, just as it currently is under R.C. 4123.519. G.C. 1465-90 (103 Ohio Laws 88 and 107 Ohio Laws 162). The provision upon which the majority relies, G.C. 1465-76 (104 Ohio Laws 194), governed a special section of workers\u2019 compensation claims relating to injury arising from the \u201cwilful act\u201d of the employer. Neither <em>Dell, supra, </em>nor <em>Whitmore, supra, </em>involved an employee\u2019s \u201cwilful\u201d injury claim. They involved claims by the dependent of a deceased employee pursuant to the death benefits provision, G.C. 1465-82 (103 Ohio Laws 86-87), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>which provision is void of reference to \u201clegal representatives.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\"><em>Dell, supra, Whitmore, supra, </em>and <em>Hoper, supra, </em>should remain the rule of this court. To deny benefits because a claimant fails to live long enough to survive delays in the administrative process is illogical and unfair. The majority\u2019s holding could encourage delay in processing claims, contrary to our statement in <em>Hoper, supra, </em>that: \u201cIt must at all times be remembered that one of the fundamental purposes of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law is prompt and certain compensation to those rightfully entitled to receive it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 190 N.E. at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Further, the rule read into the statute by the majority works inequities. Claimants having identical claims could file on the same day, prosecute their claims through the system, and be awarded an entitlement to benefits on the same day. However, under the majority\u2019s decision, if one claimant died the day before entitlement was decided and the other the day after, the estate of one would receive benefits while the estate of the other would not. That result is absurd. The legislature surely did not intend that a claimant\u2019s right to recovery be contingent upon the ability to outlive the administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">Finally, the majority\u2019s holding contravenes Ohio\u2019s survival of actions statute. R.C. 2305.21 provides: \u201cIn addition to causes of action which survive at common law, causes of action for * * * injuries to the person or property * * * shall survive; and such actions may be brought notwithstanding the death of the person entitled or liable thereto.\u201d Pursuant to this statute, a widow-dependent\u2019s entitlement to death benefits should survive her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">The court of appeals unanimously held that a workers\u2019 compensation claim does not abate when the claimant dies before the administrative decision has been made. I agree.</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-15\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\"> If the majority\u2019s reasoning in distinguishing <em>Dell, supra, </em>and <em>Whitmore, supra, </em>is that giving rights to a \u201clegal representative\u201d under one section of the workers\u2019 compensation law justifies extending those rights in other sections, the legal representative of a dependent should be allowed to prosecute the dependent\u2019s claim since R.C. 4123.01(A)(1) <em>currently provides </em>that \u201cemployees <em>or their legal representatives </em>or beneficiaries\u201d (emphasis added) may elect, in certain circumstances, whether to regard an independent contractor as the employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
