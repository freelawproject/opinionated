Code 4121: l-3-10(C)(ll) violates the constitutional mandate that a safety regulation be a specific requirement. Second, appellant contends that appellee\u2019s unilateral negligence precludes a finding of VSSR liability. We agree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">As to appellant\u2019s first contention, Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution states that the commission must determine whether the injury resulted from the employer\u2019s failure \u201c* * * to comply with any specific requirement.\u201d Elaborating, this court, in <em>State, ex rel. Holdosh, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 179, 36 O.O. 516, 78 N.E. 2d 165, syllabus, stated that \u201c \u2018specific requirement\u2019 * * * embraces such lawful, specific and definite requirements or standards of conduct * * * which are of a character plainly to apprise an employer of his legal obligations towards his employees.\u201d See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Rae, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1939), 136 Ohio St. 168, 173, 16 O.O. 119, 120-121, 24 N.E. <em>2d 594, 597.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-3-10(0) (11) provides that \u201c[t]he poles, legs, or uprights of scaffolds shall be plumb and securely and rigidly braced to prevent swaying and displacement.\u201d In this case, the commission determined that appellant had violated that provision, relying on appellant\u2019s faulty supervision in permitting the placement of cross braces over stringer braces. The commission found that the juxtaposition of braces constituted an improper assembly, yet failed to cite any specific requirement specifying the order of brace installation. The court of appeals found that the assembly was not improper in and of itself, but became improper once appellee removed the cross brace. The court denied relief, however, on the basis that Ohio Adm. Code 4121:l-3-10(C)(ll) imposed on appellant a duty to ensure that the scaffolds were securely braced at all times and to take additional precautions if necessary. It was the court\u2019s finding that, in this case, appellant failed to comply with this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">The court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of Ohio Adm. Code 4121:l-3-10(C) (11) fails to plainly apprise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>employer of its legal obligation to its employees. The court\u2019s interpretation that \u201c[additional precautions may be necessary\u201d does not impose a specific requirement, but instead vests in the employer discretionary power in determining what precautions may be necessary and when and how they should be implemented. Moreover, the regulation fails to apprise the employer of any obligation to install stringer braces over cross braces.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">This court similarly rejects the appellate court\u2019s suggestion that the employer owes an absolute duty to ensure that the scaffolding remains secure at all times. Such language is not contained in Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-3-10(C)(11). While the regulation does require that the employer provide a securely and rigidly braced scaffold, it does not impose a duty of constant surveillance over the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is also well-taken. A VSSR award is precluded by claimant\u2019s unilateral negligence in removing the top cross brace without first installing a corresponding cross brace beneath, contrary to instructions. In <em>State, ex rel. Lewis, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(Mar. 15, 1984), Franklin App. No. 83AP-756, unreported, the claimant voluntarily switched off a punch press safety device despite specific rules to the contrary. Operation of the press subsequent to the safely feature\u2019s elimination resulted in claimant\u2019s injury. The <em>Lewis </em>court denied the writ seeking a VSSR award, finding that that employer had fully complied with the applicable safety regulations and the claimant\u2019s unilateral act violated the safety requirement. Elaborating, the court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201cThere was no regulation in force at the time applicable to the punch press used by relator that any method for switching the machine to an unguarded condition be kept within the exclusive control of the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">\u201cSince there was evidence that the machine was guarded until the guard was avoided by relator\u2019s unilateral act, the Industrial Commission did not abuse its discretion in failing to find that the employer violated a specific safety requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Here, too, the scaffold was properly assembled and in compliance with the applicable safety requirement until appellee\u2019s removal of the cross brace.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The <em>Lewis </em>decision comports with several of our previous decisions which hold that VSSR awards penalize an employer. <em>State, ex rel. Whitman, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1936), 131 Ohio St. 375, 379, 6 O.O. 88, 89, 3 N.E. 2d 52, 53; <em>State, ex rel. Emmich, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 658, 36 O.O. 265, 76 N.E. 2d 710, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>State, ex rel. Kroger Co., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 4, 6, 16 O.O. 3d 2, 3, 402 N.E. 2d 528, 530. As such awards are intended to penalize employers for failure to comply with specific safety requirements, only those acts within the employer\u2019s control should serve as the basis for establishing a VSSR violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Accordingly, we find that the Industrial Commission abused its discretion in granting appellee a VSSR award. The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby reversed and the requested writ of mandamus directing the commission to deny claimant\u2019s VSSR application is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b228-13\">Moyer, C.J., Locher, Holmes, Wright and H.
