We disagree. As to wholly dependent persons, this section provides for benefit calculation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-17\">\u201c* * * [T]he weekly payment shall be sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the average weekly wage, but not to exceed a maximum aggregate amount of weekly compensation which is equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, and not in any event less than a minimum amount of weekly compensation which is equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of Section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, regardless of the average weekly wage; * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-18\">R.C. 4123.59(B) also states that \u201c* * * when any claimant is receiving total disability compensation at the time of death the wholly dependent person shall be <em>eligible </em>for the maximum compensation provided for in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-19\">Appellant relies on this latter provision contending that it' imposes an entitlement as of right to maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>compensation. This argument is not persuasive. R.C. 4123.59(B) states that dependents of decedents receiving total disability at the time of death are <em>eligible </em>for maximum compensation. It does not establish a mandatory entitlement, but merely a prerequisite to consideration. Moreover, R.C. 4123.59(B) sets forth the statutory formula for the calculation of death benefits, which are primarily determined by reference to the decedent\u2019s average weekly wage and the state-wide average weekly wage. Appellant\u2019s assertion of a mandatory entitlement ignores this statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Thus, we hold that the Industrial Commission properly applied R.C. 4123.59(B) in determining appellant\u2019s benefits, and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying appellant\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-6\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Wright and H.
