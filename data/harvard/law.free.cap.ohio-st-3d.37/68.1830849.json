This section, in pertinent part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">\u201cThe action of the county budget commission under section 5747.51 of the Revised Code may be appealed to the board of tax appeals in the manner and with the effect provided in section 5705.37 of the Revised Code ** * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUu\">Furthermore, in <em>Budget Comm. of Brown Cty., </em>we held that R.C. 5705.37 states the specific method for pursuing that appeal. We emphasized the language of R.C. 5747.55 which stated the appeal may be taken \u201cin the manner\u201d provided by R.C. 5705.37. Additionally, this appeal is taken \u201cwith the effect\u201d provided in R.C. 5705.37.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">According to R.C. 5705.37, \u201c[t]he taxing authority of any subdivision which is dissatisfied with any action of the budget commission may, through its fiscal officer, appeal to the board of tax appeals within thirty days after the receipt by such subdivision of the official certificate or notice of such action of said commission.* * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">R.C. 5705.01 contains definitions of terms applicable to R.C. Chapter 5705. The definition of \u201csubdivision\u201d in R.C. 5705.01(A) does not include a park district, nor does R.C. 5705.01(C) list a \u201ctaxing authority\u201d for a park district. A park district is listed as a \u201ctaxing unit.\u201d R.C.' 5705.01(H).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">We interpret the above statutes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>mean that only those taxing authorities of subdivisions defined in R.C. 5705.01 have standing to appeal the action of a budget commission to the Board of Tax Appeals. R.C. 5747.55 grants the right to appeal, but the appeal is pursued under R.C. 5705.37. The appeal is to be taken in the manner and with the effect provided in R.C. 5705.37. R.C. 5747.55 does not specify who may appeal; this is found only in R.C. 5705.37. Appellant is not an R.C. 5705.01 \u201csubdivision\u201d and, thus, does not have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The BTA did not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal and, consequently, should have dismissed it. <em>North Olmsted, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 218, 16 O.O. 3d 249, 404 N.E. 2d 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Appellant cites <em>Lake Cty. Budget Comm. </em>v. <em>Willoughby Hills </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St. 2d 108, 38 O.O. 2d 289, 224 N. E. 2d 120, and <em>Brook Park </em>v. <em>Budget Comm. </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St. 2d 119, 45 O.O. 2d 464, 243 N.E. 2d 77, in support of its standing. In <em>Lake Cty., </em>this court held that a park district need not be named as an appellee if it did not claim a need for current operating expenses. In <em>Brook Park, </em>the court ordered a redetermination of a park district\u2019s actual needs pursuant to the appeal filed by the park district. Neither case is helpful to appellant since neither addresses the question of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed, <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-12\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney and Locher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b134-14\">Holmes and Wright, JJ., concur separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b134-15\">Douglas and H.

I feel certain that it will come as a great surprise to the park boards throughout the state that they have no right of appeal under the law of their allocations of the local government fund. I must admit, until this issue was thoroughly reviewed and pertinent statutes analyzed, I was under the same impression that an appeal was available to the park districts from such allocations. However, close scrutiny of these sections will show that the conclusion set forth in this opinion is a correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">It must be re-emphasized that the appeals by local subdivisions of the local government fund allocation to such subdivisions are controlled by R.C. 5705.37, and according to this court\u2019s prior decision in <em>Budget Comm. of Brown Cty. </em>v. <em>Georgetown </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St. 3d 33, 24 OBR 76, 492 N.E. 2d 826, such appeals must be brought \u201cin the manner\u201d and \u201cwith the effect\u201d of such section of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-18\">R.C. 5705.37 provides that a \u201csubdivision\u201d is the entity that may appeal such an allocation, and that dissatisfaction over the funding, and thence the appeal, is to be taken by the \u201ctaxing authority\u201d of such subdivision through its \u201cfiscal officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-19\">As pointed out in the majority opinion here, even though a park district is defined within the local government fund definition section, R.C. 5747.01(Q)(1), as a \u201csubdivision,\u201d a park district is not listed as a \u201csubdivision\u201d within the definition section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>of the appellate chapter, R.C. 5705.01, and in like manner a park district is not set forth in such definition section to be a \u201ctaxing authority.\u201d As noted, a park district is listed as a \u201ctaxing unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">All the above may seem to be a strict interpretation of these statutes, and in so doing, unduly restricts the right of appeal of the park districts in Ohio. However, the plain words of any statute must be given their plain meaning and such is the case here before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Park districts throughout Ohio, and most particularly those districts serving our larger metropolitan areas, have become vital public-serving local government entities with ever increasing demands for recreational and educational activities in a natural setting. The economic needs, and therefore the increased budgets, of such park districts, have accordingly grown to proportions as great or greater than a number of the other local government entities in their county. Park districts, in addition to sharing in the distribution of local government funds under R.C. 5747.50 through 5747.55, also have the taxing power to meet some of the budgetary requirements of the districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">It would seem that the growth of park districts in real estate holdings, development costs, maintenance costs, equipment needs, and personnel costs, and a multitude of other economic needs occasioned by the notably increased public recreational and outdoor-study demands have placed such districts in an ever increasing competition with other local government entities for increased sums from the local government fund. It also seems reasonable that such growth of the park districts in their relative position and importance among other local government subdivisions should give rise to the question as to why these park districts should not be listed as a \u201csubdivision,\u201d for purposes of an appeal of such budget commission determination, as are a \u201ctownship police district,\u201d \u201ctownship fire district,\u201d \u201cjoint ambulance district,\u201d \u201ctownship waste disposal district,\u201d and others. I believe that a reasonable evaluation of the relative stance of all local government subdivisions in this regard would suggest the conclusion that park districts should have such right of appeal available to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">However, this is a legislative problem, and it behooves those interested parties to begin the legislative process to resolve this problem.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-10\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
