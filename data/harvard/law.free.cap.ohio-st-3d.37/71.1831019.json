As this court observed in <em>Blakemore </em>v. <em>Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482, 450 N.E. 2d 1140, 1142:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-13\">\u201c \u2018The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. * * * [Citations omitted.]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">No doubt, a review of some of the pertinent passages of the referee\u2019s report set forth in the footnote, <em>supra, </em>reveals an attitude that can be characterized as sexist, inappropriate, unreasonable, intemperate and prejudicial to the wife. As the court of appeals stated: \u201c* * * The report is offensive and oversteps the bounds of propriety. It lacks the necessary impartiality or properjudicial decorum.\u201d While candor is important in calling attention to the problems and issues germane to a case, we believe the appellate court below was correct in finding that the adoption of the referee\u2019s report by the trial court constituted an abuse of discretion under the <em>Blakemore </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Notwithstanding our concurrence with the appellate court\u2019s finding of an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court as set forth above, the determinative question remains as to whether the court of appeals was correct in granting the wife\u2019s motion for a change of custody. The wife essentially argues that the appellate court, acting under the power granted to it by App. R. 12(B), rendered the judgment the trial court should have rendered by granting her motion for a change of custody pursuant to R.C. 3109.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">While App. R. 12 grants an appellate court the power to reverse trial court judgments and enter those judgments that the court should have rendered, we agree with the dissenting appellate judge below that it is inappropriate in most cases for a court of appeals to independently weigh evidence and grant a change of custody. The discretion which a trial court enjoys in custody matters should be accorded the utmost respect, given the nature of the proceeding and the impact the court\u2019s determination will have on the lives of the parties concerned. The knowledge a trial court gains through observing the witnesses and the parties in a custody proceeding cannot be conveyed to a reviewing court by a printed record. <em>Trickey </em>v. <em>Trickey </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 9, 13, 47 O.O. 481, 483, 106 N.E. 2d 772, 774. In this regard, the reviewing court in such proceedings should be guided by the presumption that the trial court\u2019s findings were indeed correct. See <em>Seasons Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 410, 461 N.E. 2d 1273, 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">While a trial court\u2019s discretion in a custody modification proceeding is broad, it is not absolute, and must be guided by the language set forth in R.C. 3109.04. See <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Baxter </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 168, 56 O.O. 2d 104, 271 N.E. 2d 873; <em>Palladino </em>v. <em>Palladino </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 175, 56 O.O. 2d 108, 271 N.E. 2d 826; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 203, 18 O.O. 3d 414, 414 N.E. 2d 426. In addition, the trial court\u2019s determination in a custody proceeding is, of course, subject to reversal upon a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>Dailey </em>(1945), 146 Ohio St. 93, 32 O.O. 29, 64 N.E. 2d 246; <em>Trickey, supra; Baxter, supra. </em>Since we view the appellate court\u2019s decision as erroneous for failing to accord the trial court\u2019s decision the presumption of correctness it deserved, we reverse the appellate court\u2019s granting of plaintiff\u2019s motion for a change of custody and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings. In addition, we concur with the dissenting appellate judge below that the trial court is better equipped, in most respects, to make a proper decision regarding custody. <em>Trickey, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Last, we are compelled to reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the court of appeals\u2019 holding that the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard is no longer the law of Ohio and that it has been replaced by the \u201cfamily reunification law\u201d set forth in R.C. 2151.414. First, R.C. 2151.414 has no relevance to the cause <em>sub judice </em>since it deals with matters pertaining to motions for permanent custody of a child by a county department, board or certified organization that has temporary custody of the child. Second, a review of the pertinent language contained in R.C. 3109.04, which governs the instant action requesting a change of custody, reveals that the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard continues to be the law of Ohio in these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">R.C. 3109.04(B)(1) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">\u201c* * * the court shall not modify a prior custody decree unless it finds, * * * that the modification is necessary to serve the best interest of the child. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">R.C. 3109.04(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">\u201cIn determining the best interest of a child pursuant to this section, whether on an original award of custody or modification of custody, the court shall consider all relevant factors * * * <em>fl</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">Abundant case law also supports the time-honored standard that what is in the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d should be the overriding concern in any child custody case. See <em>Gishwiler </em>v. <em>Dodez </em>(1855), 4 Ohio St. 615; <em>In re Cunningham </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St. 2d 100, 13 O.O. 3d 78, 391 N.E. 2d 1034; <em>Pruitt </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 237, 16 O.O. 3d 276, 405 N.E. 2d 276; <em>In re Palmer </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St. 3d 194, 12 OBR 259, 465 N.E. 2d 1312. Given the plain language of R.C. 3109.04 and the precedents cited above, it is clear that the appellate court\u2019s observation in this regard was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-16\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b139-17\">Douglas, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b139-18\">Wright, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b139-19\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFX\">concurring. I concur with the majority in its judgment of reversal. I write separately, however, to make three points.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-20\">First, I am at a loss to determine what this court would have the trial judge do upon remand. That court has already awarded custody to appellant and that, in effect, is what the majority opinion herein holds. Obviously the majority would have the trial judge direct the referee to write a more \u201ctemperate\u201d opinion. That is easy enough to say if you have not had to sit through one of these proceedings and watch opposing parties literally attempt to tear each other apart. It just could be that the trial judge was moderate in his comments given what he received, both orally and in writing, from the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-21\">Be that as it may, the majority has remanded this case to the trial court for \u201c* * * further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\u201d What further proceedings? The same traumatic parade of hostile venom \u2014 only updated? The same ultimate finding (custody to appellant) with the exception that the finding be accompanied by a more \u201cmoderate\u201d opinion reciting all the usual domestic relations and psychological contradictions that often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>are, by necessity, found in such opinions, thereby passing appellate muster? It seems obvious from the majority opinion that if the trial judge proceeds in such a manner, then his decision will be approved. But at what price? Such a \u201cproceeding\u201d seems like such an unnecessary charade unless the trial court can just review its previous record and write its new opinion. Unfortunately, the majority opinion gives no direction in this regard. I am grateful that I am not the trial judge who has to determine what this court has mandated his next step to be. Frankly, I would not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">My second point concerns R.C. 3105.21(A). I recognize there has been nothing previously announced on this point which could have guided the trial judge in this case. I regret that we have not taken the opportunity to do so. R.C. 3105.21(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">\u201cUpon satisfactory proof of the causes in the complaint for <em>divorce, </em>annulment, or alimony, the court of common pleas <em>shall </em>make an order for the disposition, care, and maintenance of the children of the marriage, as is in their best interests, and in accordance with section 3109.04 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">It is my judgment that the trial judge in this case did have the authority and jurisdiction to make a custody determination because a divorce was involved. Had he done so, then any subsequent move by appellee to change custody would have been governed by R.C. 3109.04(B)(1), which is my third point.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">R.C. 3109.04(B)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">\u201cExcept as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, the court shall not modify a prior custody decree unless it finds, based on facts that have arisen since the prior decree or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the \u2022 circumstances of the child, [or] his custodian, * * * and that the modification is necessary to serve the best interest of the child. In applying these standards, the court shall retain the custodian * * * designated by the prior decree, unless one of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">\u201c(a) The custodian * * * agree[s] to a change in custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">\u201c(b) The child, with the consent of the custodian * * * has been integrated into the family of the person seeking custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">\u201c(c) The child\u2019s present environment endangers significantly his physical health or his mental, moral, or emotional development and the harm likely to be caused by a change of environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of environment to the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">Thus, there is a higher standard to be applied and applying that standard, appellee, on the record before us, could not make her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">With the foregoing comments, I concur in the reversal of the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
