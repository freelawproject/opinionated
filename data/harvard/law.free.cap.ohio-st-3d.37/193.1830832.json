For the reasons stated below, we reverse the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-19\">Under R.C. 5733.05(B)(2)(c), the sales factor of the three-factor formula is a fraction composed of the taxpayer\u2019s business done in Ohio divided by the taxpayer\u2019s business done everywhere. The inclusion of sales of non-tangible personal property in business done in Ohio is governed by the following pertinent language of this provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cSales, other than sales of tangible personal property, are in this state if either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\">\u201c(i) The income-producing activity is performed in this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">\u201c(ii) The income-producing activity is performed both within and without this state and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed within this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance. <em>If the income-producing activity involves the solicitation of a sale, the location of the solicitation shall control. </em>If the sale is principally solicited by the taxpayer or his agent from an office within Ohio, such activity shall be allocated to Ohio. If the sale is principally solicited by the taxpayer or his agent from an office outside Ohio, such activity shall not be allocated to Ohio.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The BTA adopted appellee\u2019s view that the phrase, \u201cif the income-producing activity involves the solicitation of a sale,\u201d means, \u201cif the <em>principal </em>income-producing activity involves the solicitation of a sale,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the phrase applies to corporations, such as commission sales firms, whose primary \u201cincome-producing activity\u201d is the solicitation and making of sales. We hold that the BTA interpreted a clear, unambiguous statute that needed only application.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Weimer </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 312, 28 O.O. 270, 55 N.E. 2d 413, we stated the first rule of statutory construction in paragraph five of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201cWhere the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning there is no occasion for resorting to rules of statutory interpretation. An unambiguous statute is to be applied, not interpreted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">We amplified this rule in <em>State, ex rel. Foster, </em>v. <em>Evatt </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 65, 29 O.O. 4, 56 N.E. 2d 265, at paragraphs seven and eight of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-11\">\u201c7. Courts have no legislative authority and should not make their office of expounding statutes a cloak for supplying something omitted from an act by the General Assembly. The question is not what did the General Assembly intend to enact, but what is the meaning of that which it did enact. <em>(Singluff </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>66 Ohio St. 621, approved and followed.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-12\">\u201c8. There is no authority under any rule of statutory construction to add to, enlarge, supply, expand, extend or improve the provisions of the statute to meet a situation not provided for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">Statutes clear in their terms need no interpretation; they simply need application. If the inquiry into language of a statute \u201creveals that the statute conveys a meaning which is clear, unequivocal and definite, at that point the interpretative effort is at an end, and the statute must be applied accordingly.\" <em>Provident Bank </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 101, 105-106, 65 O.O. 2d 296, 298, 304 N.E. 2d 378, 381, citing <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Weimer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\"><em>A </em>reading of the questioned paragraph demonstrates that, if there are sales of non-tangible personal property and if the income-producing activity involves the solicitation of a sale, the location of the solicitation controls. If the solicitation occurs principally within Ohio, the activity shall be allocated to Ohio. If solicitation takes place principally outside Ohio, the activity shall not be allocated to Ohio. The statute is plainly written, and its meaning is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-15\">As we view this language, the pivotal word is \u201cinvolve.\u201d Words used in a statute are to be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>1.42; see <em>Youngstown Club </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St. 2d 83, 86, 50 O.O. 2d 198, 200, 255 N.E. 2d 262, 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (1986) 1191, contains the following definitions for \u201cinvolve\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">\u201c* * * [T]o have within or as a part of itself: contain, include * * * to require as a necessary accompaniment: entail, imply * * * to engross or occupy fully: absorb * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Thus, the taxpayer\u2019s income-producing activity could include merely the solicitation of sales or its activity could be absorbed fully by the solicitation of sales. We adopt the first meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">When faced with the General Assembly\u2019s selection of an inartful word, we must opt for the meaning that favors the taxpayer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201cStrict construction of taxing statutes is required, and any doubt must be resolved in favor of the citizen upon whom or the property upon which the burden is sought to be imposed. (Paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Willoughby, </em>173 Ohio St. 338, approved and followed.\u201d <em>Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 208, 73 O.O. 2d 507, 339 N.E. 2d 820, paragraph one of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Thus, for sales of non-tangible personal property, where the income-producing activity involves, <em>i.e., </em>includes, the solicitation of a sale, the location of the solicitation controls. See, also, <em>Miami Valley Broadcasting Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 10, 2 O.O. 3d 60, 355 N.E. 2d 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Since we hold in favor of appellant-taxpayer, we need not review its second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">Given our reading of the statute and given the BTA\u2019s finding that the solicitation of these sales occurred outside Ohio, the BTA\u2019s decision is unlawful and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-14\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes] Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b259-15\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
