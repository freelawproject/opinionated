Byer appeals from the judgment of the Portage County Common Pleas Court, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, Liberty Mutual Group (\u201cLiberty Mutual\u201d), on Byer\u2019s declaratory-judgment action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 2} The facts of this case are not in dispute. On September 19, 2000, the vehicle Byer was driving was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by Renee Wright. At the time of the collision, Byer was driving a vehicle owned by his employer, Ecolab, Inc. (\u201cEcolab\u201d). Byer was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">{\u00b6 3} Byer filed suit against Renee Wright, David Wright (the owner of the vehicle Renee Wright was driving at the time of the collision), and Liberty Mutual.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Byer settled his claims against the Wrights for the available policy limits of $50,000. This settlement was made with Liberty Mutual\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">{\u00b6 4} The case proceeded on Byer\u2019s declaratory-judgment action for underinsured-motorist coverage under a policy issued by Liberty Mutual to Ecolab. Byer and Liberty Mutual moved for summary judgment. The trial court denied Byer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual on its motion. Byer filed a timely appeal raising one assignment of error: \u201cThe trial court erred, as a matter of law, by granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee, Liberty Mutual Group, and against plaintiff-appellant, Dean A. Byer, with respect to his claim for underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d,</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">{\u00b6 5} Byer\u2019s assignment of error raises five issues for our consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201c1. Is an employee of a [njamed [ijnsured who is injured while occupying a company vehicle in the course and scope of his employment an \u2018insured\u2019 under a standard [cjommercial [ajuto [pjolicy?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c2. Does a company vehicle qualify as \u2018any auto\u2019 under a [cjommercial [ajuto [pjolicy?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c3. Can commercial insurance carriers issue policies covering thousands of vehicles nationwide but still only have to comply with the laws of the single state where the insuring agreement was issued?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c4. Does a written rejection of \u2018uninsured\u2019 coverage somehow also apply to \u2018underinsured\u2019 motorist coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c5. Does a \u2018reimbursement\u2019 agreement between the underinsured motorist carrier and the [njamed [ijnsured have any bearing upon an employee\u2019s claim for coverage?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 11} We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241, i.e., independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Lexford Properties Mgmt., L.L.C. v. Lexford Property Mgmt., Inc. </em>(2001), 147 Ohio App.3d 312, 316, 770 N.E.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">{\u00b6 12} Summary judgment is proper when (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co., Inc. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[AJ party seeking summary judgment, on the ground that the nonmoving party cannot prove its case, bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the essential elements) of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">{\u00b6 14} If the moving party has satisfied this initial burden, the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden under Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">{\u00b6 15} We first address Byer\u2019s third issue. Under this issue, Byer argues that Ohio\u2019s substantive law applies, while Liberty Mutual contends that Minnesota law applies. We conclude that Ohio law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>{\u00b6 16} In <em>Ohayon v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 474, 747 N.E.2d 206, the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c1. An action by an insured against his or her insurance carrier for payment of underinsured motorist benefits is a cause of action sounding in contract, rather than tort, even though it is tortious conduct that triggers applicable contractual provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 18} <em>\u201c2. </em>Questions involving the nature and extent of the parties\u2019 rights and duties under an insurance contract\u2019s underinsured motorist provisions shall be determined by the law of the state selected by applying the rules in Sections 187 and 188 of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Conflict of Laws (1971).\u201d Id. at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 19} Section 188 provides that when the contracting parties have not made an effective choice of law, their rights and duties under the contract are determined by the law of the state that, with respect to that issue, has \u201cthe most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.\u201d Id. at 477, 747 N.E.2d 206, citing the Restatement at 575, Section 188(1). To make this determination, \u201cSection 188(2)(a) through (d) more specifically provides that courts should consider the place of contracting, the place of negotiation, the place of performance, the location of the subject matter, and the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 20} In automobile-insurance cases, application of these factors will often correspond with the Restatement\u2019s view that the rights created under an insurance contract should be determined by the law of the state the parties understood was to be the place where the insured vehicles were principally garaged or registered, unless with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship to the transaction and the parties. Id. at 479, 747 N.E.2d 206, citing Restatement at 610, Section 193. See, also, <em>Ferns v. Rawn, </em>4th Dist. No. 02CA39, 2003-Ohio-4441, 2003 WL 21995256, at \u00b6 8-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b621} Liberty Mutual contends that Minnesota law applies because the insurance contract was delivered to Ecolab at its principal place of business in Minnesota. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, the record shows that Ecolab purchased the insurance policy at issue to cover vehicles registered and principally garaged in Ohio. While the policy also covered vehicles registered and principally garaged in other states, these other states do not have a more significant relationship to the transaction and parties than does Ohio in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">{\u00b6 23} We agree with the Eighth District Court of Appeals, which stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>{\u00b624} \u201cWhere nationwide coverage is provided, the policy\u2019s legitimate expectation is that the site of the insured risk is more significant than the insurer\u2019s residence or the place of negotiation. When a large insurer issues a policy designed to apply nationwide, it has no legitimate expectation that the law of its residence will apply in other states.\u201d <em>McDonald v. Williamson, </em>8th Dist. No. 81590, 2003-Ohio-6606, 2003 WL 22922271, \u00b6 22, citing <em>Jocek v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(June 16, 1994), 8th Dist. No. 64827, 1994 WL 264506. See, also, <em>Sarka v. Love, </em>8th Dist. No. 83446, 2004-Ohio-1911, 2004 WL 816831.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 25} We also note that the insurance policy contains a document notifying E colab of the requirements of Ohio law with respect to uninsured-motorist and underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) coverage. The policy also contains an Ohio endorsement. While their decisions are not necessarily dispositive, other courts have found that such changes evidenced intent by the parties to be bound by Ohio law. See, <em>Sarka, </em>supra at \u00b6 21, citing <em>Garcia v. Green, </em>Lucas App. L-02-1351, 2003-Ohio-3841, 2003 WL 21674971, \u00b6 24; <em>Vohsing v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>Licking App. No. 2002-CA-00101, 2003-Ohio-2511, 2003 WL 21122665, \u00b6 26; <em>Amore v. Grange Ins. Co., </em>Richland App. No. 02CA70, 2003-Ohio-3207, 2003 WL 21419184, \u00b6 25; <em>Glover v. Smith, </em>Hamilton App. Nos. C-020192 and C-020205, 2003-Ohio-1020, 2003 WL 832493, \u00b6 8; and <em>Horston v. Pfannenschmidt, </em>7th Dist. No. 02-JE-3, 2002-Ohio-7379, 2002 WL 32098115, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 26} For these reasons, we conclude that we must apply Ohio substantive law in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 27} The determinative issue in this appeal is whether Ecolab validly rejected UIM coverage. We find that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 28} The parties agree that the H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18, effective September 3, 1997 applies. The relevant portion of this statute provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA named insured\u2019s or applicant\u2019s rejection of both coverages as offered under division (A) of this section, or a named insured\u2019s or applicant\u2019s selection of such coverages in accordance with the schedule of limits approved by the superintendent, shall be in writing and shall be signed by the named insured or applicant. A named insured\u2019s or applicant\u2019s written, signed rejection of both coverages as offered under division (A) of this section, or a named insured\u2019s or applicant\u2019s written, signed selection of such coverages in accordance with the schedule of limits approved by the superintendent, shall be effective on the day signed, shall create a presumption of an offer of coverages consistent with division (A) of this section, and shall be binding on all other named insureds, insureds, or applicants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>Linko v. Indemn. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 445, 449, 739 N.E.2d 338, the Ohio Supreme Court found that a valid rejection of UM/UIM coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>under the pre-H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18(C) required the following elements: a brief description of the coverage, the premium for that coverage, and an express statement of the UM/UIM coverage limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>Kemper v. Michigan Millers Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 162, 2002-Ohio-7101, 781 N.E.2d 196, the Ohio Supreme Court was asked to determine two questions certified by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division. These questions were:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(1) Are the requirements of <em>Linko v. Indemnity Ins. Co. </em>[2000], 90 Ohio St.3d [445, 739 N.E.2d 338], relative to an offer of UM/UIM coverage, applicable to a policy of insurance written after enactment of [1997] HB 261 and before [2001] SB 97?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(2) If the <em>Linko </em>requirements are applicable, does, under [1997] HB 261, a signed rejection act as an effective declination of UM/UIM coverage, where there is no other evidence, oral or documentary, of an offer of coverage?\u201d Id. at \u00b6 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 34} The court answered yes to the first question and no to the second. Id. at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">{\u00b6 35} Recently, the Ohio Supreme Court resolved the question of whether extrinsic evidence may be used to demonstrate compliance with <em>Linko. Hollon v. Clary, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 526, 2004-Ohio-6772, 820 N.E.2d 881. There the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cA signed, written rejection of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage is valid under the H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18 if it was made in response to an offer that included a brief description of the coverage and the coverage premiums and limits. Once a signed rejection is produced, the elements of the offer may be demonstrated by extrinsic evidence.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">{\u00b6 37} In the instant case, Liberty Mutual produced a signed rejection form. Although the form itself did not comply with the requirements of <em>Linko, </em>Liberty Mutual submitted the affidavit of John Spies, Ecolab\u2019s Director of Corporate Risk Management. In his affidavit, Spies averred that prior to executing the UM/ UIM-coverage rejection form, he was aware (1) of the availability of UM/UIM coverage in Ohio with limits matching the policy\u2019s liability limits, (2) of a thorough description of such coverage, (3) of the purpose of such coverage, (4) of the premium for such coverage, and (5) that Liberty Mutual was required to offer UM/UIM coverage with limits matching the policy\u2019s liability limits. Thus, this extrinsic evidence, properly considered under <em>Hollon, </em>demonstrates that Ecolab validly rejected UM/UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">{\u00b6 38} Byer argues that the rejection was invalid because the box that Ecolab marked to reject coverage stated only: \u201cI rejected UNINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE-bodily injury.\u201d Byer argues that this statement demonstrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Ecolab\u2019s intent to reject only UM coverage and not UIM coverage. However, the first paragraph of the same form states, \u201cOhio law requires that we provide Uninsured Motorists Coverage-Bodily Injury <em>('including Underinsured Motorists ) </em>on your auto policy * * (Emphasis added.) Thus, for purposes of this form, uninsured-motorist coverage was defined to include underinsured-motorist coverage. The rejection was valid as to both types of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">{\u00b6 89} Because we determine that Ecolab validly rejected UIM coverage, we need not reach the other issues raised by appellant, as they are moot. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-6\">Donald R. Ford, P.J., and Diane Y. Grendell, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-13\">.
