We find no merit to this appeal and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>{\u00b6 2} In September 2003, Schors was charged with selling a firearm to a minor, a violation of R.C. 2923.21(A)(1). The matter proceeded to a bench trial, where the following evidence was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 3} In the summer of 2003, Schors sold a pistol to J.W., who was age 17 at the time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> J.W. paid $45 for the gun and immediately resold it to his 14-year-old brother for $150. The 14-year-old boy\u2019s stepfather discovered the pistol in the boy\u2019s bedroom and called police.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 4} At trial, Schors testified that he was an acquaintance of J.W. and that they had gone to high school together but that J.W. had graduated a year behind him. Schors testified that, because he was 20 years old at the time that he sold the pistol to J.W., he assumed that J.W. was around age 19. He thought J.W. was at least age 18 because he had graduated from high school. However, Schors admitted that he neither asked J.W. his age nor requested his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court found Schors guilty of selling a firearm to a minor. In reaching this conclusion, the court held that R.C. 2923.21(A) was a strict-liability statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 6} Schors appeals, raising one assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">{\u00b6 7} Schors argues that the trial court erred in finding that R.C. 2923.21(A) was a strict-liability statute. He contends that because R.C. 2923.21(A) does not expressly specify a requisite culpable mental state, the state must prove that he acted recklessly. In support of this argument, he relies on R.C. 2901.21(B), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpabili-' ty nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">{\u00b6 8} In the instant case, Schors was convicted of improperly furnishing a firearm under R.C. 2923.21(A)(1), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">(A) No person shall do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">(1) Sell any firearm to a person who is under eighteen years of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">{\u00b6 9} The state contends that, although R.C. 2923.21(A)(1) does not expressly specify a mental culpability element, the language \u201cno person shall,\u201d combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>with the legislative intent and public policy supporting the statute, plainly indicates that the legislature intended to impose strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 10} However, in applying R.C. 2901.21(B), the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. Collins </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 524, 530, 733 N.E.2d 1118, rejected the argument that public policy and legislative intent were enough to impose strict liability, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">It is not enough that the General Assembly in fact intended imposition of liability without proof of mental culpability. Rather the General Assembly must plainly indicate that intention in the language of the statute. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">Were we to accept the state\u2019s argument that public policy considerations weigh in favor of strict liability, thereby justifying us in construing R.C. 2919.21(B) as imposing criminal liability without a demonstration of any mens rea, we would be writing language into the provision which simply is not <em>there </em>\u2014 language which the General Assembly could easily have included, but did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">{\u00b6 11} Relying on its decision in <em>Collins, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. Moody, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 244, 2004-Ohio-6395, 819 N.E.2d 268, \u00b6 16, recently reemphasized that the language \u201cNo person shall,\u201d in of itself, does not indicate a strict-liability offense. Rather, \u201cthere must be other language in the statute to evidence the General Assembly\u2019s intent to impose strict criminal liability.\u201d Id., \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">{\u00b6 12} The Ohio Supreme Court has repeatedly held that, when the General Assembly includes a culpable mental state in one part of the statute but omits a mental state in another part, the omission plainly indicates its intent to impose strict liability in that section. See <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 27-30; <em>State v. Wac </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 84, 86, 22 O.O.3d 299, 428 N.E.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Wac, </em>the court analyzed R.C. 2901.21(B) in connection with the requisite mental state for a conviction of bookmaking under R.C. 2915.02(A)(1), which provides in relevant part: \u201c(A) No person shall * * * (1) Engage in bookmaking, or knowingly engage in conduct that facilitates bookmaking.\u201d <em>Wac, </em>68 Ohio St.2d at 86, 22 O.O.3d 299, 428 N.E.2d 428. In finding that bookmaking was a strict-liability offense, the court reasoned that the General Assembly\u2019s inclusion of the culpable mental state of \u201cknowingly\u201d as an element of <em>facilitating </em>bookmaking, while omitting any such requirement for bookmaking per se, plainly indicated a purpose to impose strict criminal liability. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">{\u00b6 14} Similarly, in <em>Maxwell, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court relied on its decision in <em>Wac </em>and found that the act of bringing child pornography into the state of Ohio, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>in violation of R.C. 2907.321(A)(6),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was a strict-liability offense. <em>Maxwell, </em>\u00b6 24-30. Although the statute contains an express-knowledge requirement pertaining to the character of the material, the statute is silent as to any mental element regarding the act of bringing child pornography into the state. As a result, the court found that \u201cit is reasonable to presume that the inclusion of a knowledge requirement regarding the character of the material and the absence of a mental element elsewhere in R.C. 2907.321 reflect legislative intent to impose strict liability for the act of bringing child pornography into the state of Ohio.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 15} In the instant case, we find that the language contained in other sections of R.C. 2923.21(A), which includes a \u201cknowingly\u201d element, plainly indicates the legislature\u2019s intent to impose strict liability for the sale of a firearm to a minor. Here, R.C. 2923.21(A)(4) and (A)(5) include knowledge as a material element of the offenses and provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">(A) No person shall do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">(4) Sell or furnish a firearm to a person who is eighteen years of age or older if the seller or furnisher <em>knows, or has reason to know, </em>that the person is purchasing or receiving the firearm for the purpose of selling the firearm in violation of division (A)(1) of this section to a person who is under eighteen years of age or for the purpose of furnishing the firearm in violation of division (A)(3) of this section to a person who is under eighteen years of age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">(5) Sell or furnish a handgun to a person who is twenty-one years of age or older if the seller or furnisher <em>knows, or has reason to know, </em>that the person is purchasing or receiving the handgun for the purpose of selling the handgun in violation of division (A)(2) of this section to a person who is under twenty-one years of age or for the purpose of furnishing the handgun in violation of division (A)(3) of this section to a person who is under twenty-one years of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">{\u00b6 16} Therefore, based on the inclusion of a \u201cknowingly\u201d mental element in other subsections of the statute, we find that the omission of any culpable mental state in R.C. 2923.21(A)(1) demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent to impose strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, we overrule the sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b472-14\">Blackmon, A.J., and Karpinski, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-15\">. J.W.\u2019s date of birth is July 31, 1985. He was approximately one month away from his eighteenth birthday when he purchased the gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-15\">. R.C. 2907.321 provides, in pertinent part: \"(A) No person, with knowledge of the character of the material or performance involved, shall * * * (6) Bring or cause to be brought into this state any obscene material that has a minor as one of its participants or portrayed observers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
