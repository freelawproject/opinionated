The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations and Identification conducted DNA testing of the sample obtained and entered the results into a data bank. Cremeans subsequently was released from prison. Thereafter, in August 2001, Riverside police found blood at the scene of a burglary on Harshman Road. Testing allegedly revealed that DNA in the blood at the scene matched DNA in the 1998 sample provided by Cremeans.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In July 2003, a grand jury indicted Cremeans for the Harshman Road burglary. The state then moved to compel him to provide a second blood or saliva sample to confirm a match with the DNA extracted from the blood collected at the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">{\u00b6 5} Cremeans responded with a motion to suppress the 1998 blood sample and resulting DNA information, arguing that the state had extracted the blood in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Cremeans also opposed the state\u2019s motion to compel a second blood or saliva test. In separate entries, the trial court overruled Cremeans\u2019s motion to suppress and sustained the state\u2019s motion to compel a second blood or saliva test for purposes of DNA analysis. Following the trial court\u2019s rulings, Cremeans entered a no-contest plea to the burglary charge and received a sentence of five years of community control. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">{\u00b6 6} In his assignment of error, Cremeans contends that the trial court erred in ordering him \u201cto submit a sample for DNA testing and in failing to suppress it from use at trial.\u201d This assignment of error appears to address the second blood or saliva sample \u2014 the subject of the state\u2019s motion to compel \u2014 which was the only sample the trial court ordered Cremeans to submit for DNA testing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">{\u00b6 7} Cremeans advances two arguments with regard to the second sample. First, he claims that the DNA results from the 1998 blood test were the sole basis for a finding of probable cause to support the trial court\u2019s order compelling him to provide a second sample. Cremeans asserts, however, that the state cannot authenticate the results of the 1998 sample because of a faulty chain of custody. Absent proper authentication, he reasons, the 1998 sample could not provide the probable cause needed to justify the trial court\u2019s order compelling him to provide a second sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">{\u00b6 8} In a second argument, Cremeans contends that the taking of the 1998 sample violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches. In particular, he insists that the 1998 blood test and DNA analysis were undertaken without his consent and without individualized suspicion of criminal wrongdoing in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Given his belief that the 1998 blood test and DNA analysis were unconstitutionally obtained, Cremeans contends that the results of that procedure could not be used to justify the second test and DNA analysis ordered by the trial court in response to the state\u2019s motion to compel. Thus, he argues that the results of the 1998 DNA analysis should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>have been suppressed, and the state\u2019s motion to compel a second test should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">{\u00b6 9} Upon review, we are unpersuaded by either of the foregoing arguments. In his brief to the trial court, Cremeans alleged that \u201cthe reason the State is seeking a second blood sample from Defendant is that the State expects to be unable to authenticate the blood sample already in its possession.\u201d Notably, however, the record does not portray the authentication problem alleged by Cremeans. Absent any evidence in the record that the state\u2019s chain of custody is defective, Cremeans cannot prevail on his first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">{\u00b6 10} We note too that Cremeans had been indicted for the Harshman Road burglary prior to the trial court ordering him to undergo a second test. \u201c \u2018[A]n indictment returned by a [g]rand [j]ury constitutes prima facie evidence of probable cause under Ohio law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Nixon </em>(Apr. 25, 2001), Lorain App. Nos. 00CA007638 and 00CA007624, 2001 WL 422885, quoting <em>Inmates\u2019 Councilmatic Voice v. Rogers </em>(C.A.6, 1976), 541 F.2d 633, 635. Cremeans provided the trial court with no evidence to rebut the presumption of probable cause that his indictment created. Thus, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s reasoning that the indictment established probable cause for an order requiring Cremeans \u201cto produce nontestimonial evidence, i.e., a DNA sample, to attempt to match evidence at the scene.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">{\u00b6 11} Cremeans\u2019s second argument raises a more significant issue. There he contends that the 1998 blood test and DNA analysis were undertaken without his consent and without individualized suspicion of criminal wrongdoing in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. This argument challenges the constitutionality of R.C. 2901.07, which requires DNA testing of certain offenders who have been sentenced to incarceration, without regard to their consent or the existence of any reason to believe that they have committed a crime other than the offense for which they have been incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">{\u00b6 12} All 50 states and the federal government have enacted statutes similar to R.C. 2901.07. Appellate courts reviewing Fourth Amendment challenges to these statutes uniformly have held that mandatory collection of DNA samples from individuals such as Cremeans does not constitute an unlawful search and seizure, even without individualized suspicion of involvement in some other crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State v. Peppers </em>(2004), 352 Ill.App.3d 1002, 1004-1005, 288 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Ill.Dec. 502, 817 N.E.2d 1152 (\u201cDefendant is faced with a tidal wave of authority against his position. Every court of review that has decided the issue has upheld the DNA testing statute[s]\u201d). Indeed, this court\u2019s research has revealed dozens of state and federal court decisions rejecting constitutional challenges virtually identical to the one Cremeans advances herein. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Kincade </em>(C.A.9, 2004), 379 F.3d 813, 830-831 (en banc) (citing nearly three dozen state and federal court decisions upholding DNA-collection and testing statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">{\u00b6 13} Having reviewed the substantial case law on the subject, we now add our voice to the growing weight of authority and hold that Ohio\u2019s DNA-collection statute does not violate Cremeans\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. We begin our analysis by acknowledging that compelled extraction and testing of blood qualify as searches under the Fourth Amendment. <em>State v. Steele, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 659, 2003-Ohio-7103, 802 N.E.2d 1127, at \u00b6 23; <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 504, 508, 2002-Ohio-6717, 780 N.E.2d 981; <em>Skinner v. Ry. Labor Executives\u2019 Assn. </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 602, 616, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639. Of course, the Fourth Amendment prohibits only those searches that are unreasonable. Thus, \u201c[t]he touchstone of our analysis under the Fourth Amendment is always \u2018the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms </em>(1977), 434 U.S. 106, 108-109, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331, quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIn general, the reasonableness of a particular search or practice \u2018is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO, </em>supra, 97 Ohio St.3d 504, 2002-Ohio-6717, 780 N.E.2d 981, at \u00b6 24, quoting <em>Skinner, </em>supra, 489 U.S. at 619, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639; see, also, <em>Bell v. Wolfish </em>(1979), 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (\u201cThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted\u201d); <em>United States v. Knights </em>(2001), 534 U.S. 112, 118-119, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497, quoting <em>Wyoming v. Houghton </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 295, 300, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (\u201c \u2018The touchstone of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the reasonableness of a search is determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">{\u00b6 15} Although a search ordinarily will be found unreasonable in the absence of a warrant issued on probable cause, a warrant is not always indispensable. Even the lesser threshold of individualized suspicion may not be required for a search to be deemed reasonable. \u201c \u2018In limited circumstances, where the privacy interests implicated by the search are minimal, and where an important governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion, a search may be reasonable despite the absence of such suspicion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO, </em>supra, 97 Ohio St.3d 504, 2002-Ohio-6717, 780 N.E.2d 981, at \u00b6 26, quoting <em>Skinner, </em>supra, 489 U.S. at 624, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639; see, also, <em>Natl. Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 656, 665, 109 S.Ct. 1384, 103 L.Ed.2d 685 (recognizing \u201cthe longstanding principle that neither a warrant nor probable cause, nor, indeed, any measure of individualized suspicion, is an indispensable component of reasonableness in every circumstance\u201d); <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 543, 560-561, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (recognizing that although \u201csome quantum of individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure[,] * * * the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">{\u00b6 16} In the context of the DNA statutes, courts have followed one of two analytical approaches to dispense \"with the normal requirement of probable cause or at least individualized suspicion of wrongdoing to justify the collection and testing of blood. Some courts, including the trial court in the present case, have determined that the DNA profiling fits within the \u201cspecial needs\u201d doctrine, which permits a search without a warrant or individualized suspicion when the primary purpose of the search goes beyond the ordinary need for law enforcement. See, e.g., <em>Steele, </em>supra, 155 Ohio App.3d 659, 2003-Ohio-7103, 802 N.E.2d 1127, at \u00b6 31-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">{\u00b6 17} In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has applied the special-needs doctrine in a variety of contexts with differing results. Most recently, the court upheld the constitutionality of a highway checkpoint used by police to obtain information from motorists about an unsolved crime. <em>Illinois v. Lidster </em>(2004), 540 U.S. 419, 124 S.Ct. 885, 157 L.Ed.2d 843. Applying the special-needs doctrine, the <em>Lidster </em>majority reasoned that the primary purpose of the checkpoint was not to determine whether a vehicle\u2019s occupants were committing a crime, but to request their help in solving a crime most likely committed by someone else. In a number of other cases, the court has upheld suspicionless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>searches conducted to further important non-law-enforcement objectives. See <em>Pottawatomie Cty. Indep. School Dish Bd. of Edn. v. Earls </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 822, 122 S.Ct. 2559, 153 L.Ed.2d 735 (upholding the suspicionless drug testing of students participating in extracurricular activities); <em>Vernonia School Dish 47J v. Acton </em>(1995), 515 U.S. 646, 115 S.Ct. 2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564 (upholding a suspicionless drug-testing program for student athletes); <em>Natl. Treasury Employees Union, </em>489 U.S. 656, 109 S.Ct. 1384, 103 L.Ed.2d 685 (upholding suspicionless drug testing of certain government officials).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">{\u00b6 18} In contrast to <em>Lidster, </em>the court invalidated a highway checkpoint intended to interdict illegal drugs in <em>Indianapolis v. Edmond </em>(2000), 531 U.S. 32, 121 S.Ct. 447, 148 L.Ed.2d 333. In <em>Edmond, </em>the majority determined that the primary purpose of the checkpoint was to uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing. As a result, the court concluded that the checkpoint violated the Fourth Amendment in the absence of individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. Thereafter, in <em>Ferguson v. Charleston </em>(2001), 532 U.S. 67, 121 S.Ct. 1281, 149 L.Ed.2d 205, the court invalidated a public hospital\u2019s nonconsensual drug-testing program for pregnant women. In rejecting the government\u2019s special-needs argument, the majority concluded that the immediate purpose of the testing was to collect evidence for law-enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">{\u00b6 19} Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not addressed the constitutionality of suspicionless DNA profiling of convicted individuals, some courts have drawn on the special-needs cases to find the testing permissible under the Fourth Amendment. In <em>Steele, </em>supra, the First District Court of Appeals employed the special-needs rationale to reject a challenge to the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s DNA statute. In so doing, the <em>Steele </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cBased on the language of <em>Ferguson, </em>federal courts have concluded that a distinction exists between a statute\u2019s ultimate purpose and its primary purpose. While the ultimate purpose in obtaining a DNA sample from a person is to assist law enforcement, the statute\u2019s immediate and primary purpose is to fill and maintain a DNA database, a purpose distinct from the regular needs of law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">{\u00b6 21} <em>\u201cFerguson </em>and <em>Edmond </em>both involved programs in which a search was undertaken to produce evidence that the searched individual had committed a particular crime. The investigation of an identifiable crime is a core law enforcement activity. For this sort of law enforcement function, courts require probable cause or individualized suspicion before law enforcement authorities are permitted to conduct a search or seizure. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cBut the courts have stated that DNA statutes are not themselves designed to discover and produce evidence of a specific individual\u2019s criminal wrongdoing. A DNA sample is evidence only of an individual\u2019s genetic code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>which does not, on its own, show the commission of a crime. Unlike a urinalysis that can reflect the presence of illegal substances, the DNA sample only offers the potential to link the donor with a crime. The samples are maintained in the database without reference to the individual, and only a small percentage of the DNA samples are ever linked to any specific crime. * * * \u2018For these reasons, it is difficult to say that the DNA data bank program is one whose primary purpose [is] to detect evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing.\u2019 <em>Nicholas [v. Goord </em>(Feb. 6, 2003), S.D.N.Y. No. 01Civ.7891(RCC)(GWG), 2003 WL 256774],</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cFurther, searches conducted pursuant to DNA statutes have two purposes that go beyond the normal need for law enforcement. First, the searches contribute to the creation of a more accurate criminal justice system. This increased accuracy may ultimately exonerate persons who have been, or who will be, wrongly convicted of, or charged with, a crime. Second, the searches allow for a more complete database, which will assist law enforcement agencies in solving future crimes that have not yet been committed. In fact, the DNA statutes have a purpose, to help solve future crimes, that is unlike any other statute that has ever been before the United States Supreme Court. Thus, the statutes necessarily authorize searches that go beyond the normal need for law enforcement. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cOf course, an individual\u2019s DNA sample may ultimately be used for law enforcement purposes. Purportedly special-needs searches that may ultimately be used for law enforcement purposes are more likely to pass Fourth Amendment muster if they are conducted in a uniform, nondiseretionary manner. Under the DNA statutes at issue in these federal cases, no discretion at all existed. All persons convicted of the qualifying offenses had to provide DNA samples. Thus, traditional concerns of probable cause and reasonable suspicion were minimized by the blanket approach to testing. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cR.C. \u00a7 2901.07 is identical in all important respects to the federal statutes at issue in these cases. Consequently, the same reasoning applies in this case. We hold that the primary purpose of the search authorized by R.C. \u00a7 2901.07 goes .beyond the needs of ordinary law enforcement. Therefore, it meets the special-needs test set forth in <em>Edmond </em>and <em>Ferguson.\u201d Steele, </em>supra, 155 Ohio App.3d 659, 2003-Ohio-7103, 802 N.E.2d 1127, at \u00b6 41-467.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">{\u00b626} After finding that the suspicionless search required by Ohio\u2019s DNA statute is motivated by special needs beyond law enforcement, the <em>Steele </em>court proceeded to apply a traditional Fourth Amendment balancing test to assess the reasonableness of the search in light of the government\u2019s special needs. Id. at \u00b6 47-50. In so doing, the First District balanced the minimally intrusive nature of drawing blood, the reduced expectation of privacy possessed by convicted felons, and the special needs discussed above. After weighing these consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ations, the <em>Steele </em>court held that the search authorized by R.C. 2901.07 is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Id. Numerous state and federal courts have employed essentially the same analysis to uphold similar statutes. See <em>Roe v. Marcotte </em>(C.A.2, 1999), 193 F.3d 72, 79-82; <em>Green v. Berge </em>(C.A.7, 2004), 354 F.3d 675, 679; <em>United States v. Kinder </em>(C.A.10, 2003), 335 F.3d 1132, 1146; see, also, <em>Kincade, </em>supra, 379 F.3d at 830-831 (citing additional cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">{\u00b6 27} Other courts, however, have charted a different course in finding DNA statutes constitutional. These courts bypass the special-needs analysis in favor of a pure totality-of-the-eircumstances or traditional balancing-of-interests test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Regardless of whether the suspicionless searches mandated by DNA statutes are motivated by a law-enforcement purpose, these courts find them constitutional in light of the vastly reduced expectation of privacy enjoyed by a prisoner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whereas special needs of law enforcement may justify dispensing with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>requirement of probable cause or individualized suspicion in the case of searches involving ordinary citizens, courts adopting this second analytical approach have concluded that a prisoner\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy, particularly as to his identity, is a key fact that also obviates the need for individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">{\u00b6 28} In an early case assessing the constitutionality of compelled DNA testing, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals declined to apply the special-needs analysis discussed above and followed the pure totality-of-the-circumstances approach to assess reasonableness. In <em>Jones v. Murray </em>(C.A.4, 1992), 962 F.2d 302, the court perceived cases involving the rights of inmates as a category to which the usual Fourth Amendment requirements of probable cause or individualized suspicion do not apply. Id. at 307, fn. 2. Instead, the Fourth Circuit found that an inmate\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy eliminates the need for some quantum of individualized suspicion to justify drawing blood for DNA analysis. In support, the <em>Jones </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cWe have not been made aware of any case * * * establishing a per se Fourth Amendment requirement of probable cause, or even a lesser degree of individualized suspicion, when government officials conduct a limited search for the purpose of ascertaining and recording the identity of a person who is lawfully confined to prison. This is not surprising when we consider that probable cause had already supplied the basis for bringing the person within the criminal justice system. With the person\u2019s loss of liberty upon arrest comes the loss of at least some, if not all, rights to personal privacy otherwise protected by the Fourth Amendment. Thus, persons lawfully arrested on probable cause and detained lose a right of privacy from routine searches of the cavities of their bodies and their jail cells, as do convicted felons. Even probationers lose the protection of the Fourth Amendment with respect to their right to privacy against searches of their homes pursuant to an established program to ensure rehabilitation and security.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cSimilarly, when a suspect is arrested upon probable cause, his identification becomes a matter of legitimate state interest and he can hardly claim privacy in it. We accept this proposition because the identification of suspects is relevant not only to solving the crime for which the suspect is arrested, but also for maintaining a permanent record to solve other past and future crimes. This becomes readily apparent when we consider the universal approbation of \u201cbooking\u201d procedures that are followed for every suspect arrested for a felony, whether or not the proof of a particular suspect\u2019s crime will involve the use of fingerprint identification. Thus a tax evader is fingerprinted just the same as is a burglar. While we do not accept even this small level of intrusion for free persons without Fourth Amendment constraint, the same protections do not hold true for those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>lawfully confined to the custody of the state. As with fingerprinting, therefore, we find that the Fourth Amendment does not require an additional finding of individualized suspicion before blood can be taken from incarcerated felons for the purpose of identifying them.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 306-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">{\u00b6 31} After dispensing with the argument that individualized suspicion is a constitutionally mandated prerequisite to compelled DNA testing, the <em>Jones </em>court proceeded to conduct a traditional totality-of-the-circumstances or balancing test to determine the Fourth Amendment reasonableness of extracting and testing inmates\u2019 blood. Upon weighing the \u201cslight intrusion\u201d of a blood test against \u201cthe government\u2019s interest in preserving a permanent identification record of convicted felons for resolving past and future crimes,\u201d id., the Fourth Circuit struck the balance in favor of the government. In so doing, the court stressed the value of DNA as an identification tool for law enforcement:</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cIt is a well recognized aspect of criminal conduct that the perpetrator will take unusual steps to conceal not only his conduct, but also his identity. Disguises used while committing a crime may be supplemented or replaced by changed names and even changed physical features. Traditional methods of identification by photographs, historical records, and fingerprints often prove inadequate. The DNA, however, is claimed to be unique to each individual and cannot, within current scientific knowledge, be altered. The individuality of the DNA provides a dramatic new tool for the law enforcement effort to match suspects and criminal conduct. Even a suspect with altered physical features cannot escape the match that his DNA might make with a sample contained in a DNA bank, or left at the scene of a crime within samples of blood, skin, semen or hair follicles. The governmental justification for this form of identification, therefore, relies on no argument different in kind from that traditionally advanced for taking fingerprints and photographs, but with additional force because of the potentially greater precision of DNA sampling and matching methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThus, in the case of convicted felons who are in custody of the Commonwealth, we find that the minor intrusion caused by the taking of a blood sample is outweighed by Virginia\u2019s interest, as stated in the statute, in determining inmates\u2019 \u2018identification characteristics specific to the person\u2019 for improved law enforcement.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 962 F.2d at 307; see, also, <em>Landry v. Atty. Gen. </em>(1999), 429 Mass. 336, 350, 709 N.E.2d 1085 (\u201cWe are concerned in this case with convicted persons who have a low expectation of privacy in their identity, and a new, and validated, technology which can, by means of a properly performed minimally invasive test, obtain and preserve an extremely accurate record of identification. * * * The minor intrusion of a blood test is outweighed by the strong State interest in preserving a positive recorded identification of convicted persons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>{\u00b6 34} In the years since the Fourth Circuit decided <em>Jones, </em>numerous other courts have employed essentially the same analysis to find suspicionless DNA testing reasonable under the Fourth Amendment without regard to any \u201cspecial needs\u201d of the government. In <em>Groceman v. U.S. Dept. of Justice </em>(C.A.5, 2004), 354 F.3d 411, for example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals eschewed a special-needs analysis and upheld the federal DNA act under a traditional totality-of-the-circumstances approach, reasoning:</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cCourts may consider the totality of circumstances, including a person\u2019s status as an inmate or probationer, in determining whether his reasonable expectation of privacy is outweighed by other factors. Though, like fingerprinting, collection of a DNA sample for purposes of identification implicates the Fourth Amendment, persons incarcerated after conviction retain no constitutional privacy interest against their correct identification. The DNA Act, accordingly, does not violate the Fourth Amendment, and its application does not infringe these plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 413-414.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">{\u00b6 36} Similarly, both the Ninth and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals have relied on a pure totality-of-the-circumstances analysis to uphold compelled DNA profiling of convicted offenders without the need for individualized suspicion of wrongdoing and without regard for any special needs of the government beyond ordinary law enforcement. See <em>Kincade, </em>supra, 379 F.3d at 832-839;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Boling v. Romer </em>(C.A.10, 1996), 101 F.3d 1336, 1340; see, also, <em>Green, </em>supra, 354 F.3d at 679-680 (Easterbrook, J., concurring) (\u201cTesting prisoners\u2019 blood, urine, saliva, or hair for drugs is routine and does not require individual suspicion. DNA is present in all living cells, so it may be obtained from any of the blood or other samples regularly collected from prisoners. * * * [L]ike other specimens the inmates\u2019 blood may be put to multiple uses, including preservation of DNA, for the fourth amendment does not control how properly collected information is deployed. Use of DNA is in this respect no different from use of a fingerprint; only the method of obtaining the information differs, and for prisoners that is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>distinction without importance\u201d). A number of state and federal courts nationwide are in accord with the foregoing reasoning. See <em>Kincade, </em>379 F.3d at 831 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">{\u00b6 37} Having reviewed the two competing analytical approaches to assessing the constitutionality of DNA-testing statutes, we cast our lot with those courts employing a straight totahty-of-the-circumstances or balancing-of-interests approach without regard to whether R.C. 2901.07 serves some special need beyond normal law enforcement. While not precluding the possibility that Ohio\u2019s statute might survive scrutiny under the special-needs doctrine, we agree with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 recent conclusion that reliance on a pure totality-of-theeircumstances reasonableness analysis to uphold mandatory DNA testing of convicted offenders \u201cboth comports with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent precedents and resolves this appeal in concert with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Kincade, </em>supra, 379 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">{\u00b6 38} But regardless of whether we interpret R.C. 2901.07 as serving some special need distinct from ordinary law enforcement, as the trial court did, or whether we perceive the statute as furthering a traditional law-enforcement objective, the conclusion is the same: the compelled extraction of Cremeans\u2019s blood or saliva for DNA analysis does not violate his Fourth Amendment rights. Under the special-needs approach, a key consideration in the Fourth Amendment balancing of interests is a finding that the DNA analysis is being conducted primarily for non-law-enforcement purposes. On the other hand, under the pure totality-of-the-circumstances approach that we favor, an inmate\u2019s reduced expectation of privacy is a paramount consideration when balancing competing interests to find the DNA testing reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">{\u00b6 39} As one appellate court astutely has observed, however, \u201c[rjegardless of which analytic approach we follow, we see a common thread that leads to the conclusion the Fourth Amendment is not offended by the statute. Incarcerated felons have a substantially diminished expectation of privacy. The testing, by needle or swab, is minimally intrusive. The State is not investigating a particular or specific crime. It is conducting a technologically accurate identification procedure that will enhance the administration of justice \u2014 reaching back to solve past crimes and extending forward to identify future offenders, convicting the guilty and acquitting the innocent.\u201d <em>Peppers, </em>supra, 352 Ill.App.3d at 1007, 288 Ill.Dec. 502, 817 N.E.2d 1152. We agree with this assessment. Consequently, based on the reasoning and citation of authority set forth above, we hold that R.C. 2901.07, which requires DNA testing of offenders sentenced to incarceration, does not violate Cremeans\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. As a result, the trial court did not err in overruling his motion to suppress the DNA results from his 1998 blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>{\u00b6 40} Cremeans\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-5\">Wolff and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\">. As noted above, the 1998 blood sample was taken while Cremeans remained incarcerated on unrelated charges. The trial court played no part in the taking of that blood sample for DNA testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-8\">. The test also appears to have been authorized by R.C. 2317.47, which provides: \"Whenever it is relevant in a civil or criminal action or proceeding to determine the * * * identity of any person, the trial court on motion shall order any party to the action and any person involved in the controversy or proceeding to submit to one or more blood-grouping tests.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b42-9\">. The only courts to declare such statutes unconstitutional are the Eastern District of California in <em>United States v. Miles </em>(E.D.Cal.2002), 228 F.Supp.2d 1130, and the Ninth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Court of Appeals in <em>United States v. Kincade </em>(2003), 345 F.3d 1095. We note, however, that the Ninth Circuit subsequently vacated the panel ruling in <em>Kincade </em>and issued an en banc decision finding the federal DNA-collection statute constitutional, thereby effectively overruling <em>Miles </em>as well. See <em>United States v. Kincade </em>(C.A.9, 2004), 379 F.3d 813 (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\">. In <em>Steele, </em>the First District Court of Appeals interpreted the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in <em>Edmond </em>and <em>Ferguson </em>as mandating a two-part inquiry to determine whether a DNA statute survives review under the Fourth Amendment. According to the First District, a court first must apply the special-needs doctrine and determine whether the statute satisfies a non-law-enforcement purpose. Only if so may it then proceed to determine whether the compelled testing is reasonable under a traditional Fourth Amendment balancing approach. <em>Steele, </em>supra, 155 Ohio App.3d 659, 2003-Ohio-7103, 802 N.E.2d 1127, at \u00b6 34, 40. As we will discuss more fully infra, however, numerous courts have reviewed DNA statutes, post <em>Edmond </em>and <em>Ferguson, </em>under a pure totality-of-the circumstances or balancing test without regard to any \"special needs\u201d of the government. We find nothing in <em>Edmond </em>or <em>Ferguson </em>to preclude such an approach. As one federal court recently recognized: \"It is dubious logic to suggest that by applying the special needs test to the particular searches in <em>Edmond </em>and <em>Ferguson, </em>the Supreme Court implied that it should be used to analyze <em>all </em>searches. This is particularly true * * * with convicted felons currently serving out their terms. At best <em>Edmond </em>and <em>Ferguson </em>can be read to suggest that with respect to collecting DNA samples from the general population, one might have to show some special need. As to prisoners who have little expectation of privacy, however, there is no reason why such a showing is required.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Nicholas v. Goord </em>(June 24, 2004), S.D.N.Y. No. 01Civ.7891(RCC)(GWG), 2004 WL 1432533; see, also, <em>Kineade, </em>supra, at 832 (\"As we have stressed, neither <em>Edmond </em>nor <em>Ferguson </em>condemns suspicionless searches of conditional releasees in the absence of a demonstrable 'special need' apart from law enforcement. Indeed, <em>Ferguson </em>distinguished itself from cases addressing the constitutionality of parole and probation searches \u2014 thus recognizing a constitutionally significant distinction between searches of conditional releasees and searches of the general public, and laying the framework for a jurisprudentially sound analytic division between these two classes of suspicionless searches\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\">. Some courts also extend this reasoning to probationers and parolees. In <em>Kincade, </em>supra, 379 F.3d at 834-835, for example, the Ninth Circuit concluded that a conditional releasee's \"severely constricted expectations of privacy relative to the general citizemy\u201d and \"the government\u2019s concomitantly greater interest in closely monitoring and supervising conditional releasees, is in turn sufficient to sustain suspicionless searches of [a releasee\u2019s] person and property even in the absence of some non-law enforcement 'special need\u2019 \u2014 at least where such searches meet the Fourth Amendment touchstone of reasonableness as gauged by the totality of the circumstances.\" As applied to individuals such as Cremeans, who were incarcerated when their blood was drawn for DNA testing, the foregoing logic has even more force because inmates possess fewer privacy rights than probationers or parolees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b50-7\">. In <em>Kincade, </em>the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the U.S. Supreme Court has never decided whether suspicionless, law-enforcement-oriented searches of prisoners, probationers, or parolees violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>Kincade, </em>supra, 379 F.3d at 830. The <em>Kincade </em>court then drew upon and extended the reasoning of <em>United States v. Knights </em>(2001), 534 U.S. 112, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497, wherein the court had upheld a law-enforcement oriented search of a probationer based on mere \"reasonable suspicion\u201d of criminal activity. In its ruling, the <em>Knights </em>court also had recognized the possibility that a conditional releasee's reasonable expectation of privacy might be so diminished \"that a search by a law enforcement officer without any individualized suspicion would have satisfied the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 120, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497, fn. 6. Having found that the search in <em>Knights </em>was supported by reasonable suspicion, the court had declined to resolve this issue. In <em>Kincade, </em>however, the Ninth Circuit did address this issue in the context of the federal DNA statute and found that the suspicionless searches mandated by the statute were constitutional under a traditional Fourth Amendment balancing test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
