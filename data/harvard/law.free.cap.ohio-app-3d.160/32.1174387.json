Because we conclude that the record fails to support the trial court\u2019s decision, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Dawn K., and her husband, Robert K., separated in early 2001 after a number of years of marriage. In August 2001, appellant left her five children with a friend, Michael Metzger, while, according to appellant, she drove a friend to another town. Appellant testified that, while she was gone, her car broke down and she could not return as anticipated. Whatever the case, when appellant had not returned for several days, Metzger contacted Robert K., who in turn notified appellee, Williams County Department of Job and Family Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">{\u00b6 3} On August 27, 2001, appellee took custody of the children. Caseworkers found the children unfed, unclean, and with minor bruises. According to the testimony of appellee\u2019s caseworker supervisor, the children alleged that Metzger \u201cwas hurting them and leaving them, leaving bruises.\u201d Although appellant denied recollection of being informed of this, the supervisor testified that she told appellant of the children saying that Metzger \u201cwasn\u2019t very nice to them.\u201d On cross-examination, the supervisor conceded that the agency had not pursued charges against Metzger because what was alleged was \u201cmistreatment, not abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">{\u00b6 4} All five children remained with appellee until May 2002, at which point legal custody was transferred to appellant\u2019s husband, Robert K. Appellee retained protective supervision of the five until July 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">{\u00b6 5} At some point not clear from the record, genetic testing revealed that Brysten Allen K., now eight, and Alexis Kaye K., now five, were not the biological children of Robert K. Perhaps because of this, in the fall of 2002, when Robert K. relocated to Florida, he left these two children and a 12-year-old daughter with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">{\u00b6 6} In late November 2002, appellant again left Alexis and Brysten<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with Michael Metzger for a period of several days. On December 5, 2002, Metzger called appellee, advising that he no longer wished to care for the children and that he did not know appellant\u2019s whereabouts. Appellee took emergency custody of the children and filed a complaint alleging that the children were neglected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>On January 14, 2003, appellant consented to a finding of neglect. Appellee was awarded temporary custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">{\u00b6 7} Appellee initially filed a case plan seeking termination of parental rights. After the consent finding, however, it modified its plan with a goal of reunification of the family. To accomplish this, appellant was tasked to (1) complete parenting classes, (2) obtain stable employment, (3) obtain stable housing, and (4) resolve legal problems relating to bad-check convictions in Bryan and Defiance Municipal Courts. A second amended case plan later added a psychological evaluation and counseling, if recommended, for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant completed her parenting classes and, although delayed, eventually completed the psychological evaluation. She was less successful in obtaining steady employment or consistent housing. Her problems with the Bryan and Defiance Municipal Courts continued throughout the hearings on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">{\u00b6 9} On December 1, 2003, appellee moved for permanent custody. The matter proceeded to a four-day trial, beginning on April 27, 2004, and concluding on August 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">{\u00b6 10} At trial, the social worker assigned to appellant\u2019s case testified that permanent custody of the children was being sought, not because of a concern for appellant\u2019s parenting skills or her bond with the children, but because appellant\u2019s inability to obtain and keep employment negated her ability to provide an adequate home for the children. Indeed, for most of the period during which the agency dealt with appellant she was functionally homeless, living with friends for brief periods. The social worker also noted that appellant was unreliable at documenting her job search and inconsistent in keeping appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">{\u00b6 11} In July 2003, nearly six months after evaluation was indicated in the case plan, appellant was evaluated by a psychologist. The psychologist testified that appellant had a generalized anxiety disorder, which should be easily treatable with medication and counseling. Appellant also was diagnosed with a personality disorder with a combination of dependent, narcissistic, and antisocial traits. The psychologist testified that such traits are more difficult to treat, requiring more concentrated, long-term therapy. The psychologist recommended that appellant receive counseling and therapy to treat these disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant testified on her own behalf, explaining that when her then husband moved to Florida, he left her with three children and no job. She testified that she was soon unable to pay the rent on the house in which she and the children were living and had to move in with friends. When her car broke down she no longer had her own transportation and was forced to rely on friends to take her to work when she did find a job. Once the children were taken from her, the aid she received for them also stopped. Because much of the time while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the case plan was proceeding, she lived in Defiance County, she was ineligible for housing assistance in Williams County. Moreover, because of her failure to timely provide documents to the Defiance County authorities, she was sanctioned with a 90-day loss of benefits for herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">{\u00b6 13} The result of all this was that during the pendency of the case, appellant worked at more than ten jobs and lived in nearly a dozen places. Additionally, appellant was convicted of passing bad checks in both Bryan and Defiance. When she did not make the court-ordered payments for restitution and fines, she was arrested and incarcerated for nearly three weeks while the trial in this matter was proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">{\u00b6 14} At the conclusion of the trial, the court concluded that due to appellant\u2019s \u201cunstable behavior * * *, sporadic employment, multitude of residences, history of incarceration and untreated mental health conditions, it is unlikely that the children could return to the mother\u2019s custody within a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">{\u00b6 15} The court found that appellee had proven the factors enumerated in R. C. 2151.414(E)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (12), terminated appellant\u2019s parental rights, and granted permanent custody of Alexis and Brysten to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">{\u00b6 16} From this judgment, appellant now brings this appeal, setting forth the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cI. The trial court erred in granting permanent custody as the decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA. The county failed to show a reasonable good faith effort to reunify the children with parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cB. The county failed to show the children could not be reunified with appellant within any reasonable amount of time, specifically failing to show appellant\u2019s conditions creating dependency would continue in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cII. The trial court erred in not causing the children\u2019s wishes to be determined and considered as part of its decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">{\u00b6 21} A parent\u2019s rights to conceive and rear his or her child have been \u201cdeemed \u2018essential,\u2019 <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923), \u2018basic civil rights of man,\u2019 <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S. Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942), and \u2018[r]ights far more precious * * * than property rights.\u2019 <em>May v. Anderson, </em>345 U.S. 528, 533, 73 S.Ct. 840, 97 L.Ed. 1221 (1953). \u2018It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.\u2019 <em>Prince v. Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944).\u201d <em>Stanley v. Illinois </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551. The inviolability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>parent-child relationship finds protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteen Amendment, <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. at 541, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655; <em>Santosky v. Kramer </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599, and the Ninth Amendment, <em>Griswold v. Connecticut </em>(1965), 381 U.S. 479, 496, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (Goldberg, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">{\u00b6 22} Moreover, \u201c[t]he law does not contemplate the taking of children from their parents because they can be better provided for by foster parents or adoptive parents due to greater affluency.\u201d <em>In re Lay </em>(1987), 43 Ohio App.3d 78, 82, 539 N.E.2d 664, citing <em>In re Konneker </em>(1929), 30 Ohio App. 502, 511, 165 N.E. 850. Only where there is a \u201cdemonstrated incapacity or something akin to criminal neglect that the law is justified in interfering with the natural relations of parent and child.\u201d <em>Konneker, </em>30 Ohio App. at 511, 165 N.E. 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">{\u00b6 23} In Ohio, it has long been held that parents who are suitable persons maintain a paramount right to custody of their minor children. <em>Clark v. Bayer </em>(1877), 32 Ohio St. 299, 310; <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 97, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047; <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 157, 556 N.E.2d 1169. The state may not award permanent custody of a child absent a predicate finding that the child\u2019s natural parents are unsuitable. <em>In re Perales, </em>supra, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">{\u00b6 24} The Ohio General Assembly most recently has defined parental unfitness for a child who is not abandoned or orphaned as a finding that the child \u201ccannot be placed with either of the child\u2019s parents within a reasonable time or should not be placed with the child\u2019s parents.\u201d R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a). To enter such a finding, the court must conclude that the evidence presented clearly and convincingly discloses that the parent in question is unsuitable for one of the reasons articulated in R.C. 2151.414(E). <em>In re William S. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 95, 661 N.E.2d 738, syllabus. Because the right to raise and nurture one\u2019s child is so basic, statutory conditions which defeat that right must be strictly construed. <em>In re Cunningham </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 100, 105, 13 O.O.3d 78, 391 N.E .2d 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">I. MANIFEST WEIGHT</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">{\u00b6 25} In her first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court\u2019s determination to terminate her parental rights was against the manifest weight of the evidence, in that (1) appellee failed to show a reasonable good faith effort to reunify the family and (2) the finding that the children cannot now or should not be reunited with appellant was unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>{\u00b6 26} In a termination-of-parental-rights proceeding, all of the court\u2019s findings must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. R.C. 2151.414(E). The court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights, however, will not be overturned as against the manifest weight of the evidence if the record contains competent, credible evidence by which the court could have formed a firm belief or conviction that the essential statutory elements for a termination of parental rights have been established. <em>In re Forrest S. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 338, 345, 657 N.E.2d 307; <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">{\u00b6 27} Here, the trial court concluded that appellee had properly proved the elements of R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (12).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 2151.414(E) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(E) In determining * * * whether a child cannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable period of time or should not be placed with the parents, the court shall consider all relevant evidence. If the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence * * * that one or more of the following exist as to each of the child\u2019s parents, the court shall enter a finding that the child cannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable time or should not be placed with either parent:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(1) Following the placement of the child outside the child\u2019s home and notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to be placed outside the home, the parent has failed continuously and repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be placed outside the child\u2019s home. In determining whether the parents have substantially remedied those conditions, the court shall consider parental utilization of medical, psychiatric, psychological, and other social and rehabilitative services and material resources that were made available to the parents for the purpose of changing parental conduct to allow them to resume and maintain parental duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(2) Chronic mental illness, chronic emotional illness, mental retardation, physical disability, or chemical dependency of the parent that is so severe that it makes the parent unable to provide an adequate permanent home for the child at the present time and, as anticipated, within one year after the court holds the [permanent custody hearing];</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(3) The parent committed any abuse * * * against the child, caused the child to suffer any neglect * * *, or allowed the child to suffer any neglect * * * between the date that the original complaint alleging abuse or neglect was filed and the date of the filing of the motion for permanent custody;</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>{\u00b6 33} \u201c(4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the child by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child when able to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness to provide an adequate permanent home for the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(12) The parent is incarcerated at the time of the filing of the motion for permanent custody or the dispositional hearing of the child and will not be available to care for the child for at least eighteen months after the filing of the motion for permanent custody or the dispositional hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant insists in the first part of her first assignment of error that appellee failed to prove a \u201creasonable good faith effort to reunify\u201d appellant and these children. The only relevant section of R.C. 2151.414 to which appellee\u2019s efforts are at issue is section (E)(1). That section tasks a children services agency responsible for the removal of a child from his or her home with providing \u201creasonable case planning\u201d and exerting \u201cdiligent efforts\u201d to help a parent remedy the problem causing the child\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">{\u00b6 37} Appellant certainly has an argument with respect to the \u201cdiligent efforts\u201d portion of this equation. The initial case plan called for appellee to schedule a psychological evaluation for appellant by the end of February. The agency did not arrange for a psychological evaluation until nearly five months later, at a point at which it had already determined to seek permanent custody. Moreover, appellee failed to take any action to implement the psychologist\u2019s recommendations after the evaluation, another objective in the case plan. The agency did schedule parenting classes for appellant, which she successfully completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">{\u00b6 38} The remainder of the case plan is directed to appellant becoming financially stable. Here the story becomes almost Kafkaesque: Because appellant had no money she could not obtain reliable transportation. Without reliable transportation, appellant could not get or keep employment. Because she could not keep employment, she had no money to get transportation. Because appellant lived, for the most part, in Defiance County, housing assistance in Williams County, according to appellee, was unavailable. After appellee removed the children, appellant was no longer eligible for assistance for them and could not rely on that to help support a household. Appellant herself was cut off from direct assistance in Defiance County, apparently as a sanction for failure to timely file documents there. During this period, appellant was convicted of passing bad checks in Defiance and Bryan and ordered to pay restitution, fines, and costs. Her failure to make timely payments in these court matters resulted in her arrest and incarceration for 18 days during the pendency of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>{\u00b6 39} Appellee\u2019s response to all of this seems to have been to order appellant to find a job and suitable housing and, at one point, pay $90 so that appellant could take a state test to qualify as a nursing assistant.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">{\u00b6 40} Even assuming that appellee\u2019s circumscribed compliance with its own case plan constituted the statutorily imposed \u201cdiligent efforts,\u201d there is still a problem with the trial court\u2019s R.C. 2151.414(E)(1) finding. Alexis and Brysten were removed from appellant\u2019s home when she left them with Michael Metzger and he tired of caring for them. There is conflicting testimony between appellant\u2019s social worker and the social worker\u2019s supervisor as to whether Metzger had previously abused the children and whether appellant was ever so informed. Nevertheless, appellee concluded that, given Metzger\u2019s prior volatility, to again entrust children to him was a poor parenting decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">{\u00b6 41} The portions of appellee\u2019s case plan directed to this issue offer as an aspirational goal that appellant will learn to \u201cprotect her children from all harm and will not expose them to offenders who have hurt them in the past.\u201d The action plan to meet this goal was parenting classes for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">{\u00b6 42} It is undisputed that appellant successfully completed parenting classes. Since the children were never returned to her custody, a practical test of appellant\u2019s skill never occurred. Without an opportunity for a practical application of the only skills appellee deemed necessary to remediate the condition prompting the children\u2019s removal, we fail to see clear and convincing evidence that appellant did not remedy the conditions that prompted the children\u2019s removal from the home. Accordingly, the R.C. 2151.414(E)(1) element was not proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">{\u00b6 43} Notwithstanding our conclusion that the R.C. 2151.414(E)(1) finding is not supported, the trial court should be affirmed if any of the other statutory predicate findings is supported by the evidence. <em>In re William S., </em>supra, 75 Ohio St.3d 95, 661 N.E.2d 738; <em>In re Alyssa Nicole C., </em>153 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 2003-Ohio-2673, 790 N.E.2d 803, at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">{\u00b6 44} A finding of chronic mental or emotional illness, pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E)(2), is also unsupported. Although the evaluating psychologist testified that appellant suffered from a \u201cgeneralized anxiety disorder\u201d and a personality disorder, there was no evidence in the record that there is a causative relationship between these conditions and appellant\u2019s difficulty in maintaining an adequate home. Indeed, the psychologist testified that appellant\u2019s anxiety was easily treatable with medication. The personality disorder, according to the psychologist, was more difficult to treat, requiring a minimum of a year of therapy. Appellee did not elicit an opinion from the psychologist as to whether appellant\u2019s disorders were so severe as to make her unable to provide a home for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the children. It was not requested that appellant be evaluated for her parenting skills. Absent testimony that appellant\u2019s condition was chronic or severe and without an offered opinion that appellant could not provide an adequate home within a year, an R.C. 2151.414(E)(2) finding is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">{\u00b6 45} An R.C. 2151.414(E)(3) finding is unsupported because the children were never again in appellant\u2019s custody after the original neglect complaint in this matter. Appellee would have us look to the time the children were first taken from Michael Metzger, but that record is not in evidence in this case. The only complaint before the trial court was the one filed December 6, 2002. Since appellant never had custody of the children after that date, (E)(3) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">{\u00b6 46} Concerning R.C. 2151.414(E)(4), there is no allegation that appellant failed to visit or communicate with the children. Neither is there a suggestion that appellant was unwilling to make an adequate home for the children: unable, perhaps, but not unwilling. Inability to provide a home does not satisfy the statute. <em>In re William S., </em>supra, 75 Ohio St.3d at 100, 661 N.E.2d 738. Appellee did present evidence that appellant frequently failed to meet her child-support obligation, but presented no evidence to suggest that appellant was able to pay child support during this time. The burden is on the party seeking permanent custody to prove each element of its case by clear and convincing evidence. A parent\u2019s ability to provide support is an essential element of R.C. 2151.414(E)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">{\u00b6 47} Remaining is the finding under R.C. 2151.414(E)(12) that the parent is incarcerated at the time of filing or at the dispositional hearing and will not be available to care for the child for at least 18 months. We do not perceive \u201cincarcerated\u201d as used in this section to encompass only a portion of the dispositional hearing. The import of this section clearly is that a parent is jailed at the time of the motion or dispositional hearing and will not be let free for at least 18 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">{\u00b6 48} The dispositional hearing in this matter extended from April until late August 2003. Part of the time appellant was jailed for violating the terms of restitution on her bad-check charges. There was no testimony, however, that appellant would be rearrested or would continue to be locked up for any amount of time in the future, let alone 18 months. Consequently, this finding also fails for want of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">{\u00b6 49} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">II. GUARDIAN AD LITEM</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">{\u00b6 50} Ordinarily, having determined that a judgment should be reversed, we would not address remaining assignments of error. In this matter, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>because we conclude that appellant\u2019s second assignment of error constitutes an independent ground for reversal, we shall discuss this assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant couches this assignment of error in terms of a trial court failure to consider the children\u2019s wishes in reaching its conclusion. The issue arises because the court-appointed guardian ad litem testified that in fashioning his report, he did not ask the children their wishes. Indeed, the guardian could not recall if he had ever interviewed the children during the pendency of this case. In any event, the guardian suggested, the children were too immature to hold an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">{\u00b6 52} At trial, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that since the guardian failed to take into account the children\u2019s wishes, he had failed his statutory duty under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) and (2). We see a more fundamental problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">{\u00b6 53} Juv.R. 4(A) provides that children who are the subject of a juvenile proceeding, including a permanent-custody action, have a right to counsel. It is the trial court\u2019s obligation to ensure that this right is not violated. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">{\u00b6 54} The document appointing the guardian ad litem is not in the case file. Since no separate counsel for the children appeared during the dispositional hearing, we presume that the guardian assumed the dual roles of guardian and counsel for the children. This is permissible. Juv.R. 4(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">{\u00b6 55} As we have previously noted, however, these two roles can be distinct and sometimes conflicting. The guardian ad litem is to investigate the situation of his ward and urge the court to adopt the position which the guardian ad litem believes is in the ward\u2019s best interests. <em>In re Stacey S. </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 503, 514, 737 N.E.2d 92, citing <em>In re Howard </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 201, 206, 695 N.E.2d 1. The attorney is spokesperson for the ward\u2019s wishes and is ethically bound to zealously advance those wishes within the bounds of the law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">{\u00b6 56} Ordinarily, the court should inquire as to whether a conflict in these roles exist. <em>In re Duncan/Walker </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 841, 845, 673 N.E.2d 217. During trial, any suggestion that a conflict exists should prompt an inquiry. <em>In re Stacey S., </em>supra, 136 Ohio App.3d 503, 737 N.E.2d 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">{\u00b6 57} Here, there was unrefuted testimony that, whatever other problems appellant may have encountered, she and the children were bonded. This would ordinarily suggest that the children wished to stay with their mother. This is a position antithetical to the position advanced by the guardian ad litem in his report. Moreover, when the guardian testified that he had never inquired as to this then seven-year-old\u2019s and this then four-year-old\u2019s wishes, the court had an obligation to ascertain whether the children were being properly represented. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Absent such an inquiry, it would seem that the children were denied proper legal representation during these proceedings. The denial of counsel for a child during the dispositional hearing of a termination-of-parental-rights proceeding is plain error. <em>In re Alyssa Nicole C., </em>supra, 153 Ohio App.3d at 17-19, 2003-Ohio-2673, 790 N.E.2d 803, at \u00b6 37-40. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">III. \u201cTWELVE OF TWENTY-TWO\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">{\u00b6 58} Although the trial court did not invoke the provisions of R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) in this matter, appellee repeatedly urged it to do so. This section seems to circumvent a need for a parental-fitness analysis by declaring that permanent custody may be granted to children\u2019s services agency if \u201c[t]he child has been in the temporary custody * * * for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">{\u00b6 59} As we have previously noted, this provision on its face may not survive the stringent due process scrutiny to which termination-of-parental-rights cases are subjected. <em>In re Delfino L. M., </em>6th Dist. No. L-04-1010, 2005-Ohio-320, 2005 WL 195488, at \u00b6 24; see, also, <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, 679 N.E.2d 680; <em>In re C.W., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 163, 167, 2004-Ohio-6411, 818 N.E.2d 1176, at \u00b6 23, citing <em>In re Smith </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 1, 16, 601 N.E.2d 45. Moreover, as applied to this party, the statute\u2019s application would seem even more egregious, as it appears that the reason for much of the time these children have been in appellee\u2019s custody was appellee\u2019s failure for a period of several months to follow its own case plan in psychologically evaluating appellant and implementing the psychologist\u2019s recommendations. In our view, the trial court\u2019s decision to decline to apply R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) in this matter was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">{\u00b6 60} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Williams County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is reversed. This matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Costs to appellee pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b83-10\">Handwork and Pietrykowski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-10\">.
