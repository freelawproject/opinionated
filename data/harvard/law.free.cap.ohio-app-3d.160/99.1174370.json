In his decision, the magistrate found that (1) Dr. Snell\u2019s C-84 does not constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d upon which the commission could rely because the C-84 was inconsistent with Dr. Snell\u2019s examination notes and (2) Dr. Smith\u2019s report could provide some evidence supporting a TTD award if, on remand to the commission, the claimant presented new evidence that Dr. Smith would certify a specific period of TTD compensation for the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">{\u00b6 3} Relator has filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, arguing that the magistrate erred in recommending that this case be returned to the commission to take additional evidence from Dr. Smith as to the period of TTD compensation. Respondent commission has also filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, arguing that the magistrate erred in concluding that Dr. Snell\u2019s C-84 did not constitute evidence supporting the commission\u2019s TTD award and that it was error to order the commission to \u201ctake additional evidence from Dr. Smith.\u201d We will address respondent\u2019s objections first.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">{\u00b6 4} Contrary to the respondent\u2019s contention, Dr. Snell\u2019s C-84 is not evidence upon which the commission could rely because the C-84 is inconsistent with Dr. Snell\u2019s examination notes. Recognizing this inconsistency does not require the weighing of evidence as respondent argues. We give no greater weight to either the C-84 or the examination notes. We simply find, as did the magistrate, that they relate to the same examination and that they are inconsistent. The fact that the inconsistency arises from statements contained in two different documents rather than in one report is not significant. Again, it is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>that both documents were prepared by Dr. Snell and relate to the same physical examinations. As the magistrate notes, the same rationale was applied in <em>State ex rel. M. Weingold &amp; Co. v. Indus. Comm., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-5353, 776 N.E.2d 69, which involved substantial inconsistencies between two C-84s arising from the same examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">{\u00b6 5} Both relator and respondent object to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that we issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission \u201cto take additional evidence from Dr. Smith as to the period of temporary total disability.\u201d We agree with relator and respondent that such an order would be inappropriate under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">{\u00b6 6} The claimant had the opportunity to present evidence supporting her request for TTD compensation. Based upon the evidence presented, the commission made its determination. The magistrate found that the evidence relied upon by the commission was insufficient to support the award. For the reasons previously noted, Dr. Snell\u2019s C-84 was not evidence upon which the commission could rely because it conflicted with his office notes. It is unclear whether the commission relied upon Dr. Smith\u2019s report. Regardless of whether the commission relied upon Dr. Smith\u2019s report, the report is not sufficient to support an award of TTD compensation. Therefore, there simply is insufficient evidence to support an award of TTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">{\u00b6 7} Following an independent review of this matter, we adopt the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact, but only those portions of his conclusions of law that address Dr. Snell\u2019s report. We sustain the objections of relator and the commission with respect to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that we return this matter to the commission to take additional evidence from Dr. Smith. We further issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its order awarding TTD compensation beginning June 12, 2002, and to enter a new order denying said compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Objections sustained in part and overruled in part; writ of mandamus granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-9\">Brown, P.J., and Lazarus, J., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\n<em>APPENDIX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">MAGISTRATE\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">IN MANDAMUS</p>\n<p id=\"Az9\">Kenneth W. Macke, Magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">{\u00b6 8} In this original action, relator, Genuine Parts Company, requests a writ of mandamus ordering respondent Industrial Commission of Ohio to vacate its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>order awarding temporary total disability (\u201cTTD\u201d) compensation beginning June 12, 2002, to respondent Terri Pool-Snodgrass and to enter an order denying compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>Findings of Fact:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 9} 1. On January 10, 1998, Terri Pool-Snodgrass (\u201cclaimant\u201d) sustained an industrial injury while employed with relator, a self-insured employer under Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws. The industrial claim was initially allowed for \u201clumbosacral sprain\u201d and disallowed for \u201cL5-S1 bulging disc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">{\u00b6 10} 2. In July 2002, claimant moved for an additional claim allowance. In support, claimant submitted a report dated July 10, 2002, from her attending physician, Edward D. Snell, M.D. In the report, Dr. Snell wrote: \u201cThe resultant MRI revealed a disc bulge and degenerative disc disease. The degenerative disc disease was aggravated by the 1/10/98 incident.\u201d Claimant also moved for TTD compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">{\u00b6 11} 3. Claimant\u2019s motion prompted relator to have claimant examined by an orthopedic surgeon, David W. Smith, D.O., who had previously examined claimant on May 11, 2000. Dr. Smith examined claimant on August 13, 2002 and issued a report stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">Today, she reports low back pain with any repetitive motion to the low back as in that work conducted at Napa Auto Parts. She last worked 6/11/2002. She is receiving no treatment of any kind at this time because of claim difficulties. She is able to get nothing approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\"><em>RECORD REVIEW: </em>I have reviewed all of the records provided both for this visit and last and have compared them carefully. Very definite differences are noted. I note especially the records of Dr. Edward Snell who has cared for her over the past four or five years and has chronologically noted the changes in her condition. The issue with this visit is the claimant\u2019s motion to have her claim additionally allowed for aggravation of preexisting degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine and payment for temporary total compensation due to her disability beginning 6/9/2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\"><em>OPINIONS: </em>Based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty and probability, based on my examination of the claimant on two occasions, based on my review of the medical records provided including comparative MRIs and current conventional lumbar spine x-rays and based on my review of all of the prior medical records provided to me, I hold the following professional medical opinions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">1. This claimant has not yet reached maximum medical improvement. As a matter of fact, her condition is deteriorating as noted on my examination today <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>with significant deterioration in strength and neurological changes in the right lower extremity. Note the objective and subjective findings in my examination report today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">2. Based on significant changes in the MRI report from near the time of injury in 1998 and currently, there was definite aggravation of preexisting degenerative disc disease involving the lower lumbar spine apparently brought on by the industrial injury of 1/10/98. A certain amount of this would be as a result of natural aging as well. However, there has been a very significant difference in the two MRIs which would tend to support aggravation by injury. I appreciate the fact that aggravation is defined as something having a real adverse effect on the preexisting condition. I believe that this requirement has been met for the condition to be compensable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">3. I believe that the restrictions for her lumbar spine are due in effect to the aggravation of the degenerative disc disease lumbosacral spine. In this case, we are not talking, about returning to work but getting a definitive evaluation by a spine surgeon, whether orthopedic or neurosurgical. Her condition will no longer respond to nonsurgical measures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">4. The condition described as aggravation of preexisting degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine has not resolved and needs surgical attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">5. Regarding maximum medical improvement, I believe that she has reached maximum medical improvement as far as conservative treatment is concerned. She is not likely to respond to other physical measures earlier described from this point forth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">{\u00b6 12} 4. Following a November 26, 2002 hearing before a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d), the claim was additionally allowed for \u201caggravation of pre-existing degenerative disc disease at L5-S1,\u201d based in part upon the reports from Drs. Snell and Smith. The SHO\u2019s order of November 26, 2002 recognizes that claimant withdrew her request for TTD compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">{\u00b6 13} 5. In the meantime, on June 18, 2002, claimant was examined by Dr. Snell. In his office note of June 18, 2002, Dr. Snell wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">I saw her about two years ago on 4/13/00. * * * [S]ince the beginning of [M]ay, just recently, she started having severe exacerbation of her back pain, to the point where it radiates down into her thighs, more on the right than the left. It interferes with her activities of daily living. It interferes with her home life and interferes with her work. She has continued to work full time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-12\"><em>ASSESSMENT: </em>L5-S1 disc bulge. Probably herniation at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">{\u00b6 14} 6. On June 27, 2002, claimant again was examined by Dr. Snell. In his office note of June 27, 2002, Dr. Snell wrote: \u201cHer exam is essentially unchanged. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>She has L5-S1 and L4-5 disc bulge with DDD and possibly a herniation at this point with continuing problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 15} 7. On May 29, 2003, some 11 months following the June 27, 2002 examination, Dr. Snell filled out and signed a C-84 on which he certified a period of temporary total disability beginning \u201c5/2002\u201d to an estimated return-to-work date of January 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">{\u00b6 16} Dr. Snell failed to indicate on the C-84 the date of the last examination as the form requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 17} The C-84 form asks the attending physician to \u201c[l]ist ICD-9 Codes with narrative diagnosis(es) for allowed conditions being treated which prevent return to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">{\u00b6 18} In response to the above query, Dr. Snell wrote \u201clumbosacral sprain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">{\u00b6 19} The C-84 form asks the attending physician to \u201c[l]ist ICD-9 Codes with narrative diagnosis(es) for other allowed conditions being treated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">{\u00b6 20} In response to the above query, Dr. Snell wrote \u201caggravation of pre existing degenerative disc disease L5-S1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">{\u00b6 21} 8. Following a November 13, 2003 hearing, a district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) issued an order awarding TTD compensation beginning June 12, 2002. Relator administratively appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">{\u00b6 22} 9. On December 11, 2003, claimant was again examined by Dr. Snell. In his office note of December 11, 2003, Dr. Snell wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-13\">DATE: 12/11/03</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">SUBJECTIVE: This is a patient who comes in on 12/11/03. She is moving a little bit better, does not do anything to aggravate back pain. The right calf still has a dull sensation to it, it become[s] immobile if the pain starts significantly bad. She has an L5-S1 herniation. She is on a multivitamin, Diovan, Nexium, and birth control, in addition to her Zoloft and Vicodin. She has a herniation at L5-S1 which elicits L5-S1 nerve root compression at the outlet of her lumbosacral spine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-15\">OBJECTIVE: On exam today she is in no active distress. Blood pressure 120/70, pulse 89, respirations 16 and afebrile. Weight is 243 lbs. <em>Exam of the low back </em>reveals tenderness to palpation along the paralumbar sacral region, increased with forward flexion. Positive straight leg raise on the right at about 40 degrees. She has no significant neurovascular compromise except for some mild decrease in strength with knee extension. Neurovascular: Intact. No obvious soft tissue swelling or ecchymosis. A little bit of spasm is the only thing I can appreciate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ASSESSMENT: L5-S1 herniated disc with right L5-S1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 23} 10. Following a January 7, 2004 hearing, an SHO issued an order stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">The order of the District Hearing Officer, from the hearing dated 11/13/2003, is MODIFIED TO THE FOLLOWING EXTENT. Therefore, the C-84, filed 06/02/2003, is GRANTED TO THE EXTENT OF THIS ORDER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">Temporary total disability compensation is awarded for the period 06/12/2002 through 12/31/2003, to continue upon presentation of medical evidence of continuing temporary total disability. This award is based on the 05/29/2003 C-84 form from Dr. Snell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">Also persuasive, but not technically relied upon, was the 08/13/2002 Independent Medical Examination performed by Dr. Smith on behalf of the self-insuring employer. Dr. Smith concludes that the claimant has not reached maximum medical improvement and also that the claimant was not able to return to her former position of employment at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">The Staff Hearing Officer has considered the employer\u2019s argument that office notes from Dr. Snell and other evidence, particularly the Independent Medical Exam by Dr. David [Smith], would support the conclusion that the claimant\u2019s disability is primarily due to the disallowed bulging disc at L5-S1, or possibly the unallowed herniated disc at the same level, which has been demonstrated by recent MRI. The Staff Hearing Officer notes the practical difficulty in distinguishing between the disability at this level of the spine caused by the allowed and unallowed conditions. After reviewing the evidence, the Staff Hearing Officer finds the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion particularly from Dr. Smith that the claimant\u2019s disability is caused by the degenerative disc disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">In evaluating the employer\u2019s request for a finding of maximum medical improvement, the Staff Hearing Officer further notes that, by companion order, a surgical consultation is being authorized, indicating that treatment which is not merely conservative is under serious consideration, a contra-indication of maximum medical improvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">{\u00b624} 11. On February 4, 2004, another SHO mailed an order refusing relator\u2019s administrative appeal from the SHO\u2019s order of January 7, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">{\u00b6 25} 12. On March 30, 2004, relator, Genuine Parts Company, filed this mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">{\u00b6 26} Two main issues are presented: (1) whether Dr. Snell\u2019s May 29, 2003 C-84 constitutes some evidence upon which the commission can rely to support its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>award of TTD compensation and (2) whether the August 13, 2002 report of Dr. Smith is some evidence upon which the commission could rely to support a TTD award.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b627} The magistrate finds (1) Dr. Snell\u2019s C-84 does not constitute some evidence upon which the commission can rely and (2) Dr. Smith\u2019s August 13, 2002 report can constitute some evidence upon which the commission could rely to support a TTD award if Dr. Smith is willing to certify a specific period of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 28} Turning to the first issue, although Dr. Snell failed to give the date of the examination supporting his May 29, 2003 C-84 certification of temporary total disability, it is clear from the record that the examinations of June 18, 2002 and June 27, 2002, were the most recent examinations prior to the certification. Dr. Snell\u2019s May 29, 2003 C-84 certification was premised upon examinations that predate the certification by some 11 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b629} On the C-84, Dr. Snell certified that \u201clumbosacral sprain\u201d was the condition being treated that prevents a return to work. Dr. Snell listed \u201caggravation of pre existing degenerative disc disease L5-S1\u201d as another allowed condition being treated. Based upon Dr. Snell\u2019s responses to the C-84 queries, \u201clumbosacral sprain\u201d is the only allowed condition that he certified as causing temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 30} Certification of the lumbosacral sprain as the cause of temporary total disability is clearly inconsistent with Dr. Snell\u2019s June 18, 2002 and June 27, 2002 office notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">{\u00b6 31} At the June 18, 2002 office visit, Dr. Snell assessed \u201cL5-S1 disc bulge,\u201d a disallowed condition. There is no mention of a lumbosacral sprain in the office note.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">{\u00b6 32} Following the June 27, 2002 office visit nine days later, Dr. Snell recorded that \u201c[h]er exam is essentially unchanged.\u201d Again, there is no mention of a lumbosacral sprain in the June 27, 2002 office note.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">{\u00b6 33} This magistrate must view skeptically the discrepancy between the May 29, 2003 certification based on the five-year-old lumbosacral sprain and the office notes that fail to mention the lumbosacral sprain but discuss serious disallowed and nonallowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">{\u00b6 34} The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that internally inconsistent doctors\u2019 reports cannot be \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting a commission decision. <em>State ex rel. Lopez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 445, 633 N.E.2d 528. By extension, the court held in <em>State ex rel. M. Weingold &amp; Co. v. Indus. Comm., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-5353, 776 N.E.2d 69, that substantial inconsistencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>between two C-84s generated by the same examination compel the same result decided in <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 35} <em>Weingold, </em>is instructive here. Substantial inconsistencies exist between Dr. Snell\u2019s office records and his May 29, 2003 C-84. Based upon <em>Weingold, </em>the magistrate concludes that Dr. Snell\u2019s May 29, 2003 C-84 cannot constitute the \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s TTD award. However, elimination of Dr. Snell\u2019s C-84 from evidentiary consideration does not end the inquiry here.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 36} After stating that the award is based on Dr. Snell\u2019s C-84, the SHO states that Dr. Smith\u2019s August 13, 2002 report is persuasive \u201cbut not technically relied upon.\u201d Later on, the SHO states that \u201c[a]fter reviewing the evidence, the Staff Hearing Officer finds that the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion particularly from Dr. Smith that the claimant\u2019s disability is caused by the degenerative disc disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 37} The SHO\u2019s treatment of Dr. Smith\u2019s report is ambiguous. The ambiguity of the SHO\u2019s reliance upon Dr. Smith\u2019s report is significant because of the elimination of Dr. Snell\u2019s C-84 from further evidentiary consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 38} Dr. Smith\u2019s report could provide some evidence supporting a TTD award if Dr. Smith is willing to certify a specific period of temporary total disability for the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">{\u00b6 39} Dr. Smith acknowledged that one of the issues with claimant\u2019s August 13, 2002 visit was claimant\u2019s request for TTD compensation. Dr. Smith\u2019s report could be viewed by the commission as containing an opinion that the aggravation of preexisting degenerative disc disease causes temporary total disability where it states that \u201cwe are not talking about returning to work but getting a definitive evaluation by a spine surgeon.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Nelson McCoy Pottery Co. v. Wilson </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 28, 564 N.E.2d 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">{\u00b6 40} Even though Dr. Smith\u2019s report can be construed as an opinion that claimant is temporarily totally disabled due to an allowed condition of the claim, Dr. Smith did not certify a specific period of disability. Although the commission may not create a period of disability out of whole cloth, it can take additional evidence from Dr. Smith as to the period of claimant\u2019s disability. See <em>State ex rel. Fries v. Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-721, 2002-Ohio-3252, 2002 WL 1377785.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">{\u00b6 41} Accordingly, it is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus ordering respondent Industrial Commission of Ohio to vacate its order awarding TTD compensation beginning June 12, 2002 to eliminate Dr. Snell\u2019s C-84 from further evidentiary consideration, to take additional evidence from Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Smith as to the period of temporary total disability, and to enter a new order that adjudicates the request for TTD compensation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
