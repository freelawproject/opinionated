On February 22, 2000, James Doolittle, appellee\u2019s foreman, assigned appellant to a mold press (\u201cPress 11\u201d) with which he was unfamiliar. Doolittle trained appellant for approximately 20 minutes and monitored him on the press for approximately 90 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">{\u00b6 3} To operate the press, the operator had to open a yellow safety door, place the proper amount of raw fiberglass into the machine, close the safety door, and depress and hold two palm buttons simultaneously; if the buttons were not depressed simultaneously or if they were not depressed for the requisite time, the press would not cycle. Once actuated, a ram<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> would descend into a hole in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>mold and the press would mold the fiberglass at a temperature of 300 to 320 degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">{\u00b6 4} According to Doolittle, the primary purpose of the safety door was to \u201ckeep people\u2019s hands out\u201d of the press. However, the door was not electrically or mechanically interlocked with the machine: The door had to be manually closed by the operator, and the press could cycle even if the safety door was open. While other presses in the plant were equipped with electrical interlocking safety devices, no such device was ever installed on Press 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 5} After monitoring appellant on the machine, Doolittle began work on a press across from Press 11. Doolittle noticed that appellant was talking to a woman employee stationed next to him;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Doolittle testified that although employees are permitted to converse with one another, appellant was not paying full attention to his press. Several minutes had passed when Doolittle heard appellant scream. Doolittle hastened to appellant\u2019s press and observed appellant\u2019s right hand pinned under the ram. Appellant was quickly extricated and removed to the plant office. After medical treatment, appellant lost one of his fingers. Subsequent corrective surgery resulted in the removal of a second finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 6} In his deposition, appellant alleged that the ram suddenly and unexpectedly came down on his hand as he was loading material into the press. He claimed that the machine spontaneously dropped the ram without manual pressure on the buttons. After the incident, however, Doolittle and others attempted to re-create the accident in an effort to understand and prevent future injuries. However, they were unable to produce any misfires or disengagements of the sort alleged by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 7} From these observations and those he made immediately before the accident, Doolittle hypothesized that appellant began a cycle without having removed a finished part. After realizing this, he stuck his arm in the press to retrieve the part before the ram dropped. Doolittle noted that the timing mechanism in the press allowed a two- to three-second interval (after the palm buttons were depressed) before the ram dropped. In Doolittle\u2019s view, appellant failed to move fast enough, and the ram dropped as his hand was removing the finished part.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant\u2019s expert, Richard Harkness, Ph.D., a registered professional engineer, similarly testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cMr. Young got \u2018out of synch\u2019 with the press cycle. After the cycle was complete, the mold was opened and Mr. Young opened the gate. He should then have removed the parts from the mold. However, he made a foreseeable mistake and depressed the dual palm buttons first before reaching into the point of operation to remove the parts. The ram descended, entrapping his right hand and causing his injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 10} On October 20, 2003, appellee moved for summary judgment, which appellant timely opposed. On January 5, 2004, the trial court awarded summary judgment in appellee\u2019s favor. In doing so, the court assumed the facts alleged by appellant in his deposition despite the factual (evidentiary) dispute between appellant\u2019s reconstruction of events and Doolittle\u2019s hypothesis (a theory supported by appellant\u2019s expert witness and used in his motion opposing summary judgment). In its judgment entry, the trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cUpon review of the evidence presented in this case, Plaintiff has failed to establish, as a matter of law, the elements necessary to prove a workplace intentional tort. \u2018[Mjere knowledge and appreciation of a risk \u2014 something short of substantial certainty \u2014 is not intent.\u2019 Moreover, even if this Court accepted the \u2018new<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> theory of how Plaintiff was injured as a possible chain of events, Plaintiff has failed to offer any evidence that this scenario actually happened, given Plaintiffs own testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant now appeals from this judgment and assigns the following error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred, to the prejudice of Appellant Leonard Young by granting Industrial Molded Plastics\u2019 motion for summary judgment on appellants\u2019 intentional tort claim, by finding that he had failed to show that the accident was substantially certain to occur and that appellant submitted no evidence of how the accident occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">{\u00b6 14} Summary judgment is appropriate when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come but to one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to a construction of the evidence most strongly in his favor. Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>{\u00b6 15} The moving party must assert evidence informing the lower court of the basis for the motion by identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the essential elements of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. <em>Hunter v. Interpak, Inc., </em>11th Dist. No. 2001-L-198, 2002-Ohio-7149, 2002 WL 31862677, at \u00b6 9. The moving party must specifically point to some evidence of the sort listed in Civ.R. 56(C) that affirmatively demonstrates that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support his claim. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 16} If the moving party fails to satisfy her burden, summary judgment should be denied. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. However, where the moving party meets her initial burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to respond with evidence permitted by Civ.R. 56 demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact. Id. In effect, if reasonable minds could find for the nonmoving party, a motion for summary judgment must be overruled. <em>Link v. Leadworks Corp. </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 735, 741, 607 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 17} To establish an employer-intentional-tort claim, a party must demonstrate each of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c \u2018(1) knowledge by the employer of the existence of a dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality, or condition within the business operation; (2) knowledge by the employer that if the employee is subjected by his employment to such dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition, then harm to the employee will be a substantial certainty; and (3) that the employer, under such circumstances, and with such knowledge, did act to require the employee to continue to perform the dangerous task.\u2019 \u201d <em>Renner v. East Mfg. Corp., </em>11th Dist. No. 2001-P-0135, 2002-Ohio-6691, 2002 WL 31744760, at \u00b620, citing <em>Hannah v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 482, 484, 696 N.E.2d 1044. See, also, <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 19} In order to reverse the grant of summary judgment, appellant must demonstrate a material issue of fact relating to each prong of the foregoing test. See, e.g., <em>Renner, </em>2002-0hio-6691, at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cTo establish an intentional tort of an employer, proof beyond that required to prove negligence and beyond that to prove recklessness must be established. Where the employer acts despite his knowledge of some risk, his conduct may be negligence. As the probability increases that particular consequences may follow then the employer\u2019s conduct may be characterized as recklessness. As the probability that the consequences will follow further increases, and the employer knows that injuries to employees are certain or substantially certain to result from the process, procedure or condition and he still proceeds, he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>result.\u201d <em>Fyffe, </em>supra, 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">{\u00b6 21} The above factors operate to impose a foreseeability test. <em>Browne v. Walgreens, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-L-062, 2003-Ohio-6691, 2003 WL 22931357, at \u00b6 15. Where harm is foreseeable, the harm is substantially certain to occur. <em>Fleck v. Snyder Brick &amp; Block </em>(Mar. 16, 2001), 2d Dist. No. 18368, 2001 WL 256279, * 2. However, mere awareness or appreciation of a risk is something short of substantial certainty and does not rise to the level of intent. <em>Browne, </em>supra, 2003-Ohio-6691, at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 22} The first prong of the foregoing test requires us to determine whether appellant presented facts demonstrating that appellee had knowledge of the existence of a dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 23} During his deposition, Doolittle testified that the press was entirely manual and if the palm buttons were depressed properly, it would cycle whether the safety door was open or closed. Moreover, Doolittle indicated that an operator had two or three seconds once the buttons were depressed before the ram fully engaged the fiberglass. According to Doolittle, an operator has \u201cplenty of time to reach in there and get his hand under [the ram].\u201d In Doolittle\u2019s view, were an operator\u2019s hand hit by the ram, an injury would be \u201csubstantially certain.\u201d To the extent that an instrumentality is substantially certain to cause injury, reasonable minds could conclude that the instrumentality is dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 24} With respect to first prong of the <em>Fyffe </em>test, summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 25} We next address Fyffe\u2019s third prong, which requires appellant to show evidence that appellee, with knowledge, did act to require appellant to work on Press 11. An employer does not have to expressly order the employee to engage in the dangerous task leading to his injury. <em>Gibson v. Drainage Prods., Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 171, 2002-Ohio-2008, 766 N.E.2d 982, at \u00b623. Rather, an employee may satisfy the third prong of the <em>Fyjfe </em>inquiry by \u201c \u2018presenting evidence that raises an inference that the employer, through its actions and policies, required the employee to engage in the dangerous task.\u2019\u201d <em>Browne, </em>supra, 2003-Ohio-6691, \u00b6 18, citing <em>Hannah v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co., </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 485, 696 N.E.2d 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b626} In his deposition, Doolittle testified that his duties as the plant foreman included assigning employees to machines in the plant. On February 22, 2001, appellant was assigned to Press 11 and was expected to remain there for the workday. As indicated above, Doolittle had contemplated the possibility of an employee being injured on Press 11 because an operator could open and reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>into the press while it was cycling. Because appellant was specifically assigned to Press 11 on the day in question and Doolittle was aware of the dangerousness of the press, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the third prong of the <em>Fyffe </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 27} Next, the second prong of the <em>Fyffe </em>analysis requires appellant to set forth facts demonstrating knowledge by appellee that if he was subjected to the dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality, or condition, then harm would be a substantial certainty. <em>Fyffe, </em>supra, 59 Ohio St.3d at 118, 570 N.E.2d 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 28} An accident of the sort suffered by appellant had never occurred in appellee\u2019s plant. The lack of a previous accident is evidence tending to show that appellee did not have knowledge that an injury was substantially certain to occur. <em>Browne, </em>supra, 2003-Ohio-6691, at \u00b6 17. However, that persons have not been maimed or killed by a device or procedure in the past is not dispositive of whether that device or procedure is dangerous or unsafe. Accepting such a proposition would permit each employer one free injury for \u201c \u2018every decision, procedure or device it decided to use, regardless of the knowledge or substantial certainty of the danger that the employer\u2019s decision entailed. This is not the purpose of <em>Fyffe.\u2019 \u201d Taulbee v. Adience, Inc. </em>(1997), 120 Ohio App.3d 11, 20, 696 N.E.2d 625, quoting <em>Cook v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 417, 429-430, 657 N.E.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA foreseeable risk is a risk that is substantially certain to occur.\u201d <em>Browne, </em>supra, 2003-Ohio-6691, at \u00b6 15, citing <em>Fleck, </em>supra, 2001 WL 256279, at * 2. However, a risk that is merely possible is not a foreseeable risk for purposes of our analysis. As we indicated above, to impose liability for an employer\u2019s intentional tort, a plaintiff must establish proof <em>beyond </em>that required for negligence and recklessness. <em>Renner, </em>supra, 2002-Ohio-6691, at \u00b6 20. While the caselaw does not indicate that this standard is tantamount to the reasonable-doubt standard of criminal law, a plaintiff nevertheless shoulders a heavy burden. <em>Zink v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp. </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 637, 644, 584 N.E.2d 1303. We believe, therefore, as it relates to the current matter, that a foreseeable risk is not merely a probable risk, but a highly probable risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 30} Prior to appellant\u2019s injury, Doolittle admitted that he had contemplated the possibility of an operator depressing the palm buttons with the safety door agape and placing his or her hand in the path of the ram. Doolittle also acknowledged that such a scenario would cause injury. We must reiterate, however, that no such injury had occurred in appellee\u2019s plant prior to the injury under consideration. On the day of the injury, Doolittle demonstrated the proper way to operate Press 11; Doolittle indicated that he monitored appellant\u2019s operations for some 90 minutes and testified that if operated properly, the press <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>posed no danger to its operator and certainly did not involve a dangerous process substantially certain to cause injury. Doolittle\u2019s own operation of Press 11 underscores his belief. Moreover, Thomas Veon, an employee and press operator for appellee, testified that he had never witnessed anyone operating the press with the safety gate open.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">{\u00b6 31} In our view, nothing in the record suggests that appellee had knowledge that if appellant was subjected by his employment to Press 11, then harm to appellant would be a substantial certainty. Therefore, the risk of the harm that occurred to appellant was not foreseeable to appellee pursuant to <em>Fyffe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 32} In sum, appellant failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the second prong of the <em>Fyffe </em>test. As a result, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b541-7\">Donald R. Ford, P.J., and Diane V. Grendell, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-17\">. The ram was a hydraulic steel device that was set some six inches above the raw fiberglass; once the buttons were depressed, the ram would drop six inches into a hole in the mold. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>According to Doolittle, after the buttons were depressed, the ram\u2019s six-inch descent would take approximately two to three seconds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\">. Doolittle stated that appellant was prone, \"off and on,\u201d to talking while operating his press and not giving the work his full attention. However, he characterized this as a minor problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b537-10\">. In its decision, the trial court accepted appellant\u2019s own theory of how his accident occurred, i.e., that the ram spontaneously and suddenly fell on his hand. However, the court also referred to appellant\u2019s so-called new theory of recovery, i.e., that appellant, after depressing the palm buttons, placed his hand into the machine and the ram struck his hand before it could be removed. The court concluded that neither theory could prevent summary judgment for appellee, as appellant failed to present evidence sufficient to support either theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
