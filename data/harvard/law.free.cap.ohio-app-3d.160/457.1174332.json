The younger three children are from the mother\u2019s marriage to her now ex-husband, Mr. B. Although Mr. B. participated in the hearings at the trial level, he did not appeal. The three older children are allegedly from the mother\u2019s earlier relationship with Mr. C. Mr. C has not established paternity and did not participate in the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>{\u00b6 2} The county had taken temporary custody of the three older children in 1994, but they were reunited with the mother after she completed her case plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She later married Mr. B and had the other three children. Her relationship with Mr. B was rocky and involved physical abuse of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 3} At one point during her marriage to Mr. B, at least a few years before this removal, the children informed their mother that their older cousin, the son of the mother\u2019s sister, had engaged in sexual behavior with them. They also told her that they were engaging in sexual behavior with each other. The mother \u201cwhooped\u201d them for their behavior with each other, but she did not report the assaults to the authorities. Instead, she took her children to a minister for counseling, and, in violation of the law, the minister also did not report the abuse to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 4} As the mother\u2019s relationship with Mr. B continued to deteriorate, she moved herself and the children in with her sister. Also living with her sister, however, was the older cousin who had previously sexually assaulted them. Because the sexual assaults resumed when the children moved into the house with the older cousin, Mr. B notified the authorities, who removed the children from the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 5} The county filed an immediate complaint for permanent custody. At the adjudicatory hearing, mother admitted the charges of abuse and neglect. She was given a case plan, which she proceeded to pursue. Nonetheless, the court granted permanent custody to the county five months after the complaint was filed. The mother timely appealed, stating four assignments of error. The first is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">I. The trial court committed prejudicial error by failing to substantially comply with the requirements of Juv.R. 29(D) when accepting mother\u2019s admission to the amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">{\u00b6 6} The mother complains that the trial court failed to comply with Juv.R. 29(D) when it accepted her admission to the charges in the complaint. She is correct. Juv.R. 29 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">(C) Entry of admission or denial. \u2014 The court shall request each party against whom allegations are being made in the complaint to admit or deny the allegations. A failure or refusal to admit the allegations shall be deemed a denial, except in cases where the court consents to entry of a plea of no contest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>(D) Initial procedure upon entry of an admission. \u2014 The court may refuse to accept an admission and shall not accept an admission without addressing the party personally and determining both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">(1) The party is making the admission voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the allegations and the consequences of the admission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">(2) The party understands that by entering an admission the party is waiving the right to challenge the witnesses and evidence against the party, to remain silent, and to introduce evidence at the adjudicatory hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 7} Before accepting the mother\u2019s admission to the complaint, the court was required under the rule, first, to ascertain that she understood the allegations contained in the complaint and the consequences of her admission and, second, to inform her of the specific rights she was waiving by admitting to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 8} The court\u2019s discussion with the mother at the adjudication hearing consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">THE COURT: * * * The court will direct it\u2019s [sic] remarks to the mother in this matter. The court will direct its remarks to the mother through her counsel, Mr. Granito. At the request of the prosecutor that the court inquire of the mother that she does admit to the amended complaint and also amended as to the dates of birth by the request of the guardian ad litem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">MR. GRANITO: Yes, Your Honor. I discussed this matter with my client and we\u2019ve gone over the allegation and I explained to her what her rights are, right to trial and confront witnesses and et cetera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">THE COURT: Keep your voice up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">MR. GRANITO: I explained her right to trial and to address witnesses. At this time she\u2019s willing to admit to the amended complaint for the adjudication purpose only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Prosecutor, the mother does admit to the amended complaint as applies to this adjudication hearing only. Anything further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">MR. MILLAS: Again, just that the Court of Appeals requires a conversation with the mother to make sure that the admisi\u00f3n is knowingly and voluntarily [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-15\">THE COURT: I realize that. I\u2019m asking do you agree with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-16\">MR. MILLAS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-17\">THE COURT: The court in view of counsel indicating to the court after conversing with you, you do admit to the allegations that are set forth in the amended complaint before the court and that you are admitting only as to the extent of the adjudication hearing today. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-18\">[MOTHER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>HE COURT: And if that\u2019s so, you do admit to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">[MOTHER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. So be it. It will be her statement will be admitted and the court will now hear from counsel closing argument as to the testimony that was heard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Proceeding to closing arguments, the court never discussed with mother her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">{\u00b6 9} The county argues that the mother is barred from raising this issue in this appeal for two reasons. It points out that the mother failed not only to appeal from the court\u2019s adjudication order at the time it was journalized, but also to include the issue of the adjudicatory hearing in her notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">{\u00b6 10} First, the county notes that the mother failed to appeal from the adjudicatory ruling within the 30-day time limit in App.R. 4. The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that the decision following an adjudicatory hearing is a final appealable order because it affects a significant parental right. <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 556 N.E.2d 1169, syllabus. This court has previously ruled that when a trial court makes an adjudicatory finding of dependency, neglect, or abuse, the parent must appeal from that finding within 30 days of the judgment entry as required by App.R. 4(A). See <em>In re M.L.R. </em>(2002), 150 Ohio App.3d 39, 2002-Ohio-5958, 779 N.E.2d 772, \u00b6 23; <em>In re C.H., </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 82258 <em>&amp; </em>82852, 2003-Ohio-6854, 2003 WL 22966248, \u00b6 71-72; <em>In re M.Z., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80799, 2002-Ohio-6634, 2002 WL 31722231, \u00b6 39; <em>In re Michael A., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 79835, 2002-Ohio-1270, 2002 WL 441590, at * 8; <em>In re Natalie Hart </em>(Dec. 9, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 75326, 1999 WL 1129590, at *7.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">{\u00b6 11} Very recently, however, this court revised its holding on this issue in <em>In re S.G. &amp; M.G., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84228, 2005-Ohio-1163, 2005 WL 616115, and ruled that App.R. 4(B)(5) permitted a parent to appeal from an adjudicatory ruling either at the time that ruling was made or in the appeal of the final dispositional order. Id., \u00b6 13. See, also, <em>In re Asia Fordyce </em>(Sept. 22, 1997), Butler App. No. CA96-09-193, 1997 WL 589062, at * 10 (vacating permanent custody disposition because the mother was not apprised of her rights at the adjudicatory hearing.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">{\u00b6 12} It is axiomatic that only a final order may be appealed. What constitutes a final order is found in R.C. 2505.02(B), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">(B) An order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">(1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>(2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">(3) An order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">(4) An order that grants or denies a provisional remedy and to which both of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">(a) The order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">(b) The appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">(5) An order that determines that an action may or may not be maintained as a class action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">{\u00b6 13} In an adjudicatory hearing, if the court makes a finding of neglect, abuse, or dependency and if temporary custody is granted to the county, the mother\u2019s temporary loss of custody would qualify as a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(4). The awarding of temporary custody of the children to the county, to remove the children from the alleged abusive situation, would constitute a \u201cprovisional remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is a provisional remedy because it is temporary in nature and designed to prevent further immediate abuse to the children. Without the right to appeal at that juncture, the mother would have no recourse to alter this \u201cremedy\u201d granted to the county. Appealing from that temporary loss of custody later at the dispositional hearing could not restore the lost custody for the interim time period, the time between the adjudicatory hearing and the end of the dispositional hearing. The results of the adjudicatory hearing are, therefore, final appealable orders that do not require Civ.R. 54(B) language. See <em>In re Murray, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>S.G., </em>however, the Eighth District clarified an alternative opportunity to appeal from an admission made at the adjudicatory hearing. <em>S.G. </em>relied on App.R. 4(B)(5), which states the following exception to the appeal time period contained in division(A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">(5) Partial final judgment or order. If an appeal is permitted from a judgment or order entered in a case in which the trial court has not disposed of all claims as to all parties, other than a judgment or order entered under Civ.R. 54(B), <em>a party may file a notice of appeal within thirty days </em>of entry of the judgment or order appealed or the judgment <em>or order that disposes of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>remaining claims. </em>Division (A) of this rule applies to a judgment or order entered under Civ.R. 54(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al_\">(Emphasis and footnote added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 15} <em>S.G., </em>supra, acknowledged that the adjudicatory ruling finding the children in question to be neglected was a final appealable order, consistent with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 556 N.E.2d 1169, syllabus. The court went on, however, to explain that the Appellate Rule also \u201cauthorizes an appeal of an adjudication order alternatively thirty days after the court renders a final order on all issues in the case.\u201d <em>S.G. </em>2005-Ohio-1163 at \u00b6 11. We agree with this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 16} In the case at bar, therefore, the mother could appeal from the ruling in the adjudicatory hearing either after that hearing or after the case was disposed of by the dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 17} The county further argues, however, that even if we find that the mother\u2019s appeal from the adjudicatory hearing was timely, she is barred from addressing it in this appeal because her notice of appeal did not refer to the adjudicatory ruling and did not include a copy of the judgment entry for that ruling. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 18} It is true that the mother did not, in her pro se notice of appeal, mention that she was appealing from both the adjudicatory ruling and the permanent-custody ruling. App.R. 3(D) requires appellant to designate the \u201cjudgment, order or part thereof appealed from.\u201d However, App. R. 3(A) establishes what determines the validity of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">{\u00b6 19} App.R. 3 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">(A) Filing the nptice of appeal. \u2014 An appeal as of right shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the trial court within the time allowed by Rule 4. Failure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the court of appeals deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal. Appeals by leave of court shall be taken in the manner prescribed by Rule 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">(D) Content of the notice of appeal. \u2014 The notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal; <em>shall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from; </em>and shall name the court to which the appeal is taken. The title of the case shall be the same as in the trial court with the designation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>of the appellant added, as appropriate. Form 1 in Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a notice of appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b620} It is within the discretion of the appellate court to allow or disallow an appeal that lacks one of the prerequisites contained in App.R. 3(D). \u201cPursuant to App.R. 3(A), the only jurisdictional requirement for the filing of a valid appeal is the timely filing of a notice of appeal. When presented with other defects in the notice of appeal, a court of appeals is vested with discretion to determine whether sanctions, including dismissal, are warranted, and its decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Nolan </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 320, 322, 649 N.E.2d 1229. The court may, therefore, but is not required to, prevent an appellant from addressing an issue not raised in the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b621} In <em>S.G., </em>supra, this court held that because mother\u2019s appeal was filed timely and because it provided the opposing side with sufficient notice of the matter being appealed, there was no danger that the county would be misled or misunderstand the appeal. <em>S.G., </em>2005-Ohio-1163, \u00b6 at 9, citing <em>Maritime Mfr., Inc. v. Hi-Skipper Marina </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 257, 259, 24 O.O.3d 344, 436 N.E.2d 1034.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As in <em>S.G., </em>we find that the county was not prejudiced by mother\u2019s failure to specify in her notice of appeal that she was appealing from the adjudicatory decision, and we therefore conclude that this omission was not fatal to her appeal. Thus, we decline to limit the mother\u2019s appeal to the issues arising from the permanent custody hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 22} The state also argues that the mother waived a Juv.R. 29(D) issue on appeal because at two dispositional hearings, she failed to seek to withdraw her admissions. The question is whether the mother could be deemed to have waived her right to be advised of the consequences of her admissions when it was never determined that she understood those consequences. The court\u2019s failure to determine that she understood the consequences of her admission infects all that follows \u2014 so much so that she cannot be deemed to have waived her right to this advisement. If the court is forbidden to accept an admission without determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>personally that the mother made her admission voluntarily and with understanding of its consequences, then surely the court is forbidden to rely upon any adjudication of abuse and neglect \u2014 a process that was tainted by admissions the court was not permitted to accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 23} If a criminal defendant pleads guilty to a crime, the court fails to advise him all of his constitutional rights, and the defendant does not raise this omission at the sentencing hearing, the defendant is not barred from raising the issue on appeal. If the criminal fails to raise the issue on appeal himself, moreover, the appellate court may still take notice of the plain error. Although the plain-error doctrine has limited application in civil cases, the Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that there are occasions when it may apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">We do not hold that application of the plain error doctrine may never be appropriate in civil cases. However, we do reaffirm and emphasize that the doctrine is sharply limited to the <em>extremely rare </em>case involving <em>exceptional </em>circumstances where the error, left unobjected to at the trial court, rises to the level of challenging the legitimacy of the underlying judicial process itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">(Emphasis sic.) <em>Goldfuss v. Davidson </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 122, 679 N.E.2d 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 24} A court errs in accepting a mother\u2019s admission of abuse or neglect without that court\u2019s ensuring that the parent has a full understanding of her legal rights so that she may protect her custody of her child. When that admission, moreover, contributes to a finding of abuse and neglect and thus enables the court subsequently to award permanent custody to the county, the \u201clegitimacy of the underlying judicial process itself\u2019 is challenged if the mother is not permitted to appeal from the award on the basis of that admission. As this court stated in <em>S.G.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">The termination of parental rights is \u2018the family law equivalent of the death penalty.\u2019 <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, 679 N.E.2d 680; see, also, <em>In re Murray, 52 </em>Ohio St.3d at 156, 556 N.E.2d 1169 (stating that a parent has a \u2018fundamental liberty interest\u2019 in the care, custody, and management of his or her child and an \u2018essential\u2019 and \u2018basic civil right\u2019 to raise his or her children).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">Because this is so, a trial court\u2019s failure to comply with Juv.R. 29(D) has been found to constitute plain error in cases involving termination of parental rights. See <em>In re Elliott, </em>4th Dist. Nos. 03CA65 <em>&amp; </em>03CA66, 2004-Ohio-2770, 2004 WL 1189475, at \u00b6 15; <em>In re Aldridge, </em>2002-Ohio-5988, 2002 WL 31439807, at \u00b6 16. Unlike this court\u2019s decision in <em>In re M.F. </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82018, 2003-Ohio-4807, 2003 WL 22100124, which involved an adjudication of delinquency as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>opposed to the termination of parental rights, we are unable to conclude that appellant waived this issue for review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Id. 2005-0hio-1168, at \u00b6 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 25} In the case at bar, therefore, the mother timely appealed from the court\u2019s decisions reached at both the adjudicatory and the dispositional hearings. Accordingly, this assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 26} As a result of the disposition of the first assignment of error,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we vacate the court\u2019s decision at the adjudicatory stage in which the court awarded temporary custody to the county and also vacate the court\u2019s decision at the dispositional hearing to award permanent custody to the county. In doing so, we also vacate the court\u2019s finding of neglect and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Judgment vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-9\">Kilbane and McMonagle, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-11\">.
