Callaway, appeals from his conviction in the Akron Municipal Court for obstructing official business and resisting arrest. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">{\u00b6 2} On July 18, 2004, the Akron Police Department received a nonemergency call from Alan Bailey of the Summit County Adult Protective Services, requesting law enforcement and EMS to conduct a \u201cwelfare check\u201d at 718 Sylvan Avenue in Akron, Ohio, regarding the health of an elderly, bedridden male at that residence, namely, William\u2019s father, Walter Callaway. Bailey informed the police department that he had received information from a physician\u2019s office that several calls had been made from the Callaway residence. At no time during his conversation with the police dispatcher did Bailey mention that the calls from the physician\u2019s office suggested a medical <em>emergency, </em>and the dispatcher never mentioned to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>officer who was to follow up on this call, Officer Alan Hamidi, that this phone call indicated an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">{\u00b6 3} When asked to confirm whether he just wanted someone to check to make sure Walter was all right, Bailey explained the predicament as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-d\">Yeah, it\u2019s one step above that. I don\u2019t think (inaudible) because this is secondhand. We have a history of some kind of situation. [Walter] is, oh he\u2019s 81, but he does have need at times for IV. He has dementia and is not compliant \"with either his diet, he could be dehydrated, he could be in need of an IV. He has a son that seems quite, admit there\u2019s a history of some overreacting. He\u2019s been calling a health agency, actually a Dr. Scroggins is his attending physician. He\u2019s been calling there about every few hours to say his dad needs help. He won\u2019t take his father to a hospital for fear his father will be put in a nursing home. Okay. I think this is (inaudible) my opinion, but it\u2019s shared, it\u2019s shared. The son may not be accurate as concerned because he\u2019s a little (inaudible). But there are medical situations the father is in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">There\u2019s an adult there with Walter, that\u2019s the son. He just called minutes ago to the doctor while I was talking to the doctor\u2019s receptionist requesting medical attention again for his father. We\u2019re not medical professionals who go out there. So that\u2019s why I thought I\u2019d call to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 4} Without a warrant, Officer Hamidi went to the Callaway residence, dressed in uniform, and knocked on the side door of the house. William looked out the window but did not notice a marked police car near the house. William then opened the door to see who was there, at which point the officer identified himself and informed William that he was sent there by Adult Protective Custody to follow up on a call. At his trial, William testified that the officer had told him that the call had indicated that an elderly man at that location was being abused, that both the police and the EMS were being sent to the house, and that they actually needed to physically see Walter to make sure that he was all right. William responded that Walter was fine and that the officer was misinformed regarding any sort of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">{\u00b6 5} The officer testified at trial that William \u201cseemed to get really agitated\u201d and that he began to pace back and forth behind the door. The officer testified that William then told the officer that he had not called the police and that the officer was not welcome there and \u201cturned around abruptly to go back towards the door to go back inside the house.\u201d Before William could reenter the house, the officer insisted that he needed to come in the house to see Walter and warned William that if he resisted his entrance, he would arrest him for obstructing official business. The officer testified that William then \u201cclipped [the officer] on the right shoulder, and [said], \u2018no police coming in here and do nothing.\u2019 \u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>officer testified that he then informed William that he was under arrest for obstructing official business and instructed William to put his hands behind his back. At trial, William denied hitting the police officer and asserted that the officer never actually started to place him under arrest outside of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">{\u00b6 6} Nevertheless, both William and the officer testified that William then darted toward the partially opened door to go inside the house and attempted to shut the door behind him. The officer testified that he had held onto the partially fastened handcuffs, following William into the house. The entire time, the officer used pressure points on William\u2019s elbow to make him comply, but to no avail; William proceeded into the house, with the officer holding on to him, and moved toward the kitchen. The officer then began to apply knee strikes to William\u2019s thigh, which did not make William acquiesce, either. The officer maintained that he continued to tell William that he was under arrest and that he needed to stop moving.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 7} William proceeded into the kitchen toward the telephone. He dialed 911, insisting that he was going to call the officer\u2019s supervisor; all the while, the officer was striking him on the knee. The officer stated that he then noticed that William was holding the phone above his head, a pose that apparently indicated to the officer that he was about to be struck with the phone. The officer pulled back from William but then attempted to immobilize him with a taser-gun shot to the chest. After a second shot, the taser successfully immobilized William and brought him to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">{\u00b6 8} After the officer successfully apprehended William, he called for backup. Then, EMS arrived on the scene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The officer did eventually proceed upstairs to check on Walter; he found him lying on a hospital bed. Walter told the officer that he was fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">{\u00b6 9} William was charged with one count of obstructing official business in violation of Akron Codified Ordinance 136.11, a second-degree misdemeanor, and one count of resisting arrest in violation of Akron Codified Ordinance 136.13, a first-degree misdemeanor. William pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">{\u00b6 10} The case proceeded to a jury trial. At the close of the city\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence, William\u2019s counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A). The court denied the motions. A jury found William guilty of both charges, and the trial court sentenced him accordingly. The trial court stayed William\u2019s sentence pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>{\u00b6 11} William filed a pro se notice of appeal to this court from his conviction and sentence. Thereafter, appellate counsel was appointed to represent him, and William thereby asserts two assignments of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The city of Akron failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of the crime of obstructing official business. Specifically, the city failed to prove that appellant Callaway acted \u201cwithout privilege\u201d in refusing police entry to his home when the police had no warrant and no exigent circumstances. The city also failed to prove an authorized act and a lawful duty. The failure of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements violated appellant Callaway\u2019s right to due process of law under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">{\u00b6 12} In his first assignment of error, William contends that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of the offense to obstructing official business. Thus, William maintains that his conviction for Obstructing official business was not supported by sufficient evidence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe test for Insufficient evidence\u2019 requires the court to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and ask whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Leggett </em>(Oct. 29, 1997), 9th Dist. No. 18303, at 4, 1997 WL 775688. We must determine whether, as a matter of law, the evidence was legally sufficient to support a conviction. Id. \u201cIn essence, sufficiency is a test of adequacy.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">{\u00b6 14} William maintains that the state failed to establish that he acted without privilege in refusing police entry into his father\u2019s home and that the police officer was engaged in an authorized act and lawful duty at the time. William was convicted of obstructing official business in violation of Akron Codified Ordinance 136.11, which provides, \u201cNo person, without privilege to do so and with purpose to prevent, obstruct, or delay the performance by a public official of any authorized act within his official capacity, shall do any act which hampers or impedes a public official in the performance of his lawful duties.\u201d The police officer in this case appeared at the residence without a warrant. The Fourth Amendment confers the constitutional right upon a defendant to refuse to consent to a warrantless entry, and the assertion of this right cannot be a crime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>Camara v. Mun. Court </em>(1967), 387 U.S. 523, 530-540, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">{\u00b6 15} The state responds that William cannot assert a privilege because he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his father\u2019s home and because the evidence does not establish that he was an overnight guest or otherwise had any proprietary interest in the home. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable intrusions into an area in which the individual attempting to invoke the Fourth Amendment protection has an actual subjective expectation of privacy, which, when viewed objectively, is justifiable under the circumstances of the case. <em>State v. Robinson </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 490, 494, 659 N.E.2d 1292, citing <em>Smith v. Maryland </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 735, 740, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220. William maintains that he was an invited guest at his father\u2019s home, and that he has sufficient contact and control over Walter\u2019s residence to create a legitimate expectation of privacy in the home. A host\u2019s ultimate control of his home does not obviate the possibility that a guest in his home may have a legitimate expectation of privacy even though the guest does not have a legal interest or authority to determine who enters the home. <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>(1990), 495 U.S. 91, 99, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85. \u201cA subjective expectation of privacy is legitimate if it is \u201c\u2018one that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at 95-96, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85, citing <em>Katz v. United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576. William maintains that his expectation of privacy in his father\u2019s home is one that society would be willing to recognize as legitimate and thus is protected by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">{\u00b6 16} William does not live with Walter. However, the nature of the time he spends at Walter\u2019s home is closer in character to that of an overnight guest. William has the responsibility of providing Walter\u2019s home care. William comes to the home to take care of Walter, with whom he has a strong relationship. Furthermore, William\u2019s care-giving responsibilities to Walter and Walter Jr. necessitate that he spend frequent and lengthy periods at the home. Walter has dementia, is bedridden and cannot walk, and has difficulty feeding and cleaning himself. Additionally, William watches over his brother, Walter Jr., who has a mental disorder and lives with his bedridden father. William was not at the home to pursue some sort of business venture or for his own use; rather, he was there because he played an integral role in Walter\u2019s well being and survival. Cf. <em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>(1998), 525 U.S. 83, 91, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373. Thus, we disagree with the state\u2019s position and conclude that William did indeed have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his father\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Although William did not protest the officer\u2019s presence at his front door, his subsequent attempt to close the door constituted an exercise of his privilege to refuse entry and the termination of any consensual encounter. See, e.g., <em>State v. Cummings </em>(Jan. 16, 2002), 9th Dist. No. 20609, 2002 WL 57979, at *11. Without a warrant, the officer needed more than the mere possibility of harm to justify entering over William\u2019s objection. The police officer conceded at trial that he did not have knowledge of whether the phone call received by the dispatcher had been verified for legitimacy. There is no indication that an inquiry was made into the reliability of the informant who made the call. William insisted that he was not the one who had called EMS or the police initially; he noted that there was a possibility that either Walter or Walter Jr. may have tried to contact EMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">{\u00b6 18} It is clear that an emergency did not exist at the residence; the call did not suggest that there was an imminent need to save a life or avoid serious injury. See <em>State v. Applegate </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 348, 349, 626 N.E.2d 942.-While the EMS was dispatched to the scene as well, it did not arrive until after the police officer had already encountered William and had engaged him in what became an argumentative conversation and physical struggle. While the police officer did eventually make his way up to the second floor to see Walter, once he got to Walter, he could do no more than simply <em>ask </em>Walter whether he was all right. The police officer did not examine him or ask him any medical questions, and rightly so; such a task was appropriately left to the EMS to handle. Given the information relayed to the officer, there was no emergent medical need that he could satisfy. Furthermore, other than William\u2019s nervous pacing back and forth in front of the door while contemplating how to handle the police officer\u2019s presence, there is nothing in the testimony to indicate that anything suspicious or criminal was occurring at the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 19} Another officer who had been at the scene testified as to the commonality of answering calls to check someone\u2019s welfare. Certainly, if a call is made that indicates a medical emergency or the possibility of imminent death, such a situation may warrant taking any action necessary to enter the home and check the individual. However, that scenario was not present here. Walter was not alone. He was being attended to by William, who attested to his father\u2019s physical state and, as even the caller had stated, had made calls to Walter\u2019s physician to seek medical help. Cf. <em>State v. Russell </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 414, 418, 713 N.E.2d 56 (no response when law enforcement knocked on the door of a missing person). William testified that the family frequently made calls to Walter\u2019s physician for medical assistance. William did testify that no one in the family made a call to the doctor the day the officer came to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the state failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that William was acting without a privilege and that the police officer\u2019s entry into the home was lawful. See <em>Leggett, </em>9th Dist. No. 18803, at 3-4; Akron Codified Ordinance 136.11. Therefore, we find that William\u2019s conviction for obstructing official business is not supported by sufficient evidence. Accordingly, William\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The city of Akron violated Section 3, Article XVIII, of the Ohio Constitution when it enacted Akron Codified Ordinance \u00a7 136.13 [resisting arrest] as it conflicts with R.C. \u00a7 2921.33 in permitting convictions where the arrest was not proven to be lawful. Since the Akron ordinance under which appellant Callaway was convicted is unconstitutional, his conviction was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">{\u00b621} In his second assignment of error, William asserts that Akron Codified Ordinance 136.13 is unconstitutional because it is in conflict with R.C. 2921.33, resisting arrest, and that therefore, his conviction for resisting arrest is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">{\u00b6 22} William presents a constitutional challenge that he did not raise at the trial court level and that he therefore did not properly preserve for appeal. \u201cConstitutional rights may be lost as finally as any others by a failure to assert them at the proper time. * * * Accordingly, the question of the constitutionality of [an ordinance] must generally be raised at the first opportunity and, in a criminal prosecution, this means in the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 122, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277. Because William raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we decline to address it. See id. at syllabus. William\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">{\u00b6 23} William\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained. William\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled. The conviction in the Akron Municipal Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-13\">Whitmore, P.J., and Moore, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\">. The officer also encountered William's brother, Walter Callaway Jr., during this series of events inside the residence. The two engaged in a scuffle, and Walter Jr. was also eventually charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
