The issues presented on appeal are confined to the domestic relations court\u2019s division and distribution of properties or interests therein that the parties owned when their marriage terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 2} Linda and Joseph Maloney were married on September 20, 1991. Both brought considerable assets to the marriage. Joseph\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> included a partnership interest in the Brower Insurance Company, common stock, accounts of deposit, and real property. Linda\u2019s included accounts of deposit and a beneficial interest in a family trust. Both parties earned incomes during the marriage, and the value of their assets increased as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">{\u00b6 3} Joseph and Linda agreed as to how certain of their properties would be divided, and the trial court adopted their agreement. Their contentions on appeal concern only those other properties or interests the court necessarily divided on its own findings, which were incorporated into the final decree from which Joseph appealed and Linda cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\n<em>Joseph Maloney\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">{\u00b6 4} The first assignment of error reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred when it awarded the wife the sum of $78,370.00 of husband\u2019s interest in Brower Insurance Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">{\u00b6 6} The Brower Insurance Company (\u201cBrower\u201d) is an insurance brokerage partnership. Joseph is employed by Brower as an agent-salesperson, for which he is paid commissions on the sales he makes. He also owns a partnership interest. Joseph receives dividends from Brower on its profits in proportion to his partnership interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court found that the value of Joseph\u2019s seven percent partnership interest in Brower when the parties were married in 1991 was $455,000 and that the value of his 8.38 percent interest in Brower when the marriage terminated by the parties\u2019 separation in 2000 was $611,174. The difference, $156,174, was determined to be marital property, and on that basis, the court divided it equally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>each party to receive $78,370. Joseph was ordered to pay that amount to Linda. He was awarded the 1991 value of his partnership interest as his separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"> {\u00b6 8} Whether property is marital or separate is a question committed to the sound discretion of the domestic relations court, and its determinations will not be reversed on appeal absent a finding that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Neville v. Neville, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 275, 2003-Ohio-3624, 791 N.E.2d 434. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. The abuse of discretion standard is satisfied if there is no sound reasoning process that would support the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 553 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 9} The increase in the value of Joseph\u2019s partnership interest in Brower during the marriage is attributable to two factors. One is his purchase of additional partnership shares, which increased his share of the partnership from a seven percent interest at the time of marriage to an 8.38 percent interest when the parties separated. The other factor was the increase in the capitalized value of each one percent partnership share in Brower, including Joseph\u2019s, from $65,000 per share when the parties married in 1991 to $73,0000 per share when they separated in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{\u00b6 10} Joseph owned a Touchstone money market account (\u201cTouchstone Account\u201d) when the parties were married in 1991. The court found that the account balance was then $100,210. Joseph offered evidence showing that during the marriage, he had deposited dividends he received as a Brower partner in the Touchstone Account and that he used those proceeds along with the remainder of the account\u2019s 1991 premarital balance to purchase the additional 1.38 percent partnership share in Brower that he acquired during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 11} Joseph argues that the additional interest in Brower he acquired is his separate property because it was purchased (1) with funds from the premarital balance in the Touchstone Account, which is his separate property, and (2) with dividends from Brower representing passive income on and appreciation of his premarital partnership interest, which is likewise his separate property. Therefore, according to Joseph, the trial court abused its discretion when it found that the 1.38 percent additional interest in Brower he acquired during the marriage is marital property and then divided its value, requiring him to pay Linda $78,370 for the one-half interest the court awarded her.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Any \u201c[p]assive income and appreciation acquired from separate property by one spouse during the marriage\u201d is the separate property of that spouse. R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(iii). \u201cPassive income\u201d means income acquired other than as a result of the labor, monetary, or in-kind contribution of either spouse. R.C. 3109.171(A)(4). Therefore, \u201call income and appreciation on separate property, due to the labor, monetary, or in-kind contribution of <em>either or both of the spouses </em>that occurred during the marriage\u201d is marital property. (Emphasis added.) R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a)(iii). That section \u201cunambiguously mandates that when either spouse makes a labor, money, or in-kind contribution that causes an increase in the value of separate property, that increase in value is deemed marital property.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>Middendorf v. Middendorf </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 397 at 400, 696 N.E.2d 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 13} Joseph is not only a partner in Brower. He is also one of a number of agent-salespersons that Brower employs. John Barron, one of the other Brower partners, testified that Joseph\u2019s effort, skill, and productivity in selling insurance generated profits for Brower and contributed to the increased value of the partnership. That effort is consistent with Brower\u2019s requirement of each partner that he \u201cdevote his time and effort to advancing and rendering profitable the interest of said partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 14} It appears from the record that the January 1991 balance in Joseph\u2019s Touchstone Account was depleted through other transactions and that Joseph necessarily applied dividends he received from Brower and deposited into the Touchstone Account to purchase his additional 1.38 percent interest in Brower. Though the record shows exactly the extent of Joseph\u2019s interest in the partnership that generated the dividends and the amount of those dividends, it does not reflect the extent of his contribution to Brower\u2019s profitability from which the dividends were paid. Joseph was not the only salesperson partner who generated profits, but their relatively small number \u2014 fewer than ten \u2014 supports a conclusion that Joseph\u2019s contribution was not merely nominal, but tangible.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court reasonably could find that the Brower dividends Joseph deposited into the Touchstone Account and that he used to purchase his additional partnership interest, as well as the increase in the capitalized value of the partnership shares Joseph purchased with those dividends, were derived from profits realized by Brower which were, at least in part, attributable to Joseph\u2019s own labor and therefore marital property that the court was required to divide between Joseph and Linda. <em>Middendorf. </em>We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s classification and division of the additional interest Joseph acquired in Brower during the marriage as marital property, which supports the court\u2019s award to Linda of her one-half share of the value of that marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">{\u00b6 16} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>{\u00b6 17} The second assignment of error follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred when it concluded that Cincinnati Financial and Citizens Utilities stocks are the only non-marital property of the husband in his Morgan Stanley account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 19} Joseph owned a Morgan Stanley common stock account when the parties separated. The account included stocks of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and Citizens Utilities that Joseph owned prior to marriage. The court awarded him those stocks as his separate property. The Morgan Stanley account also includes stocks in Oracle Corp., Reynolds &amp; Reynolds, and Glaxco Corp., which Joseph purchased during the marriage. The court found that those stocks are marital property and ordered their value divided. Joseph argues that the trial court erred because these stocks are traceable to his separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"ANG\">{\u00b6 20} Any property or an interest therein that either spouse owns when the marriage terminates is presumed to be marital property. R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a). Marital property must be divided per R.C. 3105.171(B) and (C), unless it is one of the seven forms of separate property identified in R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a), which must instead be disbursed to the spouse who owns it. R.C. 3105.171(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">{\u00b6 21} Property is classified as separate by R.C 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(i) through (vii) according to the way in which it was acquired. The form in which the property is held is generally immaterial. However, \u201c[t]he commingling of separate property with other property of any type does not destroy the identity of the separate property as separate property, except when the separate property is not traceable.\u201d R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cTraceable\u201d is an adjective. As it is used in R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(b), traceable refers to evidence demonstrating a connection between property currently owned and some antecedent article of separate property. Such proof overcomes the effect of commingling, by which separate property may be \u201ctransmuted\u201d into marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">{\u00b6 23} A party who claims that property is traceable to his separate property has, as with any separate property claim, the burden to prove that proposition by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Peck v. Peck </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 731, 645 N.E.2d 1300; <em>Tupler v. Tupler </em>(Jan. 12, 1994), Hamilton App. Nos. C-920852 and C-920887, 1994 WL 6003. Oral testimony as evidence, without corroboration, may or may not satisfy the burden. <em>Fisher v. Fisher </em>(Dec. 23, 2004), Montgomery App. No. 20398. Because traceability presents a question of fact, we must give deference to the trial court\u2019s findings, and the court\u2019s decision on the matter will not be reversed as against the manifest weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>evidence when it is supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 24} Joseph purchased the Glaxco stock in February 1993 with funds drawn from his Touchstone Account. There is evidence that marital property, in the form of Joseph\u2019s Brower dividends, had been added to the account when he purchased the Glaxco stock. However, there is also evidence that the premarital property remaining in the account balance was then sufficient to cover the $3,900 that Joseph withdrew from the Touchstone Account to pay for the Glaxco stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 25} Joseph argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it divided the Glaxco stock as marital property because he offered evidence tracing it to the premarital balance in his Touchstone Account. The trial court made no specific finding rejecting that proposition. We might therefore find that the court necessarily rejected the traceability contention, relying on the fact that the Touchstone Account then contained marital property. However, that reasoning necessarily would ignore the traceability exception to the principle of commingling in R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(b). Therefore, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s order dividing the Glaxco stock and remand the case for findings on the claim of traceability and for further orders as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 26} The Reynolds &amp; Reynolds and Oracle stocks present a similar traceability issue, but with a different background. Those stocks were purchased in 1997, six years after the marriage commenced. Joseph argues that they are traceable to his separate property because they were purchased with funds derived from accumulated dividends and redemption proceeds generated by other securities he owned prior to the marriage. Those transactions took place through several other stock funds that Joseph successively owned and eventually closed when he opened the Morgan Stanley account in 1997, which he funded in 1998 with funds withdrawn from his Touchstone Account.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{\u00b6 27} Unlike in <em>Fisher v. Fisher, </em>the court did not reject Joseph\u2019s traceability claim on a finding that he had failed to prove a necessary link in the chain of events that he sought to prove. Indeed, the court did not address the traceability claim at all. However, unlike the purchase of the Glaxco stock, the Reynolds &amp; Reynolds and the Oracle stocks were purchased many years after the marriage began and through a complex series of transactions. A traceability claim imposes a burden of persuasion as well as a burden of proof. We are satisfied that the court could reasonably reject Joseph\u2019s traceability claim for a failure on both propositions. No abuse of discretion is demonstrated, therefore, in the division of the Reynolds &amp; Reynolds and the Oracle stocks as marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 28} The second assignment of error is sustained in part and overruled in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>{\u00b6 29} The third assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred when it awarded the wife the sum of $92,373.00 of the husband\u2019s Touchstone Account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court found that Joseph\u2019s Touchstone Account had a balance of $387,856 when the parties separated, which the court adopted as the date the marriage terminated for purposes of division of the account as marital property. R.C. 3105.171(A)(2)(b). The court awarded Joseph $203,110 of that balance as his separate property and divided the remaining $184,746 between the parties as marital property, awarding Linda $92,373 as her one-half interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 32} Joseph argues that the trial court erred when it found that $184,746 of the Touchstone Account balance is marital property. He presents three contentions in support of that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 33} First, Joseph contends that the $184,746 balance includes $12,000 in repayments he received during the marriage on a loan he had made prior to the marriage, which represents a repayment of separate property he owned prior to marriage and to which he is entitled per R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(ii). Linda responds that the actual balance in the Touchstone Account when the parties separated was $400,544, referring to Def. Exhibit 10, which suggests that the court may have allowed Joseph to retain the $12,000 in loan proceeds when it valued the account instead at $387,856.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">{\u00b6 34} We find no support in the record for Linda\u2019s contention. Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 10 reflects the $387,856 ending value for the Touchstone Account that the trial court used. Further, the court\u2019s particular findings make no mention of the $12,000 loan repayment. Linda does not question that those proceeds were deposited into the Touchstone Account. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to take account of the loan repayments, overvaluing the marital property portion of the Touchstone Account by $12,000 as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">{\u00b6 35} Second, Joseph argues that portions of the Touchstone Account that derive from his Brower dividends are his separate property, which the trial court should not have divided with Linda. We have found no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s classification of the Brower dividends as marital property. Therefore, this contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">{\u00b6 36} Third, Joseph contends that $38,453.66 of the proceeds in the Touchstone Account derive from his Morgan Stanley account, to which that amount had been transferred from his pre-marital Everen Account. Joseph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>argues that \u201c[i]t is an abuse of discretion for the trial court to find that the tracing of cash from a non-marital securities account is not separate property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 37} Joseph\u2019s trail of financial transactions has been highly complex. We have reviewed the portion of the record on which he relies and cannot find that it supports his contention that the trial court abused its discretion when it rejected his contention that $38,453.40 of the balance in the Touchstone Account is traceable to Joseph\u2019s premarital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 38} The third assignment of error is sustained in part and overruled in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 39} The fourth assignment of error reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred when it determined that the two (2) undeveloped lots located at 588 Tait Road in the sole name of the husband were marital property and should be listed for sale and sold with the proceeds being divided equally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b6 41} Joseph purchased the two lots on Tait Road during the marriage. He argues that because the lots were purchased with dividends he received from Brower, they are traceable to his separate property and are therefore not marital property. We have found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the Brower dividends were marital property. Therefore, the trial court correctly found that the two lots are marital property to be divided with Linda.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 42} The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">{\u00b6 43} The fifth assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred when it failed to consider tax payments made by Mr. Maloney as a marital debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">{\u00b6 45} R.C. 3105.171(C)(1) charges the domestic relations court with making an equitable division of marital and separate property, which includes any and all property or an interest therein that the parties own, determined as of the date of the final hearing or another date that the court determines would be more equitable for purposes of determining marital property. R.C. 3105.171(A)(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">{\u00b6 46} The court divided the portion of the Touchstone Account that it determined was marital property on the basis of its value on December 29, 2000. Joseph argues that the court should have reduced the marital property portion of the account by the value of payments he made from the account on the parties\u2019 joint tax obligations after the parties separated on August 22, 2000. Joseph made $14,000 in tax payments in September 2000 and $11,000 in tax payments in December 2000 from monies in the Touchstone Account. Both dates precede the date the court adopted pursuant to R.C. 3105.171(A)(2)(b) for valuing the Touch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>stone Account. Inasmuch as these payments merely depleted the marital funds that could be divided, Joseph is not due a credit of those amounts as his own separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 47} Joseph paid $54,000 in joint tax obligations with monies in the Touchstone Account in April 2001, subsequent to the date the court had determined would be equitable for purposes of division of the account as marital property. Joseph testified that the payment was made on the parties\u2019 joint tax obligation for the year 2000. If so, the payment of Linda\u2019s share of the tax obligation came out of Joseph\u2019s one-half share of the marital funds in the account. Linda argues that the $54,000 payment Joseph made did not reflect a joint obligation and that it may have been a quarterly payment of taxes for the year 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 48} Joint debts are not property or an interest in property the domestic relations court must equally divide between the spouses. R.C. 3105.171(B). They represent merely a charge against the marital property that the court divides. The court may then order one of the parties to pay some or all of the joint debt out of his or her share of marital property or out of the separate property disbursed to that spouse. The court does not abuse its discretion by allocating the debts between the parties on an unequal basis, so long as the allocation is equitable. On this record, no abuse of discretion is shown in requiring Joseph to pay the joint tax obligation from the separate and marital property in the Touchstone Account that the court had awarded him.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 49} The fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 50} The sixth assignment of error follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred when it awarded the wife all her interest in her Bank One savings account, her Bank One personal checking account and the Bank One trust account in the name of Steven Cook, trustee, for the sole benefit of the wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 52} Linda\u2019s father, Jim Cook, owns and operates South Town Self Storage, where Linda has been employed as a manager. South Town leases the real property on which it operates from High Acres Limited Partnership, which was established by Linda\u2019s parents. In 1994, a 26 percent share of High Acres Limited Partnership was conveyed to Jim Cook, as trustee, for the benefit of Linda. The conveyance was a gift. Linda receives income from the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">{\u00b6 53} R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a) defines marital property to include all real and personal property or an interest therein that \u201ccurrently is owned\u201d or which \u201ceither or both of the parties currently has.\u201d Gifts that one spouse receives during the marriage are that spouse\u2019s separate property. R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>3105.171(A)(6)(a)(vii). Passive income from and appreciation on the value of a gift is likewise that spouse\u2019s separate property. R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(iii). However, any income from or appreciation on the value of the gift that is due to the labor or other contribution of either spouse is marital property. R.C. 3105.171 (A) (3) (a) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 54} Joseph offered evidence showing that the value of Linda\u2019s 26 percent beneficial trust increased from $754,000 in 1994, when it was created, to $1,040,000 in 2000. There was also evidence that Linda had worked at the storage facility owned by the trust as a manager during that time. Joseph argues that the court abused its discretion when the court failed to find that the increase in value, $286,000, is marital property to be divided with Joseph because it is the product of Linda\u2019s work as manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 55} The $286,000 increase in the capitalized value of Linda\u2019s trust does not represent any bank account balance, which is the particular focus of this assignment of error. Nevertheless, because Linda\u2019s interest in the trust is the basis for the claims on her accounts of deposit Joseph makes, we -will address whether the trust is marital property the court is charged by R.C. 3105.171 to divide.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 56} R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a) defines marital property in the broadest terms to include any property that either spouse currently owns or \u201chas.\u201d However, even if the court had found that Linda \u201chas\u201d an interest in the corpus of the trust of which she is a beneficiary, the court could not order her to pay any part of the increase in the value of the trust to Joseph because she lacks that power and authority. The power and authority to do that are reserved to the trustee, Jim Cook, who is not a party to this action. He might have been joined for that purpose pursuant to Civ.R. 75(B)(1) as a \u201cperson * * * having possession of * * * or claiming an interest in property * * * out of which a party seeks a division of marital property,\u201d but he was not so joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 57} The domestic relations court is a court of equity and has \u201cfull equitable powers and jurisdiction appropriate to the determination of all domestic relations matters.\u201d R.C. 3105.011. The court could have credited Joseph in its other divisions of marital property with an amount representing the appreciation in the value of her trust resulting from Linda\u2019s labor as manager of the South Towne Self Storage facility. However, and unlike Joseph\u2019s contribution to the profits of Brower, there is no evidence showing that any increase in the value of the High Acres Limited Partnership or the interest in it owned by Linda\u2019s trust was \u201cdue to\u201d her labor as a manager in any material respect. Joseph\u2019s mere assertion that her efforts \u201chave increased the value\u201d of either is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>{\u00b6 58} With respect to Linda\u2019s bank accounts, Joseph argues that \u201cthe Appellate Court should find that all distributions from High Acres Limited Partnership due to Mrs. Maloney\u2019s efforts and deposited in Mr. Maloney\u2019s bank accounts are marital property.\u201d The trial court awarded Linda as her separate property a Bank One Savings account with a balance of $82,606, an account owned by Steven Cook as trustee for Linda\u2019s benefit with a balance of $196,000, and her personal checking account. Joseph states that the checking account had a balance of $6,160.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 59} The trust\u2019s bank account, like the trust itself, is not marital property. Joseph contends that the other two accounts necessarily contain deposits of money that Linda earned during the marriage, which is marital property. However, he does not support his contention with citations to the record showing that any such deposits were made. See App.R. 16(A)(7). Therefore, we must rely on the presumptions of regularity and as a result cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion when it awarded the balances in those accounts to Linda as her separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 60} The sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 61} The seventh assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred when it failed to acknowledge the $286,000.00 increase in value of wife\u2019s interest in High Acres Limited Partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 63} This assignment of error repeats the contentions in the sixth assignment of error, but with respect to her brother\u2019s beneficial interest in the family trust that Linda holds as trustee. That Linda is trustee for her brother presents no basis to find that his trust is property she \u201cowns\u201d or \u201chas\u201d and is therefore marital property per R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a), which the court must divide.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 64} The seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">{\u00b6 65} The eighth assignment of error reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred when it failed to acknowledge a payment of $42,000.00 from the employer of Mrs. Maloney as marital property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cAny gift of real or personal property * * * that is made after the date of the marriage and that is proven by clear and convincing evidence to have been given to only one spouse\u201d is the separate property of that spouse. R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>{\u00b6 68} Linda received a check for $42,000 from her father in 1997, drawn on the account of South Towne Self Storage. Joseph does not contend that it was a joint gift to both Linda and him. Rather, he contends that it was not a gift at all, but additional compensation for Linda\u2019s services as manager. If so, it is income which, if it yet exists in the form of property, is marital property that must be divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">{\u00b6 69} The clear and convincing evidence standard in R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(vii) doesn\u2019t apply to the issue presented, which is whether the $42,000 was a gift or income. Instead, that issue is to be determined on the preponderance-of-theevidenee standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 70} Linda testified that the payment was a gift, not income. There is evidence that, consistent with the purposes of her parents\u2019 complex estate plan, Linda deposited the $42,000 into an account into which she had deposited other gifts from her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 71} There is some competent, credible evidence that supports the trial court\u2019s finding. No abuse of discretion is demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 72} The eighth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\n<em>Linda Maloney\u2019s Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 73} The first cross-assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred in only awarding wife $78,370.00 for her share of the marital portion of husband\u2019s interest in Brower Insurance Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">{\u00b6 75} The trial court awarded Joseph as his separate property the seven percent partnership share in Brower that he owned prior to the marriage, and it divided as marital property the additional 1.38 percent partnership share he acquired during the marriage. Linda attacks the awards on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">{\u00b6 76} First, Linda argues that the court undervalued the marital property portion of Joseph\u2019s final 8.38 percent interest in Brower. After the parties married, Joseph sold 0.42 percent of his premarital seven percent interest in Brower, reducing his interest to a 6.58 percent interest in Brower. He later purchased an additional 1.8 percent in Brower during the marriage, bringing his total interest in Brower when the marriage terminated to an 8.38 percent interest. The court divided the value of the 1.38 percent difference between Joseph\u2019s premarital and final interests as marital property. Linda argues that the court should instead have divided the entire 1.8 percent portion Joseph purchased during the marriage as marital property, reducing the separate property portion of his interest to the balance of the 8.38 percent he finally owned, or 6.58 percent of Brower.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>{\u00b6 77} R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a)(i) defines marital property to include all real or personal property or an interest therein that either spouse owns \u201cand that was acquired by either or both of the spouses during the marriage.\u201d If Joseph acquired a 1.8 percent interest in Brower during the marriage, with marital funds, it is marital property that must be divided pursuant to R.C. 3105.171(C)(1), irrespective of what he owned prior to the marriage. Therefore, the court abused its discretion when it divided only the 1.38 percent portion of his Brower interest as marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 78} Second, Linda argues that Joseph\u2019s remaining 6.58 percent interest in Brower is not his separate property because it was acquired with marital funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 79} Joseph purchased his seven percent interest in Brower prior to the marriage with $173,352 in loans from three Brower partners: J. Norman Eckstein, Charles Castle, and William Thompson. Joseph repaid some or all of these loans after the parties were married, using funds from his Touchstone Account.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 80} When property is acquired by one spouse prior to marriage, using borrowed funds that are repaid during the marriage, using marital funds for the repayment, the property is not separate but marital, to the extent of the repayments made. <em>McLeod v. McLeod, </em>Lake App. No. 2000-L-197, 2002-Ohio-3710, 2002 WL 1627834.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 81} From the record, it appears that Joseph made a loan repayment from the Touchstone Account prior to December 29,1991, and several later, in October 1992. Linda argues that all were made using marital funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">{\u00b6 82} If, when Joseph made any of these loan repayments, the premarital balance in the Touchstone Account was insufficient to cover the amount paid, the repayment was necessarily made with marital funds, at least to the extent of the insufficiency. In that event, the portion of his Brower partnership interest that was purchased with the amount loaned and repaid is likewise marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">{\u00b6 83} On remand, the court must determine whether when the loan repayments were made the premarital balance in the account was sufficient to cover the repayments. If not, the portion of Joseph\u2019s interest in Brower that the repayment represents is marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">{\u00b6 84} Third, Linda argues that the trial court failed to consider the value of Brower\u2019s capital account and Joseph\u2019s share in it when the court valued his interest in Brower.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">{\u00b6 85} The Amendment to the Articles of Co-Partnership of Brower states: \u2018We, being all the partners of the Brower Insurance Agency, P.L.L., hereby value the equity of the same property, <em>excluding our capital accounts, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>$7,300,000.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court found that Joseph\u2019s 8.38 percent interest in Brower was worth 8.38 percent of $7,300,000, or $611,740.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 86} John Barron, Joseph\u2019s partner, testified that the Brower partnership was worth $7,300,000, but he was unable to offer any evidence concerning the partners\u2019 capital accounts. Linda\u2019s expert, Alan Duvall, testified that, based on Brower\u2019s financial statements, Joseph\u2019s interest in Brower was worth an additional $161,000 when the value of his share of Brower\u2019s capital account is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 87} If the valuation of Brower and Joseph\u2019s share of that value did not include his capital account, then the court undervalued the portion of Joseph\u2019s interest in Brower that is divisible as marital property. On remand, the court must determine whether the value it found did or did not include Joseph\u2019s capital account and enter judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">{\u00b6 88} The first cross-assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 89} The second cross-assignment of error reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred in only awarding wife $92,373.00 for her half of the marital interest in the touchstone money market account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">{\u00b6 91} Linda argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it awarded $101,210 of the Touchstone Account to Joseph as his separate property on a finding that it was traceable to his premarital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">{\u00b6 92} The parties were married on September 20, 1991. The $101,210 the court awarded Joseph was the balance in the Touchstone Account on December 29,1991, over three months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">{\u00b6 93} Marital property includes all real and personal property that was acquired by either spouse during the marriage. R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a)(i). \u201cDuring the marriage\u201d means \u201cthe period of time from the date of the marriage through the date of the final hearing in an action for divorce.\u201d R.C. 3105.171(A)(2)(a). However, if the court determines that adoption of either date would be inequitable, it may adopt another date or dates it \u201cconsiders equitable in determining marital property.\u201d R.C. 3105.171(A)(2)(b). Whether to choose a date other than the date of the final hearing to determine when the marriage has ended is, therefore, a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">{\u00b6 94} Linda argues that she was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s use of the December 29, 1991 date to determine the premarital value of the Touchstone Account. She points out that its balance at the beginning of December 1991 was $79,396, which indicates that deposits were made prior to achieving the December 29, 1991 balance of $101,210 that could have been from marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>{\u00b6 95} The court made no finding that determining the premarital balance of the Touchstone Account as of the date of the marriage, September 10, 1991, would be inequitable, or that December 29, 1991, would be a more equitable date for the determination. Neither does the record portray a reason for such a choice that reasonably may. be inferred. It may be that the court adopted the December 29, 1991 date as a matter of convenience, absent evidence of the balance in the account on September 10, 1991. However, such a choice could deprive Linda of her right to share in marital property added to the account between the two dates and reward Joseph for any failure on his part to produce more relevant proof of the account\u2019s premarital balance, which was his burden as the proponent of the separate property claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 96} We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it adopted a date other than the date of the marriage for determining the separate property portion of the Touchstone Account to be disbursed to Joseph, absent a finding that using the date of the marriage would be inequitable and that another date used would be equitable. R.C. 3105.171(A)(2). The determination will be reversed, and on remand, the court should either explain why the date it used would be more equitable or, if it does not, require proof from Joseph of the September 10, 1991 balance if his separate property claim is to be sustained. This determination may, of course, likewise require modification of several other of the findings the court made with respect to the Touchstone account.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">{\u00b6 97} The second cross-assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">{\u00b6 98} The third cross-assignment of error follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 99} \u201cThe Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations erred in awarding the Moraine Country Club membership to husband free and clear of any claims of wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">{\u00b6 100} On February 13, 1999, Joseph purchased a nonrefundable membership in the Moraine Country Club for $26,000 with monies from the Touchstone Account. The court awarded the membership to Joseph. The court declined to credit Linda one-half, the $26,000 that had been paid to purchase the membership, reasoning that the membership is not a divisible asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">{\u00b6 101} Marital property includes all property, real and personal, that either party owns and all interest that either party has in any real or personal property. R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(i) and (ii). When property is marital, the court must divide it equally, unless an equal division would be inequitable, in which event the court \u201cshall divide it between the spouses in the manner the court determines equitable.\u201d R.C. 3105.171(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">{\u00b6 102} The court could not divide the single membership between Joseph and Linda, and so an award of the membership to Joseph is equitable. However, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>does not follow that Linda is then not to be compensated for one-half of the value of the membership. Even though in this circumstance it \u201chas\u201d a value only to the spouse to whom it was awarded, if Joseph elects to retain the membership, Linda is entitled to one-half of the 1996 purchase price. The court is authorized by R.C. 3105.171(E)(2) to make a distributive award of that amount to Linda from Joseph\u2019s separate property in order to effectuate the division of the membership the court ordered. The court abused its discretion when it failed to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">{\u00b6 103} The third cross-assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">{\u00b6 104} Having sustained Joseph Maloney\u2019s assignments of error in part and all of Linda Maloney\u2019s cross-assignments of error, we will reverse the judgment from which the appeal was taken in part and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-9\">Wolff and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-14\">.
