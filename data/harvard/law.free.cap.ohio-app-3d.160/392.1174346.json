Because we conclude that appellee was entitled to summary judgment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Diane Malhas, brought a declaratory judgment action against appellee, American Family Insurance (\u201cAFI\u201d) to determine whether she had coverage under her UIM policy for claims deriving from the death of her sister, Denise Salmanpoor. The death resulted from a motor vehicle accident caused by another person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company paid the policy limit of $100,000 to Salmanpoor\u2019s eight beneficiaries, including appellant, who received approximately $8,000. Appellant then sought additional compensation through her own UIM automobile policy issued by AFI. Appellant and appellee filed cross-motions for summary judgment. AFI sought summary judgment as to appellant on these bases: (1) UIM coverage was limited to claims suffered by \u201cinsured\u201d persons who had suffered bodily injury or death and Salmanpoor was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy and (2) appellant had filed her claim beyond the policy\u2019s required two-year limitation period. Appellant claimed that she was entitled to coverage based upon the holding in <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 431, 23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 3} The trial court ultimately denied appellant\u2019s summary-judgment motion but granted summary judgment to AFI, determining that although AFI had not definitively established that Salmanpoor was not a relative under the policy, appellant\u2019s claim was time barred according to the policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">{\u00b6 4} Malhas now appeals from that judgment, setting forth the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cA. The trial court erred when it failed to find that the plaintiff is entitled to coverage for the death of Denise Salmanpoor, under her underinsurance policy, pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Sexton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cB. The trial court erred when it failed to determine that the plaintiff was entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits up to the limits of her policy.</p>\n<p id=\"ANf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201cC. The trial court erred when it held plaintiff Malhas\u2019s claim was barred by a two-year statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 8} In her first assignment of error, appellant essentially argues that the trial court erred in denying her summary-judgment motion by failing to find that she had coverage for her UIM claims pursuant to R.C. 3937.18 and the holding of <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 431, 23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 9} The standard of review of a grant or denial of summary judgment is the same for both a trial court and an appellate court. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198. Summary judgment will be granted if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, <em>answers to interrogatories, </em>written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, * * * show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and, construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the non-moving party, reasonable minds can only conclude \u201cthat the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\"> {\u00b6 10} A motion for summary judgment first compels the moving party to inform the court of the basis of the motion and to identify portions in the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. If the moving party satisfies that burden, the nonmoving party must then produce evidence as to any issue for which that party bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 295, 662 N.E.2d 264, limiting <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus. An appellate court reviews summary judgments de novo \u2014 that is, independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Brewer v. Cleveland City Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 383, 701 N.E.2d 1023; <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 622 N.E.2d 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 11} We must first determine who was an \u201cinsured\u201d under Malhas\u2019s insurance policy. The UIM policy endorsement provides that an \u201cinsured person\u201d is:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201ca. You or a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cb. Anyone else occupying your insured car.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cc. Anyone, other than a person or organization claiming any right of assignment or subrogation, entitled to recover damages due to bodily injury to you, a relative or another occupant of your insured car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">{\u00b6 15} The AFI general policy defines \u201cyou and your\u201d to mean the policyholder named in the declarations and spouse, if living in the same household. \u201cRelative\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>is defined as \u201ca person living in your household, related to you by blood, marriage or adoption.\u201d (Boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 16} On the AFI declarations page, Malhas is the only person listed as the \u201cpolicy holder/named insured.\u201d In an answer to an interrogatory, she acknowledged that, at the time of the accident, the members of her household were herself and her daughter. Therefore, since Salmanpoor was not listed as a named insured on the declarations page, was not a \u201crelative,\u201d and did not otherwise qualify, she is not a an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy. Therefore, any UIM claim may be asserted only by Malhas herself as an \u201cinsured person\u201d and not as a \u201cconduit\u201d claim through Salmanpoor, who was <em>not </em>an \u201cinsured person.\u201d We will now determine whether Malhas herself was entitled to UIM coverage for any claims under the AFI policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 17} Prior to September 2000, the Supreme Court of Ohio had found that various former versions of R.C. 3937.18(A) did not permit an insurer to limit its UIM coverage to claims for \u201cbodily injuries\u201d to an insured. <em>Sexton, </em>supra, at 435-436, 23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555. The court stated that the attempt to limit the UIM coverage was contrary to the purpose of the statute and an attempt to \u201cthwart the legislative intent.\u201d Id. In February 2000, after several revisions, the Supreme Court still found R.C. 3937.18(A) to be ambiguous as to the legislative intent and declined to enforce an insurer\u2019s limitations on uninsured and UIM coverage. <em>Moore v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 27, 32-33, 723 N.E.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 18} At the time that appellant\u2019s insurance policy was issued, March 1, 2001, the again amended version of R.C. 3937.18(A)(2) provided the following regarding UIM coverage:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(2) Underinsured motorist coverage * * * shall provide protection for insureds thereunder for bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, suffered by any person insured under the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 20} The legislative comment following the text of the statute states:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly in amending division (A) of section 3937.18 of the Revised Code to supersede the holdings of the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 431 [23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555], and <em>Moore v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 27 [723 N.E.2d 97], that division A(l) of section 3937.18 of the Revised Code does not permit an insurer to limit uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage in such a way that an insured must suffer bodily injury, sickness, death or disease for any other insured to recover from the insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">(\u00b6 22} In other words, although referring only to amended R.C. 3937.18(A)(1) (uninsured motorist coverage), the legislature specifically declared its intent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the comment to also permit insurance companies to limit coverage for UIM claims to only insureds who suffered bodily injury, death, or disease. Therefore, the <em>Sexton </em>and <em>Moore </em>cases became inapplicable to automatically negate policy language that limited UIM coverage to only those claims that were for bodily injuries to an insured. Consequently, since the AFI policy in this case was issued pursuant to this later, amended version of R.C. 3937.18(A) and has limiting UIM language, the real issue is whether that language is unambiguous and effectively limited the UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">{\u00b6 23} The interpretation of an insurance contract is a matter of law that, on appeal, is reviewed de novo. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guman Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684. An insurance-policy provision is ambiguous when it is reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation. <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus. Where the policy language is clear and unambiguous, its terms must be applied without engaging in any construction. See <em>Santana v. Auto Owners Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 490, 494, 632 N.E.2d 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 24} In general, the words \u201cbodily injury\u201d are \u201c \u2018commonly and ordinarily used to designate an injury caused by external violence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tomlinson v. Skolnik </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 11, 14, 540 N.E.2d 716, overruled on other grounds, <em>Schaefer v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 553, 668 N.E.2d 913, quoting <em>Burns v. Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp. Ltd. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 222, 233, 12 O.O. 18, 16 N.E.2d 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b625} Following this definition, emotional injuries have been held not to be covered as \u201cbodily injury\u201d under liability-insurance policies. See <em>Hawthorne v. Estate of Migoni, </em>5th Dist. No. 2003 AP 07 0054, 2004-Ohio-378, 2004 WL 177439; <em>Bentley v. Progressive Ins. Co., </em>4th Dist. No. 02CA10, 2002-Ohio-6532, 2002 WL 31681997 (husband not entitled to uninsured motorist coverage after observing his common-law wife die in a motorcycle accident); <em>Bernard v. Cordle </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 116, 687 N.E.2d 3, (husband\u2019s emotional distress in witnessing wife\u2019s motor vehicle accident was not covered as \u201cbodily injury\u201d under a liability-insurance policy). Policy language may not be construed to include different coverage, i.e., damages for emotional distress when \u201cbodily injury\u201d is required, when the plain and ordinary terms used indicate otherwise. See <em>Ambrose v. State Farm &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 797, 800, 592 N.E.2d 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 26} The AFI general-liability policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury to or sickness, disease or death of any person.\u201d The UIM endorsement states that AFI \u201cwill pay compensatory damages for bodily injury which an insured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>underinsured motor vehicle. The bodily injury must be sustained by an insured person and must be caused by accident and arise out of the use of the underinsured motor vehicle.\u201d Malhas claims that she is entitled to coverage because these two provisions create an ambiguity that prohibits AFI from limiting UIM coverage to claims for bodily injury to Malhas, an insured. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 27} Although it includes \u201cany person,\u201d the AFI general definition is limited within the general-liability policy to apply to claims by persons who qualify in some manner as insureds. The UIM endorsement merely narrows the UIM coverage to include only those claims that are for \u201cbodily injuries\u201d to \u201cinsured persons.\u201d Since the contract provisions of the AFI general-liability policy must be read and interpreted together with any endorsements, the policy is <em>reasonably </em>susceptible of only one interpretation \u2014 that UIM claims must be for bodily injuries to an insured person. In our view, there is no conflict between the general definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d and the UIM endorsement language, and no ambiguity exists in the overall policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 28} As the AFI policy clearly states, to be covered under the UIM endorsement, Malhas herself, the insured, must have sustained \u201cbodily injury\u201d caused by an accident and the use of an underinsured motor vehicle. Although she certainly sustained emotional injury, Malhas was not involved in and did not receive bodily injuries from the accident that caused the death of her sister. Consequently, Malhas\u2019s UIM claims were effectively excluded from coverage by the policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, we conclude that no material facts are in dispute as to coverage under the AFI policy and that AFI is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Although the trial court\u2019s decision was based upon a different issue, we conclude that summary judgment was still proper. An appellate court shall affirm a trial court\u2019s judgment that is legally correct on other grounds \u2014 that is, it achieves the right result for the wrong reason, because such an error is not prejudicial. <em>Reynolds v. Budzik </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 844, 846, fn. 3, 732 N.E.2d 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken. The remaining two assignments of error are rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 31} The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-11\">Pietrykowski and Parish, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-12\">.
