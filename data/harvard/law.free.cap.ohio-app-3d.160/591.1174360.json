We reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter judgment on behalf of the village of Kipton and against the Woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">{\u00b62} The property at issue is a paved road that bisects a parcel of real property owned by appellees in the village. The Woods claim that the portion of the road that runs through their property is private. Appellant, the village, maintains that the road is public and that it is a section of Haigh Road, a public thoroughfare running through the village.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">{\u00b6 3} On September 5, 2001, the Woods filed the instant lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment quieting title to the property. The village opposed the Woods\u2019 claim, arguing (1) that the road in question had been dedicated a public road, (2) that the public had acquired a prescriptive easement over the Woods\u2019 property, and (3) that two deeds, recorded by the Woods\u2019 predecessors in interest, granted the public the right to use the road. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the public from using the portion of the road that bisected the Woods\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">{\u00b6 4} The matter proceeded to a bench trial on December 11, 2002. At that trial, the village tried to introduce documents contained in a book maintained by the Lorain County Engineer and entitled \u201cLorain County Road Record Book B.\u201d The village maintained that documents in the record book show that the disputed section of the road was established as a public road known as Haigh Road in 1861. The Woods objected to the introduction of the documents, and the trial court excluded the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>{\u00b6 5} On February 26, 2003, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the Woods. The court issued a judgment quieting title to the property, ejecting the village, and permanently enjoining the public from further passage through the Woods\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 6} The village appealed that decision, stating that the trial court had wrongfully excluded the documents. In <em>Wood v. Kipton, </em>9th Dist. No. 03CA008253, 2003-0hio-7199, 2000 WL 34227524 <em>(\u201cWood I\u201d), </em>this court reversed the decision of the trial court, holding that the documents were admissible, and remanded the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 7} On remand, both the Woods and the village filed briefs. On July 19, 2004, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the Woods and against the village.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 8} The village appeals the decision of the trial court, asserting four assignments of error for our review. For ease of discussion, we will address the assignments of error out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The trial court erred in interpreting this court\u2019s earlier decision and should have found that this court had ruled in the prior appeal that exhibits F-l to F-4 showed that the disputed property was established as a public road in 1861 via statutory appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">{\u00b6 9} In its first assignment of error, the village claims that the trial court erred in interpreting this court\u2019s decision in <em>Wood I. </em>The village maintains that in <em>Wood I, </em>this court held that exhibits F-l to F-4 showed that the disputed property was established as a public road in 1861. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">{\u00b6 10} The first assignment of error in <em>Wood I </em>stated, \u201cThe trial court erred when it rejected as evidence Lorain County Road Record Book B, an official record of the Lorain County Engineer (a record which is statutorily mandated by [R.C.] 5553.10).\u201d This court agreed that the documents should have been admitted into evidence and remanded the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">{\u00b6 11} This court did not enter judgment in <em>Wood I </em>for the village. We stated, \u201cHad Appellants [the village] been permitted to submit Exhibits F-l to F-4 into evidence, they <em>could </em>have shown that the disputed property was established as a public road in 1861 * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b627. We did not expressly state that the disputed property was a public road. We stated that the village would be able to present evidence to that effect upon remand. We did not direct the trial court that exhibits F-l through F-4 conclusively established that the road was dedicated a public thoroughfare. We simply found that the village <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>had been prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence and directed the trial court to admit the documents. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The trial court erred when it rejected the Village of Kipton\u2019s proof that it acquired an easement by prescription to that portion of Haigh Road which runs through the property of [appellees].</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 12} In its third assignment of error, the village maintains that the trial court erred when it rejected proof that the village had acquired an easement by prescription to the section of Haigh Road at issue. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[Governmental entities may acquire title to land by adverse possession.\u201d <em>State ex rel. AAA Investments v. Columbus </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 151, 152, 17 OBR 353, 478 N.E.2d 773. The elements of adverse possession are the same as the elements of a prescriptive easement. Accordingly, a municipality may acquire a prescriptive easement over the property of another. The Ohio Supreme Court \u201chas long recognized that \u2018 * * * roads and streets may be established by prescription.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 152, 17 OBR 353, 478 N.E.2d 773, quoting <em>RR. Co. v. Roseville </em>(1907), 76 Ohio St. 108, 117, 81 N.E. 178. A prescriptive easement occurs when one can prove that he has used the land of another (a) openly, (b) notoriously, (c) adversely to the property owner\u2019s rights, (d) continuously, and (e) for at least 21 years. <em>Gerstenslager v. Lloyd </em>(Feb. 15, 1995), 9th Dist. No. 16814, 1995 WL 66284, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 14} The village has submitted evidence showing that Haigh Road, including the portion that bisects the Woods\u2019 property, was established as a public road in 1861. The Woods argue that the documents from 1861 do not conclusively confirm the establishment of Haigh Road as a public road. However, the village claims that even if we find that the road was not established as a public road in 1861, it has acquired a prescriptive easement over the property at issue. We agree that, at a minimum, the village has a prescriptive easement over the Woods\u2019 property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">{\u00b6 15} Assuming that Haigh Road had not been statutorily appropriated in 1861 as a public road, we will focus on whether the village has acquired a prescriptive easement over the portion of the Woods\u2019 property that Haigh Road crosses. As mentioned above, the village must prove that it has used the land at issue openly, notoriously, adversely, and continuously for at least 21 years. <em>Hindall v. Martinez </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 580, 583, 591 N.E.2d 308. The party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>claiming an easement by prescription must prove each element by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Coleman v. Penndel Co. </em>(1997), 128 Ohio App.3d 125, 131, 703 N.E.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 16} The village submitted evidence showing that it had met the requirements for a prescriptive easement. A1 Buck, who has been a resident of the village for half a century and is now its clerk-treasurer, testified that Haigh Road has been used as a public thoroughfare since at least 1955. Buck also served as the mayor of the village on three separate occasions, the first of which was in 1959. Buck testified that he was familiar with Haigh Road. When shown a map of Haigh Road, Buck testified that it was configured in 1958 in the same way that it is today, bisecting what is now the Woods\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 17} Buck explained that the village was incorporated in 1958, and since that time the village has maintained Haigh Road, including the portion that now bisects the Woods\u2019 property. Buck testified that at least from the time he moved to what is now the village in 1955 until the village was incorporated, Camden Township maintained the road.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The village has regularly resurfaced and plowed the road. The evidence shows that Haigh Road has been used openly, notoriously, and continuously from 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 18} As to the final element of a prescriptive easement, that the use is adverse to the property owner, Buck testified that no permission had been given to use the property as a road from 1955 until 1979.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">MR. GURCHIK: Are you aware of any documents prior to 1979 which granted to the Village, from the previous owners of the Kipton Elevator,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] any permission to use that property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">MR. BUCK: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">MR. GURCHIK: So as far as you\u2019re aware of, the Village of Kipton has always maintained that property since the Village of Kipton was incorporated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">MR. BUCK: Yes,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">MR. GURCHIK: And prior to that time, it was the Village \u2014 or the Township of Camden that maintained the road?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-13\">MR. BUCK: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-14\">MR. GURCHIK: And you know that from having lived there\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-15\">MR. BUCK: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>MR. GURCHIK: \u2014 since 1955?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">MR. BUCK: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 19} Upon cross-examination, Buck testified that there were no documents that granted the village a right of way or easement or permission to use the road in question until 1979. The Woods have not contested that the use of the road from 1955 to 1979 was without permission and thus adverse. Since the road had been used without permission from the property owners since 1955, we may infer that the use was adverse to the rights of the property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u2018Where one uses a way over the land of another without permission * * * and continues to do so with the knowledge of the owner, such use is, of itself, adverse * * <em>Pavey v. Vance </em>(1897), 56 Ohio St. 162, 46 N.E. 898, at paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cA party claiming a prescriptive easement satisfies its burden by demonstrating a use which is inconsistent with the title owner\u2019s rights * * <em>Schmiehausen v. Zimmerman, </em>6th Dist. No. OT-03-027, 2004-Ohio-3148, 2004 WL 1367278, at \u00b6 29. The village used the portion of Haigh Road at issue without permission from the owners, and its use was inconsistent with the title owners\u2019 rights to their property. Therefore, the village has clearly and convincingly established that from 1955 until 1979 the village\u2019s use of Haigh Road was adverse to the property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 21} In 1979, the use of Haigh Road arguably became permissive. An affidavit made by Kipton Elevator provides that \u201cthe Elevator hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns that it will not in any manner interfere with the right of the public to use said Haigh Road for the same purposes of travel that the public uses other streets in the community.\u201d Thus, debatably, the use of Haigh Road became permissive when the affidavit was recorded on July 27, 1979, or on May 25, 1979, when a deed transferring the property from Straub Enterprises to Kipton Elevator was recorded that also contained a reservation of rights to the public for use of Haigh Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 22} By 1979, however, the village had already acquired a prescriptive easement. The use of the property had been open, notorious, and adverse to the property owners for a continuous period of 24 years before the property owners acquiesced in the village\u2019s right to use the road. Furthermore, \u201cacquiescence by the property owner with knowledge of the use does not negate a claim for prescriptive easement.\u201d <em>Schmiehausen, </em>2004-Ohio-3148, at \u00b6 29, citing <em>Lloyd, </em>9th Dist. No. 16814.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">{\u00b6 23} The Woods argue that the village has not obtained a prescriptive easement to the portion of their property at issue because the use of the road was permissive. \u201cIf the landowner asserts the defense of permissive use, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the landowner has the burden of proving the existence of his or her permission.\u201d <em>Carlyn v. Garn </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 704, 707, 664 N.E.2d 1325. Mr. Wood testified that when the village repaved Haigh Road in 1999, the mayor asked his permission to pave the portion of the road on their property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, Mr. Wood testified that the village police sought his permission to run radar on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 24} Whether those uses of the Woods\u2019 property from 1999 to the present were permissive is irrelevant. The time period for which the Woods needed to assert the defense of permissive use was from .1955 until 1979. The village has shown that the use of the property at issue at that time was adverse to the property owners\u2019 rights. To negate the element of adverseness, the Woods would have had to establish that the use of the property from 1955 until 1979 was permissive. The Woods have made no such claims. The Woods have not contested the village\u2019s assertions that the use from 1955 until 1979 was adverse. They merely point to two instances of permission from 1999 to the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 25} By the time the Woods purchased their property in 1998, the village had already acquired a prescriptive easement. Thus, any permission that the village might have sought from the Woods to repave or run a radar from their property was merely a courtesy. Even if the village thought that it had to get the Woods\u2019 permission to repave the road or to run a radar from the road, it would have had no effect. \u201cA user\u2019s acknowledgment that the title holder has the paramount right will not extinguish a fully matured prescriptive easement.\u201d <em>J.F. Gioia, Inc. v. Cardinal Am. Corp. </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 33, 23 OBR 76, 491 N.E.2d 325, at paragraph six of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 26} The village had acquired a mature prescriptive easement in the 1970\u2019s. The only way for the prescriptive easement to be extinguished was by the title owner\u2019s obstruction of the easement in an open, notorious, adverse, and continuous manner for at least 21 years. <em>J.F. Gioia, </em>23 Ohio App.3d 33, 23 OBR 76, 491 N.E.2d 325 at paragraph six of the syllabus. Before the instant lawsuit, the village\u2019s easement had not been obstructed in any way. From 1979, the property owners acknowledged the village\u2019s right to use the portion of Haigh Road at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 27} Mr. Wood maintains that his deed did not include any language granting the village the right to use the portion of Haigh Road at issue. Whether his deed had any mention of the easement does not affect the village\u2019s prescriptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>easement. However, when the Woods purchased the property in 1998, they had notice that Haigh Road bisected their property.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">MR. GURCHIK: * * * [Throughout all that period of time [from 1955 to the present] you would have no reason to dispute the fact that the public has used that road?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">MR. WOOD: I would agree to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">MR. GURCHIK: And when you took possession in 1998, January, was Haigh Road there? Was Haigh Road there on that property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">MR, WOOD: Yes, I\u2019d have to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">MR. GURCHIK: * * * [Y]ou knew that there was a roadway running right through your property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">MR. WOOD: I knew it was there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">{\u00b6 28} Based on the above evidence, we find that the village had acquired a prescriptive easement to use the portion of Haigh Road that bisects the Woods\u2019 property. The village has presented clear and convincing evidence that the road in question has been used by the public since 1955 in a manner that was adverse to the property owners from 1955 until 1979. It was used openly, notoriously, adversely, and continuously since at least 1955. The village had acquired a mature prescriptive easement by 1976. The public has been using the road without interruption from 1955 until the instant lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">{\u00b6 29} When the Woods purchased their property, the village had already acquired a prescriptive easement to use the portion of Haigh Road at issue. Furthermore, when they bought the property, the Woods knew that it was bisected by a paved road that the public was using. The only way for the Woods to now extinguish the village\u2019s easement would be to obstruct the easement in an open, adverse, and continuous manner for 21 years, which they have not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">{\u00b6 30} We find that based on the facts presented by the village, each element of a prescriptive easement has been clearly and convincingly established. Thus, we vacate the judgment of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas and enter judgment as a matter of law in favor of appellant, the village of Kipton, in accordance with App.R. 12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">{\u00b6 31} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">The trial court erred in finding that exhibits F-l to F-4 did not establish the disputed property was acquired by statutory appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR IV</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The trial court erred when it disregarded the deed reservations establishing in the public the right to use Haigh Road as it ran through the property of [appellees].</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">{\u00b6 32} Given this court\u2019s resolution of appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, its second and fourth assignments of error are rendered moot, and we decline to address them. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 33} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled, the third assignment of error is sustained, and the second and fourth assignments of error are moot. The judgment of the Lorain County Court of Common Please is reversed, and judgment is entered in favor of appellant, the village of Kipton.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b638-9\">Batchelder, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b638-10\">Carr, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\">.
