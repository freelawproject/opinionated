MRDD contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it granted the Bakers\u2019 motion to compel discovery, because the MRDD records are protected from discovery by R.C. 5123.61(M), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), and Civ.R. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the MRDD records are not protected from discovery by R.C. 5123.61(M). The MRDD records are subject to discovery, even if the records are not public records. We also conclude that pursuant to <em>Ellis v. Cleveland Mun. School Dist. </em>(N.D.Ohio 2004), 309 F.Supp.2d 1019, the MRDD records relating to allegations of abuse or neglect of students by teachers are not protected from discovery by FERPA, because the requested documents do not contain information directly relating to students. We decline to address MRDD\u2019s argument that Civ.R. 26 protects the MRDD records from discovery, because it is not properly within the scope of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 3} Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the Bakers\u2019 motion to compel discovery. Accordingly, the order of the trial court compelling discovery is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">{\u00b6 4} Dustin Baker, a 12-year-old boy with cerebral palsy and developmental disabilities, was a student in the MRDD program at Northwood Elementary School during the 2001-2002 school year. During that time, Debra Mitchell-Waters, who was employed by MRDD as a teacher at Northwood Elementary School, was Dustin\u2019s teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">{\u00b6 5} In March 2003, Dustin Baker and his parents, Tom and Brenda Baker, filed a complaint against MRDD and Mitchell-Waters asserting claims of battery, assault, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, vicarious liability, breach of statutory duties to protect rights of the disabled, and loss of parental consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>{\u00b6 6} In their complaint, the Bakers alleged that Mitchell-Waters was verbally and physically abusive toward Dustin throughout the 2001-2002 school year. In particular, the Bakers alleged that when Dustin inadvertently touched Mitchell-Waters\u2019s breasts, after losing his balance and falling into her, Mitchell-Waters responded by saying, \u201cIf you want to act like a man, then I\u2019ll treat you like a man,\u201d and proceeded to grab and squeeze Dustin\u2019s testicles until he expressed pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">{\u00b6 7} In April 2003, the Bakers filed their first set of combined discovery requests upon MRDD and Mitchell-Waters, which included interrogatories, requests for documents, and requests for admission. MRDD responded to the Bakers\u2019 interrogatories as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c4. Please identify any complaints of physical and/or verbal abuse of students by Debra Mitchell-Waters during the time in which she was employed by MRDD.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cANSWER: Objection. Some and/or all of the information requested is privileged under the Ohio Public Records Act, R.C. 5123.61, 5123.613, R.C. 5126.044, R.C. 149.43 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. This interrogatory will not be answered absent a court order or in compliance with R.C. 5123.61, 5123.613, R.C. 5126.044, R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c5. Please identify any complaints of physical and/or verbal abuse of students by any teachers, aides or staff members employed by MRDD.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cANSWER: Objection. This interrogatory is vague, overbroad, unlimited in time and scope and not reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence. Further objecting, some and/or all of the information requested may be privileged under the Ohio Public Records Act, R.C. 5123.61, 5123.613, R.C. 5126.044, R.C. 149.43 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Answering over objection and without waiving same, see answer to Interrogatory No. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c6. Please state the complainant, the case name, number, date of filing and the outcome of the claim and/or lawsuit filed against MRDD for physical and/or verbal abuse of students by teachers employed by MRDD.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cANSWER: Objection. This interrogatory is vague, overbroad, not limited in time and scope and not reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence. Further objecting, some and/or all of the information requested may be privileged under the Ohio Public Records Act, R.C. 5123.61, 5123.613, R.C. 5126.044, R.C. 149.43 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Answering over objection and without waiving same, see answer to Interrogatory No. 4.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The Bakers filed a motion to compel discovery, seeking an order compelling the production of the documents from MRDD. The trial court granted, in part, the Bakers\u2019 motion to compel discovery. The trial court granted the Bakers\u2019 request for documents involving any complaints of abuse or neglect of any student by Mitchell-Waters or any teacher. The trial court found that these documents were not \u201cstudent education records\u201d protected by FERPA. The trial court ordered that the identity of all students, including their medical-related information, be redacted from these documents. The trial court also granted the Bakers\u2019 request regarding documents containing allegations of abuse or neglect of Dustin Baker by Mitchell-Waters but found this matter to be moot, because MRDD had either supplied the information, or agreed to supply the information, to the Bakers. From the trial court\u2019s order compelling discovery, MRDD appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 15} MRDD\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion to the prejudice of MRDD when it granted plaintiffs motion to compel discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">{\u00b6 17} MRDD contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it granted the Bakers\u2019 motion to compel discovery, because the MRDD records are protected from discovery by R.C. 5123.61(M) (FERPA) and Civ.R. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">{\u00b6 18} MRDD contends that pursuant to R.C. 5123.61(M), the Bakers are not entitled to the MRDD records, with the exception of Dustin\u2019s records, because none of them is a person who is the subject of the report, the person\u2019s legal counsel, or an agency authorized to receive information in the reports. MRDD contends that there is no exception to the statute permitting disclosure where a subpoena or court order is procured. MRDD contends that the Bakers are not entitled to the MRDD records of other students without obtaining a signed release. The Bakers contend that a release is unnecessary and that the reports should be made available pursuant to R.C. 5123.61(M) because Mitchell-Waters and MRDD are both the subject of the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 5123.61(M) provides: \u201cReports made under this section are not public records as defined in section 149.43 of the Revised Code. Information contained in the reports on request shall be made available to the person who is the subject of the report, to the person\u2019s legal counsel, and to agencies authorized to receive information in the report by the department or by a county board of mental retardation and developmental disabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">{\u00b6 20} We conclude that even if the MRDD reports are not public records, that does not mean they are privileged and hence not subject to discovery. R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>5123.61(M) merely exempts the MRDD reports from the scope of the Public Records Act \u2014 under which anyone can demand to see a document \u2014 while requiring, nevertheless, that the records be made available to certain persons upon request. If a document is covered by the Public Records Act, anyone can demand to see it, not just persons in litigation pursuing discovery of relevant evidence. If a document is privileged, it is privileged from discovery, even though it would otherwise constitute relevant evidence. However, there are also documents that are neither privileged nor subject to the Public Records Act (records of private organizations, for example). These documents are subject to discovery. In other words, that a document is not within the scope of the Public Records Act does not mean that it is not subject to discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 21} Therefore, we conclude that the MRDD records are not protected from discovery by R.C. 5123.61(M). The MRDD records are subject to discovery, even if the records are not public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 22} MRDD contends that pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the Bakers are not entitled to the MRDD records, because the MRDD records are \u201cstudent education records,\u201d protected from disclosure. The Bakers contend that pursuant to <em>Ellis v. Cleveland Mun. School Dist. </em>(N.D.Ohio 2004), 309 F.Supp.2d 1019, the MRDD records are not \u201cstudent education records\u201d and therefore are subject to disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cFERPA protects educational records or personally identifiable information from improper disclosure. <em>Doe v. Woodford County Bd. of Educ., </em>213 F.3d 921, 926 (6th Cir.2000). The statute sets out conditions on the availability of federal funds for educational agencies and institutions and provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c \u2018No funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records (or personally identifiable information contained therein other than directory information ...) of students without the written consent of their parents to any individual, agency, or organization.... \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1232g(a) and (b)(1). FERPA broadly defines \u2018education records\u2019 as \u2018those records, files, documents, and other materials which (i) contain information directly related to a student; and (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\u2019 <em>U.S. v. Miami University, </em>294 F.3d 797, 812 (6th Cir.2002) (citing 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(A)). Personally identifiable information \u2018is narrowly defined by the Act\u2019s regulations as including only the student\u2019s name, parent\u2019s name, the student\u2019s or parent\u2019s address, social security number, or other information that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>would make the student\u2019s identity easily traceable.\u2019 <em>Woodford County, </em>213 F.3d at 926.\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>309 F.Supp.2d at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>Ellis, </em>the court held that information relating to allegations of physical abuse by teachers was not protected from discovery by FERPA, because the requested documents did not contain information directly relating to the student. <em>Ellis, </em>309 F.Supp.2d at 1023-1024. The court stated: \u201cFERPA applies to the disclosure of student records, not teacher records. <em>Klein Independent Sch. Dist. v. Mattox, </em>830 F.2d 576, 579 (5th Cir.1987). While it is clear that \u2018Congress made no content-based judgments with regard to its \u2018education records\u2019 definition,\u2019 <em>Miami University </em>294 F.3d at 812, it is equally clear that Congress did not intend FERPA to cover records directly related to teachers and only tangentially related to students.\u201d Id. at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 27} The court distinguished <em>Miami Univ., </em>supra, upon which MRDD relies, stating, \u201cA teacher\u2019s disciplinary records and/or records containing allegations of teacher misconduct can be contrasted with student disciplinary records which the Sixth Circuit has held are \u2018education records\u2019 within the meaning of FERPA. <em>Miami University, </em>294 F.3d at 812.\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>309 F.Supp.2d at 1023, fn. 2. The court found that the information sought by the plaintiff \u2014 allegations of assault or corporal punishment of a student by a teacher \u2014 did not implicate FERPA because it did not contain information \u201c \u2018directly related to a student.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 1023. The court stated that \u201c[w]hile these records clearly involve students as alleged victims and witnesses, the records themselves are directly related to the activities and behaviors of the teachers themselves and are therefore not governed by FERPA.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 28} The court went on to state: \u201cEven if the records at issue in this case were \u2018education records\u2019 as defined by FERPA that would not necessarily end the inquiry. FERPA is not a law which absolutely prohibits the disclosure of educational records; rather it is a provision which imposes a financial penalty for the unauthorized disclosure of educational records. Thus, while FERPA was intended to prevent schools from adopting a policy or engaging in a practice of releasing educational records, it does not, by its express terms, prevent discovery of relevant school records under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Ellis, </em>309 F.Supp.2d at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 29} In this case, the trial court granted the Bakers\u2019 request for the MRDD records involving any complaints of abuse or neglect of any student by Mitchell-Waters or any teacher. Pursuant to <em>Ellis, </em>supra, we conclude that these documents, relating to allegations of abuse or neglect of students by teachers, are not protected from discovery by FERPA, because the requested documents do not contain information directly relating to students. The MRDD records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>directly relate to the activities and behaviors of the teachers themselves and are, therefore, not governed by FERPA. See <em>Ellis, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 30} MRDD contends that Civ.R. 26 protects the MRDD records from discovery where an individual\u2019s privacy interests outweigh the probability that discovery of the records will lead to admissible evidence. MRDD contends that pursuant to Civ.R. 26, the Bakers are not entitled to the MRDD records, because the MRDD records sought by the Bakers, regarding any complaints of abuse or neglect of any students by any teacher, are not relevant to the Bakers\u2019 claims. MRDD argues that discovery should be limited in this case, because the Bakers are on a fishing expedition to find other causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 31} Although we find it noteworthy, and commendable, that the trial court in this case ordered that the identity of all students, including their medical-related information, be redacted from the MRDD records in the interests of privacy, we decline to address MRDD\u2019s argument. We conclude that MRDD\u2019s contentions are not properly within the scope of this appeal. A provisional-remedy appeal from an order compelling discovery can be predicated upon a theory that a privilege is being violated, but that right to an interlocutory appeal does not extend to an attack upon an order compelling discovery as being overly broad and burdensome, which could be remedied on an appeal after final judgment by seeking an award of fees and expenses incurred in responding to the overly broad discovery order. Therefore, we decline to address this argument made by MRDD.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 32} We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the Bakers\u2019 motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">{\u00b6 33} MRDD\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">{\u00b6 34} MRDD\u2019s sole assignment of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-12\">Brogan, P.J., and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
