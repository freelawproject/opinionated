On appeal, Reed argues that the district court improperly assumed that his motion was based on the crack cocaine amendments<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, as opposed to Amendments 506 and 567. Further, he requests that his appeal be consolidated with <em>United States v. Green, </em>No. 12-10247, and he adopts the appellant\u2019s arguments in that case. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Reed\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">In 2008, Reed pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. According to the presen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Reed qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a), and as such, his base offense level was 32. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b), his total offense level was 29. Based on this offense level and a criminal history category of IV, Reed\u2019s guideline range was 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Ultimately, the court imposed a 151-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">In November 2011, Reed filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendments 506 and 567, and <em>United States v. LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997). In his motion, Reed argued that the district court\u2019s application of the career offender guideline, \u00a7 4B 1.1, was unlawfully based on his prior conviction, as the government failed to file a notice, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1), charging him as a \u201crecidivist offender.\u201d Moreover, he alleged that the court\u2019s application of the career offender enhancement violated the separation of powers. Reed further asserted that the <em>LaBonte </em>decision should be treated as a clarifying amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines because, among other reasons, Amendment 567 was based on <em>LaBonte. </em>He argued that jurisprudence establishes that the government is required to provide \u00a7 851 notice before the career offender guideline enhancement is imposed. He concluded that, in light of <em>LaBonte, </em>the district court should apply an offense level of 18 and a guideline range of 27 to 33 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">The district court denied Reed\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, indicating that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction based on his career offender status</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under the sentencing guidelines and review its factfindings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>We may affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any ground supported by the record. <em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>(U.S. Oct. 1, 2012) (No. 12-5074). Further, we liberally construe pleadings filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">A court may only modify a term of imprisonment in limited circumstances, including where a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Further, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not grant the district court jurisdiction to reconsider all original sentencing determinations. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). In fact, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the district court may not modify an imposed term of imprisonment upon a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion unless the defendant\u2019s sentencing range was subsequently lowered by an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 780; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Other sentencing issues should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Amendment 506, effective November 1, 1994, changed the definition of \u201cOffense Statutory Maximum\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l\u2019s commentary to mean only the basic statutory maximum and excluded any sentencing enhancements based on the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 506. In <em>LaBonte, </em>however, the Supreme Court concluded that Amendment 506 violated the plain language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h), which requires the Guidelines to specify a sentence \u201cat or near the maximum term authorized\u201d for defendants who had certain prior felony convictions. <em>LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. at 757-62, 117 S.Ct. at 1677-79. The term \u201cmaximum term authorized\u201d in \u00a7 944(h) includes any relevant statutory sentencing enhancements. <em>See id. </em>at 753, 117 S.Ct. at 1675. In response, the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 567, effective November 1, 1997, which amended the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.1 to specify that \u201cOffense Statutory Maximum\u201d included sentencing enhancements based on the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">As an initial matter, Reed has abandoned the arguments that he raised in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion by failing to raise them in his appeal brief, and instead, attempting to adopt an appellant\u2019s brief in a separate case. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>684 F.3d 1045, 1064 n. 23 (11th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1195 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that we \u201cmay decline to address an argument where a party fails to provide arguments on the merits of an issue in its initial or reply brief\u2019). We permit an appellant to adopt by reference any part of another party\u2019s brief by including a statement describing in detail which briefs and which portions of those briefs are adopted. 11th Cir. R. 28\u20141(f). The appellant in <em>Green, </em>however, is not a party in the instant appeal, and moreover, Reed does not describe in detail which of Green\u2019s arguments he intends to adopt. Regardless, as discussed below, even construing Reed\u2019s appeal brief liberally to preserve the arguments that he made before the district court, <em>see Tannenbaum, </em>148 F.3d at 1263, he is not entitled to sentence reduction. Further, Reed\u2019s request to have his appeal consolidated with <em>Green </em>is moot because the appeal in that case is no longer pending before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Reed\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. On appeal, Reed suggests that the district court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was confusing because the district court assumed that his motion was filed pursuant to the crack cocaine amendments instead of Amendments 506 and 567. The district court, however, did not specify a guidelines amendment in denying Reed\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Instead, the court merely stated that Reed was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was sentenced as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>career offender. Regardless, even if the district court improperly construed Reed\u2019s motion as seeking a sentence reduction based on the crack cocaine amendments instead of Amendments 506 and 567, we may affirm on any basis supported by the record, <em>see Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 975, and here, the record makes clear that Reed is not entitled to a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Amendment 506, effective November 1, 1994, and Amendment 567, effective November 1, 1997, were both issued well before Reed entered his guilty plea in 2008, and thus, his applicable sentencing range was not subsequently lowered by those amendments. U.S.S.G.App. C, amends. 506 and 567; <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780-81. Additionally, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes the district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to retroactively applicable guideline amendments, not Supreme Court decisions, such as <em>LaBonte. See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission, and therefore, <em>Booker </em>was inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Finally, to the extent that Reed seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 4B1.1 during sentencing, such a challenge is outside the limited scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and he must raise it in a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Reed\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-9\">.
