Stevens argues that because a prior conviction for \u201cPossession of Cannabis\u201d listed in the criminal history section of his PSI was classified as a felony rather than a misdemeanor, he was incorrectly considered a career offender by the district court when it originally sentenced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">We review legal issues presented in a Rule 36 motion to correct a judgment <em>de novo. United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir.2004). Rule 36 allows a court to correct at any time \u201ca clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Rule 36 does not allow for a substantive correction or alteration to a criminal sentence. <em>Portillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">The district court correctly denied the Rule 36 motion. Even assuming the district court originally considered the \u201cPossession of Cannabis\u201d charge to be a felony, such a correction would not be clerical in nature. Rather, such a correction would result in a substantive alteration to a criminal sentence, particularly if it would change Stevens\u2019 career offender status. Accordingly, Rule 36 was not the correct basis for Stevens\u2019 requested relief, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
