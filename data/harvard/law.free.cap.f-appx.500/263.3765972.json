Raney, </em>633 F.3d 385, 389 (5th Cir.2011). This court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and may affirm the denial of the motion on any basis established by the evidence. <em>Id.; United States v. Aguirre, </em>664 F.3d 606, 610 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1949, 182 L.Ed.2d 803 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>We engage in a two-step inquiry when reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Cherna, </em>184 F.3d 403, 407 (5th Cir.1999). First, we determine whether the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule announced in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), applies. <em>Id. </em>If so, no further analysis is conducted and the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress will be affirmed. <em>Id. </em>If the good faith exception does not apply, we proceed to the second step, \u201censuring] that the magistrate had a substantial basis for ... concluding that probable cause existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The good faith exception provides \u201cthat evidence obtained by law enforcement officials acting in objectively reasonable good-faith reliance upon a search warrant is admissible\u201d even if the affidavit on which the warrant was grounded was insufficient to establish probable cause. <em>United States v. Shugart, </em>117 F.3d 838, 843 (5th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). An officer\u2019s reliance on a warrant is not objectively reasonable and, therefore, he is not entitled to invoke the good faith exception, if (1) the judge who issued the warrant acted after being \u201cmisled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth\u201d; (2) the judge who issued the warrant \u201cwholly abandoned his judicial role\u201d and failed to act neutrally, such that \u201cno reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant\u201d; (3) the affidavit upon which the warrant is founded is \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable\u201d and is thus a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit; or (4) the warrant authorizing the officer\u2019s actions is so \u201cfacially deficient\u201d that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid. <em>United States v. Mays, </em>466 F.3d 335, 343 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">To the extent that Guerrero argues that the warrant was facially deficient due to the 2006 date error, the district court found that the warrant, prepared by Officer Phillips, contained a typographical error, reciting, erroneously, that the warrant was issued on August 27, 2006, at 6:25 p.m., rather than on August 27, 2007. The district court determined that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied because Phillips acted in good faith, his reliance on the validity of the search was objectively reasonable, and Phillips\u2019s efforts to correct the error in the search warrant were objectively reasonable. As the district court observed, this court has applied the good faith exception to officers executing warrants that were technically in violation of the law because the magistrate failed to sign or date the warrant in signing the application for the warrant. <em>See United States v. Kelley, </em>140 F.3d 596, 601-04 (5th Cir.1998). Here, Officer Phillips\u2019s affidavit provided specific information indicating that the informant was reliable and credible and was based on the informant\u2019s personal knowledge from which the magistrate judge could determine that probable cause existed. <em>See Cherna, </em>184 F.3d at 407-08; <em>Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d at 320-21; <em>see also United States v. Wylie, </em>919 F.2d 969, 974 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Guerrero argues that <em>Kelley </em>does not control because Officer Phillips made the error in the warrant, not the issuing magistrate, and Phillips did not reasonably rely on a valid warrant. \u201cTo trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.\u201d <em>Herring v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 144, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009). The record reflects that Phillips was \u201cmerely negligent\u201d in referencing the year 2006 rather than 2007 in the warrant, and the record does not support a finding of \u201cdeliberate, reckless or grossly negligent conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>625 F.3d 830, 840 (5th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1632, 182 L.Ed.2d 232 (2012). The date error in the search warrant, resulting from an initial error by Phillips and subsequent oversight by both Phillips and the magistrate judge, does not undermine the district court\u2019s determination that the officers executing the warrant acted in good faith. <em>See Shugart, </em>117 F.3d at 844. Nor has Guerrero identified any other error in the warrant that rendered the warrant facially deficient for purposes of the officers\u2019 good faith in executing the warrant. <em>See Mays, </em>466 F.3d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">To the extent that Guerrero argues that the search warrant violated Texas law, \u201c[wjhether the Fourth Amendment has been violated is determined solely by looking to federal law on the subject.\u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>960 F.2d 409, 415 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Guerrero argues, for the first time on appeal, that the affidavit supporting the warrant was a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit. In this circuit, a defendant\u2019s failure to \u201craise <em>specific issues or arguments </em>in pre-trial suppression proceedings operates as a waiver of those issues or arguments for appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Pope, </em>467 F.3d 912, 918-19 (5th Cir.2006). However, this court has \u201coften proceeded to evaluate the issues under a plain error standard for good measure.\u201d <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 448 (5th Cir.2010). Guerrero has not demonstrated error, plain or otherwise, with respect to his argument that the affidavit was a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit. <em>See Pope, </em>467 F.3d at 920; <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
