On appeal, Milakovich argues that: (1) the district court incorrectly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over: (a) his claim that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) violated his and his foreign-born, adopted sons\u2019 due process rights by failing to process Forms I-600 that he filed on behalf of his sons; (b) his request for a grant of citizenship to his sons, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401, 1431, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>1449; (c) his request for a grant of \u201call lost Social Security benefits\u201d resulting from improper USCIS actions; and (d) his alternative request for a grant of legal permanent resident (\u201cLPR\u201d) status to his sons, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255; and (2) the district court improperly dismissed his claim against two USCIS employees under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and erroneously failed to give him an opportunity to repair any deficiencies in his <em>pro se </em>pleadings. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">When evaluating a district court\u2019s conclusions on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Zinni v. ER Solutions, Inc., </em>692 F.3d 1162, 1166 (11th Cir.2012). We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Lanfear v. Home Depot, Inc., </em>679 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir.2012). Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are to be liberally construed, a <em>pro se </em>litigant who offers no substantive argument on an issue in his initial brief abandons that issue on appeal. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We may affirm on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not it was relied upon or considered by the district court. <em>Lanfear, </em>679 F.3d at 1275. A complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim if it does not state a plausible claim for relief on its face. <em>Id. </em>The allegations in the complaint must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all allegations in the complaint are true. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">First, we are unpersuaded by Milako-vich\u2019s argument that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against the USCIS. In order for a person to be deemed a U.S. citizen at birth under \u00a7 1401, the person must have been (a) born either in the United States or to at least one U.S. citizen; or (b) found in the United States while under the age of five. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401. In order for a child adopted by a U.S. citizen parent to automatically acquire citizenship under \u00a7 1431, the child must be admitted as an LPR. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431(a)(3), (b). Section 1449 identifies the information that should be included in a certificate of naturalization. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1449. The status of an alien admitted into the United States may be adjusted to that of an LPR by the Attorney General, at his discretion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). With the exception of decisions related to applications for asylum, federal courts lack jurisdiction to review a decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, the authority for which is specified to be in the discretion of either official. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a). Finally, \u00a7 242 is a criminal statute that provides no basis for civil remedies. <em>See Hanna v. Home Ins. Co., </em>281 F.2d 298, 303 (5th Cir.1960);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see also Otero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>832 F.2d 141, 141 (11th Cir.1987) (holding that a private citizen has no judicially cognizable interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>the prosecution or non-prosecution of another).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">To begin with, regardless of whether the district court had jurisdiction over Milakovich\u2019s claims under \u00a7\u00a7 1401, 1431, and 1449, he failed to state a claim under any of those statutes. His sons were not born either in the United States or to at least one U.S. citizen; nor were they found in the United States while under the age of five. Accordingly, Milako-vich failed to show that his sons were U.S. citizens under \u00a7 1401. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401; <em>Lanfear, </em>679 F.3d at 1275. Because his sons were not LPRs, Milakovich failed to show that his sons were eligible for automatically acquired citizenship under \u00a7 1431. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431(a)(3), (b). Because his sons had not yet received certificates of naturalization, he failed to establish a right to relief under \u00a7 1449. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1449.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The district court also properly dismissed Milakovich\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1255, because the authority to grant an adjustment to LPR status is vested in the Attorney General, and federal courts lack jurisdiction to review this discretionary determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), 1255(a). Because he alleged no facts establishing that his sons were eligible for social security benefits that were denied to them, the district court also properly denied relief on this claim. <em>See Lanfear, </em>679 F.3d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">To the extent that Milakovich sought relief under \u00a7 242, that statute is a criminal statute that provides no basis for civil remedies. <em>See Otero, </em>832 F.2d at 141; <em>Hanna, </em>281 F.2d at 303. Similarly, Mila-kovich has identified no authority for the proposition that the defendants\u2019 alleged violations of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1618 or the USCIS Adjudicator\u2019s Field Manual provide a basis for judicially cognizable relief. Finally, to the extent that Milakovich sought relief with respect to the handling of his sons\u2019 1-600 applications, he has alleged no facts suggesting that, had the defendants processed the applications more quickly, he or his sons would have received benefits to which they were constitutionally entitled, and he does not dispute that he was no longer entitled to file the applications after his sons arrived in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Next, we reject Milakovich\u2019s claim that the district court erred in dismissing his <em>Bivens </em>cause of action. <em>Bivens </em>allows for a claim against a federal agent who, while acting under color of federal law, has violated the constitutional rights of an individual. <em>See Hardison v. Cohen, </em>375 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within 21 days after serving it, or, if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after the earlier of service of a responsive pleading or of a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b), (e), or (f). Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1). In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave, which should be freely given if the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2); <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1262 (11th Cir.2004). A party ordinarily must be given at least one opportunity to amend before the district court dismisses the complaint. <em>Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir.2005). A district court need not, however, allow an amendment where it would be futile, <em>i.e., </em>where the complaint as amended would still be subject to dismissal. <em>Hall, </em>367 F.3d at 1262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">In this case, Milakovich has not alleged facts sufficient to establish that either indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>vidual defendant violated his or his sons\u2019 constitutional rights. As we\u2019ve discussed above, he does not dispute that he was not entitled to file 1-600 applications after his sons arrived in the United States, and he has failed to explain how any delay in processing the applications while he was overseas violated his or his sons\u2019 constitutional rights. To the extent that he sought relief for the defendants\u2019 alleged failure to inform him of \u201ccorrective measures,\u201d this claim is refuted by his own admission that, after he and his sons arrived in the United States, he was instructed to file additional forms, but declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">Milakovich\u2019s argument that the district court should not have dismissed his <em>Bivens </em>claims without giving him another opportunity to repair deficiencies in his <em>pro se </em>pleadings in a third amended complaint is meritless. He has not indicated how he would have cured the remaining deficiencies in his complaint, had he been permitted to do so, and nothing in the record suggests that another amendment would not have been futile. <em>See Hall, </em>367 F.3d at 1262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-5\">. As a result, Milakovich has abandoned any claims he raised before the district court but failed to raise on appeal, including those under the Administrative Procedure Act. See <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-9\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
