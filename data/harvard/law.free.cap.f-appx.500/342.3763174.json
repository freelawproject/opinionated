He argues that his sentence, which exceeds the range set forth in the nonbinding policy statements set forth in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines but is within the statutory maximum, is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and failed to articulate its reasons for imposing sen-fence. He further argues, in reliance on <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006), that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it fails to reflect the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-21\">Revocation sentences generally are reviewed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). As Gonzales concedes, however, because he raised no objections in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). Under the plain error standard, Gonzales must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). This court has discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-24\">The district court did not expressly reference \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing sentence. Although the court\u2019s comments in imposing sentence were brief, the record reflects that the court considered the policy statement range of three to nine months, Gonzales\u2019s three prior revocations of supervised release, Gonzales\u2019s comments at the revocation hearing, defense counsel\u2019s arguments in mitigation of sentence, and the Government\u2019s arguments that a sentence above the recommended range was warranted. The record reflects that the court considered the nature and circumstances of Gonzales\u2019s supervised release violation as well as his history and characteristics in imposing sentence and thus implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a)(1); <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s explanation, in the context of the revocation hearing, was sufficient, and, thus, Gonzales has not shown clear or obvious error. <em>Cf. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 261-62 (determining that lack of explicit statement setting forth reasons for imposition of sentence outside of recommended guidelines range was not clear or obvious error). Nothing in the record suggests that a more thorough explanation would have resulted in a shorter sentence, and there is no suggestion in the record that the district court considered any improper factor or would impose a different sentence on remand. <em>See id. </em>at 264-65. Gonzales has not demonstrated plain error with respect to his challenge to the district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence imposed upon revocation. <em>See id. </em>at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The court\u2019s comments at sentencing, in the context of the revocation hearing, reflect that the court was imposing the 18-month sentence on the basis of Gonzales\u2019s specific history and characteristics, which included that Gonzales\u2019s admitted cocaine use in October 2011 followed his three prior revocations of supervised release, one for testing positively for cocaine use and two for absconding from supervision. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). Contrary to Gonzales\u2019s appellate argument, the record does not reflect that the sentence \u201cunreasonably fail[ed] to reflect the statutory sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708. Gonzales\u2019s revocation sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum sentence; accordingly, he has not shown that the sentence imposed constituted plain error. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
