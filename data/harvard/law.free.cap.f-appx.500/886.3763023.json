(Appellants) appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their lawsuit alleging constitutional and statutory violations for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">Appellant Ralph Emmanuelli is a Florida resident and registered Republican voter in Pinellas County, Florida. The Hills-borough Hispanic Coalition, Inc. is a nonprofit corporation with the stated purpose of promoting, protecting, and defending the rights of the Hispanic community. Appellee Reince Priebus is the Chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">Like many organizations, the RNC requires its members to abide by certain rules. Two such rules are at issue in this case. The first rule, the calendar program, prohibits member states from holding a presidential primary or caucus before a specified date. The second rule, the delegate-reduction penalty, reduces the convention delegates of nonconforming states by a predetermined amount when they violate the RNC\u2019s calendar program. In this case, Florida and its Republican Party violated the RNC\u2019s calendar program when they held, and accepted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>results of, the State\u2019s presidential primary-prior to the RNC\u2019s specified date. Consequently, the RNC enforced its delegate-reduction penalty against Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">In response, Appellants brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the RNC\u2019s delegate-reduction penalty violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, as well as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and Section Two of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants allege that the RNC\u2019s rules \u201cunder-enfranchisef ]\u201d Hispanic Republican voters, because they allow early voting states\u2014 namely, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u2014 with comparatively small percentages of Republican Hispanic voters to skew the debate toward the interests of those states\u2019 dominant demographics. As a result of the influence the RNC\u2019s rules bestow on those states, Appellants contend that presidential candidates adopt positions contrary to those of Hispanic voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Priebus moved to dismiss under, <em>inter alia, </em>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that Appellants failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. The district court granted Prie-bus\u2019s motion, dismissing Appellants\u2019 complaint with prejudice and entering judgment in favor of Priebus. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in concluding the RNC was not a state actor for purposes of Appellants\u2019 statutory and constitutional claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants rightly concede that state action is a requisite element of their case, and they point to two of this Court\u2019s state action tests in attempting to show RNC is a state actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">First, Appellants invoke the public function test, which finds state action when private actors perform traditional state functions. <em>See, e.g., Focus on the Family v. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth., </em>344 F.3d 1263, 1277 (11th Cir.2003). Appellants argue that the RNC performed a traditional state function in reducing Florida\u2019s delegates to the 2012 convention. This argument, however, has no basis in law or fact. As the Supreme Court has acknowledged, \u201ccontroversies regarding the seating of delegates\u201d have traditionally been determined not by the states, but by \u201cthe national political parties themselves.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien v. Brown, </em>409 U.S. 1, 5, 92 S.Ct. 2718, 34 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972). Because the RNC\u2019s enforcement of its delegate-reduction penalty was not a traditional state function, Appellants\u2019 reliance on the public function test is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Next, Appellants rely on the nexus/joint action test, which finds state action when private and state actors have an interdependent, symbiotic relationship regarding \u201cthe specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.\u201d <em>Focus on the Family, </em>344 F.3d at 1278. Appellants assert Florida and the RNC operated jointly in enforcing the delegate-reduction penalty because the State (1) authorized and conducted the primary, and (2) adopted the results for the general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">This argument, like Appellants\u2019 first, is meritless as they have not established the RNC and Florida were engaged in a relevant \u201csymbiotic\u201d relationship. Appellants have shown the State was involved in violating the RNC\u2019s calendar program by conducting a premature primary. But that is not the \u201cspecific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.\u201d Rather, Appellants challenge the legality of the RNC\u2019s penalty rule, which is triggered by the nonconforming primary but which does not involve the State\u2019s participation. There is no evidence Florida and the RNC have a \u201csymbiotic\u201d relationship regarding the delegate-reduction penalty. Thus, Appellants have not made out the requirements of the nexus/joint action test for state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">In sum, because Appellants have not shown RNC is a state actor, the district court did not err in dismissing their complaint for failure to state a cause of action. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of Preibus\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-11\">. This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Speaker v. U.S. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Servs. Ctrs. for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, 623 </em>F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-6\">. In their complaint to the district court, Appellants asserted a due process violation under the Fourteenth Amendment. But, as in the district court, Appellants have presented no legal argument or factual recital in their briefs to support such a violation. We therefore do not consider it. <em>See, e.g., Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (\"[A] legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b910-7\">. As a threshold matter, we reject Appellee\u2019s mootness contention. As the Supreme Court has routinely held in \"the context of election cases,\u201d the issues presented here fall within the \"capable of repetition yet evading review\u201d exception to mootness. <em>See, e.g., FEC v. Wis. Right To Life, Inc., </em>551 U.S. 449, 463-64, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007); <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 774, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978); <em>Storer v. Brown, </em>415 U.S. 724, 737, n. 8, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974); <em>see also ACLU v. The Fla. Bar, </em>999 F.2d 1486, 1496 (11th Cir.1993). Additionally, because the appeal is narrowly limited to the state action question, nothing in this opinion bears on Appellants\u2019 \u201dunderenfranchise[ment]\u201d equal protection theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
