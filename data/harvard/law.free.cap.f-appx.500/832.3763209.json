Warui\u2019s brief fails to present arguments about the BIA\u2019s 17 February 2010 decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings and for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-20\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). The 30-day period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d and is not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Furthermore, filing a motion to reconsider will not stop the 30-day time-to-appeal clock from running. <em>See Stone v. I.N.S., </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (\u201c[A] deportation order is final, and reviewable, when issued. Its finality is not affected by the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Warui\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s 14 July 2009 decision dismissing his appeal. The petition for review was not filed until 18 March 2010, which was long past the 30-day deadline; and the filing of the motion to reopen and for reconsideration did not stop that deadline from passing. We must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">For Warui\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings and for reconsideration, his initial brief to us presented no arguments at all on the subject. \u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n.2 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThis court has a well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the initial brief are deemed waived or abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v. Day, </em>405 F.3d 1293, 1294 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Although Warui filed a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s February 2010 decision, his initial brief does not address the standard of review, legal requirements, or factual arguments on the denial of his motion to reopen and for reconsideration. Accordingly, any argument on that issue is abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-14\"> Warui\u2019s wife, Teresia Wambui Kamau, is a derivative petitioner. This opinion will refer to both petitioners collectively as \"Warui.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
