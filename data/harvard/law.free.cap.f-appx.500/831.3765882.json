Fuller challenges the enhancement of his sentence for using sophisticated means and the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The district court did not clearly err by enhancing Fuller\u2019s sentence for using sophisticated means to conceal his fraud. The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level enhancement if the offense in question \u201cinvolved sophisticated means,\u201d which the commentary defines as \u201cespecially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of the offense\u201d and concealing wrongdoing through \u201cfictitious entities [and] corporate shells.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(C) <em>&amp; </em>cmt. n. 8(B) (Nov.2011). Fuller used a shell corporation and a fake identity to collect almost $8 million in premiums ostensibly to provide worker\u2019s compensation insurance for employees of National Employer Services. After Fuller deposited the premium payments into a company bank account, he tunneled most of the money into accounts that he, his wife, or a friend controlled. To conceal his fraud, Fuller issued to National Employer Services certificates purporting to be proof of insurance and paid $437,852 in worker\u2019s compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence within the advisory guidelines range. Fuller defrauded a corporation, stole millions of dollars, and deprived employees of insurance coverage required by law to fund a luxurious lifestyle for himself. In turn, National Employer Services was forced to terminate employees and reduce the salaries of its remaining workers. Later, Fuller made false statements to authorities about his involvement in and income derived from his fraud. In the light of the seriousness and extent of Fuller\u2019s fraud, the district court reasonably determined that a sentence of 60 months of imprisonment would best serve the statutory purposes for sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Fuller\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">We AFFIRM Fuller\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
