We review revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). This is a more deferential standard than the reasonableness standard that applies to sentences imposed upon conviction. <em>Id. </em>Under the plainly unreasonable standard, we first assess whether the district court committed procedural error and then consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-23\">Calender complains that the district court committed procedural error by improperly considering the factors of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in imposing his sentence because subsection (a)(2)(A) is not among the provisions of \u00a7 3553 that \u00a7 3583(e) directs courts to weigh in fashioning a revocation sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 844. However, he does not allege, and the record does not reflect, that the district court, in imposing his revocation sentence, made any specific reference to \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) or that the district court discussed any of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Calender\u2019s argument instead rests on a statement in the district court\u2019s written judgment of revocation and sentence that the court had considered \u201call factors\u201d set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-24\">Nevertheless, the district court, at sentencing, explained that the 24-month sentence \u201cwould appropriately address the factors the [c]ourt should consider in a revocation context.\u201d The court\u2019s references to the factors that \u201cshould\u201d be considered indicate that the court limited its decision to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors enumerated in \u00a7 3583(e). The district court\u2019s oral pronouncement at sentencing controls to the extent it conflicts with the written judgment. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001). Calender\u2019s argument fails to establish that his revocation sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>See Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
