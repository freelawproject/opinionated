California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there were no nonfrivolous grounds for appeal. He now seeks to withdraw his <em>Anders </em>motion and has filed a merits brief challenging the sentence Cruz received following his guilty plea conviction for illegal reentry, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. The motion to withdraw the previously filed <em>Anders </em>motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Counsel now contends, for the first time, that the district court reversibly erred in relying on an outdated version of the Guidelines and imposing a three-year term of supervised release as part of Cruz\u2019s sentence. Because Cruz did not raise any challenge to the imposition of supervised release below, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Allison, </em>447 F.3d 402, 406 (5th Cir.2006). To show plain error, Cruz must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but it will do so only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">As the parties concede, the district court\u2019s application of the outdated version of the Guidelines was error that is clear or obvious. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii); <em>see also United States v. Martin, </em>596 F.3d 284, 286 (5th Cir.2010). However, the error did not affect Cruz\u2019s substantial rights because, at sentencing, the district court conducted the factual consideration whether the imposition of supervised release \u201cwould provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances\u201d of his particular case, in accordance with the amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1 and commentary. \u00a7 5D1.1(c) &amp; comment, (n.5); <em>see United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir.2012). Thus, Cruz has not demonstrated any effect on his substantial rights or any miscarriage of justice requiring reversal. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Cruz\u2019s pro se motion for the appointment of substitute counsel, filed in response to the <em>Anders </em>motion, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-16\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO WITHDRAW <em>ANDERS </em>MOTION GRANTED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SUBSTITUTE COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
