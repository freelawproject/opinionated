He argues that despite his prior sentencing reduction based on Amendment 706, the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) and Amendment 750 further lower his sentencing range because they lower mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine offenses. He argues that nothing about Amendment 750 makes it inapplicable to prisoners who have received a previous reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-20\">A district court may grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion only \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision \u201cwhether to reduce a sentence pursuant to ... \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, ... its interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-21\">When the district court reduced Sardin\u2019s sentence pursuant to Amendment 706, the district court determined that Sardin\u2019s revised guidelines range of imprisonment was 235 to 293 months. Applying Amendment 750, Sardin\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment is still 235 to 293 months. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A; \u00a7 201.1(c)(4); \u00a7 2D1.1 comment, (n.10). Therefore, the district court did not err in concluding that Sardin was ineligible for a further reduction and did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
