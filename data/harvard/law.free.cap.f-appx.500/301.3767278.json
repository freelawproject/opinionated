Hebert Farms brought suit and the district court found that the clause excluding coverage applied and granted summary judgment in favor of Southern. Hebert Farms appeals, claiming the term \u201crice drying house\u201d is ambiguous and should be strictly construed in its favor. Finding no error, we AFFIRM for the reasons more fully set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Hebert Farms conducts a rice farming operation in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana. It owns five rice bins located on its premises. The rice bins are used for drying harvested rice and storing the rice until it is sold. The cylindrical bins consist of flat floors, pitched roofs, and walls. Each bin has two electric fans on it to circulate air into the bin for the purpose of \u201cdrying\u201d or removing the moisture in the rice.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">During an unknown date in the fall of 2009, after the rice crop had been harvested and placed into the rice bins for drying and storage, three of the electrical fans stopped operating. When this was discovered, Hebert Farms had the fans repaired by an electrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-17\">Hebert Farms contracted with Bunge Corporation to sell its rice crop for $13 per hundred weight. However, when the rice was delivered, it was rejected by Bunge Corporation because it was stained or \u201cstack burned.\u201d Staining diminishes the value of the rice and occurs when there is excessive moisture and heat in the rice such that the pigment in the rice hull bleeds and discolors the rice seed. Because the rice was stained, Hebert Farms had to sell the rice at a price lower than the contract price and incur additional hauling costs. Hebert Farms alleged losses of $288,348.71.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-18\">Southern issued Farmowner\u2019s Policy No. RRFR159941443 to Hebert Farms for the period of August 28, 2009 to August 28, 2010. The Coverage Schedule and Declarations portion of the policy describes \u201cCoverage E-Farm Barns, Buildings, and Structures\u201d as including \u201c5 Grain Tanks.\u201d The policy additionally provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-20\">Coverage F \u2014 Scheduled Farm Personal Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-22\">\u201cWe\u201d cover the classes or items of farm personal property for which a \u201climit\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>shown on the \u201cdeclarations\u201d. Coverage applies while property is on the \u201cinsured premises\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">7. Grain\u2014 When a \u201climit\u201d is shown on the \u201cdeclarations\u201d for Grain, \u201cwe\u201d cover grain. This includes threshed beans, silage, ground feed, and manufactured and compounded stock foods in buildings, structures, sacks, wagons, or trucks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">PROPERTY NOT COVERED UNDER COVERAGES E, F, OR G \u201cWe\u201d do not cover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">5. <em>the contents of a </em>rice warehouse, <em>rice drying house, </em>cotton gin building belonging to a cotton gin plant or located on gin premises, or machinery, equipment, vehicles or implements that are part of these operations....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Hebert Farms sought coverage under Coverage E for \u201cFarm Barns, Buildings, and Structures\u201d \u2014 which lists \u201c5 Grain Tanks\u201d among covered property \u2014 and the \u201cPerils\u201d section of the policy, which covers \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to property covered under Coverage E. Southern denied coverage on the grounds that the alleged loss is explicitly excluded by the \u201cProperty Not Covered Under Coverages E, F, or G\u201d section of the policy which excludes the contents of a \u201crice drying house.\u201d The district court found the term \u201crice drying house\u201d unambiguously refers to an on-premise structure used for drying rice and granted summary judgment in favor of Southern. Hebert Farms now appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all disputed facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Rockwell v. Brown, </em>664 F.3d 985, 990 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). In cases involving named perils insurance coverage, \u201cit is the burden of the insured to prove the incident falls within the policy\u2019s terms. On the other hand, the insurer bears the burden of proving the applicability of an exclusionary clause within a policy.\u201d <em>Doerr v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>2000-0947, p. 5 (La.12/19/00); 774 So.2d 119, 124 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">This is a diversity case, so we apply Louisiana substantive law. <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Under Louisiana law, an insurance policy is a contract and should be construed according to the general rules of contract interpretation set forth in the Civil Code. <em>Riverwood Int\u2019l Corp. v. Emp'rs Ins. of Wausau, </em>420 F.3d 378, 382 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see </em>La. Civ.Code Ann. arts.2045-2048. While an \u201cambiguous contractual provision is to be [strictly] construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage,\u201d this \u201cstrict construction rule applies only if the ambiguous policy provision is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations.\u201d <em>Sher v. Lafayette Ins. Co., </em>2007-2441, p. 5 (La.4/8/08); 988 So.2d 186, 193. Further, where the words of a contract are clear and lead to no absurd consequences, no further interpretation is necessary to determine the parties\u2019 intent. La. Civ.Code Ann. art.2046. The words and phrases used in an insurance policy are to be construed using their plain, ordinary, and generally prevailing meaning unless the words have acquired a technical meaning. <em>Id. </em>art.2047.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">Here Hebert Farms argues the \u201crice drying house\u201d provision cannot exclude coverage because the term is ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>and not defined by the policy. It claims an alternate reasonable interpretation is that the policy would cover \u201cprivately owned grain of an insured located on an insured\u2019s premises, but it will not cover the grain of other persons contained in commercial facilities on the insured\u2019s premises.\u201d Further, it argues because its \u201c5 Grain Tanks\u201d are specifically listed in the Coverage Schedule of the Declarations page as covered property, the policy cannot exclude these tanks from coverage in another section. Finally, Hebert Farms points to the fact that the rice drying bins are cylindrical in shape, and therefore they do not comport with what one would ordinarily consider a \u201chouse.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">While Southern acknowledges a \u201crice drying house\u201d is not expressly defined by the policy, it argues the term should be given its ordinary prevailing meaning and cannot be construed to mean anything other than a structure where rice is dried. Southern argues the bins are structures existing for the purpose of drying rice, and under the policy, the contents of the bins-the rice itself-is expressly not covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We agree with Southern. While the term \u201crice drying house\u201d is not expressly defined in the policy, the fact that \u201ca term is not defined in the policy itself does not alone make that term ambiguous.\u201d <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>495 F.3d 191, 207 (5th Cir.2007). To construe this term, we must look to its plain, ordinary, and generally prevailing meaning and the ordinary meaning of \u201chouse\u201d is simply a structure or building that houses something.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If we were to credit Hebert Farms\u2019s interpretation that the clause encompasses privately owned grain of an insured located on an insured\u2019s premises but does not cover the grain of other persons contained in commercial facilities on the premises, we would \u201ccreate an ambiguity where none exists or the making of a new contract when the terms express with sufficient clearness the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d <em>Cadwallader v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2002-1687, pp. 3-4 (La.6/27/03); 848 So.2d 577, 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Here the \u201c5 Grain Tanks,\u201d as they are referred to elsewhere in the policy, are structures being used for housing rice while the rice is being dried; thus, under the plain and ordinary meaning of the words, the term \u201crice drying house\u201d must mean \u201ca structure where rice is dried.\u201d Under the express language of the policy, though damage to the grain tanks themselves may be covered, when the grain tanks are used to store rice that is being dried, they are a \u201crice drying house\u201d and the contents of the tanks \u2014 the rice itself\u2014 is not covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">For the above reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\">. Hebert Farms also argues that the provisions of the policy providing coverage for \"Grain\u201d on the insured premises are in direct conflict with the provision which states that the policy does not cover the contents of a rice drying house, and that the rice was not \"contents\" of a rice drying house at the time of the loss because the damage was not discovered until after the rice was removed from the bins. We do not find either of these arguments persuasive, but as these arguments were not raised before the district court, we decline to consider them. <em>See Offshore Drilling Co. v. Gulf Copper &amp; Mfg. Corp., </em>604 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-13\">. The term \"house\u201d is defined as \"a building in which something is housed.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 562 (10th ed.1997) (def. 2b). \"To house,\u201d in turn, means \"to encase, enclose, or shelter as if putting in a house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(def. 2). Thus, we are unpersuaded that something cylindrical in shape cannot meet the definition of a \"house.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
