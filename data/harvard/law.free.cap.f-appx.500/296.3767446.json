He argues in his one-page brief that he is entitled to proceed IFP because he did so in the district court and because the interests of justice require it. That is the entirety of Lister\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">When a district court certifies that an appeal is frivolous and is not taken in good faith under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Rule 24(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, a litigant may either pay the filing fee or challenge the district court\u2019s certification decision by filing a motion for leave to proceed IFP in this court. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). If the court upholds the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith and the litigant persists in the appeal, he must pay the appellate filing fee or the appeal will be dismissed for want of prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 202. If the appeal is frivolous, this court may dismiss it sua sponte. <em>Id. </em>at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">Because the district court certified that Lister\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith, he is not entitled to proceed IFP on appeal merely because he did so in the district court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3)(A). Lister has briefed no other issues for appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). This court denies the IFP motion and dismisses the appeal as frivolous on those grounds. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-18\">The dismissal of this appeal counts as a strike, as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lister\u2019s action. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). The district court previously dismissed another of Lister\u2019s civil rights actions as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. <em>Lister v. Smith, </em>No. 5:07-CV-754 (W.D.Tex. Mar. 26, 2008) (unpublished). Because Lister has accumulated three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in a civil action or appeal unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-19\">Finally, we deny Lister\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>IFP DENIED.
