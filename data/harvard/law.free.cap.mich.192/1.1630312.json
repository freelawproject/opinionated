Upon the trial counsel for both parties moved the court for a peremptory verdict; the grounds of defendants\u2019 motion being:</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-6\"><em>First, </em>that the lease was a contract required to be in writing, and it does not satisfy the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-7\"><em>Second, </em>that the contract (lease) is a usurious contract, and therefore wholly void, and, in consequence, the demand sued upon is a usurious demand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-8\">The court charged.the jury to return a verdict for the defendants; the sole ground for the ruling being that under the laws of either New York or Texas the contract was usurious.

Owing to failure to publish notice far enough in advance, the penalty did not apply. You had no rent due until January 1, 1911, so that we could not pay the 1909 taxes from this.

Fearnow and wife to plaintiffs of the land described in the foregoing indenture, reciting a consideration of $10,400.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-12\">Testimony tends to prove that the land described in the deed and lease was, when purchased by plaintiffs, wild, covered with mesquite and cactus, so that it was necessary to grub it, plow it, fence it, make ditches for irrigation, and seed it for sugar cane, in order to make it productive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-13\">The highest rate of interest allowed in Texas is 10 per cent., in New York 6 per cent., per annum. By the laws of Texas all written contracts which provide for a rate of interest greater than 10 per cent, are void as to the interest money. By the laws of New York all usury contracts (there are certain exceptions) are void. As stated in defendants\u2019 brief, the contention respecting usury is:</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-14\">\u201cThat portion of the contract [lease] contained in clause No. 2, above quoted, is clearly usurious on its face. The moneys Referred to do not constitute any part of the purchase price of the lands\u2019 nor anything upon which real estate rentals can be based. It relates solely to moneys advanced by the lessors to the lessees for the benefit of the lessees to be paid back in ten equal installments. The amount paid for the purchase price of the lands was $10,400. The total amount of the moneys paid out, including the purchase price of the lands, was $16,852. After deducting the 10 per cent, fee for services and the purchase price, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>would be left the sum of $5,806.80 as the amount of moneys advanced by the lessors to the lessees and for which an indebtedness came into being. This money was to be furnished to the lessees from time to time to enable them to clear the land, plough it, ditch it, and plant the cane for their own benefit. Of this there is no dispute. * * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">\u201cIt is claimed by the plaintiffs that no indebtedness arose because the principal sum advanced was never to be paid back. We insist that the principal sum of money advanced by the plaintiffs to the lessees was to be paid back by the terms of the contract together with an exorbitant rate of interest. The repayment of principal with interest was to be paid in 20 semiannual installments, payable the 1st days of January and March in each year. These installments would amount to $580.68 twice each year under the second clause quoted. Allowing the plaintiffs 10 per cent, for the use of this money at each payment of $580.68, one-half of the amount paid would legally apply on the principal and reduce it proportionately.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-6\">\u201cBy calculation we find that at the end of ten years the lessors, by paying according to the terms of the contract, would have paid to the plaintiffs the principal sum of $5,806.80, together with interest at 15 per cent, and a trifle over. By no process of ingenious reasoning can it be seriously contended that the payment of 20 per cent, per annum or 10 per cent, semiannually upon the moneys advanced by the plaintiffs directly to the lessees, not for the purchase of the lands for the plaintiffs, but for necessities of the lessees in clearing the land for their own use and purchasing material necessary for that purpose, could be regarded as a rental of land. Calling it by that term was a mere scheme to avoid usury laws. It is similar to a transaction which, taking the form of or creating or purchasing an annuity, is on the footing of a loan or borrowing of money, and is put in such form as a device to cover the exaction of illegal interest. Such a transaction is usurious.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-7\">I quote further from defendants\u2019 brief:</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-8\">\u201cAlthough it may be that, where the rental of land is fixed upon a percentage basis, and that percentage ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ceeds the lawful rate of interest, the contract might be good and enforceable, still if, in the same contract, there is an agreement to furnish other money at an' illegal rate of interest, that portion of the contract taints the whole contract, the entire agreement, and renders it unenforceable. In other words, if there are several considerations for one promise, and one of them is illegal, the whole promise will be unenforceable ; it being impossible to tell which one of the many considerations induced the promise.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-5\">For plaintiffs, appellants, it is contended:</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-6\">\u201c(1) That the burden of proof is on the defendants to establish usury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-7\">\u201c(2) That to establish usury there must be a loan of money, or the forbearance of an indebtedness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-8\">\u201c(3) That, where the transaction does not involve the loan of money, or the forbearance of an indebtedness upon its face, to have usury it must be proven that the transaction was a mere device to cover usury, and that the real intention of the parties was to make a loan, or create an indebtedness for the forbearance of which interest is to be paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-9\">\u201c(4) In such a case that such was the intent of the parties, is material, and must be proved to establish usury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-10\">\u201c(5) That in this case the transaction on its face did not involve a loan of money, nor the forbearance of an indebtedness, and that there is no evidence of any intention on the part of any of the parties to make a loan of money, or for the forbearance of any indebtedness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-11\">\u201c(6) That accordingly the defense of usury fails, and that therefore, the trial court having held with the plaintiffs on every other question in the case but the question of usury, the judgment must be reversed.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b45-12\">Ostrander, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4b\"><em>(after stating the facts). </em>1. The statute of the State of Texas defines interest as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-13\">\u201cThe compensation allowed by law or fixed by the parties to a contract for the use or forbearance or detention of money.\u201d Article 4973, Revised Civil Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>So by the statute of New York:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">\u201cThe rate of interest upon the loan or forbearance of any money, goods or things in action, except as otherwise provided by law, shall be six dollars upon one hundred dollars, for one year, and at that rate, for a greater or less sum, or for a longer or shorter time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Consolidated Laws of the State of New York (1909), vol. 2, pp. 1253, 1259, \u00a7 370 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">So our own statute (2 How. Stat. [2d Ed.], \u00a7 2870 [2 Comp. Laws 1915, \u00a7 5998]) is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u201cNo bond, bill, note, contract or assurance, made or given for or upon a consideration or contract, whereby or whereon a greater rate of interest has been, directly or indirectly, reserved, taken or received, than is allowed by law, shall be thereby rendered void; but in any action brought by any person on such usurious contract or assurance, except as is provided in the following section, if it shall appear that a greater rate of interest has been, directly or indirectly, reserved,, taken or received, than is allowed by law, the defendant shall not be compelled to pay any interest thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">In each State what the statute condemns is taking or receiving directly or indirectly, more than the legal rate of interest. The contract is not avoided; the loss of interest is the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">While a statutory definition of interest may change the definition of usury, there is nothing in the statutes I have referred to which forbids the acceptance of the common idea that interest is a charge for the loan or forbearance of money. See, generally, 39 Cyc. p, 888 <em>et seq.; </em>29 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law (2d Ed.), p. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">The lease affords no evidence of a loan by plaintiffs to defendants. Its reasonable, and, unless the imagination is employed, its necessary, interpretation negatives the idea of a loan to defendants. Defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>term began after the land had been fitted and seeded. It is immaterial that they, instead of some one else, superintended the fitting and seeding, at the expense of plaintiffs, or that they even performed the necessary labor and furnished the necessary materials. Suppose that a barn on premises was needed, and the owner undertook to erect it before the tenant\u2019s term began, permitting the tenant to erect it at the owner\u2019s expense, the rent being fixed with reference to the improved premises; in such a case it could not be reasonably contended that the cost of the barn was a loan to the tenant. I can see no difference between the supposed case and the one presented by the terms of the lease. Assuming that the contract which preceded the making of the lease may be resorted to and its terms and those of the lease be considered together, there is then nothing which supports a construction of the lease other than the one indicated. Clearly there is no lawful objection to fixing the rental in terms of a percentage of the total cost of the premises. Defendants, appellees, rely upon <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>159 Mich. 72 (123 N. W. 559, 134 Am. St. Rep. 712); <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Hoover, </em>3 Tex. Civ. App. 81 (21 S. W. 930), and other cases as sustaining the doctrine that usury may exist when there is no actual loan of money. Since defendants assert, and assert only, that there was a loan \u2014 an advancement \u2014 of money to defendants, the proposition stated is not, if sound, of particular interest. However, one has only to read the opinions in the cases cited to see that in each use of money, a debt, was the foundation of the exaction complained about. It is assumed, each party having moved for a directed verdict, that there was no conflicting oral testimony tending, by inference or otherwise, to prove an intention of the parties other than the one to be found in the terms of. the lease. It is asserted in the brief for appellants that there is no such testimony, and defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ants\u2019 brief refers us to none, tending to prove that the lease was a mere device for exacting usury \u2014 unlawful interest. It may be conceded that the plaintiffs desired to make a profitable investment of their money, but they did not lend it to defendants, and no debt was created for the amount invested. The intention to exact usury is not proven.</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">2. For appellants it is contended that this cburt should refuse to consider whether the verdict and judgment are in any event right, and should enter a judgment for plaintiffs for the amount of past due rent and interest, plus the amount of unpaid water rental. It is the general rule that an appellate court does not concern itself with errors claimed to have been committed against the appellee. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>78 Mich. 399 (44 N. W. 396); <em>Bowsher </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>174 Mich. 339, 345 (140 N. W. 524). But, when an issue determinable as matter of law is determined by the court, and a wrong reason assigned for the ruling, the proper administration of the law does not require a reversal if the ruling is nevertheless right. In <em>Ehinger </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>190 Mich. 132 (155 N. W. 747, 750), it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">\u201cWe think the circuit court reached the correct conclusion (although its reasons stated therefor were insufficient) ,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">and affirmed the judgment. In <em>Lentz </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>96 Mich. 445 (55 N. W. 993), it appeared that three grounds of defense to an action on a policy of insurance were asserted. Upon one of them the court directed a verdict for defendant. It was said, 96 Mich. 446 (55 N. W. 994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">\u201cIf it appears that there is any conclusive reason why no recovery should be had, the judgment should not be disturbed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">A considerable number of similar cases are collected in 1 Mich. Digest, \u00a7 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>In the case at bar the record includes the lease, and the laws of Texas and of New York were proved. It appears to be agreed \u2014 at least nothing to the contrary is asserted \u2014 that the point is one of law which the court below should and, appellants say, did determine. It is- also a question certain to be raised upon a new trial. Therefore, in my opinion, it should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The contract is for leasing for a longer period than one year. By the laws of New York and of Texas it is required to be in writing. It is in writing. Is there omitted from the writing anything essential to the contract which it attempts to evidence? If not, then it is not necessary to further test it by the laws of either State. The lease was executed in June and in July and August, 1909. It described the investment made and to be made by the lessors, upon the total of which, the rental was to be reckoned. The terms of the lease are not uncertain. No element of a lease of lands is omitted. The precise amount of rent reserved is not stated; nor is it in a lease of lands for agricultural purposes where rent in kind from crops to be raised is reserved; nor in leases for a considerable period of time during which an appraisal, or successive appraisals, of the property rented is by agreement to be the basis of the rent charge. See <em>Rayburn </em>v. <em>Lumber Co., </em>57 Mich. 273 (23 N. W. 811); <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Hydraulic Co., </em>59 Mich. 597 (26 N. W. 785); <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Moreman, </em>84 Ky. 635 (2 S. W. 179); <em>Vindquest </em>v. <em>Perky, </em>16 Neb. 284 (20 N. W. 301); <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>16 Pick. (Mass.) 227 (26 Am. Dec. 657); 2 Page on Contracts, \u00a7 704. Beyond this the term began after the expenditures had been made, the amount expended has been agreed to, and for four years the rent <em>reserved in the lease </em>was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The court below- was in error in ruling that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>contract was usurious, and right in ruling that the lease was not affected by the statute of frauds of either New York or Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We are referred to no testimony which supports a recovery for the unpaid water rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The judgment is reversed, with costs to appellants, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b50-7\">Stone, C.
