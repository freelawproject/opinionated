Suit was commenced in justice\u2019s court by oral pleadings, and judgment was given the plaintiff in the sum of $209.50. The defendant appealed to the circuit court, where plaintiff again prevailed. At the trial in the circuit court the plaintiff, who was the only witness sworn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>on the trial, testified that, after sending defendant several monthly statements of the amount owed by him, he (the plaintiff) called the defendant up by telephone, asking him if he got his mail at the office, to which defendant replied that he did; that plaintiff said he thought probably he did not, as he had not paid any attention to the account, and plaintiff stated that the defendant thereupon said, \u201cI only wished I owed you twice as much\u201d; that the defendant never disputed the account, and admitted it in the justice\u2019s court; that he knew that the goods were delivered to the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-5\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant requested the trial judge to direct a verdict for the defendant, and before the motion was passed upon the plaintiff stated that he had further proofs to offer, if necessary. The court overruled the motion, to which defendant\u2019s counsel excepted, and stated that he had no defense to offer. The plaintiff thereupon moved for a directed verdict, which motion was granted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b386-6\">BROOKE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agjn\">(after <em>stating the facts). </em>The single question before us raised by the assignments of error seems to be as to the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case. It is the contention of the defendant\u2019s counsel that the plaintiff failed to make out his case by either proper or sufficient evidence. To this we' cannot agree. Taking into consideration plaintiff\u2019s testimony that the defendant admitted the account in the justice\u2019s court; that, although monthly statements had been sent to the defendant for several months, no attention had been paid to them by the defendant; the fact that in the telephone conversation in referring to the account the defendant said, *T only wished I owed yo\u00fc twice as much\u201d; and the testimony of the plaintiff that the goods were actually delivered, we are of the opinion that a <em>prima facie </em>case was made.
