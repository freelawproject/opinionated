Wi. Graham, (Seal.)\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-15\">Endorsed, \u201cFor value received I assign the within note to <em>James F. Fahnestock. </em>Sam. Fahnestock, Jlgent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-16\">The appellant appeared to the suit, and gave bond with security to satisfy any judgment that might be recovered against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-17\">The plaintiff below then declared against him as in an action of debt, describing the single bill as payable to <em>S. F., </em>and not to <em>S. F., </em>agent, and averring an assignment in writing, corresponding with the endorsement above recited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-18\">After <em>oyer </em>of the single bill, the defendant pleaded in bar:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-19\">1. That the said <em>S. F. </em>was not duly authorized to make and sign the said assignment in writing, of the said single bill, and the said sum of $200 31 to the said <em>James, </em>in manner, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-20\"><em>2. </em>That at the time of the commencement of the action, the plaintiff who declared by attorney, and not by guardian or next friend, was an infant. This plea was not verified by oath.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-21\">The plaintiff demurred generally to the first, and moved the court to reject the second plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The county court sustained the demurrer and rejected the second plea, and rendered judgment for the amount of the debt and damages, &amp;c., and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b224-5\">The cause was argued before Archer, C. J., Dorsey, Chambers, Spence and Magruder, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-6\">By Spencer for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-7\">By Palmer for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b224-8\">Archer, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Asx\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The single bill which constitutes the cause of action in this case, is drawn payable to <em>Samuel Fahnestock, </em>agent, and the declaration alleges that the single bill was made payable to him, without averring that it was made payable to him as agent. There exists no foundation for the objection urged, that there is a variance between the single bill, and the allegations of the <em>nar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The contract is expressly made with the plaintiff; the addition of the word agent is a mere description, and is like the case of a note or single bill made payable to <em>A. B., executor. </em>The principle has often been decided: 8 <em>Con. </em>60, and the cases there cited; the promise is to the agent personally: 8 <em>Mas. </em>103. The same judgment has been pronounced in this court. <em>Turner &amp; Plowden, 2 G. &amp; J. </em>435.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">If the above positions be true, it follows that <em>Samuel Fahnestock </em>being invested with the legal right to the single bill, possessed the power of assignment; and in this case, whether he possessed the legal authority to assign to the plaintiff the single bill, was a question of law. The plea therefore of the defendant which put this question to the jury, was bad on demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">The plea of the defendant which alleged the infancy of the plaintiff, was properly struck out by the court. The subject matter of the plea was in abatement, and it is not verified by affidavit, without which it could not be received. 3 <em>Cain\u2019s Rep. </em>99, 100. 1 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>442. <em>Eagle vs. Nelson, </em>4 <em>H. &amp; McH. </em>413. 4 <em>Anne, ch. </em>16, <em>sec. </em>11.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
