Because the original judgment, as appears judicially by the pleadings in the record of said action, was rendered upon an absolute bond for the payment of a certain sum of $12,000, and the declaration, on which said judgment was rendered, does not disclose the cause of action to be a bond with a collateral condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-19\">2nd. Because the defendant, not having craved <em>oyer of the bond, </em>filed with the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, the said bond is not a part of the record in said original writ, and cannot judicially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>be pronounced by the court to be a bond with collateral condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\">3rd. Because the clerk has made a mistake in extending the original judgment, by making it to appear that it is a judgment on a bond with a collateral condition, when the pleadings in the cause do not warrant any such inference or action of the clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-6\">4th. Because the said original judgment ought to have been extended in point of fact as the law required it to be done, and not having been so extended, it is misprision in the clerk, and ought now to be corrected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-7\">5th. Because under the 27th rule of court, herewith filed, the said judgment was not a judgment by default under the rule, but a confessed judgment, and absolute in its terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-8\">Personally appears, in open court, on this 28th day of August, A.

That at the time said directions were given, the docket entries were particularly examined, and were \u201cdebt, 1 cap\u2019s, rule nar.\u2014nar. and bond filed, rule plea, judg\u2019t,\u201d and no other entries, so far as recollected. That the other entries, now appearing upon said docket, in said case, were added after said instructions were given. That the said case was particularly pointed out to <em>Mr. </em>McCormick, and the instructions to the best of this respondent\u2019s recollection, were given in writing, with the titling in the above case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-9\">Sworn to, this 28th day of August, 1845.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-10\">W.

Because the judgment was rendered by confession, generally, to the declaration filed in the cause, and the' declaration setting forth a good and substantial cause of action upon \u25a0a bond for the payment of a sum certain, the judgment ought to have been extended for the sum of money and damages set forth and claimed in the declaration, and the costs of suit. The damages to be released on the payment of the debt and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-5\">2nd.

Stone, </em>-Esq., an attorney of said court, some time in the year 1843, came to the said office, and requested this deponent to shew him the judgment of <em>Abraham Clark use of Baly L.

Stone, </em>by this deponent, when said <em>Stone </em>requested this deponent to extend the said judgment; that upon examining the papers, deponent felt doubtful how the judgment should be made up or extended, and to remove that doubt, deponent applied to the chief clerk in the office, <em>John Matthews, </em>Esq., who-in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>structed this deponent to extend the said judgment, by adding-after the word judgment, \u201c for $12,000, penalty and costs. To he released on the payment of-.\u201d That shortly after said judgment was so extended, <em>William B. Stone, </em>attorney <em>for </em>the plaintiff, directed this deponent to issue a <em>scire facias </em>to revive said judgment, as extended; and the <em>scire facias </em>was accordingly prepared by this deponent from a memorandum left with him by <em>Major Stone, </em>(which memorandum has been lost;) and before said <em>scire facias </em>was placed in the hands of the sheriff, said <em>Stone </em>examined the same, and approved of it; which said writ of <em>scire facias </em>is in the hand-writing of this deponent, and was returnable to August term, 1843, of this court. Deponent further states, to the best of his impression and belief, that <em>Major Stone </em>did examine said judgment, as extended on the docket of August term, 1832, before he gave the aforesaid memorandum by which the <em>scire facias </em>issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-7\">Sworn to, in open court, this 26th day of March, 1846.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-8\"><em>W. </em>Mitchell, <em>Clerk.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-9\">The motion of the plaintiff for an instruction from the court here to the clerk of this court, to correct the misprision and mistake in extending original judgment, upon which the writ of <em>scire facias, </em>in this cause, issued, by making the same to correspond with the facts and law growing out of the pleadings in the original action and judgment as rendered by the court, was then overruled. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-10\">The plaintiff, after the court had overruled his motion to correct the misprision of the clerk, in extending the judgment, moved the court to allow him to amend the <em>scire facias, </em>by reciting the original judgment as actually extended; and with the insertion of a prayer for a writ of enquiry to assess the damages. This motion was also overruled, and the plaintiff again appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-11\">The county court then on motion of the defendant, quashed the writ, with costs; and the plaintiff again appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b125-12\">The cause was argued before Archer, C. J., Dorsey and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>By Causin and T. F. Bowie for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-5\">By Brent and Digges for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b126-6\">Archer, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AEB\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Two reasons are assigned for the motion to quash the <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">1. Because the judgment upon which it issued is an interlocutory judgment, and</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\"><em>2. </em>Because the appellant had no right to prosecute a <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">In answer to the first reason, it may be remarked, that if the judgment was interlocutory, the appellee could avail himself of the objection on a plea of <em>nul tiel record. </em>The motion to quash the writ, in this case, was not an appropriate remedy, The writ of <em>sci. fa. </em>is not defective on its face, but states a good judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">But again, it is not an interlocutory judgment. The judgment is for penalty and costs, to be released on payment of-. The amount of the sum to be paid is not stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">From this entry of the judgment, we think it indicates a judgment, by confession, for the penalty, to be released upon the payment of such sum as might thereafter be agreed upon; and that it is not binding, as a judgment, until the sum shall be ascertained, as originally contemplated. It has been supposed, that the character of the judgment is to be ascertained by the proceedings and docket entries in the original suit. But we think, that we can only look for that purpose to the judgment, as it has been extended by the clerk. Whether it has been properly extended by the clerk, is not for us, in this suit, to determine. Motions for amendment have been made, but they were necessarily made in the original case, and could only be acted upon by us on an appeal taken in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">The second reason assigned, is, that the appellant had no right to issue a <em>scire facias </em>in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">The act of 1830, ch. 165, gives the right to equitable assignees of judgments to issue <em>scire facias </em>in their own names, to revive the same without administration being granted on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>estate of the legal plaintiff; and it further provides, that in all suits entered for the use of any person, where the legal plaintiff shall die before judgment, the person for whose use the same may be entered, or his representative, shall have power to prosecute the same to judgment as if the legal plaintiff had not died. It has been argued, that as the act has made use of the term equitable assignee in one clause, and <em>cestui que use </em>in another, the rights conferred on an equitable assignee to issue a <em>sci.fa. </em>was not intended to be conferred on the <em>cestui que use; </em>to this proposition we cannot assent. The term equitable assignee is sufficiently comprehensive to include the <em>cestui que use; </em>and the right to prosecute a suit to judgment, on the death of the legal plaintiff, is conferred on the <em>cestui que </em>use, because he is the equitable assignee of the cause of action; and if he may prosecute to judgment in his own name, and in such name have execution, or a <em>scire </em>facias, there is nothing in the reason of the law which would exclude him from having a <em>scire facias </em>on a judgment, where he has prosecuted the suit in the name of the legal plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The above observations dispose of the motion to quash the <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The only remaining question arises on the motion to amend the <em>scire </em>facias, so that it may conform to the judgment, on the supposition, that it was an interlocutory judgment. The judgment of the court below, was, we think, in this respect, right; for as we have before stated, the final entry of the clerk is to he considered, until amended, as the judgment of the court; and as it now stands, it is not an interlocutory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
