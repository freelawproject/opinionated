C. of B., </em>providing for the collection of city taxes imposed by the <em>M. and C.

And said resolution it is agreed shall be a part of this statement, and may be read as such from the printed ordinances of the city of <em>Baltimore.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-12\">It is also agreed that any ordinance of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>and any act of Assembly which either party may desire to use in the hearing of this case, either in the county court or Court of Appeals, may be read and used as a part of this statement from the printed ordinances of the city of Baltimore, and the printed acts of Assembly of <em>Maryland, </em>to have the same effect as a part of this statement, as if it were inserted at large and duly authenticated. It is further agreed, that it shall be competent for the court to draw such and other inferences of facts from those above agreed on, as a jury could do if the same were offered in evidence to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-13\">. It is further agreed, that if upon the aforegoing statement of facts the court shall be of opinion that the said <em>Morris </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>entitled to recover back from said <em>M. and C. C. of B. </em>the taxes so as aforesaid paid by him, or any part thereof, then the court shall render judgment against the said <em>M. and C. C. of B. </em>for the amount of said taxes, or so much thereof as the court shall be of opinion the said <em>Morris </em>is entitled to recover back from said <em>M. and C. C. </em>with costs. But if the court shall be of opinion that the said <em>Morris </em>is not entitled to recover back the said taxes so as aforesaid paid by him, nor any part thereof from the said <em>M. and C. C., </em>then the court shall render judgment in favor of the <em>M. and C. C., </em>the defendants in this action, with costs of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-5\">And it is agreed that either parly may appeal from the judgment of <em>Baltimore county court </em>upon the aforegoing statement; and that upon appeal by either party, the Court of Appeals may render judgment on the aforegoing statement of facts and agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-6\">The judgment being against the plaintiff, he prosecuted an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b255-7\">The cause was argued before Archer, C J., Dorsey, Magruder and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-8\">By Dclany and Meredith for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-9\">By Presstman and McMahon for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b255-10\">Martin, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_r\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">The validity of the tax imposed in this case upon the stock held by the appellant in the banks of Baltimore, chartered previous to the year 1821, is maintained by the opinion delivered at the present term, by this court, in the case of <em>Gordon </em>against the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore; </em>and the only question presented for our consideration is, whether, assuming the tax to have been unauthorised and illegal, an action to recover back the sum paid, could, under the circumstances exhibited in the agreed statement of facts, be sustained by the appellant against the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>In the case of the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore against Lefferman, </em>heard and decided at the December term, 1846, the doctrine of voluntary and compulsory payments was discussed with great ability by the counsel who were concerned in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">All the authorities cited during the present argument were by the research of the counsel in the former case, brought to the view of the court: in both cases it is apparent that the tax was demanded and paid under the impression, sincerely and honestly entertained by both parties, that it was legally due, and although the means of vindicating himself against the assessment, if it was illegal, was as amply secured to the defendant, as if an unjust demand had been imposed upon him by an individual, the right to maintain the action was placed in the <em>Mayor and City Council vs. Lefferman, </em>as it has been in the present case, upon the ground of a supposed inequality in the condition of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">After a careful review and examination of the authorities, the court announced in the case of the <em>Mayor and City Council against Lefferman, </em>what they regarded as the true doctrine upon the subject of voluntary and compulsory payments, as far as it was applicable to the case before them; and we certainly have not been able to perceive any reason for departing from the propositions there enunciated.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">On the contrary, we desire to be understood as re-affirming the principles declared in the <em>Mayor and City Council and Lefferman; </em>and as that case cannot be distinguished <em>from </em>the one before us, we should have affirmed the judgment of the court below, even if we had considered the tax as unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
