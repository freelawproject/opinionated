If the jury shall fmd from the evidence, that at the time <em>Rogers &amp; Frick </em>assigned and delivered the merchandise and notes in question to <em>Berrien </em>or <em>Larrabee, </em>they had no reasonable expectation of being exempted from liability or execution, for or on account of their debts, without applying for the benefit of the insolvent laws, then the said transfer was made with a view, or under an expectation on the part of <em>Rogers &amp; Frick, </em>of being or becoming insolvent debtors, and said transfer is void; and shall further believe, that <em>Rogers Frick </em>did afterwards apply for the benefit of the insolvent laws of the State of <em>Maryland, </em>the plaintiff is entitled to recover, provided the jury shall believe that <em>Berrien </em>had notice of the condition of insolvency of said <em>Rogers &amp; Frick. </em>Notwithstanding, they shall also believe that <em>Larrabee </em>acted as the agent of <em>Berrien </em>in the receipt of the property, and had shipped the goods to <em>Gilbert, </em>before the demand of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">2. Although the jury should believe that <em>Rogers &amp; Frick </em>had reasonable expectations of being exempted from liability or execution, for or on account of their debts, at the time of the assignment and delivery, as referred to in the first instruction, yet if the jury find the said assignment and delivery, and that the same was made with the view of being or becoming insolvent debtors, and with intent thereby to give an undue and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>improper preference, and that they afterwards applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws, that then said assignment is void, although the jury should believe that said assignment was made in satisfaction of a <em>bona fide </em>debt due from said <em>Rogers \u00bf\u00a1f </em>Frick, and although they should find that <em>Berrien </em>had no notice of the condition of insolvency of said <em>Rogers 8f </em>Frick, if such insolvent condition existed at the time of said assignment; and the plaintiff is entitled to recover, although the defendant acted as mere agent of <em>Berrien, </em>if the jury shall find that the defendant shipped the goods before action brought, to <em>Gilbert </em>of <em>JYew York.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">These prayers were granted by the court below, and exceptions having been taken to the ruling of the court, the question presented for our consideration is, whether they erred in the instructions which they appear to have given to the jury, with respect to the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">It is apparent from the statement we have given of this case, that the material and prominent question raised by the record, is that which respects the validity of the transfer of the 12th May, 1841.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">And upon this point, the counsel for the appellant have contended, that as <em>Berrien </em>\u00bfr <em>Co. </em>were citizens of <em>JYew </em>York, the insolvent laws of <em>Maryland </em>could not prevent <em>Rogers 8f Frick </em>from discharging their <em>bona fide </em>indebtedness to them by a delivery of the property mentioned in the declaration; and that as the contract by which they were so indebted to <em>Berrien fy Co. </em>wras made in <em>JYew </em>York, such insolvent laws could not prevent the debt being discharged, in the mode and manner stated in the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">We did not understand the counsel for the appellee as controverting the proposition advanced by the counsel for the appellant, that the contract between <em>Berrien &amp;/\u2022 Co. </em>and <em>Rogers Frick </em>was to be considered as a <em>JYew York </em>contract. The goods were purchased by <em>Rogers </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>Frick </em>in <em>JYew York, </em>and there is no doubt that in legal contemplation, the contract was to be performed there, and to be governed by the laws of that State. The fact that a promissory note was subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>drawn at <em>Baltimore </em>by <em>Rogers Frick, </em>in favor of <em>Berrien fy Co., </em>as evidence of tbeir indebtedness, cannot be treated as altering the locality of the contract. The original cause of action is never considered as extinguished by the mere taking of the promissory note of the debtor, and therefore, if the note is not paid, and is surrendered, it has always been held, that an action may be maintained on the common courts for the sale and delivery of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">We have then before us a contract made and to be performed in <em>JYew York, </em>between citizens of <em>Maryland </em>and citizens of <em>New York, </em>and it is now settled by the adjudications of the Supreme Court, that the discharge obtained by <em>Rogers </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>Frick </em>under the insolvent laws of <em>Maryland, </em>could not affect the right of <em>Berrien </em>Sr <em>Co. </em>to obtain against them in the <em>Maryland </em>courts, au absolute and unqualified judgment, and to place their execution upon any property of the insolvent debtors, to be found undistributed in the hands of their trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">In the case of <em>Cook vs. Moffat &amp; Curtis, 5 How. Rep. 295, </em>it appeared that <em>Moffat &amp; Curtis, </em>merchants of <em>New York, </em>sold goods to <em>Cook, </em>who was a merchant and resident of <em>Baltimore ; </em>that on a settlement of their accounts, <em>Cook </em>transmitted his promissory notes to his attorney in <em>New York, </em>who delivered them to <em>Moffat &amp; Curtis, </em>and that after the notes became due, <em>Cook </em>applied for and obtained the benefit of the insolvent laws of <em>Maryland. </em>An action was instituted against <em>Cook </em>in the Circuit Court for the District of <em>Maryland </em>on the common money courts. <em>Cook </em>pleaded his discharge under the <em>Maryland </em>insolvent laws, insisting that the contract was to be performed in <em>Maryland, </em>and governed by the laws of <em>Maryland </em>in existence at the time it was made, and that therefore his discharge under her laws was a good defence to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The case was presented to the Circuit Court, upon an agreed statement of facts, and the court overruled the plea and gave an absolute judgment for the plaintiff. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court at the January term, 1847. This case in its leading facts is strikingly similar to the one under consideration, and we refer to the opinion of the court, as con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>tabling what must now be regarded as the final adjudication of the Supreme Court, upon a question, which has produced since it was first agitated, much conflict of opinion, and has given rise to many perplexing doubts.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>Mr. Justice </em>Grier, who delivered the opinion of the court, when speaking of the locality of the contract, at page 307 says\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u201c That the contract declared on in this case was to be performed in <em>Maryland, </em>and to be governed by her laws, is a position that cannot be successfully maintained, and was therefore very properly abandoned on the argument here. For although the notes purport to have been made in <em>Baltimore, </em>they were delivered in <em>New York, </em>in payment of goods purchased there, and of course, were payable there, and governed by the laws of that place.\u201d He says\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u201c That the question to be decided is, whether the bankrupt law of <em>Maryland </em>can operate to discharge the plaintiff in error from a contract made by him in <em>New York, </em>with citizens of that State ?\u201d He controverts the proposition that the opinion in <em>Ogden vs. Saunders </em>is liable to the imputation of having established the doctrine, that a State court would be justifiable in giving effect to a bankrupt discharge, which the courts of the <em>United States </em>would declare invalid, and affirms that such a decision has never been made by this court. Upon this subject his language is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u201c The Constitution of the <em>United States </em>is the supreme law of the land, and binds every forum, whether it derives its authority from a State, or from, the <em>United States.- </em>When this court has declared State legislation to be in conflict with the Constitution of the <em>United States, </em>and therefore void, the State tribunals are bound to conform to such decision. A bankrupt law which comes within this category, cannot be pleaded as a discharge, even in the forums of the State which enacted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\u25a0 \u201cIt is true, that as between the several States of this Union, their respective bankrupt laws, like those of foreign States, can have no effect in any forum beyond their respective limits, unless by comity. But it is not a necessary consequence, that State courts can treat this subject as if the States Were wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>foreign to each other, and inflict her bankrupt laws on contracts and persons not within their limits.\u201d Again he says\u2014\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u201cAccordingly, we find that when in the case of <em>Sturgis vs. Croioninshield, </em>this court decided that a State has authority to pass a bankrupt law, provided there be no act of Congress in force to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy, it was nevertheless considered to be subject to the further condition, that such law should not impair the obligation of contracts within the meaning of the Constitution of the <em>United States, </em>art. 1, sec. 10. It followed as a corollary from this modification and restraint of the power of the State to pass such laws, that they could have no effect on contracts made before their enactment, or beyond their territory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We have quoted largely from the opinion of the learned Judge in this case, because it contains the views of a court whose decisions upon all questions of constitutional law, are to be received as conclusive; and it appears to us, that the principles enunciated in that opinion clearly establish, that the provisions of the insolvent laws relied on by the counsel for the appellee as invalidating this transfer, can have no effect upon the rights of these creditors. In other words, to use the language of the court, in <em>Cook vs. Moffat, </em>the State of <em>Maryland </em>has no constitutional power to inflict her insolvent laws on contracts and persons not within her limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The counsel for the appellee have however contended, that the provisions of the <em>Maryland </em>insolvent laws, as contained in the sixth section of the act of 1816, ch. 221, and the first section of the act of 1834, ch. 293, are not open to the constitutional objection that has been urged against them, because they leave unimpaired the obligations of this contract. But it is impossible to maintain this proposition. What is the obligation of the contract in the sense in which this term is used, in the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution of the <em>United States?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">This question is to be answered by referring to the exposition which has been given to this clause of the Constitution, by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>In <em>Sturgis vs. </em>Crowninshield, 4 <em>Wheat. </em>197, the court said\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">\u201c It would seem difficult to substitute words, which are more intelligible, or less liable to misconstruction, than those which are to be explained. A contract is an agreement in which a party undertakes to do, or not to do a particular thing. The law binds him to perform his undertaking, and this is, of course, the obligation of his contract. In the case at bar, the defendant has given his promissory note to pay the plaintiff a sum of money on or before a certain day. The contract binds him to pay that sum on that day; and this is its obligation. Any law which releases a part of this obligation, must, in the literal sense of the word, impair it. Much more must a law impair it which makes it totally invalid, and entirely discharges it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In <em>McCracken vs. </em>Hayward, 2 <em>How. </em>612, <em>Mr. Justice Baldwin </em>said\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u201c In placing the obligation of contracts under the protection of the Constitution, its framers looked to the essentials of the contract more than to the forms and modes of proceeding, by which it was to be carried into execution; annulling all State legislation which impairs its obligation, it was left to the States to prescribe and shape the remedy to enforce it. The obligation of the contract consists in its binding force on the party who makes it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\"><em>Mr. Justice </em>Story, in his Conflict of Laws, section 226, says:</p>\n<p id=\"Afl\">\u201c The obligation of a contract is the duty to perform it whatever may be its nature. It may be a moral obligation, or a legal obligation, or both. But when we speak of obligation generally, we mean legal obligation\u2014that is, the right to performance, which the law confers on one party, and the corresponding duty of performance, to which it binds the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9A\">What was the obligation of this contract? It was the duty imposed by law upon <em>Rogers </em>&amp; <em>Frick </em>to pay <em>Berrien &amp; Co. </em>for the merchandise they had purchased, in money, or in goods, if goods were accepted by the creditors as an equivalent for money. It was decided in <em>Gregory vs. </em>Mack, 3 <em>Hill, N. Y. Rep. </em>384,\u2014\u201c That when the parties have agreed on a particular thing as a medium of payment, whether it be lands, goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>or labor, and the agreement has been carried into execution, it is the same thing in legal effect, as though the like sum had been paid in money.\u201d <em>Smith on Mercantile </em>Law, 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Now we find that <em>Rogers Frick, </em>in fulfilment of this obligation, transferred to <em>Berrien &amp; Co. </em>on the 12th of May, 1841, the property sought to be recovered, in payment of their indebtment, and that it was so received and accepted by <em>Berrien Co. </em>And can it be maintained, that a law which invalidates this transfer, annuls this payment, takes from the creditors the property which they had fairly acquired in the exercise of a right conferred upon them by the common law, and places it in the hands of the trustee, to be distributed exclusively among the domestic creditors of the insolvent debtors, unless the foreign creditors will take their dividend upon the humiliating condition of surrendering their acknowledged constitutional privilege to object to the insolvent\u2019s discharge,\u2014is not a law impairing the obligation of the contract? We think not. A proposition of this kind cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The true view of the case is, that the right of these creditors to obtain a preference over the other creditors of the insolvent, and the privilege of the debtors to give this preference, stands precisely as if these insolvent laws were not to be found among the statutes of the state. And under circumstances, no exception could be taken to the validity of this transfer. In the case of <em>Hickley vs. The Farmers &amp; Merchants </em>Bank, 5 <em>G. &amp; John. </em>380, the Court of Appeals recognize the principle :\u2014\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u201c That by the common law, and apart from the provisions of the insolvent laws of this state, the debtor may secure one creditor to the exclusion of others, either by payment, or by a <em>bona fide </em>transfer of his property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The late bankrupt law of the <em>United States </em>was passed on the 19th of August, 1841 ; but it was expressly provided by the seventeenth section of the statute, that it should take effect only from and after the first day of February, 1842. This is equivalent to declaring that the act should have no effect until that day; and therefore, there is no foundation for the point made by the counsel for the appellant: that the insolvent laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>of <em>Maryland </em>were suspended in their operation by the bankrupt act of the <em>United States, </em>at the period when the proceedings of <em>Rogers 8f Frick </em>under those laws were commenced, and consummated. At that time, the bankrupt act was not in force, and there could have been no conflict between the national and state legislation upon this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In <em>Ex </em>Parte, <em>Eames, </em>2 <em>Story Rep. </em>325, <em>Mr. Justice Story said: </em>\u201c That as soon as the bankrupt act went into operation, in February, 1842, it <em>ipso facto </em>suspended all action on future cases, arising under the state insolvent laws, where the insolvent persons were within the purview of the Bankrupt Act. I say future cases, because very different considerations would or might apply, where proceedings under any state insolvent laws were commenced, and were in progress before the bankrupt act went into operation. It appears to me, that both systems cannot be in operation, or apply at the same time to the same persons; and where the state and national legislation, upon the same subject, and the same persons, come in conflict, the national laws must prevail, and suspend the operation of the state laws. This as far as I know has been the uniform doctrine maintained in all the courts of the <em>United </em>States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In the argument of this cause various other points were raised and discussed by the counsel, upon which it has become unnecessary to express an opinion, as the views we have taken of the insolvent laws of Maryland dispose of the whole case.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">We think the court below erred in the instructions given by them to the jury, and that their judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
