The act is not gratified by a constructive delivery, nor by an actual and express delivery, if it does not accompany the gift.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b469-10\">Appeal from the Court of Chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-11\">This appeal which was argued for the appellant only, with the preceding one, was similar in its circumstances with that: The appellee married <em>Elisabeth Jinn Shipley, </em>another daughter of <em>James Shipley, </em>to whom on the 3d August, 1841, he made another conveyance of a slave called <em>Miranda. </em>The appellee claimed also under a gift, from <em>J. S., </em>to his daughter made in 1835, at which time <em>S. </em>was not, indebted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-12\">The Chancellor (Bland) also decreed a perpetual injunction in this cause, prohibiting the appellants as creditors of <em>J. S., </em>from proceeding to recover their debt by <em>ji. fa. </em>levied upon the slave <em>Miranda.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-13\">From that decree the defendant in Chancery appealed to this eourt.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b469-14\">The cause was argued before Archer, C. J., Dorsey, Chambers, Magruder, and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-15\">By T. S. Alexander, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-16\">No counsel appeared for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Martin J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYl\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">With respect to the validity of the bill of sale of the 3d of August, 1841, this case cannot be distinguished from that of <em>Thomas C. Worthington </em>and <em>Isaac C. Anderson </em>against <em>Mary E. </em>Shipley, already determined. The voluntary conveyance of the 3d of August, 1841, must be held fraudulent and void under the statute of 13 <em>Eliz. </em>for the reasons assigned in the case to which we have referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In this case, however, the bill alleges, that Miranda, the slave in question, was verbally given, at the period of her birth, which was about the year 1835, by <em>James Shipley </em>to his daughter Elizabeth, who is the wife of the complainant. As at this time there was no indebtment by <em>James Shipley </em>to the appellant, the gift is unaffected by the statute of 13 <em>Eliz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">This averment in the bill is sustained, we think, by the evidence in the cause; and the title of the appellee to this slave turns upon the question, whether the verbal gift was perfected in the mode prescribed by the act of 1763, ch. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Under the provisions of this act of Assembly it is essential to the validity of a parol gift of a slave, that there should be an express delivery of the property at the time, and in pursuance of the gift. The requirements of the statute are not gratified by a constructive delivery, nor by an actual and express delivery if it does not accompany the gift. <em>The factum </em>of the gift is, in this case, very clearly established; but the appellee has not succeeded in proving that express delivery of possession at the time of the gift, which is required by the act of 1763, ch. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">It follows from what we have said, that the appellee has shown no title to the slave in controversy, and that the Chancellor therefore erred in making the injunction perpetual.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">DECREE REVERSED WITH COSTS AND BILL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
