That the said <em>Thomas Smoot </em>has had the possession, and has paid to your orator in sundry ways all of the said purchase money, except the sum of, &amp;c., which your orator charges was due and unpaid on the 9th May, 1842, and yet remains due and unpaid with interest. That the said <em>Thomas Smoot </em>having become insolvent and bankrupt, and having been so decreed, upon his application to the District Court of the United States, for the Maryland District, a certain <em>William W. Laird </em>was, by order of the said court, appointed assignee, in bankruptcy, for the said <em>Thomas Smoot, </em>and the said <em>William W. Laird </em>as assignee, or agent as aforesaid, and with the consent of the said <em>Thomas Smoot, </em>has made sale of all the right and title of the said <em>Thomas Smoot, </em>in, and to the said property; and at said sale, a certain <em>Jacob Wilson, </em>of said county, has become the purchaser and highest bidder for the said property, for the sum of, &amp;c., and, has taken possession of the said property, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>now holds and claims the said property from and under the said <em>Thomas Smoot </em>as aforesaid. Your orator charges, that public notice was given at the said sale of the said assignee, or as agent of said Smoot, that your orator had a claim upon the said property, for the balance aforesaid of the purchase money, due as aforesaid. That the said <em>Jacob Wilson </em>became a purchaser of the said property as aforesaid, from and under the said <em>Thomas </em>Smoot, with knowledge that your orator held the claim as aforesaid upon the said property, for the balance <em>of </em>the purchase money. Prayer for a sale to enforce and satisfy the lien, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">The answer of <em>Jacob Wilson </em>admitted the sale to <em>Smoot, </em>but was ignorant how much, if any, of the purchase money was unpaid; and also admitted that said <em>Smoot </em>did become a bankrupt, that <em>William W. Laird </em>was appointed his assignee, and after giving bond as such, set up to auction, and sold clear of all incumbrances, the said property, when this respondent became the purchaser <em>thereof; that </em>by such sale all the rights and liens of said <em>Turpin, </em>if any he had, have been extinguished, and that his only redress is from the purchase money now in the hands of the said assignee. This respondent expressly denies that he heard said <em>Turpin, </em>or any one else, at said sale, or before, assert that he, said <em>Turpin, </em>had any claim to or upon said property, although said <em>Turpin </em>may have announced that statement; but he submits that if he did so, still said property was sold clear of all liens or incumbrances; and that said <em>Turpin\u2019s </em>only redress is <em>from the </em>assignee in bankruptcy; and that such has been the decision in the courts of the <em>United States. </em>That said <em>Smoot </em>has either paid or secured the whole of the purchase money of said property to said <em>Turpin, </em>and that thereby, as respondent is advised, the liens of said <em>Turpin </em>have been extinguished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">After proof taken, which is not material in reference to the question decided by this court, the Chancellor (Bland) on the 17th February, 1846, decreed the property to be sold for the payment of the complainant\u2019s claim\u2014from which the defendant below appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The cause was argued before Archer, C. J., Chambers, Spence, Magruder and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-5\">By R. Johnson for the appellants, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-6\">By C. McLean for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b66-7\">Chambers, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AaD\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">This court is relieved from the necessity of any elaborate discussion of the provisions of the bankrupt law of the United States, and its true construction as far as it regards the question involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, at all times, and on all subjects, entitled to the most respectful consideration, are, we think, of conclusive force and effect when deliberately formed and expressed on a question of construction of the Constitution of the United States, or of an Act of Congress made pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">It is the opinion of the court, that the bankrupt law, under which the appellant claimed to exempt the real estate purchased by him at the sale of the assignee, must avail him according to the cases reported in 3 <em>Howard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">In the case <em>ex parte Christie, Mr. Justice Story </em>pronouncing the opinion of the court, says: \u201cthe district courts possess jurisdiction to suspend proceedings in the State courts then pending, or thereafter to be brought, by any creditor or person having adverse interests against the bankrupt, or his assets after bankruptcy.\u201d See page 318; and he instances the case of suits brought in the State courts by various mortgagees to enforce their several liens, as an illustration of the evils that would attend a contrary construction; after enumerating which, he says in 319\u2014\u201c all this, however, is completely avoided by bringing the whole matters in controversy between all the mortgagees before the district court or circuit court, making them all parties to the summary proceedings in equity, and thus enabling the court to marshal the rights, and priorities, and claims of all the parties; and by a sale and other proceedings, after satisfying the just claims of the mortgagees, applying the residue of the assets, if any, for the benefit of general creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The same doctrine is announced in the subsequent case of <em>Norton\u2019s assignee vs. Boyd et al. in the same </em>vol., <em>page </em>437 - and the judge who had expressed a dissenting opinion in the first case in giving his views in <em>Norton\u2019s assignee vs. </em>Boyd, <em>in page </em>440, <em>says: </em>\u201c That a mortgage can be foreclosed in the bankrupt court, and the lien given by it preserved there, I have never doubted if the jurisdiction of the State court had not attached, and was not ousted by the proceedings in bankruptcy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Both those were cases in which the State courts had actually assumed and exercised jurisdiction before the petition of the bankrupt. The court in each, and after elaborate argument, decide that the district court has the authority, as the circumstances of the case may demand, to interpose and claim exclusive jurisdiction, or allow the proceedings to be consummated in the State courts. But the unquestionable result of both decisions, is to clothe the assignee with ample authority to administer the assets, whether real or personal; and especially to sell mortgaged estates, and of course, to pass a title to the purchaser in every case where \u201c the jurisdiction of the State court had not attached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The appellee in this case had full remedy in the district court, and would doubtless, on a proper application there, be treated as an incumbrancer upon the premises sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">As an equitable mortgagee, he held a specific lien on the premises sold, in the hands of his vendee, and in the hands of any voluntary assignee, or an assignee taking by force of a legal proceeding, which entitled him to have his lien enforced against the proceeds of the mortgaged premises, precisely, as if it had been an actual mortgage regularly acknowledged and recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">If the property has produced less at the assignee\u2019s sale than it should or could have been sold for, it is a consideration which cannot affect the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">DECREE REVERSED, AND BIEL DISMISSED WITHOUT COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
