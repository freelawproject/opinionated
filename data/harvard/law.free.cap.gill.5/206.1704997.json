That no demand of the lands hath been made according to the act of Assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-16\">At November term, 1844, the county court ordered that the motion for the <em>habere facias </em>be overruled as to all the lands conveyed by <em>John Brewer </em>to <em>Caleb R. Penn </em>and wife, and that the writ issue for the residue of the lands sold as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-17\">From this judgment, <em>William G. Penn </em>and <em>John Penn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>appealed to this court, and the judgment of the county court was affirmed upon argument at June term, 1846, and execution awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\">On the 3d August, 1846, <em>Robert Isherwood </em>presented a petition to the Honorable <em>T. B. Dorsey, </em>one of the judges of the Court of Appeals for the <em>Western </em>Shore, alleging that since the affirmance of the judgment aforesaid, a writ of <em>hab. fac. pos. </em>had been issued to <em>W. 0. Chappell, </em>Esq., sheriff of <em>Montgomery </em>county, but the said sheriff having informed the said <em>R. I. </em>that he is interested in the property of the said <em>W. G. Penn, </em>referred to in said writ, and in possession thereof as his trustee, has returned said writ to the hands of your petitioner, to be delivered to the clerk of the Court of Appeals; and there being on the face of the said writ an informality, the petitioner countermanded the same; that he is credibly informed and verily believes there is <em>no coroner </em>in said county, and that the sheriff of the said county cannot safely be trusted with the execution of the said writ of <em>hab. fac. pos. </em>to be issued in said cause, and therefore prays an elisor' may be appointed accordingly, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">To this petition was appended the affidavit of <em>Robert Isherwood, </em>before a justice of the peace of <em>Montgomery </em>county, \u201cthat the matters and things in the foregoing petition stated, of his own knowledge are true, and those stated on the knowledge and information of others he believes to be true; and further, that the said sheriff of <em>Montgomery </em>county cannot safely be trusted with the execution of the said writ of <em>hab. fac. pos.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-7\">On the 5th August, 1842, the Honorable <em>T. B. Dorsey </em>nominated and appointed <em>H. Harding, </em>Esq. of <em>Montgomery </em>county, an <em>elisor </em>to whom should be directed the writ of execution to be issued by the clerk of the Court of Appeals for the <em>Western Shore, </em>on the judgment, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-8\">A writ was accordingly issued on the 7th August, 1846, and <em>II. Harding </em>declined to act; upon that fact appearing to the judge by the written declaration of <em>Mr. Harding </em>endorsed on the writ, on the 24th August, he certified to the clerk of the court, the appointment of <em>Joseph Snyder </em>as elisor, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>place and stead of <em>II. Harding. </em>The writ was again issued, and <em>J. S. </em>also declined to act; this also appearing to the judge on petition, and by the endorsement of <em>J. S. </em>on the writ, on the 22d September, 1846, the judge appointed <em>Thomas L. F. Higgins </em>as elisor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">On the 28th September, 1846, a writ of possession was sued out, commanding the last named elisor \u201c to cause the said <em>R. I. </em>to have possession of the said tracts of land, <em>The JMdi~ tion to Ray\u2019s Adventure, Owens\u2019 Resurvey, </em>and <em>Resurvey on Moore\u2019s Delight, </em>except those parts of the two last mentioned tracts conveyed by <em>John Brewer </em>to <em>Caleb R. Penn </em>and wife, returnable to December term, 1845.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">The elisor returned the writ as executed on the 10th October, 1846, describing the property delivered in its very terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-7\">At December term, 1846, the return term of the <em>hab. fac. pos., </em>the appellants moved the court to quash it:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-8\">1. Because it was improvidently granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-9\"><em>2. </em>Because it was directed to an elisor without sufficient proof that the sheriff was incompetent to execute it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-10\">And they also moved to quash the return of the same:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-11\">1. Because the return does not state that the lands as described in the writ had been delivered into the possession of the appellee, and the same were not delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-12\">2. Because the said elisor actually turned the said parties out of the possession of property never sold by the sheriff, and to which the appellee never set up any claim; and, it does not appear that he caused a survey to be made, or took any other steps to ascertain the tracts or parts of tracts therein mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-13\">The appellants prayed leave to take testimony on three days notice as usual, before a justice of the peace of <em>Montgomery </em>county, and to lay down by a surveyor such lands as may be necessary for the purpose of showing their rights, and the land, of the possession of which they have been deprived, and to which the appellee had no claim, and such lands as may be necessary for illustration; and that they may be reinstated in possession of the said lands, if the said writ and return shall be quashed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>or such part thereof as the appellee may appear to have no right to the possession of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">The court granted the prayer of the appellants, subject to all just exceptions, and also the same pi'ivileges to the appellee, and required the appellant to file their proof and surveys by the 1st May, and the appellee to file his by the 1st June, 1847. Surveys were made, and a variety of affidavits taken and returned.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-6\">The motions to quash the writ of <em>hab.fac.pos. </em>and return, were argued before Archer, C. J., Chambers, Spence, Magruder and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-7\">By McLean and Carter for the motion, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-8\">By Palmer and Bowie contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b220-9\">Spence, J,,</author>\n<p id=\"ATL\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The legality of the sale made by the sheriff of <em>Montgomery </em>county, and certified in his return to the <em>venditioni </em>in this case, is not now an open question.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Objections were made in <em>Montgomery </em>county court to the sale, and the court after deliberation thereon passed the following order:\u2014\u201cThe court upon due consideration of the proceedings aforesaid, with all things thereunto relating, order and adjudge that the motion for a <em>habere facias </em>be overruled, as to all the lands conveyed by <em>John Brewer </em>to <em>Caleb R. Penn </em>and wife: the court further order and adjudge that the writ of the <em>State of Maryland </em>of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>issue for the residue of the lands sold as aforesaid.\u201d From this order of the county court, <em>William G. Penn </em>and <em>John Penn </em>appealed to the Court of Appeals, and at June term, 1846, this court affirmed the judgment of the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">It was insisted by the counsel of <em>Penn, </em>that the writ of <em>liabere facias </em>should have been directed to <em>Henry Harding, </em>late sheriff of <em>Montgomery </em>county, who sold the land mentioned in the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">To this argument, the act of 1831, chap. 41, furnishes an answer, which in its first section, is as follows: \u201c that in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>cases under the original act to which this is a supplement, it shall and may be lawful for any of the courts of this State, mentioned in said law, in case the sheriff, coroner or elisor shall die, resign, be removed from or disqualified for office, or have his authority otherwise terminated, after the sales mentioned in said law, and before the writ in the nature of a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>shall have been issued and executed, to issue said writ in the nature of a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>to any succeeding sheriff, coroner or elisor, so that all the other provisions of said law are complied with and observed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In this case, the term of office of the sheriff who made the sale had expired, and it was to prevent the writ being directed to his successor in office, that the application was made for the appointment for an elisor. The same reason does not exist in law, for confiding the execution of a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>to the sheriff who made the sale, as does for directing a <em>venditioni exponas </em>to the sheriff who levied the <em>fieri facias ; </em>in the former case, no property vests in the sheriff by the sale; in the latter case the law does clothe the sheriff with, a qualified property by virtue of the levy made under the <em>fieri facias. </em>We therefore think there is no force in this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The answer to the objection, that the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>commands the elisor to deliver more land than was sold by the sheriff is, that the command of the writ pursues strictly the return of the sheriff, and the order of the Court of Appeals, and the return made by the elisor to the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>certifies that he has delivered to <em>Isherwood, </em>the land named and described in the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">It was insisted by the counsel for the motion, that the appointment of the elisor was not made according to the provisions of the acts of Assembly of 1794, ch. 54, sec. 5, and 1843, ch. 270, and therefore illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The argument was that these acts require, that the judge should not be satisfied that the sheriff could not with safety be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>trusted to execute the writ by the affidavit of the party himself, but that the affidavit must he made by a disinterested person, one who would be a legal and competent witness at common law. This construction of the words \u201c satisfied by affidavit or otherwise,\u201d would not only be a construction which might be productive of great inconvenience, hut frequently deprive parties of the benefits intended by those statutes. The design of the statutes was that the judge should he satisfied of the truth of the allegation, that the sheriff could not safely be trusted, and not to decide any matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The language in the act of 1794, ch. 54, sec. 5, is \u201cand no such appointment shall be made by any judge or justice, unless he shall be satisfied by affidavit that the sheriff or coroner of the county cannot safely be trusted with the execution thereof.\u201d The words of the act of 1843, ch. 271, sec. 1, are \u201c in any case where the said court or justice shall be satisfied by affidavit or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">It is our opinion that the practice of the courts of the State from 1773 to this time, settles the construction of these words. The act of 1773, ch. 7, sec. 7, provides, that the justices of the provincial court or any county court, upon application made to them in court by any party or parties in or to any action or civil suit depending or shall he depending before them, and upon satisfaction being given to such court, by affidavit or otherwise, that there are material and competent witnesses in such cause, residing or living out of this province, to direct the clerk of such court to issue commission, &amp;c. If there has been any case, where any court in <em>Maryland </em>has refused to order a commission under this act, on the affidavit of the party, or any case in which the legality of such an order has been even questioned, it has escaped our attention: and we believe it is the universal practice in all the county courts of this State, to order such commissions to issue upon the affidavit of the parlies, where no other objection is made, than the insufficiency of the affidavit of the party himself for such a purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">THE MOTION IN THIS CASE IS OVERRULED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
