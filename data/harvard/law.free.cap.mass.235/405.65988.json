There had been a light snow during the night. She told her counsel where she fell; a broom was brought and her counsel \u201c swept a strip across the sidewalk as large as four feet.\u201d She testified she \u201csaw a mark on the ice which she was satisfied was the scrape she had made with the heel of her shoe when she fell because she saw it three times the night before.\u201d She further testified that she held the broom indicating the place where she fell when photographs were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The defendant objected to the question put to the plaintiff, \u201cWhere was the bottom part of the broom at the time the photograph was taken, with reference to the place where you fell?\u201d and excepted to the answer, \u201c It was on the place where I slipped where I marked already with my foot.\u201d She also objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>question put to the same witness, \u201cWere there some measurements taken as to where you slipped and fell?\u201d and excepted to the answer, \u201cMr. Rendle measured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">A deposition of the former associate counsel, Mr. Jenney, was introduced in evidence. Without objection, he testified that he visited the premises with the plaintiff, her attorney and the witness Rendle; that he \u201cnoticed that the conductor from the roof was broken and was missing for a distance of. ten or twelve feet above a steel elbow where the bottom part of the gutter apparently rested when it was in place. Deponent was then asked the following question: \u2018What was done while you were there relative to the snow on the sidewalk?\u2019 Deponent, beginning to answer, said \u2018Miss Norah Burke was asked where she fell and she pointed out a certain spot\u2019 ... at this point defendant objected to the portion of the answer then given,\u201d but did not ask, nor did the presiding judge refuse, to have the answer stricken out. The deponent without objection, continued, \u201cMr. Norton took a broom and swept off the snow at that point.\u201d The deponent was then asked, against the objection of the defendant, \u201cWhat did you notice relative to the spot from which the snow had been removed after the snow was removed?\u201d and was permitted to answer subject to the exception of the defendant, \u201cWhen the snow was swept off there was ice underneath it.\u201d The deponent, against the objection of the defendant, was then asked, \u201cDid you take any measurements with reference to the location of the spot pointed out by Miss Burke?\u201d and subject to the defendant\u2019s exception was permitted to answer, \u201cI did.\u201d It is plain no harm resulted to the defendant from this question and answer. The deponent was then asked, against the objection of the defendant, \u201c What measurements did you take?\u201d and was permitted to answer, subject to the exception of the defendant, \u201cThe measurement of the sidewalk was eight feet, the measurement from the house to the spot was two and one half feet and the measurement from the part of the conductor still there was about fifteen inches.\u201d The deponent further testified that he took photographs. After the deposition had been read and the questions and answers respectively admitted, Mr. Norton offered the photographs in evidence and they were admitted without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">It is the contention of the defendant that \u201cthe testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the plaintiff that on the day after \u25a0 the accident she pointed out, in the defendant\u2019s absence, the place where she fell was self-serving or \u2018manufactured\u2019 evidence, and was therefore incompetent.\u201d It is plain the evidence from the plaintiff in this regard was received, as the presiding judge instructed the jury, \u201csolely to identify the spot she fell on,\u201d and was admissible for the purpose of laying a foundation for the admission of the photographs which were afterwards admitted in evidence and to connect and make relevant the testimony of the witnesses as to the appearance and conditions of the sid\u00e9walk at the place where the plaintiff contended that she had fallen. So considered, her testimony and the testimony of her witnesses were rightly received. <em>Everson </em>v. <em>Casualty Co. of America, </em>208 Mass. 214, 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The deponent was then asked, against the objection of the defendant, \u201cHave you noticed the situation as to the conductor since then?\u201d and he answered, \u201cIt looks like a new conductor;\u201d and the defendant excepted. The question was a proper question and as such was not subject to exception. The answer was not responsive, and presumably would have been stricken out had the defendant so requested. In the absence of such a motion the exception is a general one and must be overruled, because the question in itself could not be harmful and the answer if harmful was waived. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Brier, </em>204 Mass. 195, 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The defendant admits in her brief that her remaining exceptions were made harmless by the charge of the presiding judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">It follows that the entry must be exceptions overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
