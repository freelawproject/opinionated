Fifteen letters and post cards received from the defendant by the complainant between January 7 and July 23, 1918, were admitted in evidence subject to exceptions by the defendant. Many of them were couched in terms of affection and one contained a definite proposal as to sexual relations.

The letters and postcards, fifteen in number, to which the defendant objects were written from Maine to the complainant between January 7, 1918, and July 23, 1918. Many of them were couched in terms of affection, and one contained a definite proposal as to sexual relations. Admittedly there was a quarrel in August of 1918, and for a time the defendant and the complainant were not friendly. However, there was evidence that they were again intimate and that the defendant kept company with the complainant in December, 1918, in which month, she testified, the defendant got her with child.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The letters were admissible to establish and characterize the intimacy between the parties, which fact was relevant to the issue.
