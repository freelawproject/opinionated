There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>was evidence that the defendant called the plaintiff \u201cMaria Bellingherie e buttana;\u201d that \u201cbuttana\u201d is a word in the Sicilian dialect meaning \u201cwhore\u201d in English; and that it was spoken in the presence of others who understood its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The evidence on behalf of the defendant was that she called the plaintiff a \u201cbanniana;\u201d meaning, in a Sicilian dialect, \u201ceither a she Town Crier or a she Hawker.\u201d Apparently this was the only defence relied upon. It was a question for the trial judge to decide what words were used by the defendant, and what meaning they naturally conveyed to the understanding of the persons in whose presence they were uttered. In finding for the plaintiff he necessarily decided this and all the other issues of fact in her favor. <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>112 Mass. 237. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Parish, 8 </em>Pick. 384. <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, 5 </em>Gray, 3.
