Proceedings under any section of this act may be begun in the municipal, district or police court having jurisdiction in the place where the defendant lives, and if there be no such court, then in any municipal, district or police court in the county; or in the municipal, district or police court having jurisdiction in the place where the mother of the illegitimate child lives; and if there be no such court, then in any municipal, district or police court in the county.

He filed a motion to quash on the ground that the alleged offence is not subject to indictment, and that proceedings under the statute can be prosecuted upon a complaint only in a municipal, district or police court having jurisdiction in the place where the defendant lives, and if there be no such court having jurisdiction, in the place where the mother of the illegitimate child lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The first sentence of \u00a7 1 provid\u00e9s that \"Whoever, not being th\u00e9 husband of a woman, gets her with child shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d R. L. c. 215, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201cA crime which is punishable by death or imprisonment in the State prison is a felony. All other crimes are misdemeanors.\u201d The act described in the statute is thereby made a criminal offence; proceedings of this nature previously were regarded as being civil rather than criminal proceedings. R. L. c. 82, \u00a7 22. <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>194 Mass. 291. The question is, does the statute limit proceedings thereunder exclusively to those begun in the municipal, district or police courts, or before trial justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">As the proceedings may be brought in the courts referred to in \u00a7 1, it is obvious that the jurisdiction of the Superior Court is not expressly excluded. Although the word \u201cmay\u201d in statutory construction is sometimes used as a synonym for \u201c shall\u201d or \u201cmust,\u201d still the ordinary signification of the word is that it is permissive and not mandatory. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>107 Mass. 194, 197. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>174 Mass. 245, 247. In the construction of statutes the rule seems to be that the word \u201cmay\u201d means \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d only in cases where the public interest is concerned, or where the public or third persons have a claim <em>de jure </em>that the power should be exercised. <em>Hampden Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Leary, </em>186 Mass. 577. <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>201 Mass. 204, 211, 212. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>People, </em>24 N. Y. 405, 409. <em>Medbury </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>46 N. Y. 200. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sweetsir, </em>53 Maine, 438. <em>Continental </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Folsom, </em>78 Ga. 449, 456. <em>Fresno National Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court of San Joaquin County, </em>83 Cal. 491. The interpretation to be placed upon the statute is to be determined from its apparent intention as gathered from the context as well as from the language of the particular provision. So interpreted we see no valid reason for holding that it should not be regarded as permissive in accordance with the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The defendant relies on the cases of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fahey, </em>5 Cush. 408, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>111 Mass. 407, in support of his contention. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fahey, </em>a complaint was made by a police officer to recover a penalty imposed by a by-law of the city of Boston for burying a dead body illegally. The defendant contended that under St. 1849, c. 211, \u00a7 7, the complaint should have been made by the city treasurer. The statute provided that \u201cAll fines and forfeitures . . . shall enure to the use of such town or city; and may be recovered by complaint, in the name of the treasurer ...\u201d It was held that such fines and forfeitures were recoverable by complaint in the name of the treasurer only. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>a complaint was made by a constable of the city of Boston against the defendant for a violation of Gen. Sts. c. 26, \u00a7 47, relating to the public health. It was provided by Gen. Sts. c. 19, \u00a7 15, as amended by St. 1870, c. 227, that \u201cThe city marshal or other police officer, or the city treasurer, may prosecute for all fines and forfeitures which may inure to the city.\u201d The court held on the authority of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fahey, supra, </em>that as a constable was not a police officer the complaint must be dismissed. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>107 Mass. 194, the defendant was indicted under St. 1868, c. 263, \u00a7 1, for selling adulterated milk knowing it to be adulterated; the penalty for the first offence was $100, and by \u00a7 2 \u201cmay be recovered on complaint before any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d The defendant contended that the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d was technical and that the language of the statute did not authorize an indictment. It was held that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to proceed by indictment. In other cases it has been held that where by statute it is made the duty of a certain officer to make a complaint, the statute is merely directory and does not exclude any other competent person from making a complaint for violation of the law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cay, </em>153 Mass. 211. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>McDonnell, </em>157 Mass. 407. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rawson, </em>183 Mass. 491, the defendant was indicted for violation of a by-law of a town adopted under R. L. c. 25, \u00a7 23. Section 73 of the same chapter recites that \u201cunless otherwise provided, he shall prosecute for all fines and forfeitures inuring to the town.\u201d It was held that under the decision of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fahey, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>the indictment could not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The cases above referred to were decided under statutes different from that under consideration. We are of opinion that the statute in question is distinguishable from those therein construed, each of which related to the recovery of fines and forfeitures or penalties to the use of a city or town for violation of a statute, ordinance or by-law, and where the person authorized to make the complaint was specifically designated. As the statute under which the defendant was indicted is of general application, and as the Superior Court which has original jurisdiction of all crimes, and appellate jurisdiction of crimes that are tried and determined before the police, district or municipal courts or before trial justices (R. L. c. 157, \u00a7 7), is not expressly excluded, and as the language of the statute is permissive and not exclusive, we are of opinion that it was not intended by the framers of the statute to limit proceedings to the courts therein named to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, but that it was intended for the convenience of parties in cases within the statute to enlarge the territorial . jurisdiction of those courts by giving them authority to institute prosecutions in the place where the mother of the child lives, regardless of the place where the act was committed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haynes, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gay, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonnell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">It follows that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to proceed by indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
