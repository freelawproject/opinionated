The evidence offered by the defendant tended to show that due warning had been given to the plaintiff, and that she \u201cstood still for a moment in the middle of the street and then started at a rapid walk or run to cross the street in front\u201d of the car. The defendant asked for a ruling, \"If the jury find that the plaintiff saw the defendant\u2019s car coming, heard his horn, and stood still in the middle of the street for an instant, long enough to see the approaching car, and then started to rim across the street in front of the defendant\u2019s car, then the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care and the jury must find for the defendant.\u201d The ruling was refused and the defendant excepted. The charge was full and comprehensive. <em>Held, </em>that the ruling properly was refused, both because it disregarded the effect of fright upon the plaintiff and the necessity of instant action in imminent peril; and also because it singled out and emphasized a part only of the controverted evidence and asked for a ruling as to its effect.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">Tort for personal injuries received when the plaintiff, while crossing North Main Street in Brockton, was run into by a motor car alleged to have been driven negligently by the defendant.

The accident happened in the forenoon and there was evidence that it was then raining. The street at or near the place of the accident was free from other vehicles. The plaintiff testified that she saw the automobile just before she stepped from the sidewalk, when it was about two hundred and eighty feet north of the place where it hit her and that she did not see it again until it was \u201cright on her.\u201d When she was about halfway across the street, she was hit by the automobile, which was going so fast that it seemed as if it were \u201cflying,\u201d and that all she had a chance to do was to \u201cput . . . [her] hand out.\u201d The conflicting evidence as to speed varied from eight to thirty miles an hour. There was also evidence that, as the automobile approached the plaintiff, it accelerated its speed so that it was going \u201cquite a little bit faster\u201d than it had been.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On the defendant\u2019s evidence, the jury would have been justified in finding that the defendant gave due warning of his approach and that the plaintiff \u201cstood still for a moment in the middle of the street\u201d at the time her attention was called to the automobile and that she \u201cthen started at a rapid walk or run to cross the street in front\u201d of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The case was submitted to the jury, who found for the plaintiff, without objection or exception except to the refusal of the judge to instruct the jury as follows: \u201cIf the jury find that the plaintiff saw the defendant\u2019s car coming, heard his horn, and stood still in the middle of the street for an instant, long enough to see the approaching car, and then started to run across the street in front of the defendant\u2019s car, then the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care and the jury must find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The exception must be overruled. The request disregarded the effect of fright or the \u201cnecessity of instant action in imminent peril\u201d and therefore could not be given. <em>Bothwell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>215 Mass. 467, 469. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Haverhill &amp; Amesbury Street Railway, </em>193 Mass. 428. <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>224 Mass. 420. Moreover, no exceptions were taken to the full and comprehensive instructions actually given relative to the subject matter of this request, which could not properly have been given because it singled out and emphasized a part of the controverted evidence and asked for a ruling as to its effect. <em>Grier </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>v. <em>Guarino, </em>214 Mass. 411. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>228 Mass. 421. <em>Whitman </em>v.
