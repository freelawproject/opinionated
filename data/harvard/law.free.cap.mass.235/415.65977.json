The defendant\u2019s employees had been engaged for about two days before the accident in removing the fence. The nuts had been oiled, loosened and then turned back \"hand tight,\u201d so that they could easily be removed. When this had been done the fence was taken down by the workmen in sections, and as each section was freed it was carried away. The removal under this method proceeded until four o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the day of the accident when the workmen began to remove \u201call the nuts and bolts from the remaining sections\u201d and at five o\u2019clock when they ceased work, \u201cseveral sections of the fence\u201d were left \u201cwithout either nuts or bolts to keep them in place.\u201d The plaintiff, a boy seven years of age, testified, that while on the vacant lot he sat down about five feet distant from, and with his back toward the fence, when \u201cthe fence fell on him and injured his head.\u201d It was contended by the plaintiff that the section which fell had been left by the workmen in a dangerous condition, and that \u201cit fell without being interfered with.\u201d The defendant, on the other hand, contended, that the fence would not have fallen unless the boys who were with the plaintiff, or \u201csome one not authorized to do so removed the nuts and bolts after\u201d its \u201cemployees ceased work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\">We take up the exceptions in the order presented by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The question asked in cross-examination of one Marra, a former employee of the defendant, called as a witness by the plaintiff, \u201cYou left the fence that night so that it would stand all right unless somebody pulled it down, didn\u2019t you? \u201d and the answer, \u201cWell, if the wind blowed hard it might fall down,\u201d were permissible within the discretion of the presiding judge. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>183 Mass. 577. The defendant\u2019s foreman was properly allowed to testify that on the day of the accident there were \u201c some boys there most of the time,\u201d and that \u201cWe would drive them off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the premises,\u201d as well as to state that boys had been driven off the fence upon which they were climbing, and that the boys had been told \u201cto get off the premises.\u201d It also was relevant to ask \u201cWas the fact of boys being about there one of the reasons for doing away with the nuts and bolts as you have described;\u201d and to the \"answer, \u201cWe put the nuts and the bolts on the top rail for safety\u2019s sake,\u201d no exception was saved. The defendant was entitled to show that the fall of the fence happened not through its negligence but because of the acts of others who unlawfully climbed on, or loosened, or interfered with the fence causing the section in question to topple over. <em>Barber </em>v. <em>C. W. H. Moulton Ladder Co. </em>231 Mass. 507. <em>Donahoe </em>v. <em>New York &amp; New England Railroad, </em>159 Mass. 125. The question, \u201cWere the pickets run through holes drilled in the iron\u201d was merely descriptive of the construction of the fence, and for that purpose it was admissible, no objection to the form of the question having been specifically taken. <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>206 Mass. 547. The cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s witness Chick to elicit the reasons why he had discharged Marra was wholly within the discretion of the court, and the ruling excluding the question, \u201cWhy did you discharge this man Marra, who testified?\u201d presents no error of law. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Rooney, supra</em>. The question in direct examination to the police officer called by the defendant, and who had been familiar with the premises, and observed the conduct of the boys while the fence was being removed on the day in question, \u201cWhat had you observed as to whether boys were upon or about that fence?\u201d has become immaterial because the answer wasfinally excluded. The next question to this witness was, \u201cWhat had you observed the children doing about that fence?\u201d to which he answered, \u201cWell, they were running in through,\u201d and \u201cOn that very day I drove children off the little shed the General Electric had built when they were taking down the fence.\u201d The plaintiff excepted to the question and asked that the answer be stricken out, and excepted to the ruling of the court, that \u201cThe answer may stand.\u201d The next question also excepted to was, \u201cWere those sheds on the property?\u201d answer, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The evidence of the defendant\u2019s witness, one Rome, that on the day the fence was being taken down, \u201cI see many times dozens of times, three or more boys take hold of the fence, and shaking him up,\u201d to which exceptions also were saved, is of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>like character. We are of opinion that this line of inquiry, not being too remote, tended to support the contention that the fence fell because of children climbing on or playing with it, and that if left undisturbed by them the accident would not have happened. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Billings, 97 </em>Mass. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\">The plaintiff, on whom the burden rests, having failed to show that he has been aggrieved, the exceptions must be overruled. <em>Zamore </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>198 Mass. 594, 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
