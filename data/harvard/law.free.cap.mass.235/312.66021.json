The report contained sentence extracts from several letters between the parties bearing upon that subject and then the following statement: \u201cFrom the remainder of the above correspondence and the confirmation and such inferences of fact as may be drawn therefrom I find . . . ,\u201d which was followed by a finding that the lot shipments were to be \u201cin such amounts, not to exceed one hundred (100) barrels per week, as the plaintiff should direct.\u201d The plaintiff so directed shipments that, when the contract had eleven weeks only to run, there were more than fourteen hundred barrels uncalled for by the plaintiff. The defendant then cancelled the contract. It also appeared that the plaintiff failed to send a check for each lot ordered by him before shipment was made, which, the auditor found, was a requirement of the agreement. A judge of the Superior Court, who heard the case upon the auditor\u2019s report as the only evidence, found for the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b338-8\">(1) The judge was warranted in finding that the contract between the parties was not wholly embodied in the letter of confirmation of the plaintiff\u2019s order;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b338-9\">(2) The judge was warranted in finding that the plaintiff had broken the contract, that the breach went to its essence, that the cancellation by the defendant was warranted; and in finding for the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Contract for breach of an agreement of the defendant to sell and of the plaintiff to buy two thousand barrels of cocoa powder.

The material portion of the defendant\u2019s letter of April 17, 1917, referred to in the opinion, was as follows: \u201cConfirming conversations over the \u2019phone last night and this afternoon, we have booked you with two thousand (2000) barrels of Cocoa, as per contract enclose, to be drawn for during the year 1917 at 11| c. per lb.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">The auditor found, \u201cThe conversations referred to in this letter were not introduced in evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">The \u201cconfirmation\u201d referred to in the foregoing letter was signed by the defendant and contained the following, among other, provisions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-7\">\"Gentlemen:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-8\">\u201cWe take pleasure in confirming your order give Mr. Miner for the following goods:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-9\">Number of Containing Description Price</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-10\">Packages</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-11\">2,000 barrels Cocoa 11| c. per lb.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-12\">\u201cEntire amount to be drawn during year 1917.

It does provide, however, that a check should be sent for \u2018each lot\u2019 before shipment, and that the \u2018first shipment\u2019 should be made May 15, 1917. On July 23, 1917, the plaintiff wrote the defendant as follows: \u2018Up to the present time we are entitled to at least nine hundred barrels (900) according to our contract.\u2019 On July 27, 1917, the defendant wrote the plaintiff in reply to his letter of July 23,1917, that \u2018According to our un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>derstanding we were to begin delivery May 15, fifty (50) barrels per week.\u2019 On September 27, 1917, the defendant wrote the plaintiff as follows: \u2018There is remaining about thirteen weeks to fulfill your contract of fifty (50) barrels a week. Under no circumstances will we accept \u00e1n order for a larger quantity than one hundred (100) barrels a week.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">\u201cAs will be seen by the quotations from letters hereinafter referred to, the plaintiff, on several occasions, ordered one hundred barrels of cocoa but never more than that amount at any one' time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">Then followed, in the auditor\u2019s report, the findings quoted in the first paragraph of the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">Following other findings, described in the opinion, the auditor found and ruled as follows: \u201cI find that the plaintiff waived any failure on the part of the defendant to deliver cocoa according to\" the terms of the contract prior to October 16, 1917, other than as involved in the purchases that were made by the defendant of cocoa from other manufacturers for the plaintiff, and the plaintiff had taken no steps to terminate the contract prior to October 16, 1917, when cancelled by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-8\">\u201cI rule that the failure of the plaintiff to order cocoa .subsequent to August 15, 1917, and to take delivery and pay for the same in instalments between that date and October 16 was not a breach of his contract with the defendant in view of the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case, as hereinabove recited, and that the plaintiff was, therefore, entitled to have delivered to him, one hundred barrels per week for the remainder of the year 1917.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-9\">The auditor reported that, if \u201c the rulings above stated are correct, and if, as matter of law, it should be held that the failure of the plaintiff to take deliveries did not constitute a breach so material as to justify the defendant in refusing to proceed with the performance of the contract,\u201d he found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the sum of $5,954; and that if, \u201con the other hand, the ruling is not correct, and as a matter of law, it should be held that the failure of the plaintiff to take deliveries constituted a breach so material as to justify the defendant in refusing to proceed further with the performance of the contract, then, I find that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The action was heard in the Superior Court by <em>Jenney, </em>J., the auditor\u2019s report being the only evidence. The plaintiff asked the judge to make the following findings of fact: \u201cFrom the contract and correspondence set out in the auditor\u2019s report, and such inferences of fact as may be drawn therefrom, the court finds that the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was for the purchase and delivery of two thousand barrels of cocoa at eleven and one half cents per pound, the same to be drawn between May 15, 1917, and December, 1917, in such reasonable amounts as the plaintiff saw fit to order out.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-4\">The judge refused so to find, found for the defendant and reported the case to this court for determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-6\"><em>C.

See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Tremont Trust Co. </em>234 Mass. 502. He had before him the report of the auditor in this respect, which was as follows: \u201cFrom the remainder of the above correspondence and the confirmation and such inferences of fact as may be drawn therefrom I find that the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was for the purchase and delivery of two thousand (2000) barrels of cocoa at eleven and one-half cents (llj c.) per pound, to be shipped by the defendant at such times and in such amounts, not to exceed one hundred (100) barrels per week, as the plaintiff should direct. The plaintiff was not obliged to draw each and every week or at any particular time. On the other hand the defendant was not obliged to deliver in excess of one hundred (100) barrels per week. The whole two thousand (2000) barrels to be ordered shipped by the plaintiff during the year 1917, the first shipment to be made May 15, 1917. Payment for each shipment was to be made in advance and two per cent (2%) discount was to be allowed the plaintiff for cash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">There was some delay on the part of the defendant in shipping cocoa to the plaintiff during June and July, owing to its inability to obtain the additional presses which it ordered. The auditor has found, however, that the plaintiff \u201cwaived any failure on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>part of the defendant to deliver cocoa according to the terms of the contract prior to October 16, 1917.\u201d On September 4, 1917, the defendant wrote the plaintiff \u201cwe will ship you one hundred (100) barrels this week and from this on we will be able to ship you about one hundred (100) barrels a week.\u201d As matter of fact the defendant did ship one hundred barrels on September 5. The plaintiff before the arrival of this shipment wrote \u201cas we had to go into the market last week and buy cocoa we would like to have you defer shipment as we are cramped for room.\u201d This statement was untrue; the plaintiff had not made such purchase. The last order actually sent by him was on August 15. On September 18 he wrote the defendant not to ship any more cocoa \u201cuntil we advise you, as we are very cramped for room. We will let you know exactly when we need our next shipment.\u201d On September 27 the defendant wrote the plaintiff \u201cthis is to call your attention to your contract with us for cocoa powder. There is remaining about thirteen weeks to fulfil your contract. Under no circumstances will we accept an order for a larger quantity than one hundred (100) barrels a week, and we insist on this being placed with us now to complete your contract; otherwise we wish to cancel it.\u201d Finally on October 16 the defendant wrote the plaintiff \u201cthe discontinuance of orders for cocoa powder from you has necessitated our cancelling your contract for cocoa powder.\u201d To this letter the plaintiff did not reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The trial judge found for the defendant. That finding must stand if there was any substantial evidence to support it. The contract required the plaintiff to order the entire two thousand barrels between May 15 and December 31. When the contract was cancelled on October 16 there remained only about eleven weeks of the contract period. As only five hundred and fifteen barrels had then been ordered by the plaintiff, there remained fourteen hundred and eighty-five barrels; and the defendant was under no obligation to ship more than one hundred barrels per week. In addition to the failure of the plaintiff to send orders in compliance with his contract, there was a further neglect on his part to comply with the agreement, in his omission to forward a check for each lot before shipment was made. In the absence of any evidence to justify such conduct on the part of the plaintiff, we cannot say that the judge was not warranted in finding that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>broken the contract on his part, that his breach went to the essence of the contract, and that it justified the defendant in cancelling the rest of the order. <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Wye, </em>230 Mass. 350. Accordingly judgment must be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
