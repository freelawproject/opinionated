Writ dated May 25&gt; 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-10\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Fessenden, </em>J. The plaintiff introduced evidence that at about 8:30 p.m. on January 23, 1917, while walking on the sidewalk in front of the defendant\u2019s land she slipped on the ice and fell, breaking her arm, and that the entire surface of the sidewalk at the time was a glare of ice about three inches thick, without sand, ashes or other material to prevent slipping. The defendant admitted that, since February 27, 1916, when she became owner of the land, she had never removed nor caused to be removed any snow or ice from the sidewalk, nor placed nor spread any ashes, sand, sawdust or other material to cover any ice or snow on the sidewalk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-11\">There was evidence that there was no structure other than a billboard on the defendant\u2019s land. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the defendant asked the judge to rule that on all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. The judge so ruled and ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-12\"><em>A. J.

There was no evidence of artificial collection of water by spout or otherwise. The record utterly fails to disclose any ground of liability. This is equally so, even if it be assumed that the defendant violated some ordinance in failing to remove the ice or to render walking over it safe by scattering ashes, sand or other material. The case is covered by the authority of numerous decisions. <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Boylston Market Association, </em>14 Gray, 249, 252. <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>McKeagney, 229 </em>Mass. 300, and cases collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
