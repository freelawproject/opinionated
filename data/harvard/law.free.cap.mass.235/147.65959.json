Writ in the First District Court of Eastern Middlesex dated October 24, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\">On appeal to the Superior Court, the action was tried before <em>Aiken, </em>C. J. The plaintiff testified in substance that he made the professional visits at the defendant\u2019s house described in the account annexed to his declaration; that he was unable to distinguish what visits were for the purpose of treating the defendant\u2019s wife, their child, or the defendant himself; that he had been called by the defendant\u2019s wife on many occasions; that on some of the occasions the defendant himself personally had called him to attend to the defendant\u2019s wife, and that in July, 1908, he had received a payment of $5 from the wife of the defendant on this account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-8\">The defendant testified in substance that he did not authorize his wife to contract a bill with the plaintiff; that he had instructed his wife never to run any bills; that he gave her on an average of $25 weekly to pay all expenses and that she would tell him from time to time when she needed money and he would give it to her, then, or later on, if he did not have it at the time of asking; that he had no recollection of ever calling the plaintiff to attend his wife or child, and that he had never been ill himself or consulted the plaintiff professionally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-9\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-10\">\u201c 1. That upon all the evidence in this case the plaintiff can not recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-11\">\u201c 2. That the husband is not liable for necessaries furnished to the wife unless they were either furnished with his knowledge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>consent that he be responsible for them, or unless .he neglects and refuses to furnish them himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\">\u201c3. If the husband furnishes the wife with sufficient means or money to provide her with what is reasonably necessary for her support and comfort then he is not liable for any debts she contracts for necessaries unless he gives his consent to such debts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">\u201c8. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that the defendant neglected or refused to provide his wife with the necessaries before the plaintiff can recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-7\">The rulings were refused. The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $62.03; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-8\"><em>C. H. Stebbins, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-9\"><em>E. E. Spear, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b175-10\">Jenney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYW\">In- this action, it already has been decided on evidence substantially as set forth in the bill of exceptions, that there was, or could be found to be, authority in the wife of the defendant to contract on his credit for the medical services under controversy. <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Mansfield, </em>229 Mass. 352. That decision is decisive of the exception to the refusal to give the defendant\u2019s first request, which is considered although Rule 45 of the Superior Court was not complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">The remaining requests were properly refused. The second omitted all reference to the authority of the wife arising from the marital relation, or inferable from the evidence, and therefore was erroneous. <em>Alley </em>v. <em>Winn, </em>134 Mass. 77. <em>Lamson </em>v. <em>Varnum, </em>171 Mass. 237. <em>Auringer </em>v. <em>Cochrane, </em>225 Mass. 273. The third was objectionable because it did not include any statement as to the effect of knowledge on the part of the husband, or as to the right of the wife to contract for the services. <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Mansfield, supra. </em>The remaining request as to the burden of proof was improper because it wholly ignored the question of the wife\u2019s authority, and required an instruction that the plaintiff could not recover except upon the neglect or refusal of the defendant to provide necessary medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
