He afterwards died from the injuries thus received. In an action by the administrator of his estate against the proprietors of the store for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>causing of Ms conscious suffering and death through negligence, it appeared that the dumb-waiter- was a box, the bottom of which was sixteen by twelve inches, that it was operated by means of a rope running over a pulley in the top of the well on the same floor with the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, the rope at one end being attached to the box and at the other end carrying a counterweight somewhat heavier than the box, that the well was enclosed, containing an opening into it on the floor where the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was, through which he had thrust Ms head to signal for the elevator upon learning that an electric signal bell was not working. The details of the operation of the dumb-waiter were obvious to the casual glance. There was evidence that the dumb-waiter travelled the distance of twenty-six feet from the basement to the place where it struck the plaintiff\u2019s intestate in six and one half seconds. The elevator was not defective. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant was under no duty to warn or instruct the plaintiff\u2019s intestate as to the obvious dangers attending the use of the dumbwaiter and that the evidence did not warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the def'udant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b164-5\">The provisions of It.

A dumb-waiter was used for carrying small parcels from the second floor of the building to the shipping department in the basement. It is described as a box, the bottom of which was sixteen by twelve inches. It was operated by means of a rope, which ran over a pulley in the top of the well, the rope at one end being attached to the box, and at the other end carrying a counterweight somewhat heavier than the box or \u201c car.\u201d It moved in an enclosed chute or. well, which extended to the ceiling of the second floor. There was an opening in the chute about three feet above the floor of the room; and the box was open on that side, where parcels were put in. The dumbwaiter rope was in plain view; and one standing near the opening could see downward into the well a distance of ten or twelve feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The intestate was almost eighteen years o\u00ed age. He had left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>school when twelve years old, and was somewhat dull and slow. From September, 1910, to June, 1911, he had been at a home for consumptives. About September 8, he went to work for the defendants, and during the last week was employed on the second floor. There was no evidence as to what work he did there. The only account of the accident comes from alleged statements made by him to his father and mother. This was, in substance, that he had a parcel to put on the \u201ccar;\u201d that it was not at the opening; that the electric signal push button did not work; that he put his head into the well, to call for the dumb-waiter (or to pull the rope), and the car, which was coming up, struck bim on the forehead and caused bim to fall backward.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">There was no evidence of any defect in the condition of the dumb-waiter or of the rope or pulley connected therewith. There was no hidden danger in the construction of this commonly used appliance, and the details of its operation were obvious to the casual glance. The only element of alleged danger was the speed with which the car moved, \u2014 the plaintiff\u2019s expert testifying that in its course of twenty-six feet from the basement to the second floor it took only six and one half seconds. As to the other causes of action set forth in the thirteen counts, it is enough to say that they are without support in the evidence; and manifestly the provisions of R. L. c. 104, \u00a7 27, are not applicable. Even assuming that the defendants might owe a duty to an inexperienced employee to warn bim of this speed if he had occasion to put his hand within the well, they certainly did not owe the eighteen year-old intestate a legal duty to warn or instruct him not to put his head into the line of passage of the dumb-waiter when it was moving or might be expected to move toward him. Nor were they under any obligation to him to change the construction of this simple mechanism for carrying parcels. The record fails to disclose negligence on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">It is unnecessary to consider whether there was any evidence for the jury of the intestate\u2019s due care. <em>Ramsdell </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>168 Mass. 505. <em>Hydren </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>219 Mass. 542, 546, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In accordance with the report, judgment must be entered on the verdict for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
