Upon a petition by the insurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>under St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 12, as amended by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 11, for a review a year after the first award, the Industrial Accident Board adopted findings, made by a single member of the board upon evidence warranting them, that compensation as for total incapacity should cease, that the employee, notwithstanding his injury, had an earning capacity in the labor market of $3, \u201cdid he not have the laudable desire of continuing at school,\u201d and that he should receive compensation of S2.67 a week, which was on the basis that his earning capacity was reduced from $7 to $4 a week.

Barry, who, when in the employ of the Cape Arm Granite Company as a water boy and a tool carrier in its granite quarry and fourteen years of age, had suffered injuries which crushed his left hand, for which, under the award being reviewed, he had received $4.67 per week as compensation for total incapacity from September 10, 1917, to April 18, 1919, should receive thereafter $2.67 per week as compensation for partial incapacity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b435-6\">Material findings of the single member of the board, which were adopted by the board, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b435-7\">\"Upon the evidence in this case I find that this employee is not totally incapacitated for work and that compensation for total incapacity should cease as of this date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b435-8\">\u201cAs to what earning capacity the boy has in the general labor market, this must necessarily be estimated from the appearance of the boy and from one\u2019s knowledge of conditions of employment. I find that he is incapacitated for the work which he was doing at the time of his injury, which was that of a tool boy. I believe, however, and find that in the general labor market he has an earning capacity of $3 a week, which he could avail himself of did he not have the laudable desire of continuing at school.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b435-9\">\"I find, therefore, that the employee is entitled to compensation at the rate of $2.67 per week, two thirds of the difference between his former wages of $7 and the amount which I find he is now able to earn.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-10\">The appeal was heard in the Superior Court by <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and the decision of the Industrial Accident Board was affirmed. The employee appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-3\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-4\"><em>W.

It is contended by the employee that under St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 10, as amended by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 5, the board erred in deciding that he was not totally incapacitated for work, and that compensation for total incapacity should cease April 18, 1919, and that the evidence is insufficient to support the finding of the board member or of the full board that he was not totally incapacitated on April 18, 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">It is undisputed by the insurer that the employee, a boy fourteen years of age, received an injury to his left hand in the course of, and arising out of, his employment. The extent and nature of the injury is fully described in the record, and compensation was properly awarded from September 10,1917, the eleventh day after the injury, to the date of the first hearing, April 23,1918, to continue during the period of total incapacity. <em>Gagnon\u2019s Case, 228 </em>Mass. 334. <em>Septimo\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 430. But the evidence at the second hearing, held on April 18, 1919, plainly warranted a finding that the hand had not been .rendered permanently incap\u00e1ble of use. It still was a hand the use of which had not been entirely lost. The extent and permanency of the employee\u2019s disability was a question of fact, and, the finding being conclusive, the ruling that compensation for total incapacity should cease as of the date of the second hearing was correct. <em>Amadio\u2019s Case, </em>233 Mass. 104. <em>Pass\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 515. It further appears and the evidence supports the conclusion of the board member, that the employee, notwithstanding the injury, had an earning capacity in the labor market of a weekly wage of $3, \u201cdid he not have the laudable desire of continuing at school.\u201d It follows that his .earning capacity, although partially impaired, did not amount to a total loss of wage earning power, and he was properly awarded compensation at the rate of $2.67 a week, being two thirds of the difference between his former weekly'wages of $7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>and $3, the amount he was able to earn at the date of the second hearing. <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 141. <em>Duprey\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 189. <em>Lacione\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The board reserved the right under St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 22, of awarding a lump sum after further consideration, but this reservation forms no part of the decree under which the case is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">We find no error of law in the record and the decree must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
