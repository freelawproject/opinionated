The employer refused to consider the contract and the officers of the union thereupon called a strike in the employer\u2019s shop, established picketing and caused letters to be sent to the employer\u2019s customers \u25a0 and employees urging a boycott of the employer. In a suit in equity brought by the employer against the officers and members of the labor union, it appeared that the picketing was conducted in a coercive manner with threats and scurrilous language for the purpose of rendering the employment of the employees uncomfortable or unbearable and of causing them to leave their employment, and that the purpose of the strike and boycotting letters was to compel the employer to accept the union agreement. <em>Held, </em>that</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b295-9\">(1) The purpose of the strike was unlawful;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b295-10\">(2) The officers and members of the union were not protected by St. 1913, c. 690, which was applicable only to a lawful strike lawfully conducted;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b295-11\">(3) The employer was entitled to injunctive relief.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-12\">Two bills in equity, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court on June 23, 1919, to enjoin the officers and members of the Photo Engravers\u2019 Union of Boston from prosecuting or encouraging a strike in the plaintiffs\u2019 establishments, interfering with employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ment contracts of the plaintiffs or otherwise endeavoring to compel the plaintiffs to enter into a contract with the union.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">Without the filing of answers by the defendants, the suits were referred to a master \u201cto hear the parties and their evidence upon the question of the issuing of a preliminary injunction as prayed for, to find the facts, and report thereon to the court.\u201d The master filed a first report and, after its recommittal to him, a supplemental report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">Material parts of the contract which the union desired the plaintiffs to agree to were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">\u201cIn order to secure careful and competent fellow servants and to diminish so far as possible the risks and dangers incident to those engaged in the art of photo engraving, the employing photo engravers of Boston agree that in their employment of journeymen and apprentices they will give preference to the members of the Boston Photo Engravers\u2019 Union, No. 3,1.P.E.U., by notifying the Union officials when additional journeymen or apprentices are needed.

When the strike was inaugurated a large part of the force in each of the shops quit work and went on strike. Some of the employees who quit work were members of the Photo-Engravers\u2019 Union and some were not. Some were members of other labor organizations and a few were not members of any organization.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-10\">\u201cAfter the inauguration of .the strike, the plaintiffs secured men and women to work in their shops to fill, so far as possible, the places of the employees who had gone on a strike. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-11\">\u201cEvery business day since the strike was inaugurated groups of men numbering from two or three to more than a dozen have congregated about or near the entrances of the places of business of the plaintiffs at the hours of opening and closing and during the noon hour and have sought to talk with employees as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>came to or left the places of business. These men were not all of them identified by the evidence as being members of the union, but it was made to appear from the evidence that the larger part of them were members of the union and were acting under instructions by the strike committee of the union. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\">\u201cWithout attempting to go into all the specific instances I find that it is almost of daily occurrence that men who were employed in the shops of the plaintiffs have been approached by the pickets and asked to leave their work and join the strikers; that in all instances when employees were approached for the first time they were addressed in a respectful manner by the pickets, who sought to argue with them and to convince them of the justness of the cause of the strikers; that in some instances these methods were successful, but that in other instances the employees declined to talk with the pickets and requested that the pickets refrain from attempting to talk with them, but the pickets insisted that they should talk with them and have assembled about the employees in groups of sufficient numbers to make progress of the employee upon the streets difficult and unpleasant, and have talked in loud tones and have used language to the employee which was disagreeable and even abusive; that in some instances when an employee had plainly told the pickets that he did not care to talk with them, groups of the pickets numbering from two to five or six have followed the employee along the streets for a long distance, and into restaurants and street cars, and to their homes; that in some instances the persons who were following an employee have talked in loud tones and used language which attracted public attention to the employee and embarrassed him; that in some instances persons who were in the groups have called employees \u2018strike-breakers,\u2019 \u2018scabs,\u2019 \u2018dirty rats,\u2019 \u2018son of a b\u2014,\u2019 and other vulgar names, accompanied by profanity; that in one instance two of the employees of the Folsom Company were followed by two men for a long distance upon the public streets, during which time the men who were following repeatedly called them objectionable names and, while one of the employees was talking with a lady acquaintance whom he met, one of the men who were following approached and said in a tone which could be heard by the lady, \u2018My girl would n\u2019t talk with a strike breaker,\u2019 and that upon leaving the lady and walking a little further upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the street one of the men who were following struck one of the employees, but the man who made the assault was not known to the employee and it was not made to appear whether he was one of the defendants, though it was made to appear that the other man who was with him was one of the defendants; that in' one instance an employee of the Folsom Company who was also a professional dancer who secured engagements at public dance halls was repeatedly interviewed by the pickets and was told by one of the members of the union that, if he did not leave the employ of the Folsom Company, the defendants would see the proprietor of a dance hall at Revere Beach, where the dancer had been employed on one occasion and had promises of other engagements, and tell him not to again employ the dancer, and that since that time he has not been able to secure any engagements to dance at that hall; that in two or more instances employees have been told by men in the groups of pickets that unless they left their employment they would have \u2018their heads kicked in;\u2019 that one of the employees who had\" testified in the hearings was met by four pickets as he left the shop the night after he had testified and one of the pickets called him a \u2018G\u2014 d\u2014 son of a b\u2014and one of the pickets said \u2018G\u2014 d\u2014 you.

It was further provided that the ratio of apprentices to journeymen should be immutably fixed and that all disputes not covered by the agreement should be submitted to an arbitration committee of two from each party, but, if they failed to agree, a fifth member was to be chosen by the committee. And \u201cNo contracts, individual or otherwise, conflicting with this agreement be entered into, and all contracts of employment must be submitted and executed in accordance with the\u201d by-laws and constitution of the international photo-engravers union with which the local union was affiliated. The agreement having been presented to the plaintiffs who are engaged in the business of \u201cphoto-engraving\u201d and whose workmen included a large number of union men, was not accepted. The union because of non-acceptance voted to strike, and the employees who were members of the union ceased to work, forcing the plaintiffs to secure in so far as possible men and women to succeed them, some of whom entered into written contracts of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The question for decision is not, whether an individual employee who has contracted to perform labor can abandon his contract, leaving his employer to whatever remedy in damages he may have. It is, whether by concerted action, using the strike as a mass weapon, the defendants could lawfully compel the plaintiffs to yield to their demands. The proposed agreement was presented as an entire contract to be unconditionally accepted. If the plaintiffs declined to enter into the agreement, the underlying purpose manifestly was to enforce acquiescence through the coercive power of a strike, which, even where there is both a legal and illegal purpose, is of itself illegal. <em>Baush Machine Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>231 Mass. 30, 36. The provision that the employer must retain and pay more employees than were actually or reasonably required for carrying on his business, and that disputes not covered by the agreement must be submitted to arbitration, even if proper subjects for negotiation where the parties are willing to negotiate, were, until accepted, mere proposals, the refusal of which was wholly insufficient to justify the measures adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>by the defendants. The plaintiffs could not be compelled to make an involuntary contract, or to substitute compulsory arbitration for due process of law. <em>Haverhill Strand Theatre, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gillen, </em>229 Mass. 413. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>198 Mass. 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">But these provisions, while material and important, comprise a part only of a general plan to compel the plaintiffs, who were employing non-union as well as union labor, \u201cto unionize\u201d their shops.' The record states that, prior to the vote to strike which followed the1 decimation of the agreement, no disagreement or controversy had arisen between the plaintiffs and their workmen. It is true the agreement reads, that the plaintiffs in the employment of journeymen and apprentices will give preference to union men by notifying the union officials when additional journeymen and apprentices are needed, and if the union cannot furnish and supply competent help, the employer may secure such help from other sources; and no express requirement is found for the discharge of non-union men already under employment. No prolonged discussion however is needed to make plain that this was merely an indirect method which must culminate in a closed shop. The position of non-union employees under the practical working of the agreement would gradually become so unbearable and intolerable that, as they retired and were gradually eliminated by the process of selection, the plaintiffs necessarily must resort solely to union workmen to recruit their industrial force. It is unnecessary to consider what the status of the parties would have been if the agreement had been mutually accepted and executed. See <em>Minasian </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>210 Mass. 250; <em>Hoban </em>v. <em>Dempsey, </em>217 Mass. 166; <em>Shinsky </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>232 Mass. 99; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>232 Mass. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The right of the plaintiffs at all times to hire in the labor market, and to retain in their employment, such workmen as they might choose, unhampered by the interference of the union acting as a body through the instrumentality of a strike, or of a boycott, or of a black list, is a primary right which has never been abrogated but remains unimpaired by our decisions. <em>W. A. Snow Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>227 Mass. 382, 389. <em>Folsom </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>208 Mass. 336. The distinction between the cases at bar and <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>192 Mass. 572, and kindred decisions, where the strike was inaugurated for the sole purpose of getting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>all the work on a particular job for members of the union who-already had obtained a part of it, and a strike for the purpose of doing away with non-union labor altogether, and, by gaining a. general monopoly of the labor market, to force employers to deal only with union men, is plain. The master reports that in furtherance of their efforts to bring the plaintiffs to terms, picketing,, as well as intimidation of employees who continued to work for the plaintiffs by' the use of scurrilous language and abusive epithets, and individual boycotting have been resorted to in various forms more or less offensive and oppressive. It is also found that strenuous attempts have been made to induce workmen, employed by the plaintiffs to take the places of the strikers, to break their contracts of employment, and to depart from the city, and to remain in other localities. But, not satisfied with these methods insistently practised, the report further states, that the defendants in various printed or written communications characterized and held up the plaintiffs as being unfair to and prejudiced against union labor, and have endeavored by a circular letter to persuade their customers to boycott the \"plaintiffs and to cease business dealings with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\">The St. of 1913, c. 690, an act to define the extent to which peaceful persuasion is permitted, is invoked as a shield for what has been done. But the statute is applicable only to a lawful strike lawfully conducted. It is unavailing as a defence on the present record. The prayer for the assessment of damages has been waived, and, the defendants having deliberately, intentionally and unlawfully entered upon a course of procedure materially interfering with the right of the plaintiffs unmolested to carry on business in their own way, the plaintiffs are respectively entitled to a decree with costs awarding injunctive relief, the terms to be settled by a single justice. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>188 Mass. 353. <em>Cornellier </em>v. <em>Haverhill Shoe Manuf.
