The view along the track was obstructed until the motor car was within twenty-seven feet from the track, when the driver saw a railroad train approaching, which was about one hundred and twenty feet away. The guest jumped and was injured. The driver of the motor car proceeded at an increased speed and passed the crossing in safety. In an action by the guest to recover for his injuries against the director general of railroads, who was operating the railroad company, the jury found specially that the signals required by St. 1906, c. 463, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 147, 148, were not given, and it was <em>held, </em>that there was evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>warranting a finding that omission to give the signals was negligence of the defendant which contributed to the injury to the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b537-3\">At the trial of the action above described, there was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff\u2019s host was reckless in driving the motor car in front of the train as he did.

The defendant asked for and the judge refused to make rulings in substance that, if the jury found that the driver of the motor car was reckless, such negligence should be imputed to the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the rulings properly were refused, because it could not be said as a matter of law that the plaintiff entrusted himself wholly to the care of his host.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b537-4\">A guest in a motor car which is approaching a grade crossing of a railroad with a highway properly may rely on his host to drive the vehicle while he himself uses his senses to ascertain whether a train is approaching; and if, when a train, whose approach has not before been ascertained because the view of the crossing was obstructed and because the signals of its approach required by statute were not given, suddenly is seen one hundred and twenty feet away, the host carelessly drives forward at an increased speed and avoids a collision, but the guest, fearing a collision, jumps from the motor car and is injured, it cannot be ruled as a matter of law, in an action against the operator of the railroad to recover for such injuries, either that negligence of the host should be imputed to the guest, or that the guest was guilty of contributory negligence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b537-5\">It not being denied, in the action above described, that the plaintiff was. a guest of the driver of the motor car, a request for a ruling that he and the driver were engaged in a joint enterprise and therefore that he was bound by the driver\u2019s neglect, properly was refused.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\">Tort for personal injuries caused when the plaintiff jumped from a motor car, in which he was riding as a guest of one Frank L, McKean, who was driving, when it approached a grade crossing of a highway with the railroad operated by the defendant, upon which a train was alleged to have been approaching without sound of whistle or bell.

McKean, at a double track grade crossing in the town of Dunstable. There was evidence that about five hundred feet from the crossing the automobile was stopped and as it started McKean told the plaintiff and two companions who were with him that they were approaching the crossing and to \u201c listen for a bell or whistle.\u201d The road was down grade to a point about fifteen feet from the crossing, then up grade to the crossing. From a distance of two hundred feet to within about eight feet of the nearest rail, or twenty-seven feet from the farthest rail, as stated by the witnesses, there were bushes which obscured the view of an approaching train. When the automobile going at the rate of fifteen miles an hour was within twenty-seven feet of the farthest track, upon which the train was approaching, both McKean and the plaintiff saw the train,\u2014then about one hundred and twenty feet away. McKean started the automobile forward and the plaintiff jumped to the ground, striking his foot against the planking. The automobile safely passed the crossing. The plaintiff testified that he was looking and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>listening for a bell or whistle and heard none, and neither saw nor heard anything indicating the approach of a train until he was within twenty-seven feet of the track. The jury found that the statutory signals were not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\">1. The defendant contends that the omission to give the statutory signals was not a contributing cause to the plaintiff\u2019s injury. If the jury believed the testimony of the plaintiff that the view of the train was concealed by the bushes and while listening he heard no signal by bell or whistle, they could find that by reason of the defendant\u2019s neglect he was placed in a position of great danger but a short distance from a rapidly moving train, and that this neglect contributed to his injury. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>145 Mass. 386, 387. <em>Kelsall </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>196 Mass. 554, 555. <em>Engleman </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>210 Mass. 179, 181. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Hustis, </em>234 Mass. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">2. There was evidence from which the jury could find that the plaintiff did not surrender all care for himself to the caution of the driver McKean. He testified that he was looking and listening and relied on himself to learn of the approach of the train; and if it could be said that McKean was reckless and lacking in due care in not bringing the automobile to a stop at once on seeing the train, instead of driving forward at an increased speed and barely escaping a collision, his lack of care is not to be imputed to' the plaintiff so as to charge him with McKean\u2019s neglect. Even if( McKean had a reasonable opportunity when he first saw the train to stop the automobile before reaching the crossing, the plaintiff might still be found to have been careful if he trusted to himself for his safety. The jury were told if the plaintiff surrendered his care and safety to McKean and McKean was careless, the plaintiff could not recover. There was no error, therefore, in refusing the defendant\u2019s requests based on the assumption that the plaintiff voluntarily surrendered all care of his person to McKean.</p>\n<p id=\"AQj\">The plaintiff could properly rely on McKean to drive the automobile while he himself used his own senses to ascertain the approach of the train. There was no error in the refusal to give the defendant\u2019s request bearing on this part of the case. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Hustis, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">3. The defendant asked that a verdict be directed in his favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>because the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care. It was plainly a question for the jury whether the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in remaining in the automobile until he saw the train was that of a prudent man. They might say that up to this time he did all that could be expected of a person of ordinary care and caution. If, as soon as the plaintiff saw the danger, without time for reflection, realizing that the train was within a few feet of him and that a collision was almost inevitable he jumped from the automobile, thinking it best for his safety, and if the jury found that such conduct was reasonable in view of all the circumstances, they could decide he was using proper care and it could not be ruled as matter \u25a0 of law that he was careless. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Hustis, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\">It was not denied that the plaintiff was a guest of McKean. He was not, therefore, engaged in a joint enterprise with the owner of the automobile, and was not bound by his neglect. <em>Peabody </em>v. <em>Haverhill, Georgetown &amp; Danvers Street Railway, </em>200 Mass. 277, 279. We find no error in the judge\u2019s charge taken as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
