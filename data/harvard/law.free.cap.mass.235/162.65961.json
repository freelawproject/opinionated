The agreement was made among the directors who, in so doing, intended to act as partners and not as directors and had in view their personal rights and obligations and not those of the corporation.

The defendants alleged exceptions which were sustained by a decision reported in 231 Mass. 513.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-9\">The action then was heard by <em>Morion, </em>J., without a jury. The agreement between the plaintiff and the defendants, referred to in the opinion, relating to the termination of his active connection with the M. &amp; C. Skirt Company, in substance provided (1) that the plaintiff was \u201cto terminate his employment\u201d on January 1, 1917, (2) that on terminating his employment the plaintiff was to be \u201ccredited with an amount equivalent to one month\u2019s salary, namely: Six hundred (600) dollars, which shall be applied on account of his indebtedness to said M. &amp; C. Skirt Company for unpaid stock subscription,\u201d (3) that the defendants would pay him $125 a week for the six months next after January 1, 1917, (4) that during the six months beginning on July 1, 1917, the defendants would advance to him $125 a week to be secured by plaintiff\u2019s stock in the corporation, (5) that during the year 1917 the defendants would not \u201cincrease their present salaries, and during said year, and thereafter\u201d would not \u201cdo any act or thing to benefit their stock holdings or derive any benefit therefrom at the expense of the holdings of\u201d the plaintiff, without first giving him \u201can opportunity to share in said benefits,\u201d and (6) the defendants should \u201chave the privilege in their discretion, if they so desire, to do, to cause said M. &amp; C.

The first two six months\u2019 notes so given were paid when due. The notes sued on were the third, fourth and fifth six months\u2019 notes. When the time came for the delivery of the sixth lot of two notes, there was a dispute as to the collateral to be given by the plaintiff. Thereupon the defendants refused to make further advances. They also refused to pay the three notes here in question and this action was brought..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">At the close of the evidence, the plaintiff asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-7\">\u201c1. On all the evidence the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict for the amount declared on.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-8\"><em>\u201c7. </em>Unless affected by other facts in the case, the words in the second paragraph of the agreement of December 19, 1916, to wit: \u2018upon said termination, said party of the second part shall be credited with an amount equivalent to one month\u2019s salary\u2019 shall be construed to mean that the defendants shall cause the plaintiff to be credited on the books of the company with said amount by giving full value therefor to the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-9\">\u201c8. In the paragraph numbered second of the agreement of December 19, 1916, the words, \u2018upon said termination, said party of the second part shall be credited with an amount equivalent to one month\u2019s salary\u2019 shall not, as a matter of law, unless affected by other facts in the case, be construed to mean that the company shall credit the plaintiff with that sum without receiving consideration therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-10\">\u201c13. If the plaintiff was employed by the company at a yearly salary or by the year, this was evidence that he was under contract with the company in its employ for at least one year from May 9,1916.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-11\">\u201c15. If the plaintiff in good faith believed he had an agreement to work for the company at least for a year from May 9, 1916, the defendants\u2019 promise that the plaintiff should be credited with $600 was a legal promise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u201c 16. If at the defendants\u2019 request the plaintiff gave up a right he had to continue in the company\u2019s employ, then the agreement whereby the plaintiff was to be credited with $600 was an honest and legal one.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\"><em>\u201c </em>18. If after May 9,1916, the plaintiff continued in the employ of the company under agreement with its directors to so continue at his will, then the agreement to terminate his employment upon receiving $600 out of the funds of the company was an honest and legal agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\">\u201c 19. If the plaintiff in good faith believed he had an agreement to work for the company as long as he pleased, his termination of his employment was sufficient consideration moving to the company which made legal the defendants\u2019 promise that he should be credited with $600.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">\u201c20. The plaintiff and the defendants, being all the directors of the company, could agree together without a formal meeting of the directors to pay the plaintiff $600 out of the company\u2019s funds upon the termination of the plaintiff\u2019s employment on January 1, 1917, if he had a right to continue the employment after that date, until May 9, 1917, or for a period to end at his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-8\">\u201c21. If there was a difference of opinion between the plaintiff and the defendants about his remaining in active connection with the corporation, the court, sitting as a jury, may find that the agreement to pay the plaintiff $600 was an honest agreement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-9\">\u201c26. If the stockholders other than the parties in suit and Harry Bergson paid for their stock by promissory notes and not in cash, their holdings of stock are illegal and the agreement of December 19, 1916, is legal without their consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-10\">\u201c27. The defendants must prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the notes are illegal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-11\">\u201c28. If the plaintiff had an open account with the company upon which he was credited by the company with $600, this did not constitute an application on account of his indebtedness for unpaid stock subscription.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-12\">\u201c32. The plaintiff was not legally indebted to the company for unpaid stock subscriptions on December 19, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-13\">\u201c33. If on December 19, 1916, the plaintiff was not legally indebted to the company for unpaid stock subscriptions, the agreement to cause the company to credit the plaintiff with $600 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>account of such alleged indebtedness was no fraud on the stockholders and was not illegal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">\u201c35. The directors of a corporation, acting in good faith, have the power to employ a person for a period equal to the existence of the corporation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">The judge filed a memorandum of findings and rulings, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\">It was held in this- case in 231 Mass. 513, \u201cthat the $600 named in article second [of the contract of December 19, 1916], was to be paid out of the funds of the corporation to the plaintiff, upon an agreement by the parties not made at a meeting of directors, and not submitted to the stockholders either in or outside of a meeting, and that such an agreement was illegal, if nothing was due to .the plaintiff from the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\">\u201cThe books of the corporation show, and I find, that on January 1, 1917, there was credited to the plaintiff from the corporation up to that date the amount of $656.92 on account of salary; that the amount was made up principally from a weekly credit of $25, which the plaintiff agreed should be retained by the corporation to be applied on account of a promissory note of $3,500 given by the plaintiff in payment of stock subscription, and that the plaintiff was indebted to the company upon that note to an amount in excess of $656.92.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-9\">\u201cIt was contended by the plaintiff that that note was illegal, because in violation of St. 1903, c. 437, \u00a7 14, and that, therefore, the plaintiff had a credit balance. I find and rule against the plaintiff upon this point. I find that the cornoration was not indebted to the plaintiff on January 1, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-10\">\u201cThe plaintiff contended further that he had a contractual right to continue in the corporation\u2019s employ after January 1, 1917, and that his relinquishment of such right legalized the payment to him and legalized the agreement to pay him $600 from the funds of the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-11\">\u201cI find the following facts: A contract was made between the parties on May 11, 1911, under which it was agreed that for five years the plaintiff should be 'factory manager\u2019 and 'president\u2019 of the corporation, and the corporation contracted with him to serve as factory manager with a certain salary therefor. He was also duly elected president. Upon the expiration of the five years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and until January 1, 1917, the parties continued to draw weekly salaries as theretofore. No further express agreement as to the terms of employment was entered into by the parties personally. There was no formal directors\u2019 or stockholders\u2019 meeting indicating a corporate agreement with the plaintiff that he should continue during 1917 in the employ of the corporation, and no evidence from which I could find that the defendants made such an agreement as directors outside of a meeting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">\u201cIn the fall of 1916 various differences as to the management arose between the plaintiff and the defendant Copelof, which resulted in the decision that one or the other must sever his connection with the- management. Negotiations extending over a considerable period resulted in the agreement of December 19, 1916. As a part of these negotiations, the plaintiff on December 12, 1916, was elected at his request president, but on the understanding that he should at once resign, the resignation to take effect on January 1, 1917, and in accordance with that understanding he did resign. He knew before he was elected that he would not serve as president. It is apparent from the evidence, that in these negotiations, as well as in their prior relations and agreements, the parties all considered that they were partners, entitled to an equal share in the profits and management of the business, and the evidence would warrant a finding that there was an implied agreement, at least, between them as partners in effect up to December 19, 1916. It is equally clear that they were intending to act as partners in the various negotiations and agreements, and not as directors, and had in view their personal rights and obligations and not those of the corporation. The original contract of 1911, the method -of paying for stock by notes, the contract of December 19, 1916, and the oral evidence as to the negotiations leading up to it, all indicate such intention. The parties all entered into the contract of December 19, 1916, in good faith, in the honest belief that they were conserving the interests of the company, and that the contract was legal; but the effect of the contract, as shown by the above findings, was to obligate the company to pay to the plaintiff from its funds an amount which the company did not owe him, at a time when it was not under contractual obligations to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">\u201cI, therefore, find for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Material portions of St. 1903, c. 437, \u00a7 14, were as follows: \" Capital stock may be issued for cash, property, tangible or intangible, services or expenses.

At the second trial in the Superior Court the judge, sitting without a jury, found for the defendants and filed a memorandum of findings. The case is now here on the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the denial of requests for rulings and to the exclusion of certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AvK\">The plaintiff and the defendants were the only directors, but not the only stockholders, in the M. &amp;. C. Skirt Company, a Massachusetts corporation. Differences as to the management arose between them, which resulted in the agreement of December 19, 1916, by which the plaintiff terminated his participation in the business. The second paragraph of the agreement provided: \u201cUpon said termination said party of the second part shall be credited with an amount equivalent to one month\u2019s salary, namely: Six hundred (600) dollars, which shall be applied on account of his indebtedness to said M. &amp; C. Skirt Company for unpaid stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>subscription.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s seventh and eighth requests in effect were, that by the true interpretation of this paragraph the $600 was to be paid by the defendants, and that they were to cause the plaintiff to be credited therewith on the books of the company. This same contention was urged at the previous argument; but the court decided otherwise. As was said in the opinion (231 Mass. 513, 517): \u201cThe provision made by the article is that the plaintiff \u2018shall be credited\u2019 with $600 not that he shall be paid $600. That means \u2018credited\u2019 by the corporation.\u201d The trial judge rightly adopted this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Construing the agreement as providing for payments from the treasury of the corporation, the plaintiff\u2019s requests numbered 13, 16, 18, 20 and 35 are based on the assumption that the plaintiff had a contract with the corporation to work for it to May 9,1917, or indefinitely at his will, and that the agreement to terminate his employment was ample consideration moving to the corporar tian for such payments by the company. The trial judge, however, has found \u201cThere was no formal directors\u2019 or stockholders\u2019 meeting indicating a corporate agreement with the plaintiff that he should continue during 1917 in the employ of the corporation, and no evidence from which I could find that the defendants made such an agreement as directors outside of a meeting.\u201d This and the other findings that \u201cthe corporation was not indebted to the plaintiff on January 1, 1917,\u201d and that the corporation \u201cwas not under contractual obligations\u201d to him, render these requests immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Requests numbered 15, 19 and 21 are, in effect, that if the plaintiff in good faith believed he had an agreement to work for the corporation, his termination of the employment at the request of the defendants was sufficient consideration to the company for crediting him with $600. See <em>Blount </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>199 Mass. 330, 336. But, as the judge found, \u201c. . . they were intending to act as partners in the various negotiations and agreements, and not as directors, and had in view their personal rights and obligations and not those of the corporation.\u201d Further, in order to bind the property of the corporation, it must appear that from its standpoint the parties acted honestly and in good faith; and in effect the finding of the trial court is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The requests numbered 28, 32 and 33 are based on the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>that the plaintiff\u2019s stock was illegally issued for his note (see St. 1903, c. 437, \u00a7 14); that any \u201ccredit\u201d on account thereof would not constitute payment, and could not be enforced against the corporation. As to this it suffices to say that it was illegal to give the $600 to the plaintiff regardless of the purpose for which it was to be applied. And as matter of fact the plaintiff from the beginning has acted on the assumption that the stock was legally issued to him. See <em>Soghomonian </em>v. <em>Garabedian, </em>231 Mass. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Request numbered '27 need not be discussed, in view of the evidence and findings. The offer to prove that all the other stockholders except the defendants and one Bergson, obtained their stock by issuing notes was rightly excluded, not being material in the present case. The request numbered 26 could not have been given even if the evidence were admitted. Presumably these other stockholders were acting as such in good faith. The legality of the agreement of December 19,1916, was not dependant on their consent. <em>Palmbaum </em>v. <em>Magulsky, </em>217 Mass. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Finally the first request was denied rightly. The effect of the agreement, in pursuance of which the notes in suit were issued, was to obligate the M. &amp; C. Skirt Company \u201cto pay to the plaintiff from its funds an amount which the company did not owe .him, at a time when it was not under contractual obligations to him.\u201d The $600 was to be applied on account of the plaintiff\u2019s indebtedness for unpaid stock subscriptions, in violation of St. 1903, c. 437, \u00a7 14. The further illegality of the sixth clause of the agreement need not be considered. <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Copelof, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
