L. <em>c. </em>202, \u00a7 14, the statute of limitations is a bar to an action upon a promissory note payable upon demand, brought more than six years after its date against one of two makers who has not acknowledged the debt nor promised in writing to pay it, although his joint maker has made payments upon the note within six years before the action was begun.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b275-12\">If no demand for the payment of a promissory note, payable upon demand, has been made during more than six years after its date upon one who merely signed his name upon its back before its delivery, and who therefore by R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 80, is deemed to be an indorser, an action thereafter begun against him upon the note is barred by the statute of limitations, R. L. c. 202, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, \u00a7 14, although the maker of the note has made payments upon it within six years of the bringing of the action.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-13\">Contract, by the payee named in two promissory notes against L. J. Sturtevant, who signed as maker, and R M. Sturtevant, who signed the instruments on the back before they were delivered, for a balance due upon the notes. Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated January 15, 1918.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-14\">The defendant L. J. Sturtevant was defaulted. The action was tried in the Municipal Court against R M. Sturtevant (hereinafter called the defendant). At the close of the evidence, the plaintiff asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>\u201c1. That, if the notes set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration were signed by both of the defendants before delivery to the plaintiff, and on the statement of the plaintiff that she would not advance the money merely on the note of the defendant L. J. Sturtevant, but must have notes from both of the defendants, then the defendants are co-makers of the notes, and the plaintiff is entitled to consider the defendant R. M. Sturtevant as the copromissor with the defendant L. J. Sturtevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That, if the defendant R.' M. Sturtevant is a co-maker with the defendant L. J. Sturtevant, then neither of the defendants is entitled to a demand and notice of non-payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">\u201c3. That, the notes set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration being payable on demand, the bringing of this action is a sufficient demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">\u201c4. That, if payments were made by the defendant L. J. Sturtevant on said notes within six years from the date of the bringing of this action, then this action is not barred by the statute of limitations against either of said defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">\u201c5. That, if payment were made on said notes by the defendant L. J. Sturtevant within six years from the date \u201cof the bringing of this action to the knowledge of the defendant R. M. Sturtevant, then this action is not barred by the statute against the said R. M. Sturtevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-9\">\u201c6. If within six years from the date of the bringing of this action the defendant R. M. Sturtevant acknowledged that said notes were still outstanding and enforceable, and promised that the same would be paid, then the action is not barred by the statute of limitations against the said R. M. Sturtevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-10\">\u201c7. That if the plaintiff would not have loaned the money and taken the notes without the signature of the defendant R. M. Sturtevant, then the same are supported by sufficient consideration as against said R. M. Sturtevant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-11\">The judge denied these requests and found as a fact that the defendant signed the^ notes in question on the back thereof, although before delivery; that he never paid any part of either ' the principal or the interest due on the notes; that no demand for the payment thereof ever was made on him, and that the notes were dated February 29, and October 2, 1899, and were not witnessed. He ruled that the defendant was not a co-maker but an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>indorser, and that, as to him, the action was barred by the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">At the request of the plaintiff, the judge reported the case to the Appellate Division, who dismissed the report. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">Material statutory provisions are the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-7\">R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 34, cl. 6. \u201cWhere a signature is so placed upon the instrument that it is not clear in what capacity the person making the same intended to sign he is to be deemed an indorser.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqs\">R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 80. \u201cA person placing his signature upon an instrument otherwise than as maker, drawer or acceptor is deemed to be an indorser, unless he clearly indicates by appropriate words his intention to be bound in some other capacity.\u201d \"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-8\">R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 106. \u201cExcept as herein otherwise provided, when a negotiable instrument has been dishonored by non-acceptance or non-payment, notice of dishonor must be given to the drawer and to each indorser, and any drawer or indorser to whom such notice is not given is discharged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-9\">R. L. c. 202, \u00a7 12. \u201cNo acknowledgment or promise shall be evidence of a new or continuing contract whereby to take an action of contract out of the operation of the provisions of this chapter or to deprive a party of the benefit thereof, unless such acknowledgment or promise has been made by, or is contained in, a writing signed by the party who is chargeable thereby.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-10\">R. L. c. 202, \u00a7 14. \u201cA joint contractor or his executor or administrator shall not lose the benefit of the provisions of this chapter so as to be chargeable by reason only of an acknowledgment or promise made or signed, or by reason of a payment made by, any other joint contractor or his executor or administrator.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AnT\"><em>H. G. Fletcher, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-11\"><em>W. F. Prime, </em>for the defendant R. M. Sturtevant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b277-12\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-f\">The two promissory notes in suit, payable on demand, are signed on the face by the defendant L. J. Sturtevant, and on the back by R. M. Sturtevant, who alone defends and to whom reference will be made as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">It was decided in <em>Union Bank of Weymouth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>8 Met. 504, that where, as in the case at bar, the defendant before delivery signs on the back of the note, he is a joint and several maker or promisor, and in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>124 Mass. 77, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>paroi evidence is inadmissible to show that this was not the real contract. But St. 1874, c. 404, Pub. Sts. c. 77, \u00a7 15, required notice of non-payment to all persons becoming parties to promissory notes payable on time by a signature in blank on the back thereof, the same as if they were indorsers. A promissory note payable on demand however is not within the statute, <em>Hitchings </em>v. <em>Edmands, </em>132 Mass. 338, and the defendant would not have the rights of an indorser, nor could he be considered as such, if it were not for St. 1898, c. 533, \u00a7 63, now R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 80, in force when the notes were given, which provides that \u201cA person placing his signature upon an instrument otherwise than as maker, drawer or acceptor is deemed to be an indorser, unless he clearly indicates by appropriate words his intention to be bound in some other capacity.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Stackpole, </em>168 Mass. 537. <em>Toole </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>193 Mass. 110, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">But, even if he is treated as maker, the notes were payable at once, and, more than six years having elapsed before the action was begun, the statute of limitations, R. L. c. 202, \u00a7 14, would be a bar, as the partial payments made by L. J. Sturtevant which interrupted the running of the statute as to him, were not binding on the defendant. <em>Fenno </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>146 Mass. 118. <em>Peirce </em>v. <em>Tobey, </em>5 Met. 168. <em>Balcom </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>6 Cush. 360. <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>123 Mass. 588. If he is deemed an indorser, it is conceded that no notice of non-payment was ever given or demand for payment made before bringing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The trial judge therefore rightly refused to give the plaintiff\u2019s requests, and, no error appearing in his rulings, that the defendant is not a co-maker but an indorser, and that as to him the action is barred by the statute of limitations, the order dismissing the report should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
