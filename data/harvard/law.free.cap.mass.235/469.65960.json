The plaintiff asked that the jury be instructed that, \u201cif the defendant\u2019s servants neglected to give the signals required by statute to be given at the railroad crossing, the jury might infer that this neglect contributed to the said injuries.\u201d The request was refused, and the jury were instructed that, if they found that the statutory signals were not given, that fact was evidence of negligence, and, if that negligence contributed to the injury, the plaintiff had proved his case so far as the defendant\u2019s negligence was concerned. <em>Held, </em>that there was no error in the refusal to instruct the jury as requested nor in the instruction given.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-7\">Tort for personal injuries received when a motor car which the plaintiff was driving was run into by a locomotive operated by the defendant at a grade crossing of the defendant\u2019s railroad and Charles River Road in Needham, the declaration as amended containing two counts, negligence of the defendant being alleged in general terms in the first count to be the cause of the collision, and the second count, alleged to be brought under St. 1906, c. 463, Part II, \u00a7 245, setting forth as the cause of the collision \u201cneglect of the defendant to ring the bell or sound the whistle as required by law.\u201d Writ dated November 8, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-8\">In the Superior Court, the action was tried before <em>Dana, </em>J.

The case was submitted to the jury on the second count of the plaintiff\u2019s amended declaration alleging that the defendant neglected to give the signal required by St. 1906, c. 463, Part II, \u00a7 245. The jury viewed the premises and found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\">The only question, raised by the plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions, is to the refusal of the trial judge to instruct the jury that \u201cif the defendant\u2019s servants neglected to give the signals required by statute to be given at the railroad crossing, the jury might infer that this neglect contributed .to the said injuries.\u201d The judge instructed the jury that if they found the statutory signals were not given, this fact was evidence of negligence, and if this negligence contributed to the injury, then the plaintiff has proved his case so far as the defendant\u2019s negligence is concerned. There was no error of law in refusing the plaintiff\u2019s request and the instructions given were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The jury were not required to find that the failure to give the signals, if they found this to be a fact, contributed to the plaintiff\u2019s injury. There may have been other causes which brought about the accident, and the absence of the signals may have in no way contributed to it. It was a question of fact depending on all the evidence and circumstances in the case, whether the defendant was answerable for the plaintiff\u2019s injury, or contributed to it in whole or in part. The plaintiff testified that he stopped about forty-five feet away from the crossing and listened for the bell, but did not look in the direction of the approaching train. The jury saw the crossing and its approaches. It was clearly a question for them to determine on all the evidence, if they found that the signals were not given, whether this neglect or the plaintiff\u2019s own neglect contributed to the accident. It was open to them to draw the inference that the failure to give the signals had nothing to do with the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In <em>LaFond </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>208 Mass. 451, relied on by the plaintiff, it was said, \u201cThe jury could have found that the failure to give these signals contributed to the happening of the accident, even though the intestate was somewhat deaf.\u201d In <em>Brusseau </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>187 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Mass. 84, 86, it was stated that the inference to be drawn from the absence of the signals under the circumstances shown, was for the jury; and in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>145 Mass. 386, the question whether the absence of the signals contributed to the accident was left to the jury, and to the same effect is <em>Engleman </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>210 Mass. 179, 181. These cases are not inconsistent with what is here decided. The statement in <em>Kelsall </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford </em>Rail<em>road, </em>196 Mass. 554, that if there was neglect in this particular (neglect in giving signals), the jury might infer that it contributed to the injury, did not require the judge to instruct the jury as requested by the plaintiff. The statement had reference to the facts shown in that particular case and that in view of these facts the jury were warranted in drawing the inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">There was no error of law in refusing the request and the instructions were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
