Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated September 18, 1918.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-11\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action on the ground \u201cthat the plaintiff is and was at the time of the bringing of this action the wife of the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-12\">At the trial in the Municipal Court the defendant requested the judge to rule \u201c that this action being brought by a wife against her husband cannot be maintained for want of jurisdiction of the court to entertain actions between husband and wife at common law. It being admitted in open court and by the pleadings and evidence that the plaintiff and the defendant are still husband and wife.\u201d The judge denied the motion to dismiss, refused the ruling requested, found for the plaintiff for the full amount claimed with interest and at the request of the defendant reported the case to the Appellate Division, who vacated the finding and ordered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-13\"><em>R. D. H.

But in the absence of a final decree the parties are husband and wife. A right of action at common law originating in another State doubtless may be enforced here if jurisdiction of the defendant appears, and a right of action given by a statute of another State also is enforceable unless it is against the policy of our laws. <em>Howarth </em>v. <em>Lombard, </em>175 Mass. 570, 572. <em>Converse </em>v. <em>Ayer, </em>197 Mass. 443. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>201 Mass. 527. The laws of Maine however relating to actions between husband and wife not appearing, the law of the forum governs. <em>Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Mass. 363. <em>Callender, McAuslan &amp; Troup Co. </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>187 Mass. 104. <em>Sistare </em>v. <em>Sistare, </em>218 U. S. 1, 26. And if by R. L. c. 153, \u00a7 6, as affected by St. 1910, c. 576, a married woman may sue and be sued as if she were sole, yet this provision \u201cshall not authorize suits between husband and wife.\u201d It follows that the common law bars recovery. <em>Nolin </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>191 Mass. 283. <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>195 Mass. 124, 128. The question whether she can proceed in equity is not before us. See <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>233 Mass. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The ruling of the trial judge that the plaintiff could recover was erroneous, and the order of the Appellate Division, that judgment should be entered for the defendant, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
