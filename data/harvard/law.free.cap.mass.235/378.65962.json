The material evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked for the following rulings among others:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">\"3. If the jury find that the plaintiff accepted two post-dated checks signed by the defendant, then such checks would constitute notes, and acceptance of such checks, or notes, would be payment, and the plaintiff would have to sue on these checks or notes, and not on his original right of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">\u201c4. The receipt, so called, signed by Nathan Shimilovich, is a note, and given to the plaintiff would be payment, and the plaintiff must sue on such note, and not on his original claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-11\">The rulings were refused. There was a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,501.45; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-12\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-13\"><em>H.

A bill of lading with sight draft attached was sent to a bank for collection. There was evidence that one \u201cShimilovich was either agent or partner of the defendant and that he acted as manager for the defendant.\u201d There was further evidence that on the arrival of the goods Shimilovich did not have money enough to pay the draft, and asked the defendant to do so; that the defendant stated he could not pay it; that the plaintiff was notified and sent one Frank to Brockton as his agent; that Frank told Shimilovich he had no authority to release the goods until they were paid for; that afterwards the defendant made two post-dated checks, for $400 and $600 respectively, payable to the plaintiff, and delivered them to Frank; that at the same time an instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>written by Shimilovich was delivered to Frank, which the defendant contends is a note. The instrument recites in substance that $1,000 has been received from the Brockton Furniture Company \u201con account, Balance to be paid in sixty days. Total $2000 70/100; balance $1000 70/100.\u201d Upon delivery of the checks and instrument above referred to the goods were delivered to the defendant. The check for $400 was paid by the defendant on presentation. Payment of the $600 check was stopped by the defendant, and the check was protested for non-payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\">The acceptance by the plaintiff of the checks was not as matter of law a payment, as there is no evidence to show they were accepted in payment; accordingly, the defendant\u2019s third request was properly refused. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>11 Met. 44, 51. <em>Illustrated Card &amp; Novelty Co. </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>208 Mass. 53. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hannagan, </em>210 Mass. 246. <em>Keystone Grape Co. </em>v. <em>Hustis, </em>232 Mass. 162, 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The judge rightly refused to rule that the instrument given to the plaintiff\u2019s agent at the time of the delivery of the checks was a note; it is not signed by the defendant nor payable to the plaintiff, and lacks most of the requirements of a promissory note; it plainly appears to be a receipt in ordinary form for $1,000 on account, with a statement of the balance due and of the time when according to the terms of sale it is to be paid. The defendant\u2019s fourth request was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
