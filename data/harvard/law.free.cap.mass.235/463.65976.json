The judge, subject to an exception by the defendant, ordered a verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant not contending that the note was not duly executed. In this court the defendant \u201c waived all the defences set up in the answer except that of misrepresentation as to the quality of the bricks sold, and that the consideration, if there was any, failed.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the judge must have understood from the statements of the defendant\u2019s counsel that he \u25a0 did not rely on the alleged misrepresentation; and therefore that, the defence of breach of warranty not being open under the contract, the ordering of the verdict was right.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b489-10\">At the same trial, there was evidence that the brick were described in a memorandum handed to the defendant by the plaintiff before the sale, as \u201cbuilding or face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>brick,\u201d and \u201cfire brick,\u201d and that they were not of that quality; that the brick were open to inspection and that their quality and condition were apparent; that negotiations for the sale had begun early in the year 1918 and were concluded in July of that year; that the defendant\u2019s business was that of buying and selling second hand machinery and junk; that he had had the fullest opportunity to examine the brick and had examined and inspected them; and that the plaintiff, a lawyer, had depended for what knowledge he had concerning the brick upon the caretaker of the premises, who referred to the large brick as fire brick and to the other brick as face brick. <em>Held, </em>that a finding would not have been warranted that the plaintiff made fraudulent statements which induced the defendant to purchase the brick and upon which the defendant relied; and, therefore, that the verdict for the plaintiff rightly was ordered.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">Contract upon a promissory note for $3,000, made by the defendants and payable to one Bowen and the plaintiff, a lawyer, and indorsed by Bowen to the plaintiff.

One of them would be about the warranties.\u201d The judge then stated, \u201cYou claim misrepresentation in your pleadings.\u201d The defendants\u2019 counsel replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think I ought to be asked to say that openly until the case is in. Whether I claim that or not is for the jury to consider.\u201d The judge then ruled, \u201cHe may ask him if he intended to mislead, if you are going to claim he did.\u201d The defendants\u2019 counsel then said, \u201cThe Supreme Court ruled \u2014 may I read it? \u2014 \u2018Whether statements are made of the speaker\u2019s knowledge within the requirements of this test, is a question for the jury.\u2019 That has been decided in 127 Mass. It seems to me I ought not to be asked point blank what I personally claim is the whole transaction. I am only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>counsel, and the jury is to pass upon that.\u201d The judge replied, \u201cThe pleadings here indicate you claim there was a misrepresentation. What I am trying to get at is whether you claim that or something else.\u201d The defendants\u2019 counsel replied, \u201cI intend to amend my pleadings to claim that the goods were warranted up to a certain standard and were not up to that standard.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">The judge then stated, \u201cNow if you want to claim breach of a warranty, is that it? What I am getting at is, do you want to withdraw the claim that there was a single misrepresentation?\u201d To this the defendants\u2019 counsel replied, \u201cAs I say, that is for the jury to say, not for me.\u201d The judge rejoined, \u201cNo, it is for you to say whether you make the claim or not. It is for the jury to say whether it is justified. Do you make the claim? \u201d The defendants\u2019 counsel replied, \u201cNot as the pleadings stand now, but I want to amend the pleadings. I want to amend by adding \u2014 \u201d and the judge interposed, \"If you simply want to amend by adding, you [addressing the plaintiff\u2019s counsel] may put the question, . . . whether he intended to mislead.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">It was stated in the record, \u201cThe defendants waived all the defences set up in the answer except that of misrepresentation as to the quality of the bricks sold, and that the consideration, if there was any, failed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">Other material facts are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\">At the close of the evidence, by order of the judge, the jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $3,134.06; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-9\"><em>S.

Bowen and the plaintiff, for certain brick. The terms of sale were contained in a written contract. The defendants alleged misrepresentations of the quantity and quality of the brick by the plaintiff and Bowen, and near the close of the trial the defendants were permitted to amend their answer by alleging a breach of warranty of quality. A verdict was ordered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">Bowen and Mr. Bennett owned the machinery, rails and equipment, including three hundred and twenty thousand brick designated as building or face brick, some unburned building or face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>brick and about one hundred and five thousand fire brick, located at Martha\u2019s Vineyard. The machinery was sold to the defendants and under an agreement in writing dated July 1, 1918, the title to the brick passed to the defendants. In this agreement no representation was made as to the amount or quality of the brick, the plaintiff and Bowen transferring all brick of every name and nature and description located at Makonikey, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, on property formerly occupied by the Kaolin and Clay Products Company and the Clay Products Company, and covenanting that they were the lawful owners and that the chattels were free from all incumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">As the contract in writing contained the entire agreement of the parties, it could not be supplemented by oral evidence of a warranty. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Sugden, </em>231 Mass. 1. <em>Glackin </em>v. Bennett, 226 Mass. 316. <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Joseph Breck &amp; Sons Corp. </em>172 Mass. 581, and <em>North Packing &amp; Provision Co. </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>196 Mass. 204, are not in point. In neither of these cases was the contract of sale in writing. The agreement was oral, and the paper relied on as showing that it was in writing was merely a bill of parcels not designed to set forth all the terms of the contract. It was not a contract in writing and did not prevent the parties from showing all the terms of the bargain, including the warranty. See <em>Glackin </em>v. <em>Bennett, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The defendants further relied on the alleged misrepresentations of the owners concerning the quality of the brick, asserting that a large part of the brick were not suitable for building or structural purposes, and that many of the fire brick were not merchantable. During the progress of the trial and before the defendants amended their answer by alleging a breach of warranty, the defendants objected to a question asked by the plaintiff. The judge then asked the defendants\u2019 counsel if he relied on the claim of misrepresentation, to which counsel replied, \"Not as the pleadings stand now, but I want to amend the pleadings.\u201d The judge then said that, if the defendants desired to amend by adding (referring to the amendment setting up the warranty), the question might be put. When this question was asked, the defendants, in their answer, denied that they had signed the note, and alleged that it was without consideration and that they were induced to sign the note by the misrepresentations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the sellers as to the quality and quantity of the brick. The amendment of the defendants, which they then filed, related solely to the sellers\u2019 warranty. Under these circumstances we do not think that the question of fraudulent representations is open to the defendants. The judge must have understood, from the statements of the defendants\u2019 counsel, that he did not rely on the alleged misrepresentations and the judge was. right, therefore, in ordering a verdict for the plaintiff there being no evidence in the case to contradict the agreement in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Furthermore, there was no evidence of any fraudulent misrepresentations made by Bowen or by the plaintiff upon which the defendants relied. The brick were open to inspection and their quality and condition was apparent. Negotiations for the sale began early in the year 1918 and were concluded when the sale was made in July of that year. The defendants\u2019 business was that of buying and selling second hand machinery and junk, they had the fullest opportunity to examine the brick and they were in fact examined and inspected by each of the defendants. On the other hand, Bowen had not been in Martha\u2019s Vineyard since 1912 and depended on Mr. Bennett for what knowledge he had concerning the brick, and Mr. Bennett relied on the caretaker of the premises, who referred to the large brick as fire brick and the other brick as face brick when speaking of them. Under these circumstances there was nothing to show that fraudulent statements were made by the plaintiff, inducing the defendants to make the purchase, and on which they relied. <em>Mabardy </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>202 Mass. 148, 151. <em>American Malting Co. </em>v. <em>Souther Brewing Co. </em>194 Mass. 89, 96. <em>Hillyer </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>154 Mass. 502, 508. <em>Salem India Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>23 Pick. 256, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
