On arraignment, he admitted the truth of the latter charge, but pleaded not guilty as to the former. Following his conviction of the charge of assault with a deadly weapon, he has appealed from the ensuing judgment and from an order by which his motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Appellant presents two points for reversal of the judgment : First, that the verdict of the jury was not sustained by the evidence; and secondly, that the trial court committed prejudicial error in that, on cross-examination of defendant as a witness in his own behalf, the trial court permitted the prosecution to inquire of defendant whether he had ever been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">With reference to the first point, an examination of the transcript on appeal reveals the situation that the evidence offered by the prosecution, although contradicted in many essential particulars .by defendant, was ample to sustain the verdict. It would serve no useful purpose to set it forth herein. In accord with a host of authorities, the appellant\u2019s position in that regard cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">As to appellant\u2019s second contention, although it is presented from an unusual standpoint, by an unbroken line of decisions by the appellate tribunals of this state, the point has been ruled that, notwithstanding an admission by defendant on his arraignment that theretofore he was convicted of a felony, and in consequence of such admission, that ordinarily the fact of his former conviction should \u201cnot be alluded to on the trial\u201d (sec. 1025, Pen. Code),\u2014 should he become a general witness in his own behalf, his credibility as such witness may be tested in the same manner as the credibility of any other witness may be tested. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>94 Cal.
