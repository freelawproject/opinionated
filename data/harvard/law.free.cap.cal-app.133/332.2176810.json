J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqX\">The defendant was charged with driving an automobile on a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and, after a trial before the court without a jury, was found guilty. On his application the court made an order granting him probation upon certain named conditions. The defendant made no motion for a new trial, but gave notice of an appeal from the order granting probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Judgment has not been pronounced, the defendant having waived the same by application for probation <em>(People </em>v. <em>De Voe, </em>123 Cal. App. 233 [11 Pac. (2d) 26]), and the order granting probation, not being an order made after judgment, is not an appealable order <em>(People </em>v. <em>Patello, </em>125 Cal. App. 480 [13 Pac. (2d) 1068] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Noone, </em>132 Cal. App. 89 [22 Pac. (2d) 284] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Von Eckhartsberg, ante, </em>p. 1 [23 Pac. (2d) 819]).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">We may add, however, that the sole point raised on this purported appeal is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction in that, aside from the admissions and confessions of the appellant, the <em>corpus delicti </em>was not proven. We have examined the record, which is very brief, and are satisfied that the <em>corpus delicti </em>was sufficiently established by facts and circumstances other than the admissions and confessions of the defendant, and these admissions leave no doubt as to the guilt of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Marks, J., and Turrentine, J., <em>pro tern,., </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
