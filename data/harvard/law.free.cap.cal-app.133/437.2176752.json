However, although they are all set out in the reporter\u2019s transcript, the certificate does not show that they were used in connection with any proceeding before the trial court. The record is not sufficient to furnish a basis upon which this court properly may consider the same in reference to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">The first ground of appeal is that \u201cThe court erred in granting the respondent a jury trial.\u201d But there is nothing in the record to show that there was any objection by the plaintiff to the jury trial, either at the time of trial or in connection with any motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">As to the second ground of appeal stated by plaintiff, an examination of the record itself discloses that there was a substantial and direct conflict in the evidence upon the issues relative to the principal question urged by the appellant in support of this second ground of appeal. Appellant states his second ground of appeal as \u201cInsufficiency and total absence of evidence to justify the verdict and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>judgment rendered thereon.\u201d The record discloses sufficient evidence to justify the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Conrey, P. J., and Houser, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
