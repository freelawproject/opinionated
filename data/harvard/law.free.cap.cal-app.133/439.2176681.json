In due time this appeal was taken and the cause submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-16\">The transcript of the evidence is brief. But three witnesses were called, the complaining witness, the arresting officer and an eye-witness to the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-17\">We find no errors nor was any particular point of law presented or argued during the trial. An examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of the record discloses no error in the proceedings nor does counsel indicate anything justifying a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Thompson, J., and Plummer, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
