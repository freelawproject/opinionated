On the other hand, petitioner\u2019s position in the matter seems to be amply supported not only by rule of the superior court, but as well by statute and by judicial precedent. This court knows of no authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In such circumstances, it is ordered that a peremptory writ of mandate issue as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Conrey, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
