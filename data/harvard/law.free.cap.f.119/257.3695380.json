that they were incurred on the motion and the request of the said plaintiff; that of right they should have -been paid in advance by the said plaintiff, but upon the assurance of said plaintiff that the property against which it was seeking to foreclose was amply sufficient to pay all the costs and expenses so incurred, and the whole amount of the indebtedness for which said action was brought, they were not so paid, but were left to be paid out of the funds arising from the sale of said property; that the proceeds of such sale were wholly insufficient to pay even the costs and expenses of the court in that behalf; and that after applying the proceeds of sale to the satisfaction of the costs and expenses of sale, and of the compensation allowed to the said receiver and his counsel in and by the said decree of foreclosure, as authorized by the court, the amounts hereinbefore stated remain still unpaid and entirely unsatisfied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-23\">The report and petition of the receiver also contained certain allegations intended and tending to show that the suit was originally commenced without legal right and by collusion between the complainant trustee and the defendant Woodbridge Canal &amp;

After argument, the petition and demurrer were submitted to the court below, in deciding which the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">\u201cI am of the opinion that provision should have been made when this suit was commenced, or at the time when the receiver was appointed, for the payment of or security for the amount of his expenses, and for the redemption of whatever certificates might be issued by him, in the event that the proceeds of the sale of the property should prove insufficient. But such provision was not made at the time by the court, and I am of the opinion that the court is without authority to do so now. In Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Oregon Pac. R. Co., 31 Or. 237, 48 Pac. 706, 38 L. R. A. 424, 65 Am. St. Rep. 822, this question was fully considered, and the views there expressed are in accord with my opinion in the present case. The order to show cause will therefore be discharged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">And on the same day the following order in the matter was entered in the minutes of the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">\u201cIn this cause the receiver\u2019s application [by order to show cause] for an order directing complainant to pay the amount due to receiver and his employ\u00e9s, etc., heretofore heard and submitted, having been fully considered, and the memorandum opinion of the court having been filed, it was in accordance therewith ordered that the order to show cause in this behalf issued herein be, and hereby is, discharged, and that receiver\u2019s said application be, and hereby is, denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">The appeal is from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">A motion is made to dismiss the appeal, based upon two grounds: First, that, as the demurrer to the receiver\u2019s report and petition set up that the court below was without jurisdiction to grant the relief sought, it raised a question of jurisdiction, which was required to be certified to the supreme court, under the provisions of the act of congress creating this court (26 Stat. 826 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 547]); and, secondly, that the order appealed from is not a final order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>or decree of the circuit court. We think it clear that there is no merit in either of these points. It is not pretended that the court below was without jurisdiction of the parties to the suit, or of its subject-matter, nor that it was without jurisdiction to appoint a receiver to take possession of and hold and operate the property pending the litigation. It follows, as a matter of course, that it had the power and that it was its duty to overlook and adjust the accounts of the receiver, and to adjudge how and when the costs and expenses of the receivership should be paid,\u2014subject, of course, to correction, by appropriate proceedings, of any error committed in that respect. And in this case the court below, in its decree confirming the sale of the property, in express terms, retained jurisdiction of the cause for those purposes. It was in pursuance of that express provision of the decree of confirmation that the report and petition of the receiver was filed, and action thereon by the court sought; thus not only invoking a power expressly reserved in the decree of confirmation, but one of the powers of the court incident to its unquestioned jurisdiction over the parties to and the subject-matter of the suit. There is just as little merit in the contention that the order appealed from is not a final order. It is a mistake to say that by the order the court below did not refuse to settle the accounts of the receiver. The petition was for the settlement of the receiver\u2019s account, as well as for an order that the complainant in the cause be directed to pay the full amount of the deficiency shown thereby. The order to show cause directed the complainant to appear at a time and place designated, and show, if it could, why that relief should not be granted. Upon hearing and considering the matter, the receiver\u2019s application, which, as has been said, included a prayer both for the settlement of his accounts, and a judgment against the complainant for the deficiency shown thereby, was denied, and the order to show cause discharged. Nothing could more effectively and completely end the application than that order. It was final, in the strictest sense, and it was an order from which the receiver was entitled to- appeal, for two reasons: First, because the account the receiver sought to have settled and allowed and ordered paid contained an unpaid balance of $3,105.72 that had' been theretofore adjudged by the court to be due him on account of the expenses of the receivership-; and, secondly, because it was his legal duty to exercise his powers as receiver, and see that the certificates that he had issued and sold under the authority of the court, as well as all other legitimate expenses of the receivership, be paid. We regard the decision of the'supreme\u2019court in the case of Bosworth v. Railway Co., 174 U. S. 182, 19 Sup. Ct. 625, 43 L, Ed. 941, as full authority for the appeal by the receiver. The motion to dismiss is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">. In considering the merits of the appeal, we should not be controlled or in any way influenced by the fact that the sale of the property seems to have been in reality made and confirmed to the receiver and his attorney, through Thompson, for $21,000, $18,000 of which was paid by the satisfaction of the allowance in that amount that had theretofore been made to the receiver and his attorney for their services in their respective capacities. Neither the propriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>of the confirmation of the sale so made, nor that of any other of the provisions of the decree of confirmation, is before us for consideration. That decree, including the order of payments therein specified, must be here accepted as it stands. Nor does any objection appear to have been at any time taken by the complainant to the sale or to its confirmation, or to any of the provisions of either the original decree of foreclosure and sale, or that confirming the sale. In and by the latter, as has been shown, the court below in express terms retained jurisdiction of the cause and of the parties thereto \u201cuntil redemption is made or title deeds have passed, as herein provided, and until the coming in of the reports of the said clerk and receiver herein provided for, and the final action of the court thereon, and the final payment of the balance of the costs and expenses of this court and its officers, and of the advances made and the indebtedness incurred by said receiver which have been or may be allowed by the court in the management and care of the property placed in his charge, or until the further and final order of the court in that behalf.\u201d In obedience to the requirements of that decree, the report of the receiver was filed. It does not, we think, admit of question that the court should have settled the account of the receiver, and that in discharging the order to show cause, and dismissing the petition of the receiver, embracing, as has been shown, a prayer for its settlement, as well as for an order that the complainant pay the deficiency shown thereby, the court below was in error. The account, filed by the receiver shows, among other things, that there remains due and unpaid on the certificates issued by the receiver under the orders of the court, and for other allowed and adjudged expenses of the receivership, a large amount of money, which fact is referred to in the opinion of the court below, but concerning which the learned judge, in discharging the order to show cause and denying the receiver\u2019s application, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">\u201cI am of the opinion that provision should have been made when this suit was commenced, or at the time when the receiver was appointed, for the payment of or security for the amount, of his expenses, and for the redemption of whatever certificates might be issued by him, in the event that the proceeds of the sale of the property should prove insufficient. But such provision was not made at the time by the court, and I am of the opinion that the court is without authority to do so now. In Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Oregon Pac. R. Co., 31 Or. 237, 48 Pac. 706, 38 L. R. A. 424, 65 Am. St. Rep. 822, this question was fully considered, and the views there expressed are in accord with my opinion in the present case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On principle, it seems to us impossible to assign any good reason why, if the court was empowered at the time of the commencement of the suit, or at the time of the appointment of the receiver, to compel the complainant to pay into court sufficient money to cover the expenses of the receivership, or to give security \"for such payment, including the payment of whatever certificates might be authorized to be issued by the receiver, the court -has not precisely the same power to adjudge, upon the settlement of the receiver\u2019s account, that the complainant make good any deficiency in the matter of sucb expenses; having by its decree, in express terms, retained jurisdiction of the cause and of the parties thereto for the purpose of settling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the receiver\u2019s account, and ordering paid the costs and expenses of the receivership. The case of Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Oregon Pac. R. Co., 31 Or. 237, 48 Pac. 706, 38 L. R. A. 424, 65 Am. St. Rep. 822, relied upon and approved by the court below, does not commend itself to our judgment. The court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">\u201cIt is not perceived upon what ground it can be claimed that, because tbe expenses of tbe receivership are allowed, without any fault of his, to exceed the value_ of the mortgaged property, thus entirely destroying his security, he must, in addition to the loss of his debt, be compelled to make good the deficit, unless the order of appointment was made upon that condition. He has no control over the acts of the receiver, and if, without his consent, he is to be held responsible therefor, he is liable to absolute bankruptcy and ruin. Such a rule would render the plaintiff\u2019s position so uncertain and precarious as practically to preclude him from any protection whatever through the appointment of a receiver pending the foreclosure suit. But the inquiry is made, \u2018Shall not a railroad mortgagee, who applies for and obtains the appointment of a receiver, with authority to operate the road, be held responsible for the liabilities incurred by such officer, when they cannot be made out of the property itself?\u2019 We think not, unless such responsibility was imposed as a condition to the appointment or the continuance of the receiver-in office. The appointment of a receiver in a suit to foreclose a railroad mortgage is not a matter of strict right, but rests in the sound Judicial discretion of the court; and it may, as a condition to issuing the necessary order, impose such terms as may, under the circumstances of the particular case, appear to be reasonable, and, if not acceded to, may refuse to make the order. 30 Am. Law Rev. 161; Fosdick v. Schall, 99 U. S. 235, 25 L. Ed. 339. If, therefore, upon an application for the appointment of a railroad receiver, it appears^probable that the income and corpus will prove insufficient to pay the expenses and liabilities thereof, we have no doubt that the court may require of the plaintiff, as a condition to such appointment, a guaranty of the payment of the expenses of such officer. And if, at any time after the appointment'has been made, it becomes apparent to the court that it will be unable to pay and discharge the present or future liabilities incurred by itsexeeutive officer and manager, it should refuse to continue the operation of the road'under the receiver, unless its expenses are guarantied. No court is bound or ought to engage or continue in the operation of a railroad or any other enterprise without the ability to promptly discharge its obligations, and unless it can do so it should keep out or immediately go out of the business. But unless such terms are imposed as a condition of the appointment or continuation in office of the receiver, his employes must look to the property in. the custody of the court and its income for their compensation. They have no claim whatever on any of the parties to the litigation. They are the employes and servants of the court, and not of the. parties. Their wages are in no sense costs of the litigation, and, although incurred during the progress of the suit, they are not incurred in the suit. They are neither expenses of the plaintiff nor of the defendant, and are not fees or costs which can be charged against the successful party to the litigation, as is sought to be done in this ease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The party who asks for the appointment of a receiver does so voluntarily, and because he thinks it to his interest to have the possession of the property in controversy pass into the hands and control of the court pending the litigation. It is true that the receiver, when appointed, becomes the officer of the court, and not the agent of either party to the suit, but he is appointed to serve the parties interested. He holds the property, and, when operating it, operates it for the benefit of whomsoever shall be finally adjudged to own it. But he cannot be justly held to hold it and operate it at his own expense or that of the court. Those who render services in and about the receivership are justly entitled to be paid the fair value of such services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>and when the issuance of receiver\u2019s certificates becomes necessary for the proper preservation of the property, and such certificates are authorized by the court to be issued by the receiver for money to be used for such purposes, those who buy the obligations are entitled to have them paid. How? In cases like the present, out of the property or its proceeds, certainly. No one, we apprehend, will question that. But the property having been sold for but a trifle more than the amount theretofore allowed the receiver and his attorney for their services in and about the receivership, and they credited with such allowance on their bid, who is to suffer? The complainant, at whose instance the receiver was appointed, or those who, relying upon his acts, based upon the authority and sanction of the court, invested their money and rendered their services in and about the operation and preservation of the property ? It is not difficult to determine on which side of this question are the equities. With due deference, we are unable to see any force in the suggestion of the supreme court of Oregon in the case cited that, as the complainant in such a suit has no control over the receiver, if he be held liable for the expenses of the receivership, in the event the property prove insufficient to pay them, he may be bankrupted. At the same time it is conceded by that learned court that, where it appears probable that the property will prove insufficient, the court may require, as a condition to the appointment of a receiver, a guaranty of the payment of the expenses of such officer, and a like guaranty subsequently, on pain of the discharge of the receiver, when it becomes evident that the property will prove insufficient to pay the expenses. The theory of this manifestly is that in these two instances the complainant can inform himself of the probable outcome of the property, and, if he be not willing to give the guaranty, he will not secure the appointment of a receiver in the one instance, or his continuance in office in the other. But why should he not be required to inform himself, also, w'hen no such condition is imposed by the court? Precisely the same opportunity on complainant\u2019s part, and precisely the same duty to inform himself in that respect, exists in the absence of the requirement of the guaranty mentioned. The complainant, whose lien upon the property it is sought to foreclose, in the nature of things, must and should be held to have much better information regarding the value of the property and its probable outcome than the court. Indeed, it is not easy to see how the court can be properly expected to know anything about it. The appointment of a receiver, if made at all, is usually made at the request of the complainant,\u2014occasionally, as in the case at bar, with the consent of the defendant. If the complainant was not willing to pay the expenses of the receivership it asked for, in the event of the insufficiency of the property to do so, it should not have asked the court to make the appointment, incur the liabilities, and pledge its faith to their payment. It was the duty of the complainant to keep informed in respect to the progress of the receivership, the property, and its probable outcome, and, whenever it became unwilling to further stand good for any deficiency, to ask the court to bring to an end the business it undertook and was conducting on complainant\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>We are therefore of opinion that the complainant is liable for the deficiency shown by the decrees already rendered in the cause, and for such further deficiency as may be properly ascertained; and such is the decided weight of authority.

What that further deficiency, if any, properly chargeable against the complainant, may be, will be a matter for the determination of the circuit court on a settlement of the receiver\u2019s account. It is not for us to anticipate its action thereon in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Order reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
