Barth was president of the City National Bank of Denver, and it is alleged that he transferred it to the bank, which in turn transferred it to the plaintiff in error. The defense is: First, that the plaintiff in error is the successor of the City National Bank, taking its assets and assuming its obligations, but did not take the note as a purchaser for value; second, that the City Bank was the real beneficiary and payee of the note, the consideration for which note was the execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tion and delivery by Barth and the City National Bank of Denver to Watkins, prior to the maturity of the note, of a good, sufficient, clear, and perfect title to certain described real estate in the county of Huerfano, Colo.; that neither Barth, nor the City National Bank, nor the plaintiff in error, nor either of them, have conveyed or offered to convey such title, but have refused so to do, whereby the consideration for the note has failed; and that Watkins had paid upon the note the sum of $10,000. A jury was waived, and the cause was tried to the court. The trial judge filed special findings of fact and of law as follows:</summary>\n<syllabus data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b577-21\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>\u00b6 5.

On or about the 20th day of January, 1892, at Denver, in the state of Colorado, the defendant, Samuel W. Watkins, executed and delivered unto one William Barth, then and now a resident of said state, his certain promissory note in writing, dated on said day, whereby he promised to pay to the order of the said William Barth the sum of $16,000 four years after the date of said note, together with interest thereon at ten per cent, per annum from the date of said note until paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">\u201cSecond. The said defendant paid on the principal of said note on the 29th day of January, 1896, the sum of $10,000, together with all interest on said note to said date; and the time of the payment of the balance of the principal of said note without interest was extended to the 15th day of February, 1897, since which date no payment of principal or interest thereon has been made by or on behalf of said defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\">\u201cThird. The said William Barth, payee in said note, was at the date of the making thereof, and for some time prior thereto and thereafter, president of the City National Bank of Denver, and received the said note for the use and benefit of said bank. The plaintiff therein some time during the month of May, 1894, became the holder of said\u2019 note, as successor to the said City National Bank of Denver, the assets and liabilities of which said National Bank of Denver the plaintiff assumed, and then obtained and now holds the said note subject to any defense existing in favor of said defendant affecting the consideration thereof. The said plaintiff did not acquire said note as a bona fide holder for value, without notice of the equities subsisting between the parties thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-7\">\u201cFourth. The above-mentioned note was executed and delivered under the facts and upon the consideration as follows, and not otherwise: On and prior to March 28, 1891, the defendant was obligated to the said City National Bank as surety or indorser on several notes made by one T. F. Martin, amounting in the aggregate to about $20,000, for which said bank further held as security certain collaterals given by said Martin, and also a trust deed upon certain real estate, which was subordinate, however, to three prior trust deeds or mortgages upon such real estate. Such indebtedness being unpaid, the defendant suggested and requested that the bank purchase in the prior incumbrances on the real estate and certain collaterals therewith, held by Thurlow, Hutton &amp; Williams, representing that the value of the property would more than repay the debt and investment, and that the defendant would furnish $6,000 of the purchase money required for that purpose, ito be applied in the purchase of a specific collateral thereof, not involved in the present controversy. Accordingly, on March 28, 1891, such purchase was made in the name of said William Barth, as purchaser, through one J. P. Heisler, acting on behalf of said bank as its attorney, the price paid being $17,475.60, of which $6,000 was paid by the defendant, and the remaining sum by the bank; and pursuant to foreclosure notices then pending upon the second and third mortgages, on March 30, 1891, the real estate thereunder was bid in by said attorney in the name of said Barth, and conveyance so taken thereupon. By such transaction title in fee simple was acquired by said Barth (together with other matters) for the use and benefit of said City National Bank of Denver, to the following described real estate situated in the county of Huerfano, state of Colorado, as described in such second and third mortgages and foreclosed as aforesaid, to wit: All the lands, tenements, rights, titles, interest, and privileges of, in, and to the Lake Miriam DitCh, and all reservoirs in connection therewith, together with lots 1, 5, 9, and 11 in block 50, and 25 feet off the south side of lot 5 in block 33, and lots 7, 11, 12, 13, and 14 in block 4, and all in the town of Walsenburg, Huerfano^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>county, Colorado, according to a map of the same now on record in the recorder\u2019s office of said Huerfano county, Colorado, together with the south half of the northeast quarter and the north half of the southeast quarter of section 13, township 28 south, of range 67 west; and said Barth, for said bank, further became the owner of a $5,000 note of said Martin, and a trust deed securing the same, upon the same premises above described, which constituted a first lien, but was not included in the foreclosure. Said Barth owned said above-described real estate and prior mortgage, with no promise or obligation on his part or on the part of' said bank to sell or otherwise dispose of the same to said defendant. On or about the said 20th day of January, 1892, an agreement in writing was entered into respecting the same, as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-4\">\u201c \u2018Memorandum of an agreement made and entered into this 20th day of January, 1892, as follows: The party of the first part herein, being William Barth, the City National Bank, and John it.

For the purpose of carrying out this contract, as a part of the same transaction, Barth and Hanna, representing the bank, made a deed to the defendant, dated January 19, 1892, reciting the consideration of $36,0(10, and that they \u2018have granted, bargained, sold, and conveyed, and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell, and convey, unto the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, forever, all the following described lots and parcels of land,\u2019 covering all the property, the title to which Barth or Hanna had acquired by the above-mentioned foreclosure, including the land hereinbefore specifically described on page 3 of these findings, \u2018together with, all and singular, the hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging or in any wise appertaining, and the reversion or reversions, remainder or remainders, rents, issues, and profits, thereof, and all the estate, right, title, interest, claim, and demand whatsoever of the said party of the first part, either in law or equity, of, in, and to the above-bargained premises, with the hereditaments and appurtenances, subject, however, to suits now pending against said property; the proceeds therefrom, if any, to be credited to said Watkins.\u2019 As a part of the same transaction, the defendant executed a trust deed to the same premises, dated the 20th day of January, 1892, to secure the payment of the two notes mentioned above, and which deed contains a covenant that at the time of the making thereof he was well seised of the premises in fee simple, and that the same were free and clear of all liens and incumbrances whatever.

The litigation referred to in said escrow receipt was a suit brought by the mortgagor, Martin, against Barth, respecting the title under the foreclosure, and was finally determined in favor of said Barth on or about February 26, 1894. The value of the premises herein before specifically described appears from the evidence to have been $25,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-10\">\u201cFifth. After the mailing of the said agreement of January 20, 1892, said William Barth, being the holder and owner as aforesaid of the note of Martin for $5,000, and of the first mortgage or trust deed upon the premises described as aforesaid, securing said note, some time in the month of March, 1892, instituted proceedings to foreclose said first mortgage or trust deed by advertisement, and caused notice to be given of the sale thereof on April 11, 1892,. the said Heisler acting as attorney for the said Barth therein; and thereupon-the said Heisler attended at the time and place so appointed for said sale, the-said defendant being present with him. Bids were nlade thereupon by said. Heisler in behalf of Barth and the bank, and by a representative of one W. N. Coler, who was interested in the Walsenburg Waterworks, the reservoir connected with which was situated on said land. The sale was made by'the-sheriff of Huerfano county as successor in trust under the trust deed, and at. the sale Heisler, in the name of Barth, as owner of the note, demanded that: the sale be stopped, and tendered the note which was secured by the trust deed, with the memorandum attached thereto, signed by Heisler in the name-of Barth, stating that the note had been fully paid. The sheriff refused to stop the sale, and the bidding proceeded; the two highest bids being made-in behalf of Barth and the bank, and the next highest in the name of Coler; the bids being slightly in excess of $15,000. Heisler demanded a deed of the property from the sheriff, and tendered in payment for the same the note-secured by the trust deed, and the other notes secured by subsequent trust deeds on the property; but the sheriff refused to make a deed unless the-whole amount bid was paid in cash, which Heisler declined to do, and the sheriff thereupon made a deed to said Coler, and offered to pay Heisler the sum of about $6,000, the amount due on the note secured by the trust deed under which the sale was made; refusing, however, to pay the surplus over and above said sum to said Heisler or the representative of said bank. Heisler, on behalf of the bank, refused to accept the $6,000. Thereupon the bank brought suit to set aside this sale; said Barth being plaintiff therein, and Coler and the sheriff being made defendants. The litigation finally resulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>a decision against the plaintiffs, and affirming the said sale, whereby the title to the property was lost by the said bank and its representatives. Subsequently the bank demanded payment of the $6,000 supposed to be in the hands of the sheriff who made the sale, but was unable to collect the same or any part thereof. The defendant was cognizant of all the proceedings aforesaid, but it does not satisfactorily appear from the proofs that he either directed or requested the bringing of such foreclosure. He was present at the sale by invitation of the attorney, but gave no directions in respect thereto. In the litigation referred to, to set aside the sale thereupon, the defendant participated both as a witness for the plaintiff, and by the employment of counsel to assist therein the counsel on the part of the bank, but not otherwise. Through such proceedings the title to the property in question was lost to the bank, and it became unable to convey the title thereof to the defendant in accordance with the agreement before mentioned, and the $6,000, being the amount of the first mortgage note and interest, was also lost as aforesaid. And I find nothing in the conduct of the defendant in respect thereto to charge him with responsibility for the loss so incurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-4\">\u201cSixth. On January 29, 1896, before the final determination of the suit aforementioned to set aside the said sale by the sheriff, the defendant having paid the note in suit, except the sum of $6,000 reserved thereupon, the plaintiff bank gave to the defendant a receipt thereupon as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-5\">\u201c \u2018$10,800.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AzN\">Denver, Colorado, January 29th, 1896.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-6\">\u201c \u2018Keceived of S.

The plaintiff became the owner as successor to the assets and liabilities of the former bank, and holds the note subject to any defense existing in favor of the defendant, affecting the consideration. The answer sets up as a defense failure on the part of the payee to convey certain real estate in accordance with a contract of even date with the note; such real estate being then owned by the payee, and conveyance thereof by \u2018a good, sufficient, clear, and perfect title\u2019 being alleged as the consideration of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">\u201cThe testimony establishes, in substance, the following transactions as constituting the consideration of this note, together with another of like date for $15,000:- Prior to March, 1891, one T. P. Martin was indebted to the City National Bank on sundry notes, amounting to about $20,000, upon which the defendant was an accommodation indorser; and the bank held as further security a mortgage given by Martin upon real estate holdings; which security was subordinate, however, to prior mortgages, being the fourth mortgage upon some of the property. When the. defendant became indorser he was contemplating the purchase of an interest in the Martin properties, but later became dissatisfied with the state of affairs, and then urged upon the bank the purchase of the prior mortgages and collaterals outstanding against Martin, which were in the hands of Thurlow, Hutton &amp; Williams, assuring the bank of the safety of such further investment, promising to advance a portion from means in his hands, for which he was to take the title to certain parcels of the real estate; and undoubtedly it was his intention to thus obtain an arrangement for securing himself as indorser. Thereupon Mr. Barth and Mr. Hanna, on behalf of the bank, purchased the prior mortgages and collaterals so held against Martin, bidding in the properties at foreclosure sales as previously advertised\u2014that of the collaterals held on March 29, 1891, and of the premises under the second and third mortgages held on March 30, 1S91; taking assignment of the first mortgage, which is the subject of this controversy. Of the investment thus called for, $6,000 was furnished by the defendant, and was, by written agreement on the part of the bank, applied for the purchase by the defendant of a specific portion of the mortgaged property, not in controversy here; and the new investment of the bank was about $11,500. Soon after the foreclosure sales of March 30th, two suits were commenced by Martin against Barth (the nominal bidder) to set them aside. At this stage of the transaction, and up to January 20, 1892, it was clear that the legal ownership of all these purchases from and through Thurlow, Hutton &amp; Williams was vested in the bank, through its representatives; and, excepting as to the specific portion above mentioned, no express agreement appears between the bank and the defendant for the latter to have ownership of the property upon any terms. Since the hearing I have re-examined all the depositions in evidence, and the recitals of negotiations and conversations on the part of and with the defendant which led up to the purchase contain no stipulation or provision on one side or the other for his assumption of the purchase, aside from the single portion mentioned; and the fact of such express agreement in that instance would have called for a showing of strong equitable consideration before any parol understanding could have become admissible even for -the protection of the defendant as indorser. On the other hand, the defendant alone testifies that there was a parol arrangement that he should attend to the disposition of the property to make the amount (1) of the investment in this purchase, and (2) the indebtedness for which he was held as surety, and that he expected further compensation or share of any surplus arising, though he claims there was no express agreement to that effect. It is true that this testimony was received at the hearing by way of reply to the rebutting case on the part of the plaintiff, and after the submission of the depositions on that behalf, and should be considered with due allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>for such state of the proofs, with the witnesses for the plaintiff not present. But I find nothing in these statements by the defendant which is inconsistent with the facts stated on the other side; and it is clear that mere inferences, as stated by the witnesses for the plaintiff, that they acted for the benefit of the defendant throughout, cannot have effect beyond the facts related by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-4\">\u201cI am satisfied, therefore, and so find from the undisputed testimony, that the bank, through its representatives, owned the securities and property, so far as the same is in controversy, up to the making of the contract of January 20, 1892, with no definite promise to or with the defendant for their purchase or acquisition by the latter, and the arrangement of that date was made and intended as an adjustment of the relations and interests of the parties, respectively, and that thereupon the purchase of the entire venture, as it then stood in the hands of the bank, was assumed by the defendant, in addition to his obligation as surety, all consummated in that contract, subject only to the conditions therein stated. The pre-existing arrangements and relations between the parties are admissible for the purpose of understanding the attitude in which they dealt, and to explain provisions not otherwise clear, but ,not to vary any of the terms. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-5\">\u201cThe contract entered into January 20, 1892, wherein Barth, the bank, and Hanna are first parties, and Watkins is the second party, recites the indebtedness to the first parties of Martin and Watkins, amounting to $21,000. only partially secured by subordinate mortgages; the purchase by the first parties of the prior mortgages and-collaterals held by Thurlow, Hutton &amp; Williams against Martin for $17,500, of which part is advanced by Watkins, so that there is due to the first party the sum of $35,437.22 in the aggregate; and the foreclosure and sale of certain of the collaterals and mortgaged premises so purchased, which were \u2018bought in by the first party,\u2019\u2014and then provides that the second party shall execute notes for $31.000, and pay in- cash $4,437.22, and for the conveyance thereupon by the first party to him of the property described. The second party is to make a trust deed to secure payment of his notes. Upon payment of the notes, all the collaterals described, including the notes of Martin, are to be transferred to the second party \u2018without recourse,\u2019 and the first mortgage upon the lands in question and notes therewith are enumerated to be thus transferred. It concludes as follows: \u2018All the above subject to all suits by said Martin against said property, or the payment of any of said notes; the proceeds, if any, to go to the credit of said Watkins.\u2019 On February 12, 1892, to carry out this contract, deeds of conveyance of the real estate on the part of the first parties, and the trust deed on the part of the second party, were executed, and both deposited in escrow with Mr. Heisler, an attorney, to be held by him \u2018until such time as the litigation over the property in said deeds mentioned shall be determined,\u2019 or the parties should otherwise direct. But the notes for $31,000 were delivered to the first parties \u2018as of full force,\u2019 and the cash provided for was paid over by the second party. In a letter from Mr. Hanna to the defendant, which is practically simultaneous with the contract, and refers to its transmission, it is remarked, \u2018We, of course, will defend the suits progressing.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-7\">\u201cThis contract, on Its face, is manifestly one of bargain and sale of the property and securities enumerated, and I am of opinion that no other interpretation of the final arrangement is admissible, in the light of all the testimony offered of pre-existing facts; that all were to be transferred and accepted in the status and subject to all conditions of rights and title as then existing, of which the defendant was at least equally advised, with no covenants of title otherwise, express or implied. So construed, the vendor was-bound to preserve existing rights to the extent of its means and power, and, when the conditions were fulfilled in conformity with the contract, was bound to perform with such rights unimpaired by any default or conduct on its part, unless excused by a sufficient release, or by acts or requirements on the part of the vendee which create an estoppel. Beyond this obligation, the doctrine of Van Rensselaer v. Kearney, 11 How. 297, 322, 13 B. Ed. 703, and other like cases cited on behalf of the defendant, is not deemed applicable; nor is the vendor in the position of a mere holder of collaterals, or of a stakeholder, as counsel for the plaintiff contends, and the rule of ordinary care and dili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>gence which obtains in such cases is not the test of liability for nonperformance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-4\">\u201cWith the contract relation thus held, the final question remains, which party in interest must be held responsible for and must bear the loss incurred through the subsequent proceedings in the name of the vendor for a foreclosure sale under the prior mortgage? This singular transaction resulted not only in the destruction of the vendor\u2019s previous title in fee to the valuable real estate involved in such sale, and included in the executory contract to the defendant, but in the loss as well, through unfortunate circumstances, of the sum secured by the mortgage,\u2014-$6,000 and over. The foreclosure sale occurred in April, 1892, under a proceeding by advertisement instituted by direction of Barth, one of the vendors and nominal assignee of the mortgage, and conducted by J. P. Heisler as attorney for the bank and its representatives. At the sale, however, the sheriff, who was appointed trustee for the purpose, acted in disobedience of the express directions of Mr. Heisler that he should not open or proceed with the sale under the notice, and later refused to recognize the bids made on behalf of the mortgagee, unless paid in cash, and finally deeded the property to a third party, whose bid was asserted to be the next best. Mr. Heisler had exclusive charge on the part of the bank, although the defendant and a local attorney were present and were fully informed on the day of the sale of his action throughout, namely, of his protests against and procedure with the sale, of his making bids over those offered, and other efforts to prevent adverse sale (not material for the present controversy), and of his eventual refusal to accept from the sheriff the amount tendered to cover the foreclosed mortgage, because he intended to repudiate the sale, and not to recognize it as valid for any purpose. Subsequently the bank instituted a suit to set aside the sale and conveyance, of which it is sufficient to remark that the defendant concurred in such action, employed counsel to aid in its prosecution, with the final result of a decision by the supreme court of the state upholding the sale; thus defeating the title which had become vested in the bank under the previous foreclosures, and depriving the defendant of a portion of the property included in.his contract, which exceeded in value the unpaid balance of his notes. Furthermore, the mortgage security involved in that sale was lost through the merger; and the proceeds of the sale, of which tender had been refused, being left, in the hands of the sheriff pending the litigation, were likewise lost through the subsequent insolvency and death of the sheriff, with no liability existing upon his official bond for a default of such nature. It should be observed, in passing, that the suits by Martin against the vendors, mentioned in the contract and in the-terms of the escrow, were dismissed upon a trial, and were out of the way of performance long before the conclusion of the litigation oyer the sale in question, but were pending at the date of such sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-5\">\u201cThe testimony discloses no substantial reason for the proceeding to foreclose the first mortgage, which gave rise to the serious complication of the title and eventual loss. So far as appears, no benefit could be derived from it, even if carried out unopposed. But for the purposes of this case the only inquiry is, who was the real mover and actor in the proceeding from which the loss ensued? No question is presented of negligence by either party in the subsequent contest. Each was represented by able counsel, working in harmony, and confident of saving the property from the ill-advised foreclosure-sale. Whichever of the contracting parties originated and carried on the unfortunate foreclosure proceedings must bear the resultant loss, represented, so far as concerns this case, by the unpaid balance of the purchase-money note in suit. The question is one of fact, and its solution is saved from difficulty by reason of the absence of direct testimony in point on the part of the-plaintiff, thus presenting no substantial conflict in the evidence. The mere fact that the foreclosure was instituted in the name of the vendor party is not the test, for it could not have proceeded otherwise; but the fact that Mr. Heisler, as attorney for the bank, acted solely upon the instructions from that source, without understanding that he was to act under directions of the defendant, as his testimony clearly shows, at least casts the burden of proof upon the plaintiff, if it does not so rest on the prima facie case of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u201cAn examination of the testimony of Mr. Barth and Mr. Hanna furnishes no support for the assertion that the defendant directed this move. No written or verbal communication on the part of the defendant to so proceed is specified, nor is any explanation given by either for it, aside from the mere general statements of the inferences of these interested witnesses,\u2014that it was \u2018for his benefit,\u2019 and in some instances stating it in the same general way as \u2018at his request,\u2019 but with no specification of even\u00bb the substance of his language. In the connection stated, the answers are not probative, and are clearly insufficient to charge the defendant with the responsibility, in the face of his direct testimony that he neither requested nor suggested such course, and that it was entirely the plan of Mr. Barth, as a countermove for the Martin suits, mentioned to the defendant in a general way, only, and not as a foreclosure proceeding. The fact of the defendant\u2019s presence at the foreclosure sale, and of Mr. Heisler\u2019s conferences with him and with the local attorney, and the further fact of his taking part in the suits to set aside the sale, by the employment of counsel, and otherwise manifesting his interest, cannot serve to charge the responsibility against him. Nor was the duty cast upon the defendant to decide, after the fact of sale, whether or not the suit should be abandoned, and the proceeds accepted in lieu of the real estate,\u2014certainly not upon the mere suggestion to that effect, stated by the witness Freeman in his testimony. I am of opinion, therefore, that the defendant is entitled to findings in his favor, and they may be prepared accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-4\">A voluminous bill of exceptions was filed, preserving many exceptions to supposed errors of the court in the admission and rejection of evidence, which need not be specifically stated, and are sufficiently referred to in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-5\">T.

The special finding of the statute should speak the ultimate facts on which the law must determine -the rights of the parties, and should not contain a_ statement'of the evidence from'which those facts are determined. It is immaterial whether the finding rests on oral testimony or upon written evidence, or in part upon one and in part upon the other. The finding of fact is conclusive upon the appellate court, which may not search the evidence to ascertain if the finding be warranted. We may only inquire whether error intervened in the admission or exclusion of testimony, which should work a reversal of the judgment, and whether the facts found support the judgment rendered. \u2019i..e courts have often spoken to this subject, and the question is no longer an open one. Wilson v. Trust Co., 183 U. S. 121, 22 Sup. Ct. 55, 46 L. Ed. 113; Distilling &amp; Cattle Co. v. Gottschalk Co., 13 C. C. A. 618, 66 Fed. 609; Insurance Co. v. International Trust Co., 17 C. C. A. 616, 71 Fed. 88; Minchen v. Hart, 18 C. C. A. 570, 72 Fed. 294; Jenks\u2019 Adm\u2019r v. Stapp, 9 U. S. App. 34, 3 C. C. A. 244, 52 Fed. 641; Corliss v. Pulaski Co. (C. C. A.) 116 Fed. 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">We pass the first exception without comment, because the record fails to disclose that the defendant in error presented any findings, or requested the court to adopt them, or that there was any refusal upon the part of the court with respect thereto. We say this without implying that the practice suggested is permissible, or that error may be assigned upon refusal of the court to find as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The second exception is to that portion of the third finding of fact which declares that the note was obtained by the plaintiff in error subject to any defense affecting the consideration, and that the plaintiff in error was not a bona fide holder for value, without notice. The objection urged is that this finding is a conclusion of law, and is not supported by the evidence. We are not warranted in looking into the evidence to ascertain if the finding be supported by it. The finding is not that of a conclusion of law. It is a finding of fact, dependent upon the circumstances under which the note was transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The third exception is to that part of the fifth finding of fact to the effect that the court found nothing in the conduct of the defendant touching the foreclosure of the first mortgage by Barth and the bank, and the ensuing litigation with Coler, to charge him with responsibility for the loss thereby incurred. That is also a conclusion of fact, rather than of law,\u2014a negative statement which finds as_ a fact that the defendant in error did not request or sanction the litigation in question. We may not review the evidence to ascertain whether that finding be warranted. It may, perhaps, be said of the findings that they embody evidence and inferences of fact in addition to the ultimate,facts upon which judgment must proceed; but that gives the appellate court no right of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The fourth exception goes to the conclusion of law that the defendant below was entitled to judgment of dismissal of the complaint, and this proceeds upon the theory that the facts found do not support the judgment. The issue presented, aside from the question whether the plaintiff in error held the note subject to equities, is whether the consideration of the note had failed. The court, by its fourth finding, stated the facts found with respect to the execution of the note and its .consideration. The court has not found as an ultimate fact that the consideration of the note was the agreement to convey the title to the land, but it does find that such was the purport of the agreement under which the note was executed. The finding seems to be that of the court\u2019s conclusion of the legal effect of the agreement of the parties. We have therefore sought to ascertain if the court below correctly held with respect to the legal effect of the agreement of January 20, 1892. The question is one not without difficulty, and has engaged our careful scrutiny. We have reached the conclusion that the court below was correct in. its finding. The reasoning of the opinion of the court below, which is- incorporated in the statement of facts, seems to us well founded, particularly in view of the fact found by the court that Barth owned the real estate and prior mortgages thereon, without promise or obligation on his part or on the part of the bank to sell or otherwise dispose thereof to\" the defendant. That being the condition of affairs at the time of the execution of the agreement of January 20, 1892, we think the court below was right in holding that the agreement was that of bargain and sale of the property and the securities mentioned, and that the subsequent failure of title through the conduct of Barth and the bank should not be visited upon the defendant in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">It is also urged that partial failure of consideration is not a good defense at law, the amount being unliquidated. This is the English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>rule, formerly followed in the United- States. Wentworth v. Goodwin, 21 Me. 150; Morrison v. Jewell, 34 Me. 146; Hogden v. Golder, 75 Me. 293; Drew v. Towle, 27 N. H. 412, 59 Am. Dec. 380; Riddle v. Gage, 37 N. H. 519, 75 Am. Dec. 151; Richardson v. Sanborn, 33 Vt. 75; Pulsifer v. Hotchkiss, 12 Conn. 234; Allen v. Bank, 20 N. J. Law, 620. But the rule is now otherwise, and the cases referred to in Connecticut and New Jersey have been in express terms overruled by the courts of those states. Avery v. Brown, 31 Conn. 398; Bouker v. Randles, 31 N. J. Law, 335; Wyckoff v. Runyon, 33 N. J. Law, 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">We have scrutinized the many assignments of error relating to the admission and rejection of evidence at the trial. Many of them are merely formal; some going to the order of proof, some to the striking out of testimony which was mere conclusion of witnesses. We find none of them of sufficient moment to consider at length, and none of them availing to a reversal of the judgment. If any of the rulings may be considered as technical and erroneous, it is clear that the errors-charged, if such there were, could not have prejudiced and did not prejudice, and ought not to work a reversal.
