The defense was that no such contract had been made; that the defendant\u2019s negotiations with the plaintiff were not for a purchase by the defendant himself, but related wholly to his employment, as agent of the plaintiff, to make sales to others for its account. The parties .had had a correspondence, and also some oral communications, during a period extending from December, 1899, to June, 1900; and to maintain its allegation that the defendant had bought yarn from it, which he afterwards refused to accept, the plaintiff relied upon only a part of that correspondence, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzJ\">\u201cMarch 21st, 1900.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-16\">\u201cMr. Osear D.

As the delivery on these goods is quite some distance off yet, my customer prefers waiting to give me the descriptions until you are about ready to begin shipments, so as to avoid changes, if possible. Prom our conversation when I was at your place last, I presume that yon will confine the handling of your entire production to me from the date deliveries begin on my orders, so long as everything is satisfactory. Would kindly ask you to reply to this by return mail, so that I may know how to act in selling your yarns, and that I may know that none of my competitors will be able to offer your yarns to the same people, thereby avoiding an unnecessary and unwholesome competition. Being assured of this by you, it will enable me to hold firm at full market value, and also bar the trade here informing me that they can buy the same yarns from my competitors for less money. Hoping to hear from you favorably, and that this order is the forerunner of many more, I remain,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-20\">\u201cYours very respectfully,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANq\">Oscar D.

Loeb, Philadelphia, Pa.\u2014Dear Sir: Replying to your inquiry of March 28th, will say that we are not prepared to turn over our account in full to you. That will depend upon later developments, which we cannot foresee. We are giving you a trial, which, if it proves satisfactory, may lead to further business with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-24\">\u201cYours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV9\">Elizabeth City Cotton Mills,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-25\">\u201cApril 9, 1900.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-26\">\u201cMessrs. Elizabeth City Cotton Mills, Elizabeth City, N. C.\u2014Gentlemen: Your favor of 3rd instant to hand, and contents noted. Replying to same, would say that it is not satisfactory, and, as you will not guaranty me your production, I withdraw my order as same was given you with the understanding based upon our recent conversation at your place, when you told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>me that you would confine your production to one house only, and 1 cannot afford to handle it under any other conditions, and take the chances that I have taken in paying you the fullest prices for yarns on a declining market, with the possibility of receiving no more yarns from you, and, if so, only a part of same, and the balance of your production coming in competition with itself by its sale through my competitors. I am sorry that my first attempt in this matter should turn out this way, but I assure you that there was no other object in my going to all the trouble that I have gone to, except for the reasons above. Under your conditions, you place yourself in the same state as most other mills with whom I am doing business, and with whom I would not place orders for future delivery at these prices, and take such chances, unless with the object in view as above stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">\u201cYours very respectfully,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADC\">Oscar D.

Elizabeth City Cotton Mills, Elizabeth City, N.

L.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APf\">Even if this part of the correspondence were alone to be considered, it would not clearly appear that the relation of seller and buyer was intended to be created, for- it includes several expressions (see especially the letters of March 22, 1900, and April 3, 1900) which, upon the assumption of such intent, would seem to be palpably incongruous, but which, with reference to the establishment of the relation of principal and sales agent, are plainly pertinent and quite intelligible. Yet the court below was asked to exclude all the letters-prior to that of March 21, 1900, as well as the contemporaneous conversations of the parties, and to hold that a contract of sale was conclusively shown by this ambiguous and arbitrarily selected portion of the continuous and connected correspondence. We are of opinion that the learned judge was clearly right in declining to do-this, and in receiving and submitting to the jury the correspondence and conversations as an entirety. The question was as to the true nature of the transaction which the parties had had under consideration, and, for the correct determination of that question, it was essential that all that had passed between them upon the subject should be known. The letters, and the conversations to which they presumably related or expressly referred, were therefore, rightly admitted, and, being both admitted, their effect as a whole was properly left to the jury; and we may add that, in our judgment, its verdict for the defendant was the only one which could reasonably have been: rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
