Afterwards, but before the case was heard in the circuit court of appeals, Act June 27, 1898 [U. S. Comp.

Afterwards Act Feb. 26, 1900 [U. S. Comp.

MeCrory, Complainant, v. The United States, Defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b898-10\">(No. 52.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b898-11\">\u201cIt is hereby agreed by and between counsel for complainant and defendant in the above-stated cause that the amount herein sought to be recovered from the defendant arose under the following state of-facts, viz.: That the complainant was from the 1st day of December, 1894, to the 1st day of February, 1896, a duly appointed and acting letter carrier in the employment of the United States (defendant) as such at the Birmingham, Alabama, post office, in the city of Birmingham, Alabama, at a salary of $600.00 per annum. That his salary was on the 1st day of February, 1896, increased to the sum of $850.00 per annum, and that the complainant continued in the employment of the defendant as such letter carrier at said salary of $850.00 from the 1st day of February, 1896, to the 1st day of January, 1897. That during the aforesaid period from the 1st day of December, 1894, to the 1st day of February, 1896, while the complainant was receiving from the defendant a salary of $600.00 per annum, there were daily intervals between the complainant\u2019s daily trips in collecting an.d delivering the United States mail in the city of Birmingham, varying in duration, but which in the aggregate amounted to 425 hours, at 20% cents per hour. That during the aforesaid period from the 1st day of February, 1896, to the 1st day of January, 1897, while the complainant was receiving from the defendant a salary of $850.00 per annum as - such letter carrier, the complainant had similar intervals daily between his said daily trips in collecting and distributing the United States mail in the city of Birmingham, Alabama, which in the aggregate amounted to 567 hours and ten minutes, at 29 ^\u00a1\u00a1.i cents per hour. That the said intervals between said daily trips were \"in number from two to three hours per day, and varied in duration as aforesaid from 30 minutes to 2% hours, according as the amount of mail for collection and distribution was large or small. That these idle intervals were exclusive and in excess of the 8 hours of actual and'active service which the complainant performed as such letter carrier daily for the defendant. That during the said intervals the complainant was by the rules of the post office department excluded from the post office, but was under the control and direction of the postmaster to the extent that the post master had the right, power, and authority to summon the complainant to duty at any time during any of said intervals and send him out again col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>lecting or delivering mail, or assign him to any other duty within the range and line of his employment as such letter carrier. That during such intervals complainant was not required by the postmaster or any rule or r\u00e9gulation of the post office department to keep on his uniform, and could keep it on or discard it as he might desire, but that while on duty he was required to wear his said uniform. That, by reason of the said right, power, and authority of the postmaster to summon the complainant to duty at any time during any of said intervals, the complainant was prevented and prohibited from obtaining or accepting other employment during such intervals except such employment as should be subject and second to the right, power, and authority of the postmaster to at any time so summon the complainant to duty during any and all of said intervals, and the complainant could hot and did not obtain other employment. That the complainant did not actually do or perform any work or service for the defendant during any of the intervals which makes the aggregates aforesaid, but was subject during all of said intervals to be summoned by the postmaster to duty as aforesaid within the line of his employment as such letter carrier, but was under the control and direction of the postmaster during said intervals as aforesaid. That, in computing the aggregate of said intervals aforesaid, the daily dinner hour from 12 to 1 o\u2019clock p. m. is not included. It is further agreed that this statement of facts may be taken and considered by the court as the facts in each of the other 18 cases now pending seeking a similar recovery of the defendant, except as to the amount involved in each, respectively, and the court may in each of said cases pronounce its findings, conclusion, and judgment accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b899-4\">The trial judge found the facts to be as set forth in the foregoing agreement, and from that finding concluded that the petitioner was entitled by law to a judgment for the recovery of the amount claimed by him, and rendered judgment accordingly. From this judgment in due season the United States sued out a writ of error on February 28, 1898, and the transcript was filed in this court April 12, 1898. Before the case was heard on this writ, congress passed an act entitled \u201cAn act to amend sections 1 and 2 of the act of March 3, 1887,\u201d approved .Tune 27, 1898 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 752], wherein the jurisdiction of the district and circuit courts to entertain suits against the United States, on the part of the officers of the United States, to recover fees for services rendered, was taken away; and thereupon, on motion of the defendant in error, the writ of error pending in this case was abated. See U. S. v. McCrory, 33 C. C. A. 515, 91 Fed. 295. Subsequently congress passed the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b899-5\">\u201cAn act for the relief of claimants having suits against the United States pending in the circuit and district courts of the United States affected by the act of June twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, amending the act of March third, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b899-6\">\u201cBe it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the United States of America in congress assembled, that no suit shall abate or be affected by the act of June twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, entitled \u2018An act to amend sections one and two of the act of March third, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven,\u2019 which was pending in any circuit court of appeals, circuit or district court of the United States at the time of the passage of said act; and all such suits which have been dismissed by reason of said act shall be restored to their places in such courts and proceeded with as if the same had not been enacted; and time within which an appeal or writ of error may be taken or prosecuted in any case affected by this act is hereby extended six months from the passage hereof.\u201d Approved February 26, 1900 [U.

U. S. v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358-386, 2 L. Ed. 304; Railroad Co. v. Thomas, 132 U. S. 174, 188, 10 Sup. Ct. 68, 33 L. Ed. 302. The ambiguity must be in the context, and not in the title, to render the latter of any avail.\u201d U. S. v. Oregon &amp; C. R. Co., 164 U. S. 526, 541, 17 Sup. Ct. 165, 41 L. Ed. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">The act of congress of February 26, 1900, is neither of doubtful nor ambiguous meaning, but in plain terms provides that all suits pending in any circuit court of appeals, circuit or district court of the United States, on June 27, 1898, which have been dismissed by reason of the act of congress approved June 27, 1898 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 752] entitled \u201cAn act to amend sections one and two of the act of March 3, 1887,\u201d shall be restored to their places in such courts and proceeded with as if the said law had not been enacted; and it further extends the time within which an appeal or writ of error may be prosecuted by the said act to six months from the passage thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">This act plainly includes the present suit. All the proceedings under the act of March 3, 1887 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 752], and amendatory acts, are permissive, and in the main intended to advise the congress. The practice thereunder is exceptional, and the judgments and decrees rendered are not executory. When such judgments and decrees are adverse to the United States and are final in the courts, the attorney general reports them to congress for such action as it sees fit to take. It seems, therefore, that it is not worth while to consider whether the act of February 26, 1900, impairs vested rights or is otherwise unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">The motion to strike the case from the docket is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">On the merits, the case is identical with that of U. S. v. Langston, heretofore decided by this court (29 C. C. A. 379, 85 Fed. 613), except in respect to these findings of fact, which were not in the Langston Case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>\u201cThat during said intervals the complainant was by the rules of the post office department excluded from the post office, but was under the control and direction of the postmaster to the extent that the postmaster had the right, power, and authority to summon the complainant to duty at any time during any of said intervals, and send him out again collecting or delivering mail, or assign him to any other duty within the range and line of his employment as such letter carrier. That, by reason of the said right, power, and authority of the postmaster to summon the complainant to duty at any time during any of said intervals, the complainant was prevented and prohibited from obtaining or accepting other employment during such intervals, except such employment as should be subject and second to the right, power, and authority of the postmaster to at any time so summon the complainant to duty during any and all of said intervals, and the complainant could not and did not obtain other employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">The act under which the petitioner in this case claims extra pay distinctly grants such extra pay only in case the letter carrier is employed during the extra time for which he claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The facts as found by the trial judge clearly show that, during the \u201cidle\u201d intervals for which petitioner claims he was not employed in his duties as a letter carrier, he was not required to wear his uniform; he was not required to stay in any particular place; he was doing nothing but waiting, and waiting to be employed. The fact that during the time he was so waiting to be employed the postmaster could have summoned him to duty tends strongly to show that during such interval he was not employed, and not at all that he was employed. The fact that during the time he was so waiting he could not and did not obtain other employment may raise an equity in his favor, but in no wise proves that during the intervals for which he claims pay he was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Under the finding of facts, it seems perfectly clear that during the \u201cidle\u201d intervals, as styled in the finding of facts, the petitioner was not employed in his duties as a letter carrier. If he was not' so employed, then'he has no right to recover under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">For these reasons and others given in U. S. v. Langston, supra, the judgment of the district court is reversed, and the cause is remanded, with instructions to dismiss the suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
