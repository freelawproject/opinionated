And ten years were allowed for completion of the bridge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-10\">That, by an act of Virginia of 1836, certain facilities for the reorganization of the said company were conferred, and the time, by-consent of Ohio, extended ten years longer; that this \u00bfompany constructed a bridge from Zane\u2019s Island to the Ohio, or western shore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-11\">That on the 14th of March, 1847, the Legislature of Virginia passed an act reviving and continuing certain parts of the\" former acts, and providing for the reorganization of the corporation \u201cwith power to erect and keep a.wire suspension\u2022 toll-bridge eh and from Zahe\u2019s Island' to and up\u00f3la the main Virginia shore or bank at the city of Wheeling.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>That this act had the following proviso: \u2014- \u201c That if the said hr dge shall be so erected as to obstruct the navigation of the Ohio River in the usual manner, by such steamboats and other crafts as are now accustomed to navigate- the same, when the river shall be as high as the highest flood therein heretofore known, then, unless, up'on such obstruction being found- to exist, such obstruction shall be immediately removed or remedied, the said last-mentioned bridge may be treated as a public nuisance, and abated accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-5\">That .respondents were organized under this act in May, 1847, and an engineer appointed in July, 1847, who reported a. plan, which was published and extensively, circulated, -and made contracts for its erection in September, 1847.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-6\">That the elevation of the bridge at the highest point over the channel is over 934 feet above low-water surface.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-7\">That for eighteen months past it has been \u201c steadily and notoriously-progressed with\u201d ; that the persons at whose suggestion these proceedings are instituted must have known it, and yet, while all this expensive work was being done, no objections were made, but the work' quietly permitted to progress until nearly the whole cost of the bridge was expended, the first wires drawn over, and the bridge on the eve of completion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-8\">The arfswer insists on the following grounds of objection to the proceedings: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-9\">1st. That if the evils imputed to this bridge were true, the persons injured might' have remedy in the courts of.

The defendants admit that the citizens of Pennsylvania,, in common with the citizens of the whole United States, are entitled to the use of the Ohio as a. common or public highway, but claim that their bridge is not an obstruction, and is. itself a connecting line of a great public highway, as important,as a means of intercommunication, as the navigation of the-Ohio, and <em>\u201c </em>claim the principle of concession and compromise, which enters so largely into the structure of our government.\u201d That -this bridge will be very beneficial to the people of the neighbouring States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-12\">4th.\" That the State of Pennsylvania herself has. set the example of authorizing bridges to be constructed across this stream no higher .than this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>5th. That the report of certain, engineers of the United States to Congress, in 1848, recommended a wire bridge, and gave as their opinion, that \u201c by an elevation of ninety feet every imaginable danger of obstructing or endangering the navigation would be avoided.\u201d Also, that certain reports of committees in Congress recognized the necessity, of a bridge at Wheeling, and recommended an appropriation, stating that a. bridge can be erected that will not offer the slightest obstruction to the navigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-5\">6th. That the objections to the bridge are only to the insufficiency of headway for steamboats, and they aver that the headway left is amply sufficient; that the highest usual rise of the river Ohio does not exceed thirty-eight and a half feet, but will not average thirty-five feet for spring floods, nor much exceed twenty-nine feet; that the flood of 1832 was an extraordinary flood, which rose forty-four and a half feet above low water at Wheeling, on the 11th of February, 1832 ; that landings and warehouses were under water, and the river too high for navigation, or, if navigated, that .boats might have passed over Zane\u2019s Island.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-6\">7th. That for all useful purposes the pipes of steamboats need not exceed forty-seven feet above the water, and if the draft should not be sufficient at that height, that blowers might be added.. That chimneys might have hinges on them, so that they could be lowered without much inconvenience. That the bridge over the canal at Louisville does not give a headway of over fifty-six feet, and chimneys of greater height usually have hinges to. accommodate themselves to it, and steamboats made with high chimneys and without hinges should conform, <em>\u201c </em>because the height of chimneys of steamboats above a certain limit involves secondary considerations of contingent and relative expediency or convenience, rather than such as are of absolute importance or necessity in connection with the material or indispensable purposes of navigation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-7\">8th. That the bridge will not be an appreciable inconvenience to boats of the average class, whose height, they aver, will not average over fifty-two feet, and not sixty-five feet, as stated in the bill; but it is admitted that there are boats whose chimneys are of greater height, which is asserted to be unnecessary; or, if necessary, they should be provided with hinges ; that these high chimneys have been but lately brought into use, are of \u201c extravagant and unnecessary \u201d. height, and \u201c got up \u201d by commercial rivals, who promote these proceedings <em>\u201c </em>in the name of a sovereign State, to destroy a useful and necessary work.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>9th and lastly. That the bridge will not diminish or destroy trade between Pittsburg and other ports, or do irreparable injury to the citizens of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-5\">Affidavits were also read to support the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-6\">After argument by counsel, Mr. Justice Grier delivered an opinion, which concluded ^s follows : \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-7\">\u201c The application of the principles I have stated to the facts of this case will result in refusing, without prejudice, an injunction before the sitting of the Supreme Court, for the following reasons\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-8\">\u201c 1st. Because the question <em>pf </em>the plaintiffs right to prosecute this is new, and involves the jurisdiction of the court.

The injury threatened is- not imminent and certain, but contingent. It may or may hot happen before the final hearing of this cause, or before this application may be renewed before the court. In the mean while, this cause may be brought to a final hearing, the cause being now at issue, and having preference on the list. And- on the first Monday of December next the plaintiff Will have an opportunity of moving the court for an injunction on the bill and answer, when the question of jurisdiction can be finally decided. Nor is there any evidence to justify the supposition, that in the mean time the ihcome of the Pennsylvania improvements will be materially affected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-10\"><em>\u201c </em>3d, The injury will not be irremediable if any should occur; as the owner of every boat which may' be' hindered or delayed in the mean time from passing along the river by this obstruction will have a clear - remedy at law, to recover damages against the company and the individuals engaged in its erection.

This second supplemental bill averred that .the defendants had erected their bridge over the channel of the Ohio in such a manner as to hinder, and obstruct, and prevent the passage of steamboats, owned- and navigated by citizens of Pennsylvania, to and from her ports, over and along said river, and from passing from Pittsburg to other ports in Ohio and Kentucky below said bridge. It charges, that on the 10th day of November, 1849, the steamboat Messenger', owned and navigated by citizens of Pennsylvania, engaged in the carrying trade between Pitts-burg, a port of entry in Pennsylvania, and Cincinnati, a port of entry in Ohio, and intermediate ports, duly licensed, equipped, and enrolled according to the acts of Congress, cleared from the said port of Pittsburg with a large cargo of freight and pas-, sengers for the port of Cincinnati and other intermediate ports, and while on her voyage along the channel of said river, On the night of the 10th of November, at a usual stage of water, to wit, twenty-one feet, was hindered and obstructed from passing along said channel, and obliged to stop by reason of said bridge, and with great trouble and danger to the officers and crew, and expense and loss of time to her owners, was compelled to have seven and a half feet of her chimneys cut off in order to pass said bridge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-8\">It is further alleged that the Hibernia, another boat ow\u2122ed arid navigated by citizens of Pennsylvania, on a voyage from Cincinnati to Pittsburg, on the 11th day of November, 1849,. was hindered by skid bridge from prosecuting her voyage, and obliged to stop at Wheeling, a port of entry in Virginia, and there discharge her passengers and cargo: \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-9\">The bill further charges, that, since the filing of said original bill, sundry, citizens of Pennsylvania have contracted for, and are engaged in, the construction of ships and sea-going vessels, \u2022 to be propelled by wind- and steam, and desire to continue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>said business. That the building of such vessels is . a profitable branch of business, and that any obstruction to the navigation of the Ohio River at high stages of water will interfere with and destroy said branch of business, and prove alike detrimental to the revenues of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to the interests of her citizens. It is further charged, that the Wheeling Bridge will produce this result, and practically give a preference to the port of Wheeling and other ports, lower down the river, to the great injury of the citizens' and State of Pennsylvania. The plaintiff, therefore, prays that the defendants may be enjoined from keeping said bridge across said river, and be required to abate the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-5\">On the 2d\u2019of February, 1850, the defendants filed their answer to the second supplemental bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AI0\">It stated,\u2019 <em>\u201c </em>that, since the filing of their former answers, in this case, the Legislature of the State of Virginia have passed an actamendatory and explanatory of the various acts which had been previously passed by that body, (and which taken together constituted the charter under which your respondents erected their' .bridge,) and more particularly of the fourteenth section of the act passed March 19, 1847.

It is his opinion, that the case is not presented to this court between such parties in interest as can give jurisdiction to this court. The only legitimate. ground of jurisdiction in this case, under the Constitution, would be the fact of such a direct interest or right on the part of Pennsylvania as a State as would authorize her to become a party in this controversy. The interest of the State of Pennsylvania in this case, if indeed any such is shown, is that which she may have in the competition which may or which does exist between works of public improvement \u2019erected by herself, and rival works erected by other States within their own territory. No direct interest on the part of the State of Pennsylvania is shown in the vessels or steamboats which navigate the rivers Ohio and Mississippi, nor in any question connected with the rights of that State separate and apart from the individual interests of the owners of steamboats, or other private citizens of the State of Pennsylvania. Again, the. question of nuisance or. ho nuisance is one proper for the cognizance of a court of law, to be determined by a jury upon the testimony of witnesses confronted and cross-examined before a jury in open court, and under its supervision. In this view of the question, it would seem to be irregular to determine it upon affidavits and by a court of equity, and without the interposition of a'jury, and in the absence of the witnesses. The \u2022 order now made in. this cause seeming to lead to the latter mode of settling the question of nuisance, it is therefore hereby formally objected' to.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
