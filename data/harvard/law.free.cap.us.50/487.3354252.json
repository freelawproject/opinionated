That the fact being known to Mr. Barry, the Postmaster-General, that the Bank of Maryland had failed, and that the Union Bank held the certificates given to the former by the Post-Office Department, and that the certificate to Brown given by the Bank of Maryland was for his private account, he had no lawful authority to assume and pay the same to Brown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-24\">2.

The services rendered by Mr. Brown, and for which he claimed this compensation, were not such as were ordinarily attached to the duties of the office held by him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-6\">2.

He further gave testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>mony tending to show that no loans were- ever made and negotiated by or for the use of the Department, except during the period when Major Barry held the office of Postmaster-General, and that no other officer or clerk attached to the General Post-Office had ever been employed in the negotiation of any loans for the use of said Department; that during the same period of time another person, viz. Samuel L. Governeur, then postmaster at New York, was, in,like manner, employed to negotiate similar loans for the use of said Department, as a srecial agent; that loans Were thus negotiated by said Governeur, as such special agent, sometimes at a very high premium, on ohe oeeacasion paying for the same at the. rate of three per cent, per month, besides collateral advantages to the lender ; that for the loans thus negotiated by said Governeur he claimed and was allowed five per cent, commission when he lent his own personal responsibility, and two and a half per cent, when he incurred no responsibility ;

that the general outline of his duties is stated in the published rules and regulations of March 4, 1833, issued by the Postmaster-General, but there were other minor duties for -which there were verbal directions; that the disbursements of the contingent expenses of the Department, and the settlement of accounts therefor at the Treasury, down to the year 1815, had been by the Postmaster-General, and since that year by officers of the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ment assigned to that duty in addition to their other duties j that the defendant was disbursing agent from 1829 to some tiine in February, 1835, and as such settled quarterly accounts of his agency at the <em>Treasury; </em>that <em>no </em>allowance had ever <em>been made </em>for such services beyond the stated salaries of the officers, and none had been asked for by any officer except by the defendant, long after he had settled his accounts, and had retired from office ; that before, and during, and ever since the years 1833 and 1834, in which said loans were negotiated by defendant, it was the frequent usage of the Department for the Postmaster-General to send its officers to points of the country distant from the office, on special business connected with their respective branches of the \u00a1service, and they had never claimed or been allowed any compensation therefor, except their actual expenses, in addition' to their stated salaries, which continued to run on during their absence, and that no distinction was known or recognized in this respect between the financial and. other divisions of the department; that during his treasurership the defendant had made, no claim for commissions on the loans aforesaid made by him; that his predecessor in charge of the. financial department was the First Assistant Postmaster-General/: who held the office during several years, down to March, 1843, and during that time, by direction of the Postmaster-General, negotiated with distant banks for permission to make two overdrafts, of $ 50,000 each, for which interest was to be allowed, and which were to be repaid by deposits of the revenues of the Department, as collected; that he rendered these services, as essential portions of his duties, under charge of the fins\u00ednci\u00e1l division of the Department, and never expected to receive any compensation therefor beyond his regular salary <em>i </em>that no other loans are known'to have been negotiated by the Department, nor are commissions known to have been allowed to officers of the Department for any special services rendered by them for the <em>Department; </em>and further offered evidence to prove, that in the Treasury Department the contingent expenses and salaries of officers, amounting to the monthly sum of $ 70,000, were always disbursed by officers of the Treasury assigned to the duty, in addition to their ordinary duties, without any charge or claim of extra compensation; and that officers of this Department were sent on missions to New York connected with public loans, and were never allowed any compensation beyond their expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u201c And the defendant further gave evidence tending to prove, that the arrangement made for the overdrawing of the $ 50,000, made by the First Assistant Postmaster-General, was performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>through the instrumentality of an agent in New York, acting under instructions from said assistant; that it was not regarded as a loan, but as an agreement, upon the promise of regular de-' posits, sometimes leaving large balances in favor of the government to meet and pay the drafts of the Department, in case no funds belonging to it were at the time in deposit', to the extent of $ 50,000; that the defendant had made similar arrangements for the Department with other banks, at different times, to the amount of $ 500,000, and had never claimed compensation- for this as an extra service, or received any such compensation therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u201c Upon the whole of the evidence, so given by the parties respectively, the counsel for the United States prayed the court to instruct the jury as follows, viz.: \u2014 That on the whole of said evidence, if believed by the jury; the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the said sum of $ 2,500, and that defendant is not entitled to set off against that item any value of his services in negotiating said loans, or for the disbursement of the contingent fund-, as claimed by him in his said account. To the giving of which instruction, the defendant, by his counsel, objected, but the court overruled the objection, and gave the instruction as prayed ; to which ruling of the court the defendant excepted/\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The inquiries arising upon this record involve, to some extent, an examination of the powers and duties of the Postmaster-General in the administration of his office, and embrace also a construction of the seventeenth section of the statute of June 2, 1835, with respect to the directions to the Postmaster-General to prosecute for' any of the delinquencies or misfeasances enumerated in that section; they imply, moreover, an examination on the part of this court as to how far the acts of the defendant helow, as characterized by the proofs on the record, fall within either category of a payment- out of the funds of the Post-Office Department under pretence of services which have not been performed, \u2014 or of an allowance for services actually performed, exceeding the compensation permitted by law, \u2014 or of money paid over to a person in consequence of fraudulent representations, \u2014 or by mistake, or collusion, or misconduct of any officer or clerk of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Without undertaking, in the solution of these inquiries, to define with perfect exactness the powers of the Postmaster-General, or-to deny or affirm any implied general power in that-officer to make loans on the credit or responsibility of the government, we think it may be safely assumed that such a power, if vested in that officer, must be limited to acts inseparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>from the exigencies of the Department over which he presides; acts necessarily incident to its regular, legitimate operations. It never can be extended to a right in the Postmaster-General, at his discretion, to contract loans, or-to borrow money upon mere calculations of contingent or speculative advantage to the Department; much less can it embrace the, right in this officer to deal <em>ad libitum </em>in stocks, or bonds, or evidences of debt, or in certificates of deposit, either with corporations or individuals, when these subjects of traffic can in no wise be connected with the necessary or beneficial operations of the Department, n\u00f3r can, indeed, be in any sense connected with'that Department, except to render the latter a guarantee for the profit of others, with whom such transactions may take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Under' the principles here assumed, and which are deemed by this court to be undeniable, let us look more nearly at\u2018 this payment of $ 2,088.61, .made by order of the Postmaster-General, to the - defendant, and at the circumstances under which it was made, in order to ascertain how far such payment, and the retention of the amount, by the defendant, are warranted by these principles. . It should here be borne in mind, that for some time previously, and to a period of nearly eleven months after the failure of the' Bank of Maryland, the defendant was not only the chief clerk, but the treasurer, of the Post-Office Department. He was, therefore, necessarily acquainted, not only with the internal details of the Department; and clothed with the control of its pecuniary operations, but was also acquainted, with the condition and character of those from whom loans- to the Department were obtained; indeed, he assumes much credit to' himself for this knowledge, and his acts .based upon it, and makes them in part the foundation of his claim for commissions on the moneys he had negotiated. But in addition to this implication, it is stated in the proofs that the Post-Office Department was informed, in March, 1834, of the failure of the Bank of Maryland-; and that as early as. the 8th of April following, both the Department and the defendant were notified, of the assignment to the Union Bank of the Post-Office certificates for $ 50,000. However possible it may be, that the. head of the Department remained individually ignorant of the several occurrences above mentioned, they warrant a fair, nay, a necessary, legal conclusion to affect him with every consequence deducible from facts which it was within the range of his duty to know. But whatever suppositions may be indulged with respect to the head of the Department, they cannot avert from the defendant the consequences of acts notoriously, designedly, and personally performed by himself. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Thus situated, \u2014 under these striking facts and circumstances, \u2014 being still the chief clerk and treasurer of the Department, with full knowledge of the failure of the Bank of Maryland, and of the transfer to the Union Bank of the certificates of debt for $50,000, the defendant himself withdraws his depreciated certificate of deposit from the insolvent Bank of Maryland, and on th\u00e9-9th day of September, 1834, more than five-months after the failure of .that bank, transfers it, with the interest-which had accrued thereon, to the Post-Office Department at par. It is true he does not sign the order for the payment to himself, for he had a few days previously withdrawn from his situation in- the Department, but he obtained from the Postmaster-General a requisition on the acting treasurer of the Department for payment, and obtained on the 19th of February, 1835, a check from that acting treasurer for the amount of his depreciated certificate, with the interest thereon, at par, and received payment at that rate. Upon considering the position laid down by the Circuit Court, that this transaction was within . the scope of the official authority of the Postmaster-General, we are'irresistibly led to' inquire, What could have been its'object ? Could this possibly have been to improve the credit or to\u25a0 facilitate the operations of the Department? If so, how could either of these ends be promoted by wasting the money of the government, that.it might become the holder of a claim upon a notoriously insolvent corporation? Could the objeci have been to possess a set-oif \u25a0 against the claims held by the Union Bank ? If' so, then surely the defendant should have, been allowed nothing beyond the value of the certificate procured from him, and that was literally nothing. If we could impute to the head, of the Department the design to f\u00e1vor a subaltern in office, this too would be equally irregular and inadmissible with either of the-solutions above.suggested. In no view of this transaction have we been able to regard it as falling within the scope of the Postmaster-General\u2019s authority. On the contrary, it has appeared to us as illegal and irregular, and, so far as the head of the Department was concerned, as perhaps flowing either from want of information, or from the absence of -vigilant personal supervision of the details of office, and of the conduct of inferior agents. But whatever may be the true explanation of the course of the Postmaster-General, that explanation can have no bearing in justification of the conduct of the defendant, or in support of his' pretension to withhold from the government the amount paid for his certificate. As the immediate actor throughout this transaction, giving it form and direction in all its progress, he could not but know the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>right in which he held the certificate of deposit in the Bank of Maryland. He could not but know the failure of that bank, and the consequent worthlessness of the certificate held by, him, and the injustice and fraud of the contrivance by which he palmed that certificate upon the government, and obtained thereby the amount of it atJpar. In this view of the transaction, we consider the payment to the defendant of the sum of $ 2,088.61, by direction of the Postmaster-General, as illegal and void, and' the case of .the defendant as coming regularly within the meaning of the provision, which is mandatory in directing proceedings like the present for the recovery of moneys of the Department that have \u2022 been paid over to any person in consequence of fraudulent representations, or by mistake or misconduct of any officer'or clerk of the Department, and therefore as rendering the defendant liable to refund the amount so paid to him, with interest thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In the decision of the Circuit Court upon the prayer to the second bill of exceptions, sealed at the instance of the defendant below, this court can perceive no error. Upon adverting to the printed rules and regulations for the government .of the Post-Office Department adopted on the 4th of March, 1833, and referred to in the defendant\u2019s exception, we find in the eighth rule the following provision: \u2014 \u201c The third division will be. that of finance, under thfe superintendence of the chief clerk, Obadiah B. Brown, who shall be treasurer of the Department. There shall be under his control the book-keeper\u2019s, the solicitor\u2019s office, and the pay office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The language of this rule, if standing singly, must be understood as ' efficiently comprehensive to embrace every thing relating to finance, \u2014 to the fiscal concerns of the Department; and it must be perceived, too, that all the functions and duties comprehended within this rule are attached to the office of chief clerk. It is as chief clerk, and by virtue of his office of chief clerk, that the entire subject of finance and financial \u00e1dininistration is devolved on him. . The only singularity marking this arrangement is the fact of its associating the powers and .duties created byfit peculiarly with this defendant individually, by declaring that the division of finance shall.be under the su-, perintendence of the chief clerk, O. B. Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">But beyond this general provision, contained in rule eighth of the Post-Office regulations, it will be found on examination that the whole' of the remaining rules; extending to number twenty-four, are made- up of a detail of duties to be performed with, respect to receipts, deposits of money, payments and disbursements, by this treasurer, so constituted in virtue of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>office of chief clerk; for which last office he received a stated salary. By what course of reasoning, then, it could be shown that the peculiar or appropriate duties of this \u25a0 officer were not his duties, but were performed by him in lieu of some other agent, and became, therefore,' the foundation for extra.compensation, this court are unable to comprehend. Some instances of extra compensation allowed at the Department have been adduced in support of the claim of the defendant to commissions in this case, and several authorities have been cited from this court, which' are supposed to tend to its establishment. With respect to the former, this court- cannot consider them as entitled to the smallest weight; we feel bound to regard them as wholly irregular, and as. examples rather to be censured and shunned, than as precedents to be approved and followed. Between the cases' of The United States <em>v. </em>Ripey, of The United States <em>v. </em>Macdaniel, of the. same <em>v. </em>Fillebrown, relied on for the defendant, and that now before us, we can discern an obvious distinction. Without undertaking- here, to discuss the force of. those decisions as autbvity upon this question, we may safely say that they were commended to the judgment of this court by the conviction that they were founded on services which appertained not to the regular official stations and duties of the claimants, \u2014 services, too, actually performed, and untinged by any hue or shade r of contrivance or <em>mala jfides, </em>and really beneficial in their character to those for whom they were performed. We deem- it unnecessary further particularly to contrast. those claims with that of the defendant in the case before us. But whatever may have been understood to be decided, or whatever may in- truth have been decided, by the cases above mentioned, the principles established by this court in the decisions of Gratiot <em>v. </em>The United States, 4 Howard, 80, and of The United States <em>v. </em>Buchanan, decided, during the' present term of this court, we consider as- furnishing the true rule as to allowances for extra services ; by that rule, we conceive that the pretension of the defendant to commissions on loans, as set forth in the proceedings in this case, must be utterly condemned. This court, therefore, approving of so much of the decision of the Circuit Court as disallowed those commissions, do hereby adjudge that the writ of error of the defendant below to this decision be dismissed-; and disapproving as erroneous so much of the judgment of the Circuit Court as authorizes the said defendant to claim against the United States the amount of the certificate of deposit from the Bank of Maryland transferred by him to the Post-Office Department, we hereby adjudge and order, that this judgment be reversed, and that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>cause be remanded to the Circuit Court, to be proceeded in conformably with the principles herein above declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the County of Washington, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit Court, with directions to award a <em>venire facias de novo, </em>and for such further proceedings to be had therein as may be in conformity to the opinion.of this court, and as to law and justice may appertain.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
