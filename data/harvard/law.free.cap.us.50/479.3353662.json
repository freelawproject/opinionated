The defendant, on the contrary thereof, insisted and claimed that said levy and sale did not embrace or contain any part of the land described in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration (which is the same marked 158| acres on the plot), but, on the other hand; was limited and confined to that' marked on the said plot 3261 acres, &amp;c.; and thereupon, after giving evidence to show that the improvements on the said last-mentioned tract of 3261 acres, &amp;c., corresponded with the description in the levy, that the tract in dispute contained upwards of one hundred acres of cleared land, with an apple-orchard, a shingle-roofed log'dwelling-house and barn and stable thereon erected, and that the said two tracts were entirely \u2019distinct, separate, and disconnected from each other, in order further to prove that said levy and sale did not embrace or contain any part of the land described in plaintiff\u2019s declaration, but, on the other hand, was limited and confined to that marked on the plot 326| acres, called John Klingensmith, Esq., late sheriff of Westmoreland County, by whom the levy and sale in the case were made,- and proposed to prove by him as-follows : \u2014 That he went to the land of George Pumroy, in 1821, to make the' said levy ; that the said George Pumroy furnished- him with the adjoiners of both tracts; that, upon inquiring of said Pumroy whether the description furnished embraced more than one tract, and learning from hjm that it covered both, he objected-to making the levy in that way; that the said Pumroy acquiescing in his decision, he then struck off, as well as he could, \u25a0 the names given to him as adjoiners exclusively of the tract in dispute in this action, and supposed that he had* stricken them all off; that on the inquisition held upon the levy, indorsed on ' the <em>fi. fa., </em>the laud in dispute was not\"submitted to the jury, ' or acted upon by them, but only what was calied the mill tract, or, in other words, that upon which the purchaser entered after the sale <em>; </em>that at the sale, upon a representation made to him by s'ome of the bystanders that\u2019 there was'ah ambiguity, ih the description of the land which rendered it uncertain whether one. or both tracts were included within it, he stated, in the presence and hearing of John Rhey, that he was selling only the mill tract, and that bidders must govern themselves accordingly ; that he made the same representation to Paul Morrow, by whom the property was purchased, as the agent and for the use of said Rhey; that, after the said sale, he was directed to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ecute the deed to said Rhey, which was accordingly done; that, at the time of the execution thereof, it was again represented, and perfectly understood by both parties, that the property conveyed in said deed embraced only the mill tract, and not the land in dispute ; and that at a subsequent period, not very remote from the time of the said sale, upon a representation to him by some of the neighbours that the said Rhey was asserting his claim to the property in dispute under said sale, he took occasion to inquire of him whether the fact was as represented, to which the said Rhey replied that he might have said so in a jocular manner, but that he never intended to claim both tracts, for that he knew that he never bought both tracts, and that he never paid for both tracts, and to claim them now (then) would be too much like putting his hand into another man\u2019s pocket and robbing, him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">' \u201c To the admission of which testimony of said Klingensmith, proposed to be given by the defendant as. aforesaid, the plaintiff objected, and insisted that the same could not be legally admitted for the purpose aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">\u201c Whereupon said court did overrule said objection, and admitted said testimony of said Klingensmith so proposed to be given as aforesaid, and the said plaintiff' here in court, and during the trial of said cause, excepts to the judgment, opinion, and determination of said court in admitting said testimony; and as the facts aforesaid do not appear of record, the said plaintiff prays .that this bill of' exceptions may be certified, signed, and sealed by the judges of said court, that the same may become part and .parcel of the record in said case.

In Pennsylvania there is no court of equity, but equitable principles are applied, under the direction of the courts of law, in the same manner as legal principles. Kuhn v. Nixon, 15 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 118; Hawthorn v. Bronson, 16 ib. 278; Torr\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Estate, 2 Rawle, 252. Ejectment is a substitute for a bill in equity, and may be defeated by the same considerations which would defeat a bill for a specific performance in a court of equity. Pennock <em>v. </em>Freeman, 1 Watts, 408.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-5\">2: Equity will not permit a party to enforce compliance with a deed or contract, when such compliance would work a fraud on the other party. Woollam <em>v. </em>Hearn, <em>7 Ves. 211; </em>2 Atk. 98; Story\u2019s Eq., \u00a7 769. And parol evidence is admissible to show the fraudulent purpose.

And it is an admitted principle, that courts of law have concurrent jurisdiction with courts of chancery, in cases of fraud. Gregg <em>v. </em>Lessee of Sayre, 8 Peters, 244.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-6\">3. The evidence was for the purpose of applying the deed to its proper subject, and therefore competent. 1 Greenl. on Ev., \u00a7 301.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b492-7\">Mr. Justice GRIER</author>\n<p id=\"AaO\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The single question in this case arises on a bill of exceptions to the admission of certain testimony. In order to judge of its correctness, we must ascertain what was the matter in dispute before the jury at the time the testimony was offered and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">The action was ejectment for a tract of land containing 1582-acres. In 1822, George Pumroy was owner of this tract, and also of another of 3262 acres, lying n\u201ear to it, but not adjoining. A judgment had been obtained against Pumroy for the sum of $ 400, and an execution issued, on which the sheriff returned that he had levied on \u201c a certain tract of land, situate in Derry township, adjoining lands of James Henry\u201d (and a number of others), <em>\u201c </em>containing 400 acres, more or less, of which 60 acres were cleared land, and 30 acres of meadow, and on which were erected a grist-mill, dwelling-house,\u201d &lt;fcc., &amp;c. A sale was made by the sheriff under a writ of <em>venditioni exponas, </em>and a deed delivered by him to John Rhey, legally conveying to him the- tract of. land as described in the levy. Under this deed, Rhey took possession of the tract of 3262 acres, on which the grist-mill was erected, and has held it from the year 1822 till the present time. In 1S41, he made a conveyance to Isaac Atkinson, the plaintiff\u2019s lessor, a citizen of Ohio, in whose name tlie present ejectment, was' instituted for the other tract, owned by Pumroy, of 1582 , acres, and now in the possession of the defendant, Cummins.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The only evidence offered in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>was, that two of the adjoining tracts, called for as boundaries in \u25a0his deed, did not adjoin the mill tract of 326\u00a3 acres, but were contiguous to, and adjoined the tract of 158J acres. It was admitted, that all the other parts of the description correctly applied to the larger tract, but it was contended that, if this portion of the description applied only to the other, the levy and deed for this reason included both.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The defendant, on the contrary, insisted that the levy and sale did not embrace any part of the land in dispute, and gave evidence to prove that it was a distinct and separate tract of land, having'a house, barn, orchard, and 100 acres of cleared land, not occupied or used in connection with the larger or mill tract. They contended, also, that the deed called for but one tract of land, which was well described, except in this one particular, which was evidently an ambiguity, caused by a mistake of the sheriff in making his levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The defendant might, perhaps, have safely rested his case on the evidence as it now stood, but, in order to remove all possible doubt, he offered to prove by the sheriff <em>\u201c </em>how the mistake in the description occurred ,\u2022 and that the purchaser and other bidders at the sale had remarked this ambiguity in the descrip- \u2022 tion, and were informed how it happened, and were perfectly aware that but one tract was levied on and offered for sale, called the mill tract. That Rhey, the purchaser, was fully aware of it, and accordingly claimed and took possession of the mill tract only <em>; </em>that the sheriff, having afterwards heard a report that Rhey was asserting a claim to the property in dispute, took occasion to inquire of him if it was true ; and that Rhey replied, \u00a3 that if he had said so it was only in jest j that he had bought and paid for one tract only, and to claim them both would be too much like putting his hand in his neighbour\u2019s pocket and robbing him.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">To the reception of this testimony the plaintiff\u2019s counsel Objected, and the admission of it by the court forms the subject of the bill of exceptions now under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">It is contended that this testimony ought not- to have been received, because \u201cthe levy, <em>fieri facias, venditioni exponas, </em>sheriff\u2019s deed, &lt;fcc., are records, and parol evidence is not admissible to contradict, vary, or limit the description of the .premises contained in them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">This proposition is undoubtedly true. But it assumes the very fact in dispute, and on which the jury were about to pass, on parol proof given by both parties. It is true that, if a sheriff levies on a whole tract of land, and, describes it accurately in his levy and deed, parol testimony cannot be received to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u25a0that he intended to sell less than his deed describes, ob that he excepted a part of the premises at the time of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">But that is not the case before us. The testimony offered is not to contradict the levy and deed, but to explain and confirm them. The plaintiffs testimony had shown that there was a latent ambiguity on the face of his deed. It purported to convey a single tract of land; it described one tract completely, with a single exception which applied to another. It might be void for uncertainty, if its description equally applied to .two tracts, while it clearly purported to convey but one. It might convey one, and the part of the description which did not apply to that would be rejected as <em>falsa demonstratio, </em>or misdescription. Or it might possibly be intended to convey both ; but in the present case the latter supposition had hardly a shade of probability to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">It would be of little profit to notice the infinite variety of cases on this subject, or to seek for one precisely in point with the present. The general rule .is well stated by Tindal, Chief Justice, in the case o'' Miller <em>v. </em>Travers (8 Bingh. 244), that \u201c in all cases where a difficulty arises in applying the words of a will or.deed to the subject-matter of the devise or grant, the difficulty or ambiguity which is introduced by the admission of extrinsic evidence may be rebutted or removed by the production of further evidence upon the same subject calculated to explain what was the estate or subject-matter really-intended to be .granted or devised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The deed in this case called for but a single tract of land, the purchaser had himself taken possession and held up to certain boundaries for near twenty years, and had thus by his acts given his own construction of an ambiguity in his deed which he now showed by extrinsic evidence to exist. The evidence offered tended to confirm what appeared on the face of the de\u00e9d; that but one tract was sold ; that the practical location of his grant made by the purchaser was correct; that he had not acted under a mistake of his just rights, but had a due appreciation of the merits of the claim now set up to the land, in-question, This testimony may have been superfluous and unnecessary, but was not irrelevant or illegal. It' did not contradict the record or deed, under which the plaintiff -claimed', but. showed the gross injustice of the claim now attempted to be established under coyer of an ambiguity in their terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">. <em>Order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">This cause came on to be heard .on the transcript of the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>ord from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and was argued by counsel. .On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by 'this coujrt, that the judgment of the said. Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
